		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>By market share, Nissan is the top carmaker in the Mexican market. How do you constantly adapt to remain ahead of the competition?</h4><p>We have four main factors of success. First, it is the product and our innovation in manufacturing, because we have great preference from the market in terms of durability, quality, and reliability. Second, we have the strongest and most well-established dealer network, with dealerships in excellent locations that provide customers with a unique experience when buying a Nissan. Third is our strong financial muscle through Credi Nissan; we have innovative, pioneering, and unique programs. Fourth is our talented team. We are offering customers this innovation and excitement through the introduction of the Nissan GT-R, which is a legendary sports car, as well with our first hybrid vehicle, Nissan X-Trail. We have cars for every taste and segment in Mexico</p><h4>What is the relevance of Mexico within Nissan's global strategy?</h4><p>For Nissan, Mexico is the global benchmark. We are the most important operation for the corporation. Markets such as Japan and China are larger than Mexico; however, we have been able to maintain not only the number-one position in terms of car sales and manufacturing but also customer satisfaction, while the profitability of the dealer network has also increased. That it is why Mexico is Nissan's benchmark market.</p><h4>How advanced is Mexico in terms of industrial technology developments?</h4><p>Our strategy is extremely focused on what customers want, and a great example of this is Nissan Kicks, an SUV in a segment in which we were not participating previously. It was launched in 2016, and shortly after it became the best-selling car in that segment because it is the perfect example of how successful product innovation can drive demand. This car is also manufactured in Aguascalientes. Furthermore, we will start the production of Infiniti QX50 through a joint venture between the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and Daimler. One of our objectives for our manufacturing operation, including four plants—one in Morelos and three in Aguascalientes—is to produce more than 1 million vehicles by the end of the decade.</p><h4>What are the pillars of environmental innovation at Nissan and what is the appetite for eco-friendly vehicles in Mexico?</h4><p>We were the first ones to launch an electric vehicle (EV) back in 2014, through the Nissan LEAF. We are the leaders, not only in Mexico, but worldwide. We have sold more than 320,000 EV units globally and more than 355 units in Mexico. To date, we have more than 270 charging stations established both through our dealer network, other public spaces, and commercial centers. When we launched LEAF in 2014, we integrated this step without the respective infrastructure because we could not wait. If we had to wait for the government to get to the point needed, we would still be waiting. It is important for the government to play a key role in such development and energies in partnership with manufacturers to promote policies and different taxation for these energies. We need to continue to work alongside the government and will continue to push because this is not the future, but the present. It has been an effort that has been taking place for many years; however, we need to evolve. Now, we are talking about autonomous driving and connectivity, and we have an umbrella called Nissan Intelligence Mobility pursuing zero-emissions and zero-accident solutions.</p><h4>How is Nissan adapting in light of NAFTA renegotiation to retain its position in the market?</h4><p>We will continue to do business as usual because nothing has changed. We are waiting to see what will happen and will decide after that. We have to continue to ensure that we can retain our leadership position in the market. In May, we celebrated nine years of sales leadership in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons behind the company's recent success in the second round of public auctions conducted by the National Hydrocarbon Commission (NHC)?</h4><p>Jaguar E&amp;P, since its incorporation, has had a clear vision: to become one of the leading E&amp;P companies in Mexico. We are focused on mature, onshore fields. There is a huge opportunity due to Mexico's circumstances, particularly related to Pemex's financial constraints, which have left many fields under-developed. Jaguar was awarded several fields in the Burgos Basin and in Veracruz and Tabasco states. We have opened regional offices in these areas to operate the businesses with the support of local service companies</p><h4>Why did Jaguar decide to focus on mature, onshore fields?</h4><p>From the outset, we were sure we wanted to become operators. This immediately ruled out the more expensive shallow and deep-water projects; targeting onshore mature fields made sense because there is less capital and less uncertainty involved. These mature fields typically have existing seismic studies, well logs, and geological information that allow companies to make better estimates of resources and production curves. Second, the investments required are less capital intensive. Starting with fields with more information and easier access was the obvious route for us to become operators</p><h4>What lessons have you learned from the auctions so far, and how will you adjust your strategy for future public bids?</h4><p>We now have a solid and diversified platform. We have achieved diversification in three senses, the first of which is regional. Second, we have both oil and gas within our portfolio, and lastly, we have diversification in terms of the maturity of the fields. Some of our fields are already producing, while others are in the exploration phase. We are in an extremely comfortable position from where we can grow. The information from the data pack and NHC has significant gaps. The more a company can learn about the geology of a field and how to operate on it, the better it can make evaluations and bids. Information is key to this business. In the following rounds, we will have a more concise approach to assess the potential of each field</p><h4>What are the pillars of your innovation strategy?</h4><p>Most of the fields we were awarded have never been developed with the proper use of technology. For example, the seismic data for some of the blocks is fairly old, and we can use new technology to upgrade and reprocess this, which will lower the exploration risk. There are also new completion techniques we can use in these fields to optimize flow and production. We can use lateral drilling to control the water in some of the reservoirs we have. There is a great deal we can do with these old fields, even with the basic technology that is out there</p><h4>Should Mexico invest in constructing new oil refineries and upgrading the existing ones or are there other priorities at the moment?</h4><p>Refineries could be a strategic part of Mexico's economy, and a country needs some control over refined products. However, the best economic solution is probably not new state-built and run refineries. There must be an economic equation that allows private investors to re-build and efficiently operate refineries. Another option is the idea of buying refineries, or refining capacity, in the US where there is access to better infrastructure. It is always a balancing act for countries between supply, cost, and energy security issues. It is the same issue with gas. Currently, Mexico imports around 80% of gas consumed nationally, which is not ideal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The flow of investment into the energy sector has been significant. To what extent is this due to a stable regulatory framework?</h4><p>The Energy Reform has been able to promote investments in Mexico. There is trust in the system and trust in the way the regulation and laws were written. A way of measuring that trust is in the investments that have been drawn to Mexico. Currently, we have USD83 billion of investment in place, most of it in the upstream arena, although, in the future, there is great potential for other parts of the value chain. We are in the business of getting the market to trust the system and that has been extremely successful in terms of showing potential investors that the regulation was built in a collaborative manner. We listened to the industry's concerns and are not afraid of making adjustments to the regulations. We are afraid of setting regulations that are incorrect, do not set a level playing field, or do not set the right conditions for investors to come and be comfortable with projects. We have an open relationship with companies, and there are rules of conduct that are similar to the US Sunshine Act. This is a great example of what transparency and good contact rules can do for an industry.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of the liberalization of these markets for final consumers?</h4><p>What we have gained from this process is something that we have in all the other markets in Mexico: competition. There was only one gasoline service provider. By now, we have over 27 brands and are adding one every one or two weeks. For example, we have BP, Chevron, Shell, Gulf, Glencore in partnership with Group 500, and Costco opening service stations. We have Arco, for instance, which used to be Tesoro, a large refiner from the US. We have all of these brands, and most of them include additives that make the product different from what Pemex offered traditionally. Nevertheless, Pemex is the wholesale seller at present for all these brands. Competition will become a reality in the wholesale market coming into the country by the coasts and the border. In the center, some things are happening due to the railroads that right now have permits from CRE. Things are moving from the center by trains, from the coasts by boats, and from the border by pipeline as well as trucks</p><h4>What are the main obstacles left to be able to meet the 2050 goal of 50% of clean energies?</h4><p>We have a great deal of opportunities. The decision of some countries to move away from green energy provides Mexico an opportunity to be the leader here. Most of our country has solar potential. If we took 1% of the territory of Sonora, which is a large state, and used that to build a solar facility, this would generate all the energy the country requires. It is flexible; that is why there are projects all over the country. Most of the 52 projects are solar. Wind projects are also successful in Mexico, which is also great news for the development of this country. It has been an interesting discussion in Mexico because when we started the reform there was strong opposition from industry against green energy, not because it was bad but because it was expensive. They understood it was beneficial for the country, but it was also expensive and they were unsure if it would contribute to their competitiveness. However, soon it was clear that solar was not only inexpensive, but very cheap. There was a major change in technology, and Mexico was one of the countries where the prices of solar energy dropped earlier. We are in great shape to maintain the pace of projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[adapting-for-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the drivers behind Mercedes-Benz's growth figures, and what is your strategy to continue to break records every year?</h4><p>Mercedes-Benz has been around for over 130 years, and we have always been the leader in innovation. It is always a matter of representing a brand that is interesting for the premium market from the perspective of innovation, safety, and services, which are all important to the consumer. And from a design perspective, we maintain a sexy brand. It has also become more important for our employees and the public to not only see our products and services but also how we behave, what we give back to society, how we get involved in issues in Mexico specifically, and so on. The success of the brand first and foremost has to do with the product. Five years ago, we introduced the new A Class, a new generation compact car, and people truly love its design, sportiness, dynamics, and performance. We have done our homework not only in the compact segment, but also have impressive growth in the SUV segment, with 50-60% growth in SUVs depending on the country. Worldwide, Mexico is one of the top-five countries in terms of growth. In 2016, we had 36% growth and 22% in 2017. We are number one in the premium market in Mexico.</p><h4>How did you decide to construct a manufacturing facility in Aguascalientes?</h4><p>There are two reasons for being in Mexico: to be part of NAFTA, which is important for the US, Canadian, and Mexican markets, and because Mexico today is number five from a manufacturing perspective worldwide and is one of the big players with excellent quality, labor laws to be fast and flexible on decisions, a large pool of young people, and great support from the different regions and the Mexican government. Overall, it is a great country for investment; the local market is growing and is close to the other NAFTA markets. Mexico also has great trade agreements with the European community.</p><h4>How do you foresee NAFTA renegotiations impacting Mercedes-Benz in Mexico?</h4><p>I expect there to be a discussion on the level of numbers. The main point is the US' large trade deficit and the issue is not Mexico but Asia—specifically China. At some point, the US needs to look at the real issues. I do not expect major changes, and we still have the World Trade Organization even if NAFTA is canceled or things end up drastically different. I am in fact largely unbothered because I hope people understand the business, and we are positive overall. We will proceed with our project in Aguascalientes and with our strategy.</p><h4>What have been the results of Mercedes' innovation processes?</h4><p>Our AMG cars, which are our high-performance cars, have 25-30% less fuel consumption compared to the previous model; traditional engines are being optimized. We recently introduced hybrid cars into the Mexican markets and will introduce more in 2018; therefore, this is the next step before fully electric cars arrive. Electric cars are the future and will arrive fairly quickly so innovation will be essential, not only for Mercedes-Benz but everyone. The entire automobile industry is changing and we do not want to become like Nokia or Kodak; we are currently successful because we are adapting. Cars are evolving into multimedia products and we need all kinds of different people working for us: more millennials and digital experts, and perhaps fewer engineers looking into the engines, especially in the future when we are talking about electric cars. Many things are also changing for our dealer network and retail; retailers will be needed, though perhaps in a different way and this will be from the perspective of commercialization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you appraise your 2017 results?</h4><p>Crédito Real had a great quarter in 3Q2017; the year in general was easier than we believed. At the beginning of 2017, everything looked shaky because of Trump, the developments surrounding NAFTA, and the low peso. Interest rates went up 100% in 2016 and that had a large effect on financial companies, especially those like us that do not get their money from the public. Our entire funding is from banks or papers we put in the markets. The effect was significant for Crédito Real's numbers, and although we have been able to transfer that to the end consumer, it takes time to show in our numbers because all our loans are on a fixed rate for a fixed period.</p><h4>What are your activities in Central America?<br></h4><p>Costa Rica now represents 20% of our overall net income. This happened when an investment bank sought us out to acquire a personal loans company with 90% personal loans, plus a small portfolio in SMEs and cars. We did a deal whereby he retains 30% share in the company for seven years, and after that, we have an option to progressively buy him out at 10% per year. With our Costa Rican operation, we have 12 branches in Nicaragua, which is interesting business-wise. We are opening more branches in Nicaragua and also have two branches in Panama, with a plan to grow to 50 in the next three to four years. In Costa Rica, we have 56 branches.</p><h4>How does Crédito Real create trust among customers?</h4><p>The biggest difference between Crédito Real and banks is that we approach customers in person and create a link with them. We seek out customers and offer them a product; we do not have branches where they seek banking services. We create a personal bond that people do not have with a bank and this builds confidence. We go to their offices and homes, offering our products. We have close to 6,000 people on the streets through our distributors who knock on doors and visit businesses every day.</p><h4>Does Crédito Real plan to become a bank?</h4><p>We do not want to become a bank at all. We invested heavily in evaluating this option and at the end of the day we found we would not gain anything by becoming a bank; it would only create problems. We are larger than most of the banks here, but we are more flexible than a bank. We make decisions quickly and do not have to seek permission because we are a regulated multi-purpose financial company (SOFOM) with different regulations. If we were a bank, it would have been complicated to receive the authorization for our acquisition in Costa Rica. Likewise, in the US we sell cars through our showrooms rather than just financing vehicles, and this would be complex if we were a bank. In Mexico, we only do the financing for cars, so we have different models and adapt to the different countries in which we operate.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>Crédito Real expects to keep growing. We are in a great position to acquire new companies in the near future, and this will allow us to grow beyond what we planned. The companies we look to acquire and the products we will develop are all financial entities and non-banking financial products. Regardless of any new acquisitions, we should still grow the company organically by 10-15% in 2018 despite it being an election year. Our business is really counter-cyclical, and we are not affected by large crises. Our payroll loans business is stable and predictable. 2018 will offer great opportunities to grow our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have recent technological innovations transformed the face of insurance in Mexico?</h4><p>Technology will completely change the way the industry works globally; however, Mexico will not evolve as quickly in that area, even though we want to advance as rapidly as possible. Most of the innovations today are focused on customer service more than on the acquisition part of the business, and we are evolving faster on the service aspect than on the sales aspect. Still, we have developed many tools to help with the sales platform, and there will be a full digital ecosystem for insurance that will help customers as well as partners. In Mexico, this process is evolving slower because the market is still operated by agents. However, changes are coming, and BNP Paribas Cardif, particularly, is developing in-demand digital ecosystems.</p><h4>What role does data analytics play in the company?</h4><p>Data analytics is a top priority, and we have appointed a director in charge of business intelligence and strategic planning. There are three pillars that are important for us: data mining and analytics, predictive models, and emotional segmentation. Data mining and predictive models help us to understand the best moment to sell, the best product to sell, and so forth. Emotional segmentation is needed because social demographics are not enough to properly target our customer's needs</p><h4>How do you price your products?</h4><p>In the insurance business, that is an art; if we do this wrong, we lose a great deal of business. At BNP Paribas Cardif, the prices are set in conjunction with the commercial and the actuarial areas. We do not price just an insurance coverage, we price overall insurance solutions. This is important because most of our products are not just single products, but products with an offer and may include assistance and more benefits. For example, we have an important retail customer for whom we designed a complete offering; we provide not only life insurance but also give them the opportunity to call a doctor if they have a terrible allergy and discounts at the pharmacy. We design offers to fit the needs of customers and make the product more real and tangible. BNP Paribas Cardif in Mexico serves three main groups of customers. There are banks and financial institutions, which have certain needs. We are also a significant player in the auto finance industry in terms of providing insurance for finance captive companies of the automobile insurance. Finally, we serve retailers. Therefore, the price depends on the customer, the industry, the package, and many other things.</p><h4>How is the market education here in comparison with other countries in Latin America?</h4><p>We have a tremendous opportunity to grow the insurance business in Mexico. The penetration rate is 2.1% in Mexico and has remained between 1.9% and 2.1% for the last decade, although it grows around 11% a year. In terms of auto insurance, only 30% of automobiles are insured here, while only 7% of the population has home insurance. There is also a huge opportunity for health insurance. Banking penetration is low in Mexico, and insurance is even lower compared to other Latin American countries where insurance versus GDP have bigger figures than Mexico. For example, Chile is 4.7%, Brazil 3.1%, Argentina 2.8%, and Colombia 2.7%</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We have been building toward profitability, because in insurance, the more one grows, the more they invest. I hope we will continue to be a company that is proud of the service it provides for both customers and partners, and continue to have high ratings among our employees. Hopefully, 2018 will also be a big year to continue advancing with technological developments. We are in the process of defining all the goals; however, 2018 should be another year of solid growth and consolidation of our businesses with our partners and customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's strategy to seize the opportunities made available by Mexico's energy reforms?</h4><p>One of the main objectives of the reforms was to lower the cost of energy so that consumers have a more competitive platform for their business or personal consumption. The second factor is that Mexico wants to be part of the movement to generate cleaner energy; several new, clean energy projects such as solar and wind energy are developing across the country. Third, Mexico is looking to expand and improve the quality of its electricity infrastructure. Within transmission and distribution, provisions are being made for private investors to participate in future projects. Finally, the government wants a competitive market to attract investors into the Mexican market. Orca Energy is looking at all available opportunities. We mostly participate on the supply side but are considering projects in energy generation and infrastructure</p><h4>What are Orca Energy's projects in the field of energy infrastructure development for the electricity sector?</h4><p>Our focus on supply is our core participation in the market. We started operations in July 2017, and we are focusing on the opportunities to create a strong energy portfolio. Moreover, we are targeting large consumers to create a good balance within our portfolio of energy and our portfolio of users. Apart from opportunities in energy infrastructure, Orca Energy is searching for generation projects to establish third party agreements with independent generators. There is potential in the transmission lines and distribution segment, especially in partnership with well-established companies</p><h4>Do you think there is a bottleneck in Mexico's transmission infrastructure?</h4><p>New power sources create the need for an expansion of transmission lines. For example, there are a number of wind farms in the Ventosa area of Oaxaca State that require a sufficient number of transmission lines to connect with the grid. The same applies to Mexico's Tamaulipas and Sinaloa regions; Baja California is the only area that is not connected to the national grid. Hence, there is huge potential for a new transmission line to connect Baja California with the rest of the country or for electricity to be imported from the US.</p><h4>Do you think Mexico's wholesale electricity market is functioning optimally?</h4><p>The market situation is far from optimal. Mexico is in the early stages of its energy reform. The conditions are okay for this stage but there are issues that need to be clarified to improve and mature the reforms. For example, tariffs are one of the biggest challenges to having more participants and qualified users in the market. The tariffs released by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) in November 2017 are transitional, and there is no long-term vision for how tariffs for basic users will behave. Another important issue is that companies have questions regarding how to operate; the industry has requested governing bodies respond more rapidly to questions. The last factor to ensure optimal market functionality is to make the system flexible. It needs to be easier and faster for users to change supplier to create a competitive model for qualified suppliers.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals at Orca Energy for 2018?</h4><p>The long-term aim is to have an energy portfolio 500MW within five years. For 2018, our goal is to get around 100MW in our portfolio in order to be able to trade and supply our clients. This is a huge goal and a major step for a company that only started operations eight months ago. The present need has led the market to behave correctly and move in terms of liquidity and transactions. The company is aware of the need to create a diversified portfolio of energy. Our strategy is to have the most diversified portfolio with the best efficiency in the areas where the largest consumers are based—there are massive opportunities in the northeast and west of Mexico. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[five-star-finance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Clip is among the top-six Mexican start-ups in terms of venture capital raised. What are the reasons behind the company's success?</h4><p>It is to do with two main factors. First, we have an amazing product. Second, we provide an extraordinary service to merchants. These factors have allowed us to grow at a rapid pace to the point where we are now the second-largest provider to merchants in the country. And we are going to pass the number-one company, BBVA, in a matter of months. We have done this with minimal market investment or salespeople. Clip is by far the highest-ranked finance app in Mexico's app store. We have over 11,000 reviews now, and our rating is 4.8. When you provide the level of service and product that we do, the word gets out, and you start picking up a lot more customers. With that comes venture capital. We have also done a great job raising money. Our investors have unprecedented access to our data, including all our dashboards of real-time transactions</p><h4>What is your view on how fast Mexico is becoming a cashless economy compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Mexico is moving much slower than many other countries in Latin America. One of the obstacles is the duopoly in the payment system where a small group controls everything, from the rules of the system to the processing. This leads to anti-competitive behavior and practices and is the reason why 50 million Mexicans do not have access to a bank account</p><h4>In terms of improving financial inclusion, can fintechs succeed where banks have failed?</h4><p>The key is having competition. Instead of making a disproportionate amount of money on fees and interest rates, fintechs actually have to make money by providing a product or service that the customer needs and values. This is where the difference between banks and fintech comes into play. It comes from competition and talent. The most talented people in the world join start-ups, not banks. The ease of access to technology and its plunging costs will also help companies like us succeed where others cannot</p><h4>Will banks embrace this business model anytime soon?</h4><p>They have tried but have not been able to do it simply because banks are not built to work like this. This is why companies like Clip have been able to succeed in fields, such as digital payments, where banks have failed. Another factor is that the best young talent today does not want to work for big financial institutions. It is a problem that large institutions are facing all over the world, and start-ups provide people with more of a mission and purpose. Start-ups give people more freedom over how they work and create a life balance. Another factor is that large worldwide financial institutions have excluded 50% of the population from their management: women. At Clip, we are 50-50 men and women. This is a huge competitive advantage for us.</p><h4>How can Mexico City become the fintech capital of Latin America?</h4><p>To become a financial or economic hub one needs to have the right talent, big problems to solve, money, and a support network, such as lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Mexico City does a fairly great job on the talent side. The only issue is that talent is expensive. However, its advantage is that many foreigners want to live and work here. Second, Mexico has big problems to tackle, and lack of access to financial services is just one. Furthermore, the availability of capital has improved dramatically in recent years. Five years ago, there were few funds and now there are many, all the way from seed investing up to USD10 million. Beyond that, we likely need to go abroad for capital, though that is changing and will mature. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the implementation of the 2014 energy reforms?</h4><p>For upstream, it is going well, which was expected; the results speak for themselves. There are over 60 companies, close to 100 licenses have been signed, many wells have been committed, and there is several billion dollars of immediate activity by the private sector. In midstream, there have been certain issues. There has been progress in terms of opening the market, and many companies have been opening new petrol stations, though access to infrastructure and permitting, particularly with ports, has progressed slower than expected. Still, the intentions are good, and everyone is working hard to solve the bottlenecks. From the start, Sierra believed in the reforms and in the capacity of Mexican regulators to carry them out; therefore, we had first-mover advantage. We have done more than just participate and won bids; we have made discoveries and have actively been investing in the last three and a half years. The government has the right incentives in place, and with contracts and interests aligned, the opportunities are good. The reforms can truly be successful.</p><h4>How would you assess the investment climate in Mexico, particularly in relation to other countries competing for capital?</h4><p>When the reforms started, the macro oil and gas system was collapsing, companies were cutting capital expenditures, and many in traditional oil and gas regions such as the Middle East, Russia, Africa, and Brazil were facing trouble. And at the end of the day, Mexico has to compete with everyone. Mexico is a top-tier destination—in terms of risk and reward, it ranks in the top quartile. I have worked in many places around the world, and Mexico competes extremely well. It is modern and has many strong institutions, bilateral agreements, and large, close markets. In terms of Latin America, it is the most exciting place to operate, and from an exploration perspective, the most exciting place in the world</p><h4>What is the significance of your discoveries in Zama-1?</h4><p>Chiefly, it was the first exploration well and the first discovery after the energy reform. Second, the size and quality of the discovery were bigger and better than expected, and we are now working with a great challenge. Third, it is the largest offshore discovery in the tertiary reservoirs. Pemex has done a great job developing carbonate-level exploration in the Campeche zone, where there are billions of barrels still to be produced. However, private investors will put their money, technologies, and capabilities into the tertiary reservoirs, which are at the subsalt level and require complex structures and higher risk. The Zama discovery has had a huge impact on investment, which was evident in the last round of bidding when many competitors bid on the areas surrounding our zone. It confirms to the entire industry—and not just Mexico—that the newly opened zones are attractive. Finally, for us and our partners, it will allow us to make a quantum leap in terms of reserves, production, and hopefully cash flow.</p><h4>What is your general outlook regarding Mexico's hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>It looks extremely promising. Three years ago, we were one of the only fish in the sea as the first license holder. Today, there are many companies bidding on new zones, and the entire Sureste Basin has been taken. The sector has to speed up and begin drilling more, proof testing, and developing. We all look forward to regulatory continuity. The regulator has done an outstanding job thus far in the face of great pressure, both positive and negative. It has managed to pull off an amazing feat. We believe in Mexican institutions and their outlook for progress. There is always uncertainty when there is presidential change; however, we maintain a positive outlook on the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[double-digits-for-decades]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The insurance sector in Mexico grew five times more than the GDP. Why is this the case here?</h4><p>This is possible, firstly, because Mexico is a young country, and thus, the need for insurance is still in its early stages. Mexico's average age is 28.6 years, and young people do not have a need for insurance; however, the need for it will grow rapidly in the coming years. We will see the insurance sector growing by double digits for the next 20 years only because the average age in Mexico will increase over the next two decades. The second reason is that Mexico's culture has not been focused on being insured, though natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes have raised awareness on why insurance is necessary</p><h4>How do you compare market education of insurance in Mexico and other countries in the region?</h4><p>It is lower; Chile is the most advanced country in Latin America insurance wise. It has mandatory insurance and pensions, and there is complete awareness of why insurance is necessary. For example, in Mexico, car insurance was not mandatory in any state up until three years ago, and now it is mandatory in only half of the states. It is slowly moving in the right direction, and the authorities are now more aware of claims and transferring the risks to insurance companies. There was a change, and they have started being more open to changing the laws in the first state, which was Mexico City. These states need to make sure it is being enforced. The other states will move when they start to see the benefits in those states that have made insurance mandatory and enforced it</p><h4>What is your strategy to offer coverage against emerging risks such as cyber threats?</h4><p>We are the first company in Mexico to offer a comprehensive insurance for cyber risk. We wanted to have the best policy available and established a joint venture with a more renowned, London-based cyber insurance company. Through the partnership, we can offer an advanced product that did not exist in Mexico; our product is called CyberSafe GNP. We are pleased to be the leaders and pioneers in Mexico in cyber insurance. Currently, this is only focused on corporations; however, at some point in the future we will have to go into the individual sector. This is the next step and we are going to develop that policy over the next 24 months or so</p><h4>What is your priority in terms of innovative technology and how do you see disruption in the sector through insuretech start-ups?</h4><p>There are digital insurance companies that could change the insurance sector in Mexico. We have to move fast and are trying to become a digital insurance company as quickly as possible with digital products such as “pay-as-you-drive" or “pay-how-you-drive" car insurance. There is a digital wave on how we will service policyholders in the near future. We will turn into a digital service company wherein all transactions will be available digitally in the next 12-18 months. About 35% of all automobile policies are now sold digitally. In the case of accident and health insurances, they are captured directly by the agent. One of the things that we discussed with the board is having an innovation cell outside GNP, and today we have an innovation cell in Santa Fe. It is part of the company, though it does not operate like GNP. We have a budget that allows us to buy any small insuretech company that can be of use for us, such as this cell in Santa Fe. It is difficult because we are a 116-year-old company, and we are trying to make the company more agile with a focus on innovation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities do you see for Mexico to diversify its exports and trade partners?</h4><p>These are interesting times. As a country and as Bancomext, we have been opening new avenues, for example to South America. We are opening more lines with different banks for factoring, specific programs, and specific credits. In this sense, Central America also plays a special role. There are more Mexican companies exporting to Central America than to South America. Our trade relationship with Central America is also larger than with Spain. Mexico has a specific free trade agreement with Central America. We have many opportunities to boost our business with Central and South America. Bancomext has been in talks with the largest international banks in Mexico and South America and they are keen to start working with us as their export credit agency. This means they have the guarantee of Bancomext and can thus lend to their customers in their home countries at a better interest rate.</p><h4>How can Mexico strengthen its trade ties beyond the Americas?</h4><p>There are opportunities for us in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11). We also have excellent opportunities in China and Korea, and not just in manufacturing. We are rapidly creating a creative industry in Mexico that is interesting for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean markets, for example. Mexico also wants to continue to work with our European friends. Mexico has been the largest investor in Spain after the EU for the last three years. We are also interested in Italy and Russia, where we can sell a number of products. The idea is to focus on specific niches where we have a great number of potential customers in Russia. We predict great markets in that area. We are financing Mexican exporters of halal products now as well. Qatar has already purchased our halal beef and we intend to continue to explore the opportunities for halal exports from Mexico. There have been a number of trade delegations to the Middle East to develop this market. This halal market also exists in London and the US. In terms of the steps, the most obvious and easiest one is for Mexico to increase trade with Central and South America, while the next obvious market is Asia because it is large. Then there is the traditional market of Europe. However, we have to look at new markets as well, such as halal and the Arab and African markets. I anticipate many Mexicans investing in Africa over the next few years</p><h4>What are the biggest obstacles for Mexican SMEs to internationalize?</h4><p>The first one is talent because an SME might just be one person. Part of the challenge is to develop the team of both blue- and white-collar workers an SME requires to fulfill specific roles and grow. The second challenge is financing; in the last few years interest rates were too high in Mexico, the banking system was too tight, and it was complicated to obtain credit from financial institutions. Today, it is easier, and Bancomext guarantees the credit so that banks can give loans with the risk minimized to 10% of the transaction. Interest rates are also lower now, so companies are more able to export and establish new companies overseas. Bancomext also has a great factoring system to ease the way for companies selling small quantities of products to overseas markets. The third challenge for Mexican SMEs looking to internationalize their businesses is infrastructure. It is almost impossible to send products from here to Africa, while our connectivity to Bolivia and Paraguay is poor and expensive. The same is true for exporting to Australia and New Zealand. However, Mexico has the best bridge to places such as Singapore and Shanghai from the Americas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Zuma play in terms of Mexico's goal to have 35% of its energy matrix come from renewable energy by 2021?</h4><p>We are first and foremost a start-up dedicated to renewable energies. Zuma was created in 2014 by several private equity funds. Our mission was to mobilize capital and put it to work in this sector in Mexico. The key to our success has been the commitment to provide resources to build an outstanding team. By the end of 2018, we will have a portfolio of 800MW in operation. We are extremely excited about this prospect; it is a fairly spectacular achievement from our own perspective, and this came at a time when we were able to help shape the model that Mexico would follow through the power reform. We are an exception in the sense that by being a Mexican entity, the responsibility, value, and experience of the final decision-makers reside in the country. We are extremely proud to be experts in project development and in procurement, engineering, and financing here in our country. We contribute to the achievement of these goals by building financing projects, getting them contracted, and supplying clean power</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in providing energy directly to major companies with long-term contracts?</h4><p>There is a market out there, and the structure and requirements for clean energy certificates are applicable across all consumptions. Non-regulated consumers or qualified users can either go via a commercializing entity or directly to a market participant. There is, therefore, some nascent activity there; and several contracts have been signed in that space. As requirements continue to grow, that market will have its own needs and opportunities to execute projects together with private entities outside of auctions</p><h4>Are there any major obstacles holding back the renewable energy industry in Mexico?</h4><p>There are constraints, though there is no doubt the industry, together with the public sector, will find ways to address them effectively. Fortunately, Mexico is a large and diverse country, and there are areas where the environmental dimension is sensitive or security is an issue, and these are large, capital-intensive projects. In that sense, we are exposed to the local dynamics. That being said, one of the most prevailing limitations is perhaps the availability of interconnection capacity. It is more an opportunity than a threat in the sense that there is a need to invest more and develop larger projects in order to enable grid expansion. We are excited to find ways to make that work and continue to implement the projects at scale</p><h4>What is your assessment of the commitment of commercial and development banks to the advancement of this industry?</h4><p>We raised around USD900 million of financing to execute our portfolio in 2017. We use predominantly Mexican development banks and are also involved with a commercial bank as well as an expert credit agency from Denmark, where the turbine equipment comes from. We employ different structures and are extremely satisfied to have been able to contribute to the industry overall by being the first entity to have closed the financing of any projects as a result of the reform. Others that achieve their closings will look at the type of transactions that we have structured to define relevant references in terms of how financing will be structured moving forward. There are relevant elements of the auction contracts that need to be carefully assessed against the type of financing solution to be employed. I made the conscious choice to focus mostly on Mexican development banks because this was the first closing in the works, and we needed the decision makers to be easily accessible. Once more deals are closed, it will be easier for commercial banks to replicate, and we will see more participation from commercial lenders in the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Mexico’s Benchmark]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mexicos-benchmark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much interest have you seen in international investors coming to Nexxus?</h4><p>We have seen great interest. We are both one of the largest and oldest private equity firms in Mexico. We are celebrating our 20th year doing private equity as Nexxus Capital. Mexican pension funds have only been allowed to invest in private equity via tailor-made securities called capital development certificates since 2010. Before then, almost all our investors were foreign. Still, we have raised in the aggregate, including our fund in Spain and our recently raised Nexxus Mezzanine Fund, a little more than USD1.5 billion, of which two-thirds is foreign. The remainder is funded by Mexican pension funds. Interest from foreign business is, and always has been, crucial.</p><h4>What financing market are you introducing with Nexxus Mezzanine, and what companies do you hope to target?</h4><p>I am conscious of what Mexican banks offer, and there is still a gap for mid-sized companies. Mezzanine targets the same tier of companies: mid-sized growth entrepreneur or family-owned companies that lack or have a hard time accessing banks. Mezzanine encircles a series of possibilities that either substitute or complement financing by banks through two alternatives: equity and debt. That is where, especially in Mexico, the added value of private equity comes in. We are confident we will have enough pipeline to fill this and future mezzanine funds.</p><h4>How are SMEs in Mexico different from those in the US or elsewhere in the region?</h4><p>The first differentiating factor is the informality. Tax and labor have historically been issues, though that has changed significantly in Mexico because the authorities have been far more diligent in their tax and labor fiscalization. The second difference is management. When a company goes to a developed economy, it is easier to find the right marketing or operations guy; here that is not the case. The third difference is information. Companies that want to enter an industry in the US or UK will find a large amount of data. It can receive an extensive study on the industry, trends, and competitors. In Mexico, this is more difficult.</p><h4>What changes do you see coming for the Mexican middle-income group?</h4><p>The greatest challenge in this business is that companies have to think three to five years ahead as that is the average tenure of our investments. We have to predict how things will be when we want to exit. Clearly, it is hard to predict correctly in many cases, and in Mexico in particular. It is a young country with an average age of 27 years old, which makes the market extremely dynamic. The second factor is mobility. When Mexican mobile competition expanded and lowered the cost of Wi-Fi, data, and bandwidth, it facilitated the penetration of smartphones and mobility. E-commerce penetration in Mexico is now becoming a reality. This is part of why we will continue to bet on the growth of the middle class, though in a younger fashion. I see a dynamic, modern market and any investment one does should consider this.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>Our three main goals are reaching the target for Nexxus Iberia, start investing Nexxus Mezzanine, and complete the deployment of Nexxus VI to start raising Nexxus VII. Our goal is to have a clear route  where we are aligned with a team that is young and motivated. We have both the honor and the responsibility of being a benchmark for the industry in Mexico. Our goal is to maintain ourselves as a benchmark, not only in terms of results, but also in the way we do so: through our mix of investors and our contact with sovereigns from the Middle East, Europe, and North America. This keeps us sharp as they transfer best practices and the new things that evolve worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[more-the-merrier]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Under which conditions do you prefer to invest in a project, company, or fund? </h4><p>We prefer to invest in funds but were incorporated to invest in private equity funds at the beginning. Four or five years in, we started to invest in venture capital funds. Late in 2015, we launched an effort to invest in energy fund managers to take advantage of the openness of the energy reform. When we invested in venture capital funds, the ecosystem was under-developed, and we found that some Mexican fund managers committed to an investment in an early stage company and placed most of the money upfront. When the company started growing and went to capitalization rounds B or C, the fund did not have enough money to keep investing with the company. Therefore, we decided to open a vehicle to co-invest in those companies. After a while, some fund managers in the equity growth area started looking into companies that had capital requirements bigger than the maximum ticket allowed to invest by the fund. Hence, we started to co-invest with other funds. Nevertheless, our core business is to invest in funds.</p><h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a fund of funds?</h4><p>Several limited partners (LPs) believe that a fund of funds only results in a double management fee. But there are still a lot of funds of funds operating worldwide. We provide diversification. If an institutional investor wants to invest in different funds, they have to have a team to do the analysis and due diligence to verify that they are really picking up the best managers. They then have to start following the managers who have already invested and help attend investor meetings as well as LP and advisor committees. If a large investor gives us a ticket of USD100 million and we place it into a fund's fund, it is then distributed into 20-25 funds where each fund manager will commit to seven or eight companies. So, we achieve significant diversification.</p><h4>What is the evolution of your investment vehicles, and how is your strategy changing?</h4><p>This company was created by four governmental development banks that provided capital and capital commitments. Private equity is a long-term play; continuity is an important aspect. As a corporate company, we can have a long-term, stable situation in investment policy and personnel independent from the political cycle. After three years, the shareholders and board of directors realized that the private equity industry was growing fast. Since we were the only Mexican investor investing in this, they realized that we would not have enough money to keep investments at the rate of the growth of the industry. They asked us to start looking for best practices to try and raise capital from third parties. We became a catalyst of growth in the industry at the beginning. Then, we went abroad and started comparing with other businesses that were doing the same as us. After deciding to incorporate investment vehicles, we went all the way and incorporated a vehicle in Canada as a limited partnership agreement with a strategy of investing in private equity growth. We placed USD250 million and started to do investments into capital commencement funds. We soon increased our commitment to USD275 million in 22-24 funds. We closed the fund and fully committed to it before deciding to launch a venture capital fund of funds.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>My goals for 2018 are twofold. We are launching a fund of funds to do impact investment and are going to do the same partnership with a different partner from the US. It is going to be a smaller effort of around USD120 million. What is more, we are also launching a debt fund of funds to invest in infrastructure debt. It will be a MXN4-billion effort. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Visa México perform on the global market last year?</h4><p>The company recorded double-digit growth across the world, and Mexico's numbers were even higher than the global average. Mexico has been growing well in terms of consumption, but there is room for improvement. The Mexican market continues to be heavily dependent on cash; the penetration of electronic payments for consumption expenditures per person remains an opportunity as it is around 15%. Although the growth is satisfying, we are working hard on cash conversion through our transformational initiatives aimed at penetrating digital and electronic payments</p><h4>Why is digital penetration low, and what are the main obstacles?</h4><p>A recent study conducted by Visa for Roubini Thought Lab found that by transitioning to digital payments, businesses stand to experience greater efficiency, lower costs, reduced crime, more seamless customer experience, and greater sales. In an analysis of 100 cities, Mexico City was classified as a “Cash Centric City." The potential net benefits that Mexico City will experience by moving to an “achievable level of cashlessness" will sum more than USD12 billion. The industry as a whole has multiple challenges to overcome. In addition, education and behavior play a vital role in ensuring a frictionless experience for the public. The market needs to match the number of terminals per person with the region; Mexico has approximately nine terminals per 1,000 people as compared to Brazil with 27 terminals per 1,000 people. The introduction of payment facilitators a few years ago helped trigger growth in 2017, and new players in the ecosystem are injecting solutions such as fixed terminals for easier accessibility. Currently, Visa is enabling contactless payments, working with merchants on the implementation of contactless terminals, and collaborating with banks to issue contactless cards.</p><h4>What impact will new payments technologies have on fraud?</h4><p>Security is one of the company's main pillars, and Visa has been the industry leader in ensuring security with debit and credit cards, and adding security layers in e-commerce. For example, tokenization does not show the complete account number, allowing us to create a device-specific or merchant-specific token. Another example is 3D secure, which is a dynamic form of fraud detection. At present, the amount of customer information available enables us to protect them better. The company is fast moving into Visa ID Intelligence: a technology that uses biometrics and other authentication methods to conduct easy and secure transactions.</p><h4>What opportunities do fintechs represent for Visa?<br></h4><p>Fintechs will have a tremendous effect on the whole ecosystem. While fintechs are more agile in terms of innovation, we have opened our platform. By opening our Visa Development Platform two years ago, players in the ecosystem could use application programing interfaces (APIs) to get the best of Visa. We have created Visa's Everywhere Initiative, where we bring hundreds of fintech companies to participate in creating projects to help us build the future of commerce. At the same time, the company is working with banks and merchants on co-creating solutions with the sole priority to put the consumer at the center of everything.</p><h4>What does the opening of VisaNet represent for end users?<br></h4><p>VisaNet, our advanced global processing network, processes 65,000 transactions per second. In the past, it was associated with physical work, but we are scaling up our capabilities in the digital world. We opened the VisaNet capabilities for any interested party to access it through APIs. In parallel to that, we have created several different innovation centers across the world to harness the collective strength of the ecosystems into creating human-centered design technology. VisaNet provides an openness that allows for faster speeds and additional convenience; we are continuously searching for the consumers' demands and needs in an integrated way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Citibanamex participating in the implementation of reforms such as the Energy Reform and the Telecommunications Reform?</h4><p>We are convinced that the correct implementation of structural reforms is a key element for the growth and development of Mexico. We have wholeheartedly supported them and have donated or invested in many of the main projects associated with these reforms, such as MXN6.15 billion (USD308.9 million) in Escuelas al Cien, the largest-ever program in Mexico for school infrastructure dignification under the Education Reform, as well as USD98 million for the construction of ALTAN, a wholesale mobile network and the largest telecommunications project in the history of the country, which was part of the Telecommunications Reform. We have been especially active in the Energy Reform, investing MXN1.26 billion (USD62.63 million) in Sierra Oil and Gas, the first independent oil company in Mexico; USD146 million in Enel, the company with the largest installed capacity in Mexico for the generation of renewable energies; and MXN1.24 billion (USD61.64 million) in CFE Capital, the first and only Fibra E (investment vehicle) specialized in the electricity sector. We serve companies that obtained two-thirds of the contracts awarded in the different tenders derived from the opening of the oil sector. We have financed or invested in around 70% of the projects that have been possible due to the Energy Reform.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the Fintech Bill?</h4><p>The Fintech Bill is a step forward for the Mexican financial sector, as it provides certainty to market participants. Both the Fintech Bill and its secondary regulation must guarantee a healthy competition that promotes the use of new technologies to achieve greater financial inclusion and, at the same time, protect customers and users. A key aspect of the secondary legislation will be the opening and design of application programming interfaces (API). Citibanamex was the first bank to open its APIs. In this regard, the design of APIs in the secondary legislation should follow global standards and global best practices to ensure the best use of information for the benefit of customers. Citibanamex participates in the Open Banking Working Group organized by The FinTech Hub, C-Minds, and the Open Data Institute (ODI). This working group includes financial institutions and fintech associations. We also participate in the Pilot Project on Open Banking Data Standard of the National Digital Strategy of the Office of the Presidency. The objective of this pilot project is to create an interoperable API to help regulators on the development of secondary legislation of the Fintech Bill related to the standardization of APIs and open financial data.</p><h4>How is Citibanamex interacting with the fintech ecosystem today?</h4><p>We are interested in offering the best solutions to our customers, taking advantage of the most advanced technologies. We welcome the new actors that participate in these innovation and collaboration ecosystems. We view fintechs as potential collaborators and partners, rather than competitors. Accordingly, we actively promote interaction and collaboration between fintechs and banks. Transfer is the main fintech in the country, and we were the first bank to open our APIs.<br>Banks can benefit from the new technologies of fintechs, while fintechs can also benefit from banks' scale, namely large client bases; in all cases, customers and users will be the final beneficiaries of such collaborations.</p><h4>What is Citibanamex's strategy to be resilient against potential cyberattacks?<br></h4><p>We adopt and update our policies, methods, and controls to identify, evaluate, prevent, and mitigate cyber risks, as well as promote initiatives to update regulatory and legal frameworks that converge the actions of all parties considering best practices and international agreements. We also collaborate on projects to strengthen the security controls of the different infrastructure components and platforms that support the country's financial services, while promoting the use of information technology to prevent, identify, react, communicate, categorize, and face present and future threats. Also important is encouraging cyber education and culture among users and the staff of institutions through continuous training. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From Academia to Entrepreneurship]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-academia-to-entrepreneurship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated you to launch CESCA?</h4><p>CESCA is an example of how researchers can successfully transition from academia to entrepreneurship. With Mexico's undertaking to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, companies producing energy with renewable sources have arrived in the Mexican market. The transition meant the creation of eolic as well as solar parks all across the country. We offer consulting services to these new projects launched by renewable energy companies so that they can meet all environmental regulations</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your clients?</h4><p>Our clients are mainly power and mining companies, because their activities have an impact on the landscape. Today, we work with Enel Green Power, Acciona Energia, BMW, Grupo México, and other Mexican developers as well, among others. In the case of Grupo México, most of the environmental licenses for its new mining development program in Cananea, Sonora, were obtained through CESCA's work</p><h4>What services do you offer?</h4><p>We conduct environmental impact assessments, land use viability studies, and more generally help our clients meet any legal requirement related to the environment. We help industries decide how to prevent environmental impacts associated with the location of their new operations and developers decide which plot is suitable for construction. We aim to not only obtain the permits and the licenses, but also to reach a sustainable balance throughout the entire operation. More generally, we seek to ensure our standards go beyond what is asked by regulators in order to provide the best possible service</p><h4>How has the legal framework evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Environmental regulation is not really new; it dates back to the 1990s for the most part. The difference is that currently companies, consultants, and even regulators have learnt how to apply it. Implementation has improved significantly. We help private companies understand how to abide by these rules. The most recent piece of regulation in this field is the Federal Environmental Responsibility Law, voted in 2013. With this new law, if a company pollutes or impacts, it has to pay. Companies have to internalize the cost of polluting, impacting the environment, or damaging the wildlife</p><h4>How has the market of renewable energy evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>As a result of the incentives for the generation and distribution of renewable energy included in the Energy Reform 2013, many projects have been developed to generate energy from solar or wind energy sources. The reform has been a boost for the sector. However, it is not enough to identify areas with high potential, where it is feasible to install new projects without increasing the impact on the environment, without damaging wildlife and affecting the rights of the local population. These are the challenges for the coming years, both for developers and generators, as well as consultants such as CESCA and environmental authorities.</p><h4>Do companies face any challenges concerning labor provisions?</h4><p>There is a shortage of skilled labor in this field, especially concerning environmental protection. Foreign companies come with the know-how and need to develop knowledge in Mexico to increase skills and abilities, for example to sign MoUs with local universities in order to facilitate technology transfers and help train a generation of skilled professionals. For example, CESCA employs many young graduates, and we do our best to train them in environmental management, which is new for many of them. Moreover, in any project we include a training component for our client's staff.</p><h4>How has the mentality of business leaders concerning environmental protection evolved?</h4><p>It is still seen as an obligation they have to meet in order to operate. However, that is already progressing, because today every single company bears in mind the environmental impact of its activities and the measures it must take in order to mitigate them. Several years ago, this was not the case. There is now a culture of compliance with environmental legislation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges does Mexico face in terms of development?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most developed countries in Latin America. However, there are some challenges to be addressed. According to UN reports, Chiapas, for example, has a Human Development Index 20% lower than Mexico City. Development banks like CAF are here to help reduce this gap. We need to provide the best tools and knowledge our countries have in order to overcome poverty and inequality. Mexico has improved significantly in this area, though there still is plenty of work to be done.</p><h4>What policies does CAF support to reduce income inequality in the country?</h4><p>Mexico, in terms of public policy, has created an adequate framework to increase private investment, which has been a powerful tool to fight poverty considering the sustainable income-generation activities developed, which reduce the dependence on public expenditure. It is something like a public-private alliance against poverty. Although rural issues are no less important, with a large urbanization rate (80% by 2015) Latin America has become the region with the highest urban growth in the world where exclusion, low productivity, and climate change coexist and are deepening inequalities. In this light, one of our priorities is to contribute with the countries to build the best answers to solve the urban deficiencies. We work with the “Cities with Future“ initiative, where CAF accentuates the need to focus on vulnerable populations' quality of life regarding access to services and infrastructure improvement with a focus on resilience. This approach can be of great impact for Mexico.</p><h4>How does CAF support the country's productive sector?</h4><p>Our focus has been on transitioning from macroeconomic issues to microeconomic aspects because macro stability is not a sufficient condition to reach sustainable growth. Currently, one of the important challenges for Latin America is something we have called productive transformation, similar to certain Asian countries where development took a radical turn by improving productivity. Considering that a key factor was the transformation of educational levels and human talent, CAF promoted the improvement in skills for work as a source of long-term change. We promote working skills reinforcement in young people to assure them better conditions and opportunities to access the labor market and improve the economy's competitiveness. Our mission is to promote regional integration and sustainable development. We could encourage deeper integration between Mexico and South America while stimulating productive transformation. Given our experience in the region, there are clear opportunities for Mexico in the economies of the south.</p><h4>How do Mexican cities fare in terms of climate change adaptation compared to the rest of the region?</h4><p>In the Paris Agreement, countries adopted several measures to fight climate change. Mexico has significantly advanced regarding its policy commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico's approach is transversal and comprehensive, including all stakeholders and factors. Environmental policies are not only about climate behavior and conservation; they are embedded in all economic, productive, and social areas. It is a cross-cutting issue that must be taken into account when designing educational, health, industrial, and transportation policies. The environment is no longer an important issue; it is a vital one. The Latin American region needs to generate a regional, organic, and comprehensive approach to manage environmental concerns.</p><h4>How does CAF support the government to upgrade its water infrastructure and improve water governance?</h4><p>In general terms, water is one of the most critical and important issues amongst CAF programs. We are part of the Global Water Council and recognize there are many challenges regarding water. Water governance must be included in all development agendas. Mexico does have a shortage of water resources; however, we are on time to generate a national water governance program of which we are keen to be a part. Both the public and private sectors must cooperate in order to reach sustainable water usage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Power Bid]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[power-bid]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your presence in Mexico is expanding, and the projects under construction will almost double your electricity generation capacity. What made this expansion possible? </h4><p>In 2001, EDF partnered with a company that was already located in Mexico. Later, EDF acquired that company and began to develop some projects in Oaxaca, which are currently in operation.  In 2007, we started our first 67.5MW wind project, our second in the country by that time. In 2010, we began developing two 160MW projects, which, by 2011 and 2012, were put into operation. Our consumers are important companies from different fields. One of them is ArcelorMittal, the largest consumer of energy in Mexico. Other customers include Wal-Mart, Grupo Modelo, Herdez, and Continental.</p><h4>How has the energy reform of 2013 impacted the market for renewable energies?</h4><p>The reform launched a process of transformation of the CFE, the public power distribution company, which is no longer a monopoly. Users will no longer depend on energy supplied exclusively by the state. This allows competition and promotes investment. The CFE split into 10 different companies, each one focusing either on generation, distribution, renewables, and so on. The diversification of dependencies promotes autonomy and cooperation among the public companies it has diversified into. There is now more competitiveness, strategies, and manufacturers, which helps develop the industry as a whole.</p><h4>Is the lack of transmission and storage infrastructure still an obstacle for renewable energy companies?</h4><p>It is considerably insufficient. The tender for the construction of a power distribution line in the Tehuantepec Isthmus arises from the need to provide energy to many areas. It is impossible to build a wind park in Oaxaca today due to a lack of transmission infrastructure. The current tender for the construction of a 600-km direct line of transmission will improve the situation. The capacity of this line will roughly be 5GW. We still do not participate in the construction of transmission lines, though we are interested and have spoken to some of our Asian partners who are interested. Our mother company, EDF, participates in transmission, though this is not the focus in Mexico</p><h4>Are local financial institutions in general eager to invest in renewable energy projects? </h4><p>Yes, as long as the project is profitable and sustainable, the financial sector backs us. Some funds are looking for short-term returns, but we cannot offer that because of the nature of our projects. Banks are eager to invest in long-term projects like ours because they see it as a safe investment.</p><h4>In 2016, clean energy represented 20% of the power matrix. Will Mexico be able to meet the target of 35% in 2024 and 50% in 2050? </h4><p>The goal of 2024 is ambitious but achievable. On one hand, the infrastructure has to be created. On the other, there are risks associated with the construction of projects in specific areas related to social movements, environmental specificities or security in the case of “red" regions because of conflicts that may hinder or slow down the development of projects and investments.</p><h4>What is your outlook for EDF in the year to come?</h4><p>The strategy until 2024 is clear: we want to have around 2GW by 2022. To date, we have 800MW, so we have to generate 1,200MW in the next three or four years. In the third auction, we hope to obtain 200 MW, but in the following, our bid is stronger and is for 400 or 500MW. The electoral issues complicate next year, though we hope that the upcoming auction will be advanced by January. This could mean that it will be possible to bid and announce winners before 2019. In the future, prices will get more aggressive because of decreased capacity and high participation in the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent have 2016's results met your initial expectations?</h4><p>Our results in 2016 met both my expectations and those of our shareholders. Our performance is above the average of the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores (ANTAD). When we are above the ANTAD average, it connotes a great performance; in other words, we are acquiring the market of a competitor. We have been above this average for the last three years.</p><h4>How has the process of digital transformation at Elektra been?</h4><p>We launched our e-commerce platform in September 2017. We are adapting our business to the most up-to-date digital marketing and online distribution trends. Customers now want to buy whenever they want, wherever they are, and in whatever way they want. We have significant inhouse expertise on e-commerce after hiring a former Amazon director. We are pioneers because our e-commerce platform has functionality and features that go beyond what is on the market today.</p><h4>To what extent will this e-platform offer new products that are not available at your stores?<br></h4><p>We will offer a much wider product catalog than in stores, and it will broaden our target market. Anyone can purchase on the Elektra website since it will be mobile friendly. In addition, we will be able to cover 99% of the Mexican territory, as long as the area has a zip code</p><h4>Elektra offers consumer loans to unbanked consumers. What makes this possible?</h4><p>It is a business model that has been in the market for 67 years. It has been based on understanding the needs of such clients and creating a business model that could satisfy this type of customer. We are able to serve these customers after conducting risk analysis and probability of payment checks. We have a strong alliance with Banco Azteca, which provides the credit to our customers so they can buy our products. All our stores work in conjunction with Banco Azteca. From the end of November 2017, customers have been able to ask for credit to make a purchase directly from our web site.</p><h4>What will be your brick-and-mortar strategy now that you have this strong online presence?<br></h4><p>We are still opening stores in middle- to low-income neighborhoods. The brick-and-mortar trend will remain for a long time in Mexico, unlike in the US, where people are already migrating massively from shopping in a physical store to shopping online. That is the reason why we are still opening stores. There is a population segment that will not have access to our digital platform or at least it will not be easy for them.</p><h4>Tiendas Elektra is present in Central America and Peru. What criteria do you use to choose the countries where you start operations?</h4><p>Elektra has not expanded to a new country in the last 10 years or more. We entered those markets because we believed our business model would be well accepted there. In fact, these countries are similar to Mexico. Currently, we are satisfied with the number of countries where we are present. We focus on strengthening our presence in current countries, including Mexico.</p><h4>How has the demand for electrical appliances here evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Today there is a greater demand for experiences than products. Millennials have a marked tendency to buy online; they do not want to enter stores. Regarding the products we sell, they are more or less the same; this has not changed significantly. In our case, we have perhaps gained a share in the motorcycles market. We did not sell them before; now we are the number-one seller of motorcycles in Mexico. We also sell electric motorcycles and bicycles. We have just hit the market with new models, though prices continue to be the entry barrier. The market tendency for buying electric vehicles is growing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your thoughts on NAFTA negotiations and how they might affect the strong trade relations between the US and Mexico?</h4><p>For Mexico, the NAFTA agreement is extremely important for two reasons. 20 years ago, when the NAFTA agreement started, Mexico started to open up to the world and became competitive in terms of exports and foreign trade. 85% of exports consist of manufacturing and 82% of this is exported to the US and Canada. On another note, over 60% of the country's GDP is related to foreign trade. The renegotiation will establish and reinforce the relationship between the three countries and make the three countries more competitive. However, we do have some issues, one of which is the rules of origin. COMCE agrees that this area needs to be updated, though this is something that must be implemented over the course of four to six years and not abruptly. It is also important to emphasize modernization during the renegotiations; we need to consider other topics and issues as part of this modernization. These were all issues that were not discussed back then, of course. Now, however, we need to take them all into consideration. We foresee an excellent negotiation because the three countries are extremely connected in the value chain. This will definitely result in a successful renegotiation of the agreement. In the end, this will give us more opportunities to update the agreement and promote growth in all three countries</p><h4>In Mexico's strategy to diversify its trade partners, what other markets do you see as a great opportunity?</h4><p>Mexico should seek foreign trade opportunities with other countries and other regions. We need to take advantage of the ones we already have. For example, we have great relations with Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Thus far, we have great relations with Japan. Hopefully with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), we will have more opportunities in that sense. We also have to consider that the Asian markets are harder for an economy such as Mexico, which is mainly based on manufacturing because Asian markets are much more competitive than others. The same problem exists with European markets that are mainly manufacturing producers and traders as well. It is important to find ways to integrate both value chains between Mexico and those markets. On the other hand, Mexico has to grow in terms of value-added exports. Because of the processes, the product, and the fact that the country wants to protect Mexican trade and products, it tries to encourage more value addition. The multiplier effect will give GDP a boost.</p><h4>What sectors can Mexico further develop as part of its export strategy?<br></h4><p>We have many sectors in Mexico that are competitive, the main one being the automotive sector. We are among the seven largest producers and exporters in this industry in the world. The exports go mainly to the US, which demonstrates the importance of NAFTA, and we are starting to export more to Brazil, Latin America, and Europe. Also, there is a great deal of potential growth in the aeronautics industry in the center and north of Mexico. There must also be growth in the export of food products, both fresh and processed, as well as the metal and electronic industries.</p><h4>What are COMCE's priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our strategy is to support the diversification of Mexican commerce and economy. The high rate of dependence on exports to the US, which is 80% exports and 50% imports, is not sustainable. COMCE has to support the diversification of imports and exports. I also believe in the importance of making use of the 46 trade agreement treaties that we have as well as finalizing CPTPP. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the impact of the energy reform on the renewable energy market?</h4><p>Energy reform has opened many opportunities for renewable energy. The energy reform led to green energy auctions, which allowed us to develop more projects than before. Now, we have public auctions where different companies can participate and not just the Federal Power Commission (CFE). Mexico can develop projects not only through auctions but also via the traditional way of doing business: developing projects with power purchase agreements (PPA). With this reform, we have new alternatives to develop projects, which increases the size of the renewable energy market. However, there are some challenges that worry us. For the auctions, size matters because projects have to be better than earlier ones. It is now a completely open market, and we are now competing with all technologies, such as solar and thermal. Previously, there were special projects that we had to compete with, though not like now, where it is a completely open competition, and technology has to lower the cost of energy</p><h4>What factors allow Siemens Gamesa to improve its cost efficiency?</h4><p>There are many reasons. Now there are better projects, which are more developed and less risky. In addition, the wind turbine technology has improved significantly, especially on our side. The competition also makes the market more aggressive. As a result of all this, there has been a reduction of almost 50% of the energy price. In the end, this is great for us because it produces technology that does not need subsidies from the government and means we are competitive. We are competing against other forms of energy.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for renewable energy infrastructure in Mexico?</h4><p>The transmission lines and the entire grid are major challenges. There are currently many projects under construction; however, during the auction we saw certain restrictions in some areas, for example, in Oaxaca. The most important issue currently is that all auctions need a great deal of time because the government needs time to obtain transmissions lines and environmental permits. The infrastructure bottleneck is also an issue. The first PPP transmission project will not be in Oaxaca, where it is most needed. The government changed to one in Sonora to connect the different systems. We expect something to change in order to have the necessary infrastructure in Oaxaca</p><h4>How do you see the foreign investor appetite for the renewables market in Mexico?</h4><p>At the last tender, most of the winners were foreign investors, though most of them are large utilities companies. This is a business for energy companies, more than just an investment or people seeking a one-off opportunity. In Mexico, the clients are large international utilities like EDF, Enel, Engie, Euro Dollar, and Gas Natural, and they are now winning tenders not only in Mexico but also Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. The cost of energy is currently resulting in decreasing profits, though this has made companies more focused on their business. It is not only an investment opportunity but also a business opportunity from a long-term business perspective.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Mexican market for Siemens Gamesa's global strategy?</h4><p>This is a market that is growing, not just in Mexico but all of Latin America. In the wind market, there have been mergers. We—Siemens Wind Power and Gamesa—merged, GE and Alstom merged, and Nordex and Acciona merged. There is a reduction in the number of competitors, though they are now larger and we need to be extremely competitive. We need to be larger and seal big contracts to obtain optimized costs. It is a market that will grow; it is a market where we can compete. It is a market where Siemens Gamesa is the leader. In Mexico, we have 50% of the market share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of companies do you target?</h4><p>We target institutions of all sizes and in all industries. It is perhaps easier to get through to larger companies as they have more resources, a better understanding of what it takes to prioritize loyalty, and are more proactive in seeking to do something in terms of loyalty. However, small companies tend to benefit from loyalty initiatives even more than larger companies. Another key thing about loyalty is that there are two aspects to it. On the one hand, there is consumer loyalty, where we target end consumers. On the other hand, however, loyalty also entails a company's entire value chain. From suppliers to distributors, and from key executives to line employees, a company wants them all to be loyal. We can help companies on all these fronts</p><h4>What is the biggest challenge a company faces when trying to build up loyalty?</h4><p>The biggest challenge, and the one thing I address from the offset with each client, is helping them have a clear idea of what their company and brand stand for. A loyalty program should truly reflect, and at the same time, augment the brand. Offering points, experiences or rewards is just part of the mechanics of a program. The real key is thinking about the brand and having the loyalty program transmit and reinforce its values</p><h4>What is the difference between digital marketing and loyalty programs?</h4><p>Many of our clients are a little skeptical about what we will accomplish and what will happen when we start developing their loyalty strategies. Once we get the ball rolling however, they start seeing the benefits of the loyalty program and start taking their marketing dollars from other initiatives and putting them into the loyalty program. Loyalty truly encompasses everything—and is where the company's investment can have the most significant impact on the customers that it really targets. Digital marketing is a communication channel, while a loyalty program is a relationship strategy</p><h4>Do you have future plans to expand to other countries?</h4><p>When it comes to loyalty programs, their core is the intellectual property that goes into developing them. There is however, also a significant volume of operations, logistics, and other aspects that are not easily replicable from market to market. Hence, I am considering expanding internationally, but not before we ensure all local capabilities are in place, so we may offer a full-service solution like we do in Mexico. I do not want to go out there with a limited portfolio of services to offer.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the NAFTA renegotiation?</h4><p>There is more concern in the market than is warranted. Certainly, we have the US President being harsh both in word and action; the agreement, however, is in place and even if he was to scratch it, it would take time for that to happen. Regardless, and most importantly, Mexico already has close ties to several regional countries, and is among the countries with the most bilateral agreements around the world; it is a matter of exploiting them and making them come to full fruition. This is a great opportunity to readdress and update the agreement, and ensure we have the best deal for everyone.</p><h4>How would you assess the strategy by Mexican companies to diversify their trade partners?</h4><p>Mexico has done a great job of entering bilateral agreements; it is now up to private companies to take full advantage of them. Mexico's relationship with the US is double edged because the US is a huge market and it is great to be geographically sitting next to it. On the flip side, however, it has made Mexico complacent and prevented us from aggressively developing other markets. Thankfully, the US presidency placing such pressure on the NAFTA agreement—and in such a caustic manner—encourages many companies to start looking more aggressively for trade partners outside the US. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Triple Helix Model]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[triple-helix-model]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Jalisco's long-term bet in terms of economic specialization?</h4><p>It is based on innovation, science, and technology, not as a concept but as a system. The current administration's first action was to create the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology. We carried out a study regarding the changes in technology in industry, such as manufacturing, over the past 50 years. Through this, we were able to reinforce technological ideas and conditions powered by innovation and science. Our development plan is based on this philosophy.</p><h4>How has private and public spending regarding research and technology evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Since the start of ouradministration, we have increased the budget for research and technology from 0.37% to 1%. However, private investment has hovered around USD10 billion across the last five years and the sector requires additional private investment for development and encouragement of start-ups.</p><h4>Why did Jalisco opt for a “triple helix" governance model to foster its knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>We signed a triple helix model agreement that includes the government as the coordinator, the private sector as the main investor, and universities—including public, private, and vocational education institutions—as knowledge and research builders. The benefits go to society, which acts as a fourth helix. Jalisco has always had great potential, and we saw the opportunity to articulate efforts in the government's agenda based on innovation, science, and technology. At present, there is a council formed by all the private and public university presidents working on projects and plans with the government.</p><h4>Concerning Jalisco's successful agri-food sector, what is the relation between innovation, exports, and national food supply?</h4><p>Success was possible due to the support for agricultural research as well as technological investment and development. Investing in technology for rural areas allows farmers to propel future generations to become entrepreneurs. Jalisco is home to Latin America's most important research center for agroindustry. By giving farmers access to investment, research, and better seeds, they are able to analyze the time of year and the type of soil for all the potential products. Due to these steps, there was a reduction in pests and animal diseases. On the back of these innovations, a development and growth model was created; farmers who only grew corn were growing berries and earning 600% more income. We provide help with production, export, and commercialization of their products. Through these value-adding steps, we export to 193 countries.</p><h4>Many states and cities opt for Industry 4.0. What is Jalisco doing differently here?</h4><p>Jalisco's gamechanger is investment in education. We created a Council 4.0 with an allocated budget, in charge of checking out the projects that need to be legislated and managing educational programs that suit market needs. From registering the least number of patents in Mexico, Jalisco is now on top of the list. If Mexico continues to adopt Industry 4.0, it will be a world leader within 10 years. The difference can already be observed; there are 6,000 companies in Jalisco now as compared to 300 at the start of our administration. By further implementing Industry 4.0, we can substantially reduce poverty, violence, and insecurity.</p><h4>What policies has Jalisco put in place to cut down on its greenhouse gas emissions?</h4><p>We have achieved this through stringent policies. Rather than following other Latin American cities by investing in infrastructure for vehicles, we have invested in public and alternative transport systems. We are about to inaugurate the third line of our subway system and extend line one. Moreover, by increasing the number of rail cars per train to three, an extra 350,000 people will be able to use the system daily, reducing the number of car journeys by 1 million. In addition, by expanding the bike-sharing system and zones with speed limits, we can reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 tons. Our broader measures include intercity transportation systems, implementation of bio digesters, restoring water bodies, and stricter regulations for companies working in Jalisco. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key features of Banobras' Proyectos Mexico platform, which displays all the infrastructure projects open to private investment?</h4><p>The first is transparency, as the federal government has done an impressive job in regard to transparency. A great deal of information that was not public seven or 10 years ago has become public now, although transparency is not only putting information on the web. The idea is to make it easier for users to access information. Another message the government wants to send is that never before in the history of Mexico has there been so many opportunities to invest in infrastructure and energy. Most of the projects are driven by the energy reform, though we still have many projects in other sectors such as transportation, hospitals, and so on. However, we cannot spread the platform's message alone. We need the support of ProMexico and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as ambassadors know best who is willing to invest in Mexico.</p><h4>How would you assess foreign investors' appetite for projects in Mexico?</h4><p>It varies from country to country, though they have Mexico on top of their minds and inquire about the economy in 2018, NAFTA, and the elections. Most of them invest for 20-30 years so these issues are secondary. More than half of these countries are already invested in Mexico, and they make recommendations about certain issues that we still need to tackle in the government. Those who have yet to participate in Mexico have us at the top of their minds and just want to find the right moment to invest. For those countries, it is important to touch base from time to time because it is difficult for those in the Middle East or Asia to stay up to date with developments in Mexico. Most do not know that auction and procurement processes in Mexico are mostly done on a public platform. The main events of the procurement process of major projects are on TV, and they are surprised by how transparent they can be. We are optimistic about their interest in participating in Mexico.</p><h4>How successful has the PPP mechanism been to date?</h4><p>The PPP framework was created in 2012, and we made certain changes in 2014 and 2016. There are currently 37 different projects under the new PPP framework. Project sponsors now have to get themselves familiar with the PPP framework as it has more rigorous guidelines about what they need to do before launching a project. Such an effort should be made for all projects and not only PPPs. It will take perhaps an additional two or three years for everyone to become familiar with the framework. It is not rocket science; everything just needs to be put in order from the beginning. However, we are not constrained by the PPP framework. There are more than 400 different opportunities, and only 10% of them are PPPs. The others are concessions, financed public works, joint ventures, and so on.</p><h4>Is investment currently mainly channeled to the energy and hydrocarbons sectors?</h4><p>We currently have more projects in those than any other sector. Nonetheless, there are important projects in other sectors. The government plans to have over 92% internet coverage across the country in the next six years, which requires the participation of the private sector. We have other projects such as the expansion of the Veracruz Port. The Toluca-Mexico City train is currently not a PPP, although perhaps there will be further PPP projects once operations begin. The government has also awarded a project for a tunnel that will drain rainwater from Mexico City. These ones have greater impact; however, there are many other investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your thoughts on the main goals of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) agreement?</h4><p>From the time we started doing the work on regional arrangements that ultimately led to the TPP process, we had in mind an ultimate goal of developing building blocks toward a free trade area covering the whole Asia-Pacific region. But in terms of combined GDP of the countries concerned, even this initial CPTPP agreement is a huge achievement. It represents a collection of 11 progressive economies whose governments are committed to opening trade as a driver of economic growth. It will come into force at the end of 2018 or early 2019 once six countries have ratified it. It seems fairly likely that it will become a platform for further expansion. Considering the political and technical challenges in putting together a high-quality agreement like this one involving such a diverse range of countries, it is an enormous technical and political achievement with tremendous positive economic implications.</p><h4>What would be some of the concrete impacts on trade in the short term?</h4><p>Governments and interest groups tend to focus on goods trade and generally begin with tariff cuts. CPTPP is important in that respect, because it takes us a long way toward free trade in goods. However, the most important impact is in shaping the vision, building an expectation in business and investment circles that we can work toward an extensive integration of our economic relationships, including the development of complex multi-country supply chains. This will allow businesses to progressively develop similar operating models in every market and enjoy the efficiencies that flow from that in multiple CPTPP markets. With high-quality services and investment rules, CPTPP will encourage investment and development of services trade. It is notoriously hard to measure and assess what is happening in the service sectors. However, as drivers of economic development shifting toward modern, high value-added production, this will be a critical part of CPTPP impact.</p><h4>How do you expect SMEs from both Mexico and New Zealand to benefit from trade deals?</h4><p>In New Zealand, almost every company qualifies as an SME, with few exceptions. At the same time, in New Zealand and Mexico, SMEs are critically important sources of innovation for employment and growth. New Zealand's Minister for Small Business, Stuart Nash, attended the OECD conference on small businesses in February 2018 in Mexico to signal an interest in working with bigger economies like Mexico in supporting SMEs, not just in each national economy, but also as they venture into export and offshore investment. Some of our New Zealand SMEs are active in Mexico, such as Wellington Drive, which is based in Querétaro and provides new generation, highly efficient, and low-energy use electric motors in soft drink cabinets for companies such as Coca-Cola. There are equally important Mexican stories around innovation by SMEs. An agreement like CPTPP makes it easier to work toward streamlined regulatory approaches, mutual recognition, trade-friendly regulatory approaches, facilitated investment relationships, and so on; these things matter for smaller enterprises.</p><h4>How would you assess New Zealand's economic presence in Mexico?</h4><p>In recent decades we have been heavily focused on Asia. But now the combination of the P4 deal, which involved Chile and Singapore, the TPP, and the Pacific Alliance, is helping to boost the visibility of Mexico and other Pacific Alliance markets in New Zealand. There are not many New Zealand companies active here, though those that are here have excellent stories to tell. The biggest is a company called Fisher &amp; Paykel in the healthcare sector. It has a manufacturing plant in Tijuana and is a great example of what Mexico can offer as an investment destination for New Zealand companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Deepening Ties]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[deepening-ties]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are Canadian and Mexican companies cooperating to transfer knowledge and conduct joint research projects in key sectors?</h4><p>Aerospace is one example. Bombardier came to Mexico about 15 years ago and established a plant. They realized the market did not have the right makeup of skilled workers; hence, they sat down with universities to create a curriculum that would train for these necessary skills. This has since transformed into an aerospace cluster that now trains some of the most highly skilled workers in the sector. Canadian companies are doing the same in the mining and the oil and gas industries right now. There was an important agreement in 2017 between the Ministry of Energy, University of Alberta, and University of Calgary to train technicians and engineers in these areas. We want to help develop the curriculum to ensure young engineers exiting university have the right skill set and knowledge base to address the industry's growing challenges. The reality is that the last 18 months have allowed Canada and Mexico to assess their relationship more closely and forge new and lasting bonds. The relationship was slightly dormant before this. We were partly ignorant of one another before recent events forced us to re-evaluate. Over the last 18 months, this re-evaluation has gone extremely well, and we are poised to strengthen ties in ever more exciting ways</p><h4>What short-term results do you expect?</h4><p>In the short term, we expect a number of positive developments. More Mexican students will be able to come to Canada to study. Roughly, 20,000 Mexican students come to Canada to study every year, and we can do better than this. That said, this marks a significant increase from just a few years ago. We have top universities for a fraction of the price one might pay in the US. Canada has done a poor job of selling itself in terms of its education value in the past, though that is now changing quickly. We have a full-time education officer in the embassy whose job it is to promote education opportunities in Canada. The proof is in the pudding. Now, we need to bring more Canadian students to Mexico, which has been a challenge for us. If one studies abroad, they become an excellent personal ambassador for their country, and they build a network that will last their whole life. We want to deepen these ties to Mexico. We could have 25,000-30,000 Mexican students studying in Canada year in, year out. We must be ambitious.</p><h4>How can Canada and Mexico foster reciprocal promotion as tourism destinations?</h4><p>We recently won the bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Mexico and the US. This will provide us a huge opportunity to promote the image of all three countries together. Now that we have lifted the visa requirements, the increase in tourism reached 47% last year. 257,000 Mexicans visited Canada in 2017, and we hope for 400,000 in 2018. Many Canadians are unaware of how great the cities in Mexico are. We hope to see more Canadians visiting these great cultural centers across Mexico when they come to visit the beaches. I am extremely confident tourism will continue to grow between our two countries.</p><h4>Which sectors of the Mexican economy hold the largest potential for increasing investment inflows from Canada?</h4><p>We are extremely active in the aerospace, auto parts, mining, and financial sectors in the country. We have around 60 Canadian companies in the auto parts sector, and they operate 116 plants across Mexico. However, this is an industry that flies below the radar a great deal of the time. We also have important activities in the banking sector. We have pension funds that operate here as well, and they have hundreds of millions of dollars invested. Furthermore, Canadian companies are looking more at the agribusiness sector. There are many new areas of investment popping up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80% of Payments Electronic]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hamzat-ayodele-subair-executive-chairman-lagos-internal-revenue-service]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures and policies has LIRS implemented in recent years to improve tax collection?</h4><p>LIRS was established in March 2006, through the presentation of a bill to the Lagos State House of assembly and subsequent passage of the Lagos State Revenue Administration Law, making the then Board of Internal Revenue autonomous and self-accounting. This autonomy allowed for an increase of revenue from a previous monthly average of NGN600 million to an average of NGN30 billion monthly. This was largely due to improved quality of service delivery to taxpayers, improvement in the use of IT and other modern methods of administration in tax collection and an unprecedented enlightenment campaign on tax administration and education. We also invested in training and development of staff, ensuring that officers of the LIRS are technically competent and know the relevant tax laws and regulations.</p><h4>Is Lagos's e-payment system and automated processes unique to the local environment?</h4><p>Lagos really stands out in this regard. We are almost like an academic institution for some other state tax authorities in Nigeria. When we grow and improve together, the entire country enjoys synergies. All payments made to Lagos State Government can be viewed real time, with payment history securely stored for future reference. This was climaxed by a pronouncement by the Governor of Lagos, His Excellency Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, mandating that from April 2018 onward, all payments in Lagos must be electronic. We were already at around 80% electronic payments, but this executive order changed the landscape completely as automation promotes transparency and has helped build trust and confidence.</p><h4>What is the tax compliance level in Lagos?</h4><p>We need to break it down across sectors to get a better idea. Compliance for people in paid employment, usually called 'Pay As You Earn,' is well over 70%. There are hardly any businesses that employ three to five people or above that are not remitting PAYE taxes. For self-employed people however, it is difficult to access information. Many are paid in cash and are therefore below the radar. We do, however have ways of bringing them into the tax net, such as through withholding taxes. The other taxes we collect at LIRS apart from Personal Income Tax include withholding tax, capital gains tax, stamp duties, and consumption tax. Consumption tax is unique to the hospitality industry. A 5% tax is added to any consumption or service in the hospitality industry under the Hotel Occupancy &amp; Restaurants Consumption Tax (HORCT) When we initiated this tax, we encountered stiff resistance from operators in this industry, there were claims that it was a duplication of the federal VAT. The issue was taken to court and there was a ruling in 2012 validating the Hotel Occupancy &amp; Restaurants Consumption Tax and the Lagos State Government's right to charge it. We have since been collecting this tax and the compliance we can say is approximately 70%. Automation of our tax processes in Lagos State has increased transparency and accountability.</p><h4>How would you explain Lagos's success in tax collection compared to the rest of the country?</h4><p>We have been blessed with good leadership in Lagos State. Additionally, we were forced to think outside of the box for the purpose of revenue generation. Infact in Lagos, we say that there is no box, and we are willing to implement any strategy or reform that will improve our effectiveness and efficiency. We have had Governors who are passionate about turning the state into a leader in not just Nigeria but of Africa. They have a vision for Lagos and a matching passion for its sustainable development, which makes life much easier. The state has a number of ongoing projects, and government is working to develop every part of Lagos. Many of these projects are only possible with the money we have been collecting in taxes.  For most states, there is a ratio of 90:10 between the allocation paid to them from the federation accounts and the revenue generated internally, In Lagos however, a reversal is the case, with the federal allocation being only 25% and IGR 75%.</p><h4>On a federal level, what does Nigeria need to do to improve tax revenue?</h4><p>Because of the oil price dip, budgets allocated to the states from the federal government have dropped, forcing many state governments to start thinking about developing their revenue authorities with the view to increasing their internally generated revenue. More states are starting to seek the autonomy that LIRS has had in Lagos for about 12years. Governors have started to give heads of states' internal revenue services more freedom, which reduces bureaucracy and allows for greater strategizing and creativity. The state next to Lagos in revenue generation collects approximately NGN7-8 billion monthly and we have many others generating less than NGN2 billion monthly.</p><h4>How successful has the Voluntary Asset and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) been?</h4><p>The scheme was initiated by the Federal Ministry of Finance in collaboration with Federal Inland Revenue Service, and the State Internal Revenue Services.  Lagos through this scheme has been able to generate material revenue. Lagos was the most successful state in terms of the program implementation. Some states were a bit apprehensive at commencement of the scheme; however, we recognized its value from the start. We were the first state to sign an MoU through the Joint Tax Board (JTB) because we saw the scheme and the potentials it held to increasing our revenue. On the part of the taxpayer, people who voluntarily declare their assets and income get interest and penalty waivers. Additionally, there is no criminal prosecution for those who sign up for the program. You must, however, truthfully declare, because if it is subsequently discovered that you lied, then you have breached the agreement and thereby your immunity. The declaration is extremely confidential. No one outside the agency VAIDS unit knows who has come and declared assets. Furthermore, Nigeria has signed the OECD agreement that allows for Exchange of Information. Many Nigerians have properties abroad, some of which is income producing, and it is vital that we develop a plan to collect tax revenue on all incomes earned locally and abroad. Globally, there is an effort to ensure that people pay taxes promptly and correctly to the relevant authority.</p><h4>What do you expect for 2019?</h4><p>The first thing we want to do is widen the tax base. After our analysis, we saw that people in paid employment bear the burden of taxation more than others. We want to expand the tax net for high net worth individuals and the informal sector. We are investing more in technology as well. We are developing a tax administration solution by which taxpayers will be able to interact with the platform from the ease of their offices or homes. It will allow them to buy into the philosophy of paying their taxes. We expect to go live by the end of the year, and this will really help us grow revenues. We seek to develop BVN as a tool to identify individual taxpayers. We also plan to harness our integration with other state government agencies such as the department of motor vehicles, the Lands Bureau, Land use charge etc. in verifying incomes against vehicle and property purchasing habits. Lastly, we will move into a larger office acquired by the state. We are extremely excited about everything that 2019 has to offer. The Government is dedicated to improving the lives of everyone in Lagos through the provision of infrastructure and social amenities. . The revenues we collect are vital components of the government's efforts to transform the state. All these visible projects make my job easier, because people are able to see where their money goes. They can see they are contributing to the development and growth of Lagos.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A considerable majority of citizens have decided to start with the fourth transformation of the public sphere in Mexico.</p><p>I thank all those who voted for us and trust us to head this process of real change. I respect all those who voted for other candidates and political parties.<br><br>I urge all Mexicans to reconcile and put the general interest before their personal interests, no matter how legitimate it might be. As Vicente Guerrero said: "The homeland comes first."<br><br>The new national policy seeks to establish a true democracy. We do not seek to have a dictatorship, neither overt nor covert.<br>There will be deep changes, but according to the existing order.<br><br>There will be entrepreneurial freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of belief; all individual and social freedoms will be guaranteed, as well as the civil and political rights enshrined in the Constitution.<br><br>In economic terms, the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico will be respected; the new government will keep a financial and fiscal discipline; we will recognize the existing commitments toward companies and domestic and foreign banks.<br><br>Regarding the energy sector, we will review contracts in order to prevent corruption and infringement. In the event that anomalies that affect the national interest are found during this revision, we will appeal to the National Congress or national and international courts for help; that is to say, we will always act by legal means, and not arbitrarily. There will not be seizure nor expropriation of property.<br><br>The transformation we will carry out is about rooting out corruption from our country. We will not have any problem to achieve this purpose since Mexican people are the inheritors of great civilizations and, therefore, they are intelligent, honest, and hard working. Corruption is not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of a decadent political regime. We are absolutely sure that this condition is the main cause of social and economic inequality and the violence that we are suffering. Therefore, the eradication of corruption and impunity will be the primary mission of the new government.<br><br>Under no circumstances will the next President allow corruption or impunity. Forewarned is forearmed: no matter who it might be, there will be a punishment. I am including comrades in activism, public officials, friends, and family.<br><br>The money saved from combating corruption and eliminating privileges will be used to stimulate development in the country. There will be no need to increase taxes in real terms nor place the country in debt. There will not be any increase in the price of gasoline either. The current expenditure will be lower and the public investment will increase, in order to encourage more productive activities and the employment generation. The purpose is to enhance the domestic market, produce what we consume inside the country, and make Mexican people happy and employed in the place where they were born—where their families, their traditions, and their culture are. Those who want to emigrate should do so just for pleasure and not out of need.<br>The state will no longer be a committee in the service of a minority but rather it will represent all Mexicans: rich and poor; rural,and urban inhabitants; migrants, believer and non.believers, human beings af all kind of schools of thought and sexual preferences.<br><br>We will listen to, take care of, and respect everyone, but we will give priority to the less fortunate and forgotten, particularly to the indigenous people of Mexico. For the common good of all, poor people come first.<br>We will change the failed strategy to fight against insecurity and violence. More than using force, we will address the root causes. I am convinced that more efficient and human-centered way to face these wrongs needs to fight against inequality and poverty first. Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice.<br><br>We will be friends with all countries. In terms of foreign policy, the principles of non-intervention, self-determination of peoples, and peaceful settlement of disputes will be implemented again. As President Juárez said: "Nothing can be imposed by force, everything must occur through reason and law."<br><br>We will look for a friendly and development cooperation-oriented relationship with the government of the US, always based on mutual respect and the defense of our migrants, who live and work honestly there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about how the ban on single-use bags plastic materials came into existence and your thoughts on expanding these types of environmentally friendly initiatives across the country?</h4><p>First of all, we have to view nature as a global warehouse; every aspect of the modern world is, at some level, derived from the natural world. We have to recognize and accept this fact, because this state of consciousness allows us to develop the proper structures for dealing with this. In the best case scenario, the products we derive from nature end up in a legitimate landfill, but in other cases these products and waste materials are dumped into the natural world. Thus, we have two problems: The warehouse that is mother nature is slowly becoming emptier and the waste products from the global industrial economy are going straight back into the environment. The single-use bag ban is designed to create a balance between supply and demand while also protecting the natural world by requiring that these types of products are created using 70% recycled materials. We can, therefore, rely on nature for only 30% of the inputs needed to continue producing because the remainder is coming from materials present in the economy. These products are primarily products that are not being used with foods and other consumables. However, we are developing the ability to utilize recycled materials in a host of products that have traditionally used totally fresh inputs. We are looking to lower the total pressure being put on the natural world while supporting industrial and economic production. The bag ban is the first step in getting the city and the country to move in this direction—after Guayaquil, the country should follow. We want to be a sustainable model that the National Assembly can look to as they craft the national legislation. We believe that within 36 months we can transform this area of the economy with phasing out plastic bag and utensils and straws. After plastic bags, we will phase out other products like straws over the next three years.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit more about how SAMBITO serves as a facilitator to players in the public and private sphere?</h4><p>SAMBITO is a holding that is an ecosystem of interests dedicated to promoting ways of doing business that save the planet. In 20 years, we have completed 2,000 projects. We are strong in both the technical and commercial aspects of the industry, and our focus on the latter is what really sets us apart from our competitors. Every year, we visit 2,000 companies, which is almost seven companies per day. Out of these companies, perhaps 400 articulate an interest in our services and 100 sign contracts with us annually; thus, we sign a new contract around every three days. We operate across three four business lines. First line is our consultancy business. The Ecuadorian Constitution enumerates specific rights for the natural world, giving us a large umbrella of various businesses for us to consult on the regulatory requirements. Our second business line relates to everything that is voluntary; we have signed more than 50 contracts for carbon-neutral companies. We created the first and only platform that connects nature to lawyers, and we have supported the defense of numerous causes on a pro bono level. The third line of services relates to the support and development of the environmental industry. This is where our water company comes into play. This company takes water from industrial waste, treats it and then returns it to the natural world. Fourthly, we organize the Latin American Green Awards (LAGA), which provide an opportunity to put a spotlight on the people that are taking actions for the environment. The UN is the main strategic partner for this event, together with the municipality of Guayaquil. SAMBITO is the organizer of this event, and we exhibit, reward, and connect the best 500 projects from Latin America. In the latest edition, 2,733 projects were subscribed from 713 cities across 38 countries. </p><h4>What are other notable environment initiatives that you have launched?</h4><p>We are the executive director of the national recycling corporation of tires. For 2018, our target is to recycle 2.4 million tires. We can transform 60-70% of these materials into energy for the concrete and other industries. We also represent a US German company called FMS, which creates products that allow industries using diesel fuel to reduce their CO2 emissions by 15%. We have another partnership with a German investment pension fund, and we are heavily involved in reforesting. This means we are in the business of producing oxygen. Finally, we organize the Latin American Green Awards, which provide an opportunity to put a spotlight on the people that are taking actions for the environment. This spotlight is organized with the UN, and we exhibit, reward, and connect the best 500 projects from Latin America. In the latest edition, 2,733 projects were subscribed from 713 cities across 38 countries.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the digital applications you are developing?</h4><p>In Ecuador, there are penal consequences for extreme non-compliance with environmental laws. Thus, we created an app, Nikola, that allows organizations to keep up with their environmental targets. The app also allows firms to announce what they will do in terms of the regulations and it allows for the government to verify compliance. We are the first company in the world to develop a digital environmental assistant like this.</p><h4>What is your approach for maintaining a high level of sustainability in the agriculture and aquaculture cacao and banana sectors?</h4><p>Moving toward sustainability in these industries is a matter of survival. The white disease we faced in Ecuador was the result of a high-degree of exploitation facing our soil and water; nature was letting us know that something was wrong. We had to let it rest for a while, and since then our agriculturalists shrimp farmers have switched to more sustainable techniques and approaches. The industry also has to understand that treating its human capital better is valuable for the entire industry. Almost 50% of Ecuador's economy is dependent on agriculture. We have to focus on adding value, and we have to help our growers learn and develop by supporting them and teaching them the best techniques. No one supervises traditional farmers, whereas organic farmers are highly scrutinized and regulated. We really need to review this system of incentives and the current structure for the agriculture industry. People are being pushed away from organic, and there is an urgent need to reassess this. Most agricultural workers and industrialists want to be sustainable, while consumers are conscious.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>Here in Ecuador, we have a law requiring that colors corresponding to nutritional components and ingredients be added to food packaging. This has changed the way food is purchased and consumed. Next, we should have a similar color system for packaging's food's environmental impact. This system will allow consumers to make informed decisions about the environmental impact of their purchases. We are working hard on these projects, and we believe that it will change the habit and culture of the nation. Another project is the 'Uber for recycling' which allows neighborhoods to collectively recycle waste. Our dream is for landfills to become mineral mines of the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[alberto-mainieri-costa-rica-country-manager-ibm]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have IBM's operations in Costa Rica evolved over time?</h4><p>IBM's delivery center operations started in 2004 with a fairly limited scope in business process outsourcing (BPO), doing HR processes, such as payroll and benefits and travel and expense accounting in the F&amp;A space, for around 11 clients. However, based on results and as we saw the talent and the capabilities of the resources in the country, we started to expand our scope in the business process outsourcing (BPO) field, where we started doing full scope services for F&amp;A including balance sheet reconciliation, record to report, etc, and shared services or internal support to IBM North America in various areas. For any new scope in this space that we started supporting from our center,, we found talented people with excellent English, and most importantly with great attitude and willingness to learn. Once we had the full scope of BPO services here, we expanded scope into the IT outsourcing area, which is closer to IBM's core business—technology. In 2011, IBM reinvested in Costa Rica and opened a delivery center for IT outsourcing because the technical skills in the market were as good as the business process skills we had found here. We were able to grow by about 1,000 people in this area, within a few years all with technical skills, including doing incident management, technical project management, mainframe support work, provisioning, support for data center installations and migrations, etc. As our company transformed, our delivery center in Costa Rica, continued to evolve and we started doing cloud services and cybersecurity. We are constantly re-skilling and up-skilling our resources and are preparing our team to support other service lines such as R&amp;D, IBM Watson Health, Blockchain and others if required. We have had great success with the local talent and have not yet found any service within IBM that cannot be done from Costa Rica. The people are talented, with good attitude and willingness lo learn and can be trained to do most jobs.</p><h4>What does the country and industry need to do to develop more highly qualified STEM human capital here?</h4><p>This is an important topic, and this is mostly where we focus our efforts when we talk to government, CINDE and various ministries. We ask about what the government is doing to prepare people for the new jobs that are needed today or coming in the near future. There is a big need for technical skills in the workforce. However, the work to incentive students needs to be done early on in the education system. We need to make young students in the sixth and seventh grade, who have not yet decided on their career path, become aware and excited about technology and technology-related jobs, which is our biggest need today and will be the jobs of the future. One way we support these initiatives is bringing students to our company and see what we do and get them excited about technology and show them the possibilities available with STEM skills and technology oriented education. The second point is that Costa Rica has around 10% unemployment, so the challenge  is how can we re-skill that workforce to do the jobs in the technology industry that we need  and where demand is growing.</p><h4>What does IBM Costa Rica do to differentiate itself as the best solution provider?</h4><p>The training and preparation of staff is number one in terms of serving clients and adding the greatest value to their business. However, lower value transactional processes that we do for clients are cheaper to do from other parts of the world. The way to add value for clients is to take their data, analyze it, and show them the trends and business insight. Instead of just being a service provider, one becomes a business partner and gives their clients opportunities to grow their revenue and improve their processes and products. Our focus at IBM Costa Rica is becoming that business partner to our clients and adding more value, rather than just taking care of their routine processes and requirements. We look at how we can collaborate with other IBM centers through our innovation and create assets that can be shared with others doing the same type of work. Innovation, high value skills and collaboration are key to strive to be the best.</p><h4>What is IBM doing to attract STEM talent and retain it?</h4><p>In terms of staff retention, IBM invests a great deal in training; in the market, if one hires someone from IBM, they will probably be well trained. To help with retention, we promote from within and offer a career to our employees. We have entry-, mid-, and high-level jobs, including those with global responsibilities based in Costa Rica. Our entry-level people can go anywhere in the world; there is no limit. We have many examples of people we have moved to work  to places like Europe and the US. Our collaborators can build whatever career they like within our global services scope and it does not have to be based on what they studied in school. IBM offers a wide variety of career opportunities within the one company. For example, we provide the tools and education for an accountant who joins us to become a cybersecurity analyst if they want to. This is a great way to promote staff retention. Besides offering a great place to work, we also ensure we are at par with the market on standard benefits, such as transportation, private medical insurance, work from home opportunities and others  and stay competitive in terms of salary. However, the investment in skills and education in our resources which enables one to grow or even change their career path to new areas, with different skill sets and challenges  is our main retention point.</p><h4>Would you tell us about IBM's main CSR projects and the ones you are most proud of?</h4><p>IBM's current CSR focus is on three areas—women in technology, diversity in general, and skills development. We have Internship programs with Technical High schools and Universities. Besides providing the experience of a real job to the students we have a defined training curricula to help them develop soft skills that will make them more successful on their work life and we also give fundamental training on IBM new technologies. Also, we have a program named IBM Experience that includes soft skill training and Design Thinking workshops among others, this program is used to develop skills on IBM family members, vendors and students to make them more attractive for hiring. We bring in students from different schools and high schools from all over the country to look at what we do and give them a robotics-type projects to do to get them excited about STEM careers. We show them that we have many exciting jobs they could do. Our delivery center in Costa Rica has a large and state of the art cybersecurity center of excellence, and we provide courses and workshops to the public in order to build and grow cybersecurity skills that the rest of the market can use. We also partner with universities; for example, we provide CENFOTEC a cybersecurity curriculum. We are also working with universities to help them learn how to modify their IT curricula to stay up to speed in this field. We participate in several programs to promote women in technology, including working with groups and sponsoring women to bring more of them into the technology sector. Besides the Cybersecurity Academy we also provide free academies in our Innovation Hub for Data Science and Design Thinking. We work all these programs with different ONGs to support inclusiveness in technology and skills development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a brief background of what was behind the creation of Education E-Solutions and what gap in the market it filled?</h4><p>Education e-Solutions was established four years ago with the main focus of riding the wave of technological transformation since the Saudi economy has been shifting away from being oil-based toward being knowledge driven. The technology sector is one of the main sectors driving this change. We took the opportunity to create digital solutions and e-platforms to engage the entire community. This includes connecting university, college, and school students through a common platform where ideas are created through their interactions. Traditionally each university has had its own R&amp;D department, without much communication between them until the research was published. Modern technologies now allow us to move past this phase, and come to a truly open innovation environment. With short technology life cycles, knowledge is coming from multi-dimensional aspects in different fields. This pressure has forced many institutions to be more outward looking. A single company can only innovate so much. People are needed from outside, be they individual experts or end-users, to participate in the development process. This is the concept of Education e-Solutions. We are providing digital platforms and inviting experts, students, and universities to engage in a social community to tackle common challenges to co-create a vision of the future. As a part of this, we have been introducing innovative technologies into the market, like VR, AR, and AI. Like all new things, you can expect some initial resistance to adoption. From our experience, one of the main obstacles is that there is no rich content for virtual reality. We tackled this by inviting experts from around the global to help students here to create and perfect a 3D model. We signed an MoU with TVTC and partnered with Effat University. We are seeing much effort in social learning. It is more than delivering content to users. There needs to be social interactions in the approach to allow connections and exchanges between users to create a knowledge mash-up of ideas. This is how innovation takes place. We provide the infrastructure for all of the programmers and developers where they can look into the community and change their ideas with the help of experts. They can share the software codes and models to make communication easier through a “xR portal" that we are currently implementing.</p><h4>How would you assess the maturity of the digital economy in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>There has been significant improvement in the adoption of e-commerce, e-business, and now e-education. We can see several universities adopting and changing their content from physical and paper-based to digital. This is cost saving as well as more accessible to end-users. We see these initiatives both from the private and public sector. The goal of Vision 2030 is to have the private sector engaged with the public sector to co-share an innovative future. The management of data is essential to reach this goal. Data is the fuel and new currency. In the future, data will run the economy. All AI technologies and IoT will need data to achieve their potential possibly with the help of neural networks. It is absolutely key and comes from interactions, user-to-user, user-to-machine, and machine-to-machine as we will see with Machine Learning or Deep Learning from AI. Therefore our platform has to be so attractive for all innovative companies to come and deploy their technologies and open their data for exchange. Furthermore, our absorption capacity has to be very high. We have to focus on changing the rules of intangible assets or intellectual property rights. The global conventional approach is that governments are focusing on defining the ownership of IPRs. There are aggressive restrictions on who owns what for intangible assets and how the end-user can be protected. The rules will have to be changed from ownership-based to governance-based. It is about guiding users on how their data can be valuable, traded, and used. Many small companies make good discoveries and have good innovation. They fail, however, to take that to the market because they do not know how to trade their intangible assets. There is no solid foundation of law to guide them in ways that their data and IP rights can benefit them. That is the first step. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is so geographically dispersed in the region and by 2030 will be an attractive place for foreign investors and companies to operate. This makes it an ideal place for data generation, and lots of interactions will happen between companies and end users with all digital platforms. There is a big opportunity for Saudi Arabia to be a bank of data. The competition will be very tough in the future, which is why we are taking steps now, early on. Consistent with the Kingdom's vision 2030 Education e-Solutions is committed to attract international top leading players and mobilize required investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for privatization of the sector? </h4><p>We definitely intend to take the privatization in two stages. Stage one entails issuing management contracts, followed by a concession of 25-30 years. The management contract means the contractor will take over the region or city for three to five years, depending on the complexity of the area. The contractor will evaluate the asset, manage the whole operation, and oversee all the manpower. During this period, the contractor will decide and vocalize the investment requirements so as to ensure the efficiency of the operation. We will provide all of the CAPEX required during this period of time. Once we move from a management contract to a concession, the contractor will take over everything. It will be responsible for the manpower and investing in CAPEX to manage the master plan, with which we will have agreed. The contractor will, therefore, become the supervisor and operator of the water sector. The benefit of having this model comes from the private sector, which has the expertise to run the water sector. It will level the efficiency of the sector and do a better job than what we are doing today. We could do what the private sector is doing, but it might take 20 years to get there, while we expect the private sector to do the same work in half the amount of time. Finally, we will pay the private contractor based on a unit rate according to each cubic meter of water supplied or the waste water being discharged. The other benefit of the private sector is that all the CAPEX can be deferred. We do not need any more funding from the government. The private contractor has to fund all the expansions and upgrades for brown- and greenfield projects.</p><h4>How do you envision balancing between inviting international companies to bid on projects and tendering to local entities? </h4><p>International operators and developers have the know-how and experience. At the same time, it is important that they partner with a local developer because the local developer has the knowledge of the market, connections to necessary organizations, and the understanding of the culture. When they come together, both will form a good bow and arrow to operate, which we see today. Today, international players are in alliances with local developers.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set for the organization in the next three years? </h4><p>Our main objective is to monitor the highest standards for when we hand the operations over to the private sector. We have to leverage the entire efficiency factor, either in terms of the billing coverage, collections, costs, the way we operate, or project execution. If we go without spending enough time on efficiency improvement on everything we do, then the private sector will unquestionably charge additional costs because of these efficiency issues. We seek to minimize or reduce the gap.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the higher education sector in Ras Al Khaimah develop in the near future?</h4><p>If we compare the current education sector here with how it was 10 years ago, we can see vast improvements in terms of how it has developed. There has been rapid progress over the last decade. In the next three years, we have to contribute significantly to research, which is the most critical aspect for a university or any higher education institution. In our case, we have a team of researchers, especially in microbiology- and genetics-related research. Sheikh Saud has a great vision for the education sector. He has been reinforcing the ideology that education has to be of a high standard for all, regardless of nationality. He strongly believes that an education gives students the power to manage themselves and society. Since UAE nationals make up around 18% of the student body, no educational institution can survive without the support of expatriate students. Hence, every university should develop strategies to attract expats for higher education.  This will be possible only when the university offers high quality education supported by world-class infrastructure and other facilities.</p><h4>How do you differ from the universities in the free zones?</h4><p>We have to go through the Ministry of Higher Education for every new program we start. We need the initial accreditation and licensing. We must have adequate infrastructure, facilities, and faculty for each program in order to ensure high quality. The standards set by Ministry of Higher Education affairs are excellent regulations required for higher education. Institutions in the free zone do not have to meet the same regulations for their programs because their parent universities provide the degrees.</p><h4>To what extent are qualified doctors needed in Ras Al Khaimah and the UAE?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, there has been a remarkable improvement in terms of hospitals opening in the UAE; this is necessary considering there is a never-ending demand. However, there is still room for more hospitals. With each new hospital, the need for more doctors naturally emerges. However, the cost of healthcare is still high. It is a challenge for the government and hospital authorities to make healthcare more affordable. The country cannot continue to depend on expatriate doctors. The Ministry of Health seeks to fill new positions with as many national doctors as possible. There is a high demand for psychiatrists at the moment. The Ministry of Health recently opened a psychiatric hospital, which demonstrates that it is paying greater attention to mental health in the UAE. A second area that needs more doctors is cancer treatment. There are not many facilities for oncology. In specialized surgeries, there are many cardiologists as well as high-tech surgeries. For diabetes, patients need not only doctors and surgery, but changes in lifestyles too. There are endocrinologists in the UAE, though they have to motivate their patients to stick to the necessary diets and lifestyle to be healthy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the profile of people investing or buying homes in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>In our case, Al Hamra Village is currently host to 99 different nationalities. One of the trends we see is the growing number of Emirati buyers. That profile has been steadily on the rise, regardless of whether they are purchasing it as a primary home, a weekend home, or a holiday home. We have seen many UAE nationals moving into new areas and making it their primary homes. Young people and young to middle-aged families in particular are more open to living in a community alongside other nationalities. Perceptions and mindsets of the past are changing. The leadership of the Emirate is visionary, modern, and progressive, and that has flowed down to the people. Even in hotels, our weekend occupancy mostly comprises Emiratis. Nonetheless, overall the market is shifting from weekend stays to homestays. It has fallen slightly in the last year because of market conditions. However, when I took over in 2011, we had occupancy rates of around 35-40%, while today occupancy rates are over 70%. There are also many people living here and working in Dubai because they made a lifestyle choice.</p><h4>In what ways is environmental protection working its way into the local construction sector?</h4><p>Environmental protection is becoming more important. The challenge for developers is to incorporate sustainability elements without affecting cost. However, it can be done via small simple measures. For example, we decided to apply for LEED Platinum certification. To reach Platinum status, one needs a waste management system, which is more challenging to achieve and developers will not make any money. At the same time, we wanted to demonstrate our commitment. Whatever we can incorporate into the design, material, or equipment, we endeavor to include. Solar street lights are in fact cheaper than regular streetlights if they are installed right at the beginning. Many consultants are already incorporating such innovations into their new designs. The final product ends up being more sustainable than five years ago, though I cannot definitively say there is a conscious effort to make sure they are more sustainable. Where we will face a great deal of resistance from developers is when it starts to affect their pockets, especially in terms of residential. On commercial buildings and hotels, it is easier to do these things. However, because the residential market is extremely price-driven, it is difficult.</p><h4>How sustainable is the development of the hospitality and retail sectors in Ras Al Khaimah and why?</h4><p>There is a large scope of development in the hospitality sector. Firstly, the Dubai airport, the busiest airport in the world, is only 45 minutes away. There are people who do not want to visit a concrete jungle and want a different experience. Ras Al Khaimah also has the added attention and focus of the tourism authority, which is not only focused on attracting tourists, but also on developing tourism infrastructure so that tourists have more things to do. Our greatest strength is our natural beauty and culture. We have an old town and a market, as well as the beach, desert, and mountains. We can develop enough tourism infrastructure to attract more than just tourists who want to sit on the beach. We want to attract millennials, Middle Eastern tourists, and families. We are building camping destinations and zip lines, and developing the old town so people can wander and see how people lived hundreds of years ago. We are restoring abandoned villages and allowing tourists to come to this part of the world to see how societies lived in this region. There is an undersupply in terms of experiences. We have five malls in Ras Al Khaimah and we are adding one more, though some are doing exceptionally better than others. That has to do with the shopper experience. Once we offer the experiences, shoppers will come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bridging-gaps-through-education]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the difference between educational institutions located within the free zone and those outside?</h4><p>The universities in the free zone have established a branch of an existing foreign institution by obtaining a license and approval. We look at an institution's status in its home country to ensure their quality is ensured by the respective authority. Educational institutions outside of the free zone are federally accredited; they seek accreditation and approval from the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA) from the Ministry of Education in Abu Dhabi. The main differentiator between the two is that setting up a branch is much faster than setting up a fully accredited university. Expats prioritize high-quality education when relocating to a different city or country; our branch campus model was created to cater to this demand. Moreover, companies operating in the free zone provide internships and scholarships to some of the 2,000 students who seek to position RAK as a destination for higher education. </p><h4>What measures are taken to ensure stricter quality control from education providers and what has been the impact?</h4><p>The response we have received from our existing and potential partners has been extremely positive because they trust our authority to take certain measures to certify these institutions. After conducting a year-long comprehensive market research study with international agencies, we have been able to better understand what the higher education landscape looks like, how we can improve it, and how we can attract new institutions. A few years ago, none of these universities were established as a branch; they were all franchise models. We managed to get them onboard to go through the administration process and the branch licensing process. The main idea was to have a local partner remain as an investor or non-academic infrastructure provider—one that will take care of the logistics and requirements and bring the university onboard to ensure quality is of the highest level. Also, we signed a letter of cooperation with different qualification agencies in the UK, Australia, and other countries to ensure that an incoming institution's quality is ensured.</p><h4>What are the main constraints or challenges that arise when trying to attract students to come to Ras Al Khaimah?<br></h4><p>There are no major challenges in attracting students; as a result of being in close proximity to other Emirates, institutions are able to attract students from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah. We already have a large group of graduates from high schools in RAK who are willing to pursue their studies here. It is a student-friendly Emirate; it is cost effective, both in terms of fees and living expenses. The next major step is to diversify the list of programs being offered. We are looking for more universities that have topnotch degrees in engineering, aviation, tourism, hospitality, logistics, and supply chain.</p><h4>How are you benchmarking RAKEZ Academic Zone?<br></h4><p>We are in contact with the Ministry of Education Dubai, the Ministry of Education Abu Dhabi, CAA, Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), Dubai Knowledge Village, Academic City, and Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK). During the initial stages, we benchmarked with the models in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, and we concluded that the Dubai model is the best fit for us. We are in the planning stage of creating a dedicated zone and location to help us attract more students and institutions; the key is to showcase the potential engagement with other stakeholders. In addition, we are planning to meet the zone's need for retail facilities and student accommodation. Perhaps, we can have a mixed-use development that will combine commercial, residential, and educational facilities. Also, we are planning to bring the most required specializations offered by selective universities to expose students to different courses that will enrich their experience.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the growth of the education sector in the region?</h4><p>The global population growth is demanding more from the education sector, and the latter is struggling to accommodate it; there is higher demand than supply. That will have two effects on education. We will see more schools throughout the world, though the quality of education in many areas will fall, especially in countries where demand cannot be matched. For those who are willing to cope with high demand, there is a bright future for education. The number of students who are looking for a place in higher education institutions is growing. We may see stiffer competition due to new universities, as every institution tries to showcase what they have. Today, every university that wants to survive must have modern technology with labs and equipment. They may also offer online teaching and so forth. In the UAE, there are more than 80 academic institutions accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education. There are also many satellite campuses as branches of foreign universities that we should bear in mind when discussing quality. This creates a competitive environment among high quality institutions. The environment of the campus should be appealing since the student will spend four years of their lives there. The size of the university does not mean anything in this case; it is always the quality of the education that counts.</p><h4>What challenges do you face when trying to attract students to Ras Al Khaimah?<br></h4><p>I do not view them as challenges, but as driving forces and motivation. They include the population, which is less than 500,000; of that number, two-thirds are expatriates. We need to be open to the region, not only to the country. The expatriate ratio in Ras Al Khaimah is relatively well reflected in our student mix: about 70% of our students are expats. The UAE is a tolerant and open society, especially when compared to other Arab nations, and often that feeling of comparative security is a draw for many people. Many were betting against the success of this institution, mainly due to the rising costs of living in the Emirate, coupled with the fact that just 10 years ago it was not as developed as it is today. However, we can also attract students from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In our case, the numbers show it can be done since we have grown from 100 students in 2011 to more than 1,000 in seven years. Moreover, faculty recruitment can present a challenge. In order to have a good faculty, we have to offer a competitive salary and benefits. Because we teach in English, the pool for recruitment is the whole world. The only issue then is credentials. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is technology engaged and incorporated into the education system?</h4><p>RAK Academy is fortunate that it is in a position now where a major push can be made to introduce the latest ICT initiatives that are in use in other schools around the world and taking on what the best developments in ICT are. Technology is both taught as a subject in its own right as computer science, which has a programming focus, and IT, which is more focused on ICT applications. Technology also has a place in all subjects as a tool to enrich learning and provide virtual experiences beyond what textbooks can provide. We encourage computer programming, app development, and robotics right down to primary schools. On the horizon is artificial intelligence, which is now coming into our lives and will be a big part of the learning platform in schools.</p><h4>What are the greatest challenges facing the education sector at primary and secondary levels?</h4><p>The development of literacy and numeracy across all levels is a challenge worldwide and the Emirates is no exception, especially for local students. Many of the local students from an early age are cared for by maids whose first language is not Arabic, and they spend a large amount of time on screens from an early age. They come to school with language skills that are below their age level and show poor development of their mother tongue where proficiency is required for acquisition of a second language. In RAK, the task of developing language is made more difficult as many students only get exposure to English at school. We start to develop their language levels right from kindergarten and, by the time they get to secondary school, students should achieve proficiency in the English language. A significant challenge for the community is to develop Arabic as a mother tongue so that local students can fully access and understand their culture and also learn a second language, which in our case is English as students must first be strong in their own mother tongue.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Ras Al Khaimah's education system in comparison to the other Emirates and the GCC region?</h4><p>RAK Academy has more freedom as a school compared to other Emirates. As an educational institution we can operate independently and make our own decisions in terms of day-to-day learning and how we structure our programs. Other Emirates are under the control of their local education authorities, which have a rigid framework of annual inspections that can drive the curriculum. The other Emirates also have their daily operations closely scrutinized and regulated. There is also more space in RAK both at the school level and in the local environment. This makes access easier and also provides many opportunities for students to explore outdoor education. Another advantage for the education system in RAK would be the lower cost environment compared to other Emirates. This not only makes RAK an ideal place to learn but also to live.</p><h4>To what extent is the development of soft skills among Ras Al Khaimah's schools a priority?</h4><p>That is certainly the focus of 21st century schools. Communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem solving are all important soft skills because if students are not engaging in these skills, they are missing out on opportunities available through access to the huge amount of information and data that is accessible through technology. It is through the development of understanding of other cultures, backgrounds, and tolerance that one develops soft skills in young minds. It is part of our guiding statement of global citizenship that tolerance, understanding, and appreciation of other people's backgrounds that may be different from our own and learning from the cultural experience of others is developed. This is a truly important part of international schools in Ras Al Khaimah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your view on the real estate market's outlook in Ras Al Khaimah for 2018?</h4><p>The real estate market in Ras Al Khaimah has experienced continuous growth. Real estate development, especially within the residential and hospitality sectors, has gained traction led by the strong fundamentals of the economy and the government's focus on economic diversification with emphasis on trade, manufacturing, and tourism. We believe this growth will be sustained, especially with Ras Al Khaimah's GDP predicted to grow 4.3%, and the business and tourism sectors recording robust growth. The market is stable and demand outpaces supply.</p><h4>What differentiates this market from the other Emirates?</h4><p>With its focus on offering a new era of luxury, lifestyle, and hospitality services, Ras Al Khaimah also has one of the largest economic zones in the region with more than 13,000 companies that enable investors to have 100% ownership with zero income tax. The Emirate's population increased 3.6% in 2016 over the previous year, and it continues to welcome professionals from across the world. The population is expected to grow 11% in less than five years. Only four hours flying distance away from 31% of the world's population and eight hours from 76% of the global population, Ras Al Khaimah's airline connectivity is served by three international airports: Ras Al Khaimah International Airport, only 25 minutes from the city; the Sharjah International Airport, only 35 minutes away; and Dubai International Airport, only 45 minutes from the city. Ras Al Khaimah also has robust tourism potential with 43km of pristine coastline, golden sandy beaches, natural mangroves, the UAE's tallest mountain offering spectacular views, and a rich cultural heritage. These are strong fundamentals that differentiate the market. Offering a more relaxed environment, Ras Al Khaimah assures an authentic and genuine experience, especially for an active outdoor lifestyle. It is similar to the US, for example, where diverse environments can be found between Washington D.C. and California.</p><h4>In terms of investment, is a bubble developing in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>No, the investment landscape of Ras Al Khaimah is promising and robust and led by strong fundamentals. Demand continues to outpace supply. In terms of residential investment, there are strict guidelines and regulations in place. Ras Al Khaimah's freehold areas offers innumerable benefits to international investors such as zero per cent income and personal tax, 100% foreign ownership, no foreign exchange controls, 100% repatriation of capital and profits, 100% ready infrastructure, 100% availability of utilities services, and residency visa for homeowners.</p><h4>What should Ras Al Khaimah do to position itself as a different Emirate for tourism?</h4><p>We have a clear vision and action plan for our tourism sector, and we do not compete with others. We see the UAE as one nation, and our goal is to build on our strengths. The government has set an ambitious vision to develop the Emirate, and we are on course to achieving the goals. In fact, we are witnessing sustained growth in tourist arrivals, and according to estimates, tourist arrivals are set to grow from almost 1 million this year to over 2.9 million annually by 2025. In the hospitality sector, an additional 15,000 hotel units are required in the next seven years to serve the growth in tourist arrivals, with the sector set to record a growth of 23% per annum. About 7,000 new hotel rooms are set to be added, mostly in the five-star beach resort category, by 2021, with nearly 71% to be delivered on Al Marjan Island. The Emirate's focus is on promoting Ras Al Khaimah as a luxury enriched product, long-haul destination, and with the incentives that are provided for investors, we see strong interest from global markets for inward investment in diverse sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you recommend to improve the perception of 'Made in UAE' products worldwide?</h4><p>Having a strong brand is important, and people associate the 'Made in UAE' label with excellent products and companies. The 'Made in the UAE' label lends credibility to all of the country's manufacturers and strengthens the manufacturing sector as a whole, which can only be a good thing for us. For example, RAK Ceramics was established in 1989 and since has grown to become one of the largest ceramics brands in the world, despite a ceramics industry that was predominantly focused on Italian and Spanish products. In 2016, we launched a new brand identity, which was designed to better reflect who we are and where we are headed. Today, RAK Ceramics has a strong brand, and the 'Made in UAE' label helps boost our brand exposure worldwide.</p><h4>How do you qualify Ras Al Khaimah's competitiveness for foreign investment?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah is of course our headquarters and our most successful plant. Ras Al Khaimah's historical DNA is in manufacturing and industry, and RAK Ceramics has played a key part. By choosing to play to its strengths and focus on manufacturing and industry, Ras Al Khaimah complements the other emirates such as oil-led Abu Dhabi and tourism-led Dubai. As the UAE economy continues to diversify away from oil, manufacturing will play an even more important role, and we are proud to be at the forefront of that. The UAE has great infrastructure. We have some of the best airlines and ports, which enable us to access world markets, and in Ras Al Khaimah the raw materials we import are delivered directly to us from all around the world. Being based in Ras Al Khaimah, we are uniquely positioned to export our products globally with no barriers.</p><h4>How should policy be shaped to further boost exports from the UAE?</h4><p>At RAK Ceramics, we are always looking for ways to boost our exports through better accessibility, delivery time, and reduced transportation costs. As part of the UAE Government's Vision 2021, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has called for a unified industrial strategy. During this shift toward a post-oil era, the industrial sector is set to become one of the country's key contributors to GDP. Continued developments in the UAE's transportation infrastructure gives RAK Ceramics access to high-quality raw materials and new technologies that will enable us to be competitive in our global export markets.</p><h4>How will the level of competition develop in the ceramics industry worldwide?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, the ceramics industry has come a long way. The introduction of digital printing changed the industry dramatically. Historically, carpet and wood were chosen as the main flooring solution, whereas today ceramics is increasingly gaining market share. With the new technologies we have available, RAK Ceramics is able to produce products that are greener, cleaner, and more durable than marble, granite, wood, or cement, thereby reducing the use of granite in residential, commercial, and outdoor developments. Overall, the usage of ceramics per capita has increased, which is great for business, but the industry does not come without its challenges. Increasing competition, rising costs of materials, and ongoing increases in gas prices are challenges we must try to find ways to mitigate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the results so far from the Maritime City free zone?</h4><p>It has been a lengthy process. Currently, RAK Maritime City, as far as land with dedicated berths is concerned, is almost full. We do have another 3.5 million sqm of land for which we have signed MoUs with two entities. One is with Zuari for a fertilizer factory, while the other is with the Federal Electricity and Water Authority (FEWA) for the construction of a 4,200-MW power station. Both projects involve an investment over AED1 billion each. Both projects are in the early stages, though we expect to see the first half of the power station come on stream sometime in 2021 and Zuari to come on stream the same year. We are establishing contacts with China to attract FDI to boost our tenants and restore business partners in that part of the world.</p><h4>How do all ports in Ras Al Khaimah work together?</h4><p>We have asked ourselves the same question a number of times, which is why we have engaged with McKinsey consultants to assist us with a strategic 2030 plan. As a result, there is a strong possibility that our two ports to the south, RAK City Center port and Al Hamra Port, will be repurposed or seeds will be sown to repurpose these ports to be more in line with what is going on around them. Saqr Port is a successful port, and it will continue to be a bulk and container port. RAK Maritime City is a successful free zone and will continue to expand and reclaim land in order to feed that expansion if need be. On the other hand, RAK City Center Port, while still profitable, is not as lucrative as these other two ports. Therefore, we will perhaps look at repurposing it from its current warehousing and offshore vessel services to residential, retail, and so on, similar to developments that are taking place all over the world.</p><h4>What are the main bottlenecks in Ras Al Khaimah's logistics sector?</h4><p>One of the bottlenecks is the fact that we were not bringing containers through the port. That has now changed, and we are doing that as we speak. Apart from that, there are no real bottlenecks as trade was moving in and out through ports in our neighboring Emirates successfully by road. If anything, perhaps rail would have been an advantage. There were plans to have a rail-air deal at one point in order to transport bulk products, especially into Dubai and Abu Dhabi. However, it was shelved for a number of reasons, possibly when there was a cut back on infrastructure projects during the fall in oil prices.</p><h4>How does RAK Ports stand out compared to the other ports in the UAE?<br></h4><p>RAK Ports only competes with the likes of Ajman, Dubai, and other ports within the reach of Ras Al Khaimah when it comes to unitized cargo. We do not compete with the non-bulk because this is the largest bulk port in the Middle East and North Africa. However, in containers we do have competition, which is why we partnered with Hutchinson Ports. We hope to attract the volumes that go to our neighboring ports by being more competitive as far as price is concerned, also by being more efficient and customer focused. Al Hamra Port in the south of the Emirate is predominantly a shipyard, and its main competitor is Al Hamriya Port in Dubai. We carry out small vessel and leisure vessel repairs; however, we do compete with it in terms of ease of doing business, efficiency, and the fact that there is an overspill from it. This port is due to be repurposed as well because it sits within a high-end residential area and hotels. There is a great deal of development going on in that area with regards to tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the efforts of Ras Al Khaimah to diversify its energy mix?</h4><p>Though we use natural gas to generate electricity, we are also developing solar energy and are involved in clean coal projects. A good energy mix is required, and that is why we are also looking at other clean projects such as landfill gas, biogas, and pumped hydro. Due to the fact that the Federal Electricity and Water Authority (FEWA) is a limited organization, bound by its own legacies, there were many openings in unserved areas for organizations like ours to get involved. Thus, we are not competing, but rather complementing the existing efforts to diversify the energy mix. We still need coal and other fossil fuels in the mix, as in the end it is based upon the purchasing power of the consumer. If a consumer wants solar energy but needs to pay 10 times more and the capital investment is too high, it does not make economic sense. Therefore, the right energy mix is between renewable and fossil of around 50/50.</p><h4>To what extent is Ras Al Khaimah ready to supply water and energy to the growing population?</h4><p>In terms of water, Ras Al Khaimah is ready for 100% growth. We are self-sufficient, which is why we supply to Sharjah as well. However, for power we will need to negotiate new gas terms, but it is possible. FEWA has a transmission network, and therefore, it remains an integral part of infrastructure, while we are a complementary option. FEWA has a governmental role and an obligation to support growth, while we are a private enterprise working under government tariffs, so it is a perfect mix and a benefit to consumers. We are growing at 20% YoY, which means that customers are coming to us. We have more than 650 large customers, and FEWA is one of them.</p><h4>To what extent is there room for growth for new private sector power suppliers to invest?</h4><p>If a company wants to set up its own network, it is free to do so, though there are only two networks currently. If a company wants to construct a generation plant and supply power, it can only do so with either FEWA or Utico. We are prepared to give a 10% return on investment. Our business model is unique because companies do not build networks; they build power plants, take a guaranteed offtake, and then go to the bank. We have built a network because we go to every single customer directly, which means our capital outlay is more, though our risk is less as we serve a population of 200,000. Therefore, we go to unserved areas so that as the network grows, the demand footprint will grow correspondingly. Our vision is to serve Ras Al Khaimah and build relationships with neighboring states as well.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for renewable power generation in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The main opportunities lie in landfill gas, biogas, solar, and pumped hydro projects. RAK Waste Management has a hybrid project of around 15-20MW, which is huge because typically with landfill gas a 5MW project is big. It will be a unique project in the Middle East as it will combine waste-to-energy and solar energy generation. In addition, it will use hydroponic waste to clean the solar panels.</p><h4>How can energy saving be encouraged?</h4><p>I would like to transfer the benefits of the clean energy such as solar onto consumers but at the same time put greater responsibility on consumers to be efficient. Currently in the region, with every utility there is a penalty regime where the more one consumes, the more they pay. However, if one consumes less, there are no rewards or benefits. If someone makes an effort to use less water and power, they should be rewarded. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the differentiating aspects of Ras Al Khaimah's maritime sector?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah is an excellent manufacturing-based Emirate. In terms of cargo volume, the market generates upward of 300,000TEUs and is growing. The potential in this regard is huge. In the past, everyone in the market had to use land transportation to bring their cargo to and from Dubai's Jebel Ali Port for export and import; however, we are now working to export and import more cargo from Saqr Port. In order to achieve this, we have to serve the local market better, both in terms of efficiency and cost benefits for customers. Our main objective—and the directive of the Ras Al Khaimah government—is to have the all of the Emirate's cargo handled at its own ports. It is a straightforward goal, and it is the right direction to take for the greater economic development of Ras Al Khaimah. We are highly committed and dedicating significant resources to achieving this goal. Namely, we are investing in our people and equipment. We are also installing Hutchison Ports' very own terminal operation system.</p><h4>To what extent are companies willing to change their port of call from Jebel Ali to Saqr Port?</h4><p>Companies understand the range of benefits of using Ras Al Khaimah's own port and are interested in this alternative. Indeed, within a few short months, we have managed to significantly expand the customer base of the port and are keen to continue this trend going forward. For most shippers, cost is paramount; therefore, our task is to help firms understand the cost savings of moving cargo from Saqr Port. We have already arranged a feeder from Saqr Port to Jebel Ali. Instead of moving thousands of TEU via truck from Jebel Ali, we can now consolidate them and send them by feeder. It is much more economical, and is arguably more environmentally friendly. Considering the restrictions on road usage for heavy trucks, it is also more convenient for all those involved. Shippers can save money and avoid road restrictions. A regular and high-quality feeder connection makes this possible. Previously, there was only one feeder per month, which was highly inadequate. With nine terminals in the region, Hutchison Ports has an extensive network and strong relationships with numerous feeder companies and global carriers. We are pleased that the local government is inclined toward sustainable economic development. With this support, we are bringing people together and directly engaging end-users to ensure we can meet their needs. These users require world-class terminal solutions with a high level of customer service, all at competitive rates. Thus, we have our work cut out for us; however, beyond the end user, there are other stakeholders at the port that we must serve, including shipping lines, the cargo carrying agent, and so on. We must ensure that, if the entire process saves money, every stakeholder benefits. Otherwise, no one would be willing to challenge the status quo.</p><h4>How do you compare logistics between China and Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>With much of the world's manufacturing taking place in China, the country has managed to revolutionize its logistics industry. Since Hutchison Ports was a player in this transformation, we hope to play a similar positive role in the UAE's development. The UAE is a unique market and, with three terminals in the country, we see great potential. Similar to our river terminals in China, each of our UAE terminals is in a unique position to serve the local market in its respective Emirate. In this regard, we are striving to build a better logistics platform for end-users in each distinct market. The situation is similar to that of Shanghai, a city that handles a huge volume of 40 million TEUs, and that of Ningbo, which handles about 26 million TEUs. The market size might be different, though the dynamics are extremely similar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges to further incentivizing Emiratis to become entrepreneurs?</h4><p>The UAE government is enabling youth to become entrepreneurs by facilitating a number of services for startups that incentivize UAE nationals to begin their own SMEs. The challenge is to properly prepare our youth to become critical thinkers, innovators, and entrepreneurs. The SME sector is the driving force behind the UAE economy, and so deserves an exceptional regulatory and business environment conducive to broad and sustainable growth. For entrepreneurs, a robust business plan and relevant market research are required in a business environment such as the UAE, where an open free market and competition are a given for the future. If people are not smart, strong, and sufficiently well prepared, it will be hard for new businesses to enter the market successfully, even with a quality product or service. This is where we can help start-ups. When we build awareness in youth and demonstrate the significance and rewards of operating a business, they begin to believe they can start one of their own. We cannot force people to open a business, but we can explain where the opportunities are and show them the way.</p><h4>How are companies growing from small to medium in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>SMEs account for more than 94% of the companies operating in the UAE. At RAK SME, we provide special services for UAE nationals, such as commercial license fee exemptions, economic and technical consultation, development, and training workshops. We extensively promote the SME sector by participating in various local and international events, and exposing local SMEs to international markets and best practices in order to discover new technologies and opportunities related to innovation. Recently, RAK SME launched a “Government Procurement Program“ initiative in cooperation with local government authorities and departments in Ras Al Khaimah. There are 736 SMEs registered with us, and they are now entering tenders for government procurement. Something else we are doing to encourage people to develop more industrial companies is allowing those who are in that sector to be given support here in RAK SME until they establish themselves. They can remain with us as members and therefore use our facilities. If we find that they succeed and are financially sound, we allocate industrial and commercial plots for them. We have done this for about 50 entrepreneurs so far.</p><h4>How would you assess SMEs' access to finance?</h4><p>Since SMEs constitute over 90% of the market, financial entities should not neglect them. Instead, banks are rethinking their positions and talking about funding SMEs now, without which they will not be able to succeed. In our case, we signed an agreement with RAKBANK to support our members with special financial solutions. Indeed, Emirates Development Bank has been specifically created to support SMEs. From now through 2021, SMEs will have an increasingly important role to play in the UAE's marketplace. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the position in Ras Al Khaimah regarding energy security?</h4><p>When new companies come to Ras Al Khaimah, they appreciate the ease with which they can operate in a business-friendly and low-cost environment. There are some companies that are energy intensive—for some as much as 30% of their operating costs come from energy, so lowering the cost of energy will make Ras Al Khaimah even more attractive as an investment location. We already have a long-term contract with Dolphin Energy, and through this agreement, we have addressed the reliability of supply. We would, of course, also like to have a diversity of gas supply sources, and we are also pursuing that objective. On a separate front, we are also looking at the possibility of building a new liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) importation terminal, potentially establishing a joint venture for its importation. If implemented, the project would bring LPG into Ras Al Khaimah by ship, through an offshore unloading point. There is a good LPG market here in the UAE, and we know that our customers would appreciate LPG options.</p><h4>Have there been any new gas discoveries in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>At present, we have no domestic production from within the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, but historically, we had the Saleh field that produced for many years. Exploration has also stopped over the last few years, as the oil price collapse resulted in companies with Ras Al Khaimah petroleum exploration licenses returning their exploration acreage to the government. Now, apart from one small exploration license operated by Sinochem, the rest of the Emirate is all open acreage.</p><h4>How will RAK Gas find more gas supplies?</h4><p>We recognize the need to rejuvenate exploration endeavors in Ras Al Khaimah, so in 2018 we are preparing for a license round, whereby oil companies are invited to come into Ras Al Khaimah and explore. Companies are welcome to look at all the technical data that we have, including the previous wells, seismic information, and any other data on hydrocarbon prospectivity. We have divided the offshore and the onshore acreage into different blocks, so companies can bid for the right to explore on the blocks. In conjunction with this, we have a new offshore seismic survey; therefore, any interested company will be able to use this new data to explore for oil and gas. We have some historical seismic data, but this new high quality, 3D seismic data is going to make a big difference in identifying prospects with enough confidence to encourage drilling. In order to attract high-quality international oil companies for exploration, we are also putting the right supporting legislation in place. A government body is being set up to administer the oil and gas sector. We are adopting best practices in terms of license-round processes and will have competitive terms for the oil companies entering the market. We will ensure that the share of the oil and gas that the oil companies receive under the exploration and production sharing agreements meets the requirements for a healthy return on their investment, whilst also creating an investment environment that is competitive with other countries. We have an oil and gas processing plant at Khor Khwair in Ras Al Khaimah that is capable of processing 150 million scf of gas per day.  We also have existing offshore and onshore pipeline infrastructure. This is a big plus for oil companies interested in exploring, as our plant can process any oil and gas that is discovered, send the gas to an established market in Ras Al Khaimah, and export the oil to international markets through our oil export terminal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures are being set up through RAKEZ to cut red tape for international investors?</h4><p>We pride ourselves on customer focus and service, transparency, and the lack of red tape. Everything we do is customized for each customer. RAKEZ was established to be a regulator and improve the services of the previous entities we had, which were the RAK Free Trade Zone (RAK FTZ) and RAK Investment Authority (RAKIA). When we merged them under RAKEZ, one of our main objectives was to re-engineer all our processes to be customer-centric, remove bottlenecks and unnecessary transactional activities, and empower our frontline staff who deal with our clients so they can do away with red tape and make decisions on the spot. We also act as one team. It is not only RAKEZ that is eliminating red tape; the other government entities that are our stakeholders and partners follow the same philosophy.</p><h4>How challenging is it to develop the Ras Al Khaimah brand in comparison to other Emirates?</h4><p>Investing in a brand is a long-term strategy, and we have created a strong brand in a short period of time. Ras Al Khaimah has historically been a strong brand for industry and SMEs; however, now it is also known for its value proposition: customization and customer-centricity. At the end of the day, it is how we deliver that brand. The Emirates all complement each other, and we are all focused on the type of industries we can attract, our enablers, and the services we can provide. Some choose to go to Abu Dhabi or Dubai for the amenities and livability of those Emirates. Others choose to go for heavy industry that requires more power demands, which are available in different areas. We know and attract investors and customers that fit within our capability and complement each other. It is not competition but offering the right package for the right investor. Today, investors look at the total package; they not only look at RAKEZ' fees, but also the standard of living. </p><h4>What value proposition does RAKEZ offer?</h4><p>We are moving toward clean energy and focus on industries that have a higher contribution in terms of manpower expenditure. The industry itself is shifting toward automation and robotics, and we offer a value proposition and services to these clusters. One of our main value propositions is the cost-effectiveness of running a business in Ras Al Khaimah, not to mention our high standard of living and seaports, airports, and highway network that are second to none.</p><h4>How do you balance industrial development while increasing economic diversification?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has been strong in the tourism industry and historically strong in logistics due to our ports. We are actually home to the largest bulk port in the Middle East. In addition, we have a great deal of industry that not many people know about. Many of the top manufacturers that supply construction materials are located here. We have over 600 manufacturers from small, medium, and large industries. As part of Vision 2030, we want to enhance the GDP contribution of manufacturing and other industrial sectors. It is our strength, and we should continue to have that strength because of the value proposition and services we give. </p><h4>What role can Ras Al Khaimah play to move the GCC away from oil-based economies?</h4><p>The great thing is that we were never truly reliant on the oil or carbon industry in the first place. We have always had to rely on being innovative and attracting a healthy balance between SMEs and industrialists. We are ready to adapt to the industry that we attract, as they are changing as well. We have to look at targeting different types of evolving industries. Everyone today is talking about Bitcoin and blockchain, for example; therefore, we have to understand the trends in the market and be ready for them two or three years in advance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Ras Al Khaimah differentiate itself from the other Emirates?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has a strong trading heritage and an extraordinary geographical location at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf. It has grown into an industrial and trading hub with strategic access to the UAE's major logistical centers and emerging world markets. Conducting business in the Emirate is extremely safe, secure, and stable. Ras Al Khaimah has earned 'A' ratings from both Fitch and S&amp;P. The economic structure is highly diversified, dynamic, and strong, and Ras Al Khaimah is the most industrialized Emirate of the seven. Manufacturing here contributes more than 26% of the Emirate's industrial GDP. The major factors behind its high level of industrialization include the availability of natural resources, a strong blue and white-collar labor force, and the ease and low cost of doing business, especially when it comes to rent, cost of living, and relatively low wages and salaries. The large industrial base Ras Al Khaimah has managed to create has added significantly to its competitive capabilities, attracting many industrial companies to the Emirate. Several de facto industrial clusters have also emerged here. </p><h4>What are the major key pillars that stand out in Ras Al Khaimah's economic diversification plan?</h4><p>While the manufacturing sector will still be a major source of economic development and diversification, Ras Al Khaimah's economic strategy is still to emphasize the importance of other sectors. For example, tourism is increasingly becoming more important and is expected to be a major source of growth in the medium term. The growth rate of tourists coming to Ras Al Khaimah in 2016 was almost 11%, compared to the global average of 3-4%. In 2015, the growth rate of gross capital formation in the sector was around 34%. The annual nominal growth rate of the sector's value added in the period of 2011-2015 was above 13%. Such positive developments in these sectors will maintain our momentum into the future. In addition to these, construction and real estate will play a larger role. For example, Emaar recently decided to invest extensively in Al Marjan Island. Our goal is to transform Ras Al Khaimah into a regional and international service hub. </p><h4>How will the introduction of VAT affect commerce and investor sentiment?</h4><p>As VAT is a form of consumer tax and not an accelerating tax, the end consumer will completely incur the costs. From a merely accounting perspective, it will not affect the cost and profit of businesses. However, from an economic perspective, the general prices index will increase by 5%, as indicated by IMF experts, and this may cause a temporary slowdown of sales in the short run. However, in the long term, consumers will adjust to the new prices and consumption will return to its previous levels. Registering business for VAT, administering, and accounting for it may lead companies to hire new staff to deal with it. </p><h4>How are entrepreneurship and start-up mentalities being incentivized in the Emirate?</h4><p>The RAK Incubator &amp; Accelerator focuses on innovation and technology, with entrepreneurs welcome to register their entities with RAK DED, and establish local companies, or register with RAK Economic Zones (RAKEZ), and set up a free zone entity. This presents a great opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to tap into mentorship and funding to realize their dreams.</p><h4>How do you plan to improve the ease of doing business in the coming year?</h4><p>At RAK DED, we are relentlessly looking for innovative techniques to improve the ease of conducting business. Perhaps the most prominent achievement in this area has been to reduce the number of days needed to establish a company from 12 in 2013 to eight in 2016. Currently, RAK DED seeks to exert greater effort and work in cooperation with all the related governmental bodies to adopt several initiatives to improve the process of issuing economic licenses in accordance with the World Bank's recommendations and other best practices from around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the efforts of the Ras Al Khaimah's economy to become more diversified?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, Ras Al Khaimah's economy has really boomed. We noticed that Ras Al Khaimah did not experience a significant impact from the financial crisis, so we came back and asked why this was so. We found out that there was no large negative impact on Ras Al Khaimah because we had planned the economy well in terms of the products and factories that we are providing; there were good feasibility studies conducted before companies were created. To attract investors we also created a proper ecosystem in the Emirate, which is why we agreed to create a free zone that provides a platform for any investor to come and open a company and invest in the Emirate through 100% ownership of their investments. RAKEZ was a great platform to draw in investors and also provide input for some of the rules and regulations that match investors' requirements in terms of heavy industry, banking, education, and consultation. We attracted a lot of investors and give them proper foundations. We then noticed there is a great demand for tourism here, which means we need more hotel rooms. We have 5,000 rooms but require 10,000; hence, the Emirate is easing up the regulations to build more hotels</p><h4>How important has diversification been for Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>We have been blessed by our leadership, and the leadership of the country and of each Emirate to have different styles that work in great combination. The leadership has logical targets and respects that everyone wants to compete in the market. We also have Emirates airline, which is bringing us a great deal of traffic with around 20 million tourists coming to the UAE every year. So that kind of support and blessing is there, making long-term investment more attractive and realistic. Ras Al Khaimah even supports other Emirates because growth in other Emirates has a knock-on effect on the UAE as a whole. If they are creating more demand and traffic within the entire UAE, everyone will benefit from that as everyone has different product offerings that are complimentary to each other.</p><h4>To what extent is it more cost effective to set up business in Ras Al Khaimah compared to the other Emirates?</h4><p>There is healthy competition, and every Emirate is trying to create a proper ecosystem for investors. Most investors will look at two things: the cost and the rules and regulations. The government is working to ease all these things to attract investors. We have a proper agreement and prices available; however, we take care of investors on a case-by-case basis. At the end of the day, minimal but proper rules and regulations are critical for attracting and retaining investors.</p><h4>What are the main challenges when seeking investors to the Emirate?</h4><p>Most large investors will look at energy prices, so gas and electricity are a challenge, which is governed by federal laws and applies to everyone. We can offset these issues with good rules and regulations. If you have a cheap energy price, but bad rules and regulations that do not allow you to take your product to market easily, then we would rather charge more but have one formal step to ensure optimization, leaving the investor free to import and export wherever they want. When you look at this kind of offset, then we are in a good situation.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages that Ras Al Khaimah presents?</h4><p>The advantage is the price of land; it is an attractive area as we still have a lot of space compared to other Emirates. Second, rules and regulations are more flexible for businesses and entrepreneurs. We are trying to cater to this entrepreneurial mindset. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is SME lending being encouraged in the UAE?</h4><p>There is a lot of talk about SME lending here at the moment. We ourselves have seen some results through the Mohammed bin Rashid Innovation Fund. We have dispersed one loan through the fund already and are working to increase our cooperation. There is also talk about some kind of SME guarantee scheme being developed. From my experience, these things can work; however, ultimately the most powerful partnership is where the client and bank work directly together on a risk participation basis: the client with their equity, the bank with its funding, and the ensuing interest. That is the most effective model going forward. The risk of any guarantee scheme is that people may not be as committed, since they feel that someone else is going to step in if something goes wrong. The best model is where both the business owner and the bank are committed to the relationship.</p><h4>How do you qualify the level of financial education in the UAE?</h4><p>Historically, this has been an area of weakness. The banks have overstretched borrowers and have not focused on consumer education. In the last three years, there has been a major push by the regulator to get more serious about proper financial education, disclosure, and helping clients understand the implications of the financial decisions they make. There has been an improvement there, but there is still room for growth. The Central Bank has done a tremendous job in terms of setting clear regulatory caps on consumer finance, loan-to-value ratios, and property settlement. In the next couple of years, there will be more progress on personal financial management, whether through digital offerings or some fintech scenarios being developed. People can now access independent reviews before making their own decisions as to which provider to choose. This means that banks have to be competitive, transparent, and disclose the right thing. </p><h4>How are banks in the UAE adopting fintech in order to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>Fintech is the buzzword at the moment, but financial technology has been around since the inception of the ATM. I am seeing more hype than reality in the UAE at this stage. At RAKBANK, we started to use blockchain technology through a company called Ripple to do our transfers and payments to India. For this, we have a strategic partnership with Axis Bank in India. We have an instant money transfer platform called Rakmoney Transfer, and we are planning to have more direct host-to-host links with banks in the Philippines, Pakistan, and Nepal. The problem is that the banks on the other side need to invest in having the same technology that we use, which takes time. Historically, this is an area where banks have not been interested. These particular clients typically earn a low salary and send a high percentage of their income back to their home country. We came up with a cost-effective solution for them that is largely digital. </p><h4>To what extent is there going to be a level of consolidation in the UAE's banking sector?</h4><p>There are too many banks in the UAE. On top of that, the so-called bankable population is 3-4 million people maximum. To have 50 banks serving that population is just not logical. It is just a case of whether at the end of the day the individual shareholders of these organizations feel it is in their interest to consolidate or not. </p><h4>What will be the economic driver for Ras Al Khaimah in 2018?</h4><p>Tourism and real estate will play the most important roles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons for merging RAKIA and RAK FTZ?</h4><p>The UAE is growing at an unprecedented rate. Investors are flocking to this side of the world to set up or expand their businesses and with this, the competition between investment hubs in the country is ever increasing. The reason behind the RAK Free Trade Zone (RAK FTZ) and the RAK Investment Authority's (RAKIA) merger was to revolutionize our investment landscape and support the Emirate's vision of attracting more investments. The move has brought a major impact and created a hub that offers a broader range of business solutions. RAKIA was successful in supporting industrial companies. On the other hand, RAK FTZ was strong in the SME segment. Hence, with the two under the umbrella of Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ), we now have a powerhouse economic zone able to cater to businesses of all sizes. We remain competitive in the market by offering global investors a platform where they can access wide-ranging premium facility options and first-class services that suit their needs. Right now, we are continuously working hard to provide our tenants a more seamless, nurturing, and transparent ecosystem by offering enhanced levels of services. In line with this, we recently launched a new one-stop shop called RAKEZ Service Centre - Al Hamra, which houses our services from A to Z. Government entities are also on-board with us in the same location for easier processing of government-related requirements. </p><h4>What were the challenges in joining forces into a one-stop shop?</h4><p>It is more a question of new investments. As we build a new and more comprehensive one-stop shop, we began to understand that there are areas we can improve by adding new technology and manpower. Hence, we invested a great deal in IT solutions so that our customer service team is able to provide the best support to our clients. We have implemented SAP and salesforce, as well as CRM which helps us communicate better with our customers, enhances our team's productivity, and provides solid analytical data and reporting. </p><h4>How will the Emirate further boost economic diversification?</h4><p>For years, all of our efforts have been toward further boosting the UAE's economic diversification. RAKEZ was established for this very purpose. With the best of the best of RAK FTZ and RAKIA merged into RAKEZ, Ras Al Khaimah's position as an ideal investment destination is even more solid. Right now, we currently have over 13,000 companies from over 100 countries operating in more than 50 sectors, and this number will double a few years down the road. More investors means more sectors will boom resulting to strong economic diversification. We cater to SMEs, entrepreneurs, and industrialists. Our efforts have brought in thousands of SMEs in the Emirate, the backbone of our economy. We nurture them by offering cost-effective facilities such as flexi facilities and offices, as well as easy payment plans to help setting up and running a business more manageable. So, we are aggressive in conducting roadshows in our core markets to approach large companies, and the number-one question of these companies is about the cost of living for their employees, which includes schooling, housing, transportation, and so on. We have proven to them that Ras Al Khaimah is cost effective. </p><h4>How can industries be encouraged to set up in Ras Al Khaimah when the UAE market is not that large?</h4><p>When we go on roadshows and meet with potential investors, we tell them not to do feasibility studies on Ras Al Khaimah or the UAE alone; they have to think of Africa, India, Asia, and Europe as well. For example, Ashok Leyland produces 3,000 buses a year. This is not only for the UAE market; it also exports to the GCC. Another example is Italfood, which exports 90% of its cheese to the GCC. In addition, we have Dabur International, which is a large exporter. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what way has Ras Al Khaimah facilitated its companies' growth into the global marketplace?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah specializes in two sectors: industrial manufacturing and tourism. We have the mountains, desert, and sea, which are not there in the other Emirates. This combination makes it unique among the Emirates, a fact that is accentuated since they are all nearby. In 20 minutes one can go from mountain to desert to sea. With all the facilities and support of the government and new facilities and products from the Chamber, we are attracting many new businesses, while many internationally recognized companies have started a base here. We have exceeded 49% growth in the number of companies registered with the chamber in the last seven years.</p><h4>What is Ras Al Khaimah doing to enhance investor protection?</h4><p>First, we are benchmarking our legislation with international practices in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the UK. In parallel, we are doing the same with the free zones. We have combined them into one, RAKEZ, and are also enhancing our legislation. We have had several meetings regarding taxation implementation for VAT to understand how it will affect companies. </p><h4>Is it difficult to attract FDI in comparison to Abu Dhabi and Dubai?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE and larger than Kuwait, Lebanon, and Bahrain combined. Dubai has a target and been working on itself since 1906, when it was the first Emirate to drop the 10% tax paid to the government for all businesses and land in their creek. This was delivered over the years by the rulers that came to Dubai, as well as His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who had great vision to manage and position Dubai toward competing against other large and well-established cities in the world. Dubai also has different aspects to leverage, such as Emirates Airlines, and its airport was always a hub between the east and the west. However, it was not easy for Dubai to reach where it is today and this challenge is true for any other Emirate, city, or country, unless they focus on one thing and specialize in something. Ras Al Khaimah has stepped up its game since 2010, when His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi took over. This is visible everywhere, such as the developments in the construction of infrastructure and the number of companies that have come in. The challenges are still there and we have many steps to climb to reach where we want to be; however, the tools have become easier and wider for us. It took other cities or countries hundreds of years to reach where they are; however, I am confident it will take us 10 years with our determination, combined effort, and the blessing of the government.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages for growth in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>There are many geographic and natural elements here. We are the first stop when entering the Gulf for shipping lines. For them, going to any other Emirate takes more time and fuel, and they are more expensive than us. Number two, we have most of the elements of infrastructure, including ports and the airport. Finally, we have the natural elements of the mountain, desert, and sea. We are part of the UAE, which is a blessing for growth. If we were independent like Bahrain or Oman, then the challenges would be harder. Many people do not recognize that the Federation of the UAE and the seven Emirates is one of the strongest attractions for any international businessman to have flexibility in legislation. If something does not work in Dubai, one can go to Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, or another Emirate. The UAE has a flexible system; we have around 50 free zones, which provide a huge flexibility in terms of pricing, facilities, legislations, and logistics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights of the new renewables and energy efficiency strategy?</h4><p>We have agreed on a strategy that includes nine programs. The first program is green building regulations and addresses new construction in Ras Al Khaimah to raise the bar for new developments in terms of energy efficiency and adoption of renewable energy. The second is a building retrofit program that addresses existing buildings to make them more efficient and apply renewable energy where beneficial. The government will lead by example and other sectors are expected to follow. There is an energy management program addressing the industrial sector, which comprises 40-45% of the total consumption of Ras Al Khaimah, so that is crucial for us. The industrial sector started working on energy efficiency a long time ago, though there is always potential for improvement. Therefore, we are launching a program to improve best practices of energy management. There will also be a program for efficient home appliances in collaboration with Emirates Authority for Standardization &amp; Metrology (ESMA), which introduces and periodically updates standards for appliances and equipment. The idea is for consumers to be more aware of the energy consumption of their appliances, and encourage the purchase of products with higher energy ratings. We are also working on street lighting, with a program to convert streetlights from conventional bulbs to the more efficient LED, and add dimming and controls where advantageous. We are also working on renewables, and solar is one of the programs in collaboration with Federal Electricity &amp; Water Authority (FEWA). The program will support both on-site solar energy, such as rooftop installations for individual properties, and utility-scale projects. Another area of work is energy from waste, for which RAK Waste Management Agency is evaluating several pilot projects, including landfill gas recovery for electricity generation, alternative fuels, and others. Finally, we are evaluating the activation of an efficient vehicle program, supporting electric and possibly hybrid vehicles. Some of these programs are directly led by our office, while others are driven in partnership with other entities. We are in the process of finalizing our annual targets for each of these programs. Overall, we estimate potential savings of up to 30% by 2040 versus business-as-usual projections as a result of a combination of all the programs. We also envisage potential contribution from renewable energy of up to 25% of total consumption by 2040.</p><h4>How difficult is it for industries to adopt energy efficiency methods and renewable energy?</h4><p>The industrial sector was one of the earliest adopters of energy efficiency measures. Energy is an extremely important component of the total cost for industries such as cement and ceramics. The industries are among the first because they find an immediate and tangible benefit. In Ras Al Khaimah, for example, heat recovery is advanced, and reuse of water is also highly adopted. We want to promote best practices of energy management to ensure everyone conducts a correct energy audit and adopts practices in line with the best global standards, like ISO 50001.</p><h4>How do developers feel about the green building regulation?</h4><p>In terms of impact, the green building regulation is our most important program. Developers in the region are starting to realize the potential commercial value of building sustainable developments. We are willing to support them in this field with awareness systems that will reward those who adopt these building standards. We want to start with a pilot regulation in 2018 applicable to the government sector to start with, and then extend it to the private sector. This will be Phase I, and it will activate the initial market. For Phase II, which will be a few years later, the standards will be supported by a rating system, providing market recognition for developments which exceed minimum standards. In three to five years, we expect to see tangible outcomes from this program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drives economic diversification in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The answer to this question is clear: the long-term vision of successive rulers of the Emirate. That broad vision was in turn shaped by a recognition of the possibilities offered by the Emirate's resource endowment, coupled with a deeply rooted tradition of openness to trade and foreign investment. Continuously implemented for over 50 years, the result of this has been that Ras al Khaimah today has one of the most diversified economies in the GCC.  One key indicator of this is that manufacturing directly contributes about 26% of GDP, while another 10% comes from manufacturing activities in the free zone. As for the actual mechanics of it, the path that has been followed is that the leadership builds a business, develops it to a large scale, and then moves toward partial divestment through a stock market listing. This model has worked well.  </p><h4>How do you expect this diversification process to roll out?</h4><p>The Ruler's Office is in the process of developing a formalized long-term strategy that will bring the key economic, social, and environmental elements together for a harmonized long-term development plan for the Emirate. That plan will identify the principal sectors that need to move forward. Manufacturing will certainly remain a focus area, and there is increasing emphasis on tourism. To grow, we need people and businesses and entrepreneurs to come and invest. Manufacturing has always been the catalyst for growth, and it will continue to be so. In this regard, RAKEZ is now the leading growth engine.  The Emirate is in a strong financial position, with low level of debt and a net asset position. This means there is enough flexibility for free zones to vary prices if they want to compete on price to attract businesses. </p><h4>How much economic diversification can there be while industry is still the main sector?</h4><p>There is a great deal of diversification because the manufacturing sector itself is highly diversified. Among the companies in the free zones, there are firms that produce everything from armored vehicles to chocolates. There are many smaller industries that supply the larger players. As the companies that were set up in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Julphar Pharmaceuticals or RAK Ceramics, became bigger, they attracted small and auxiliary businesses to support their growth.</p><h4>To what extent will industry continue to grow and support other sectors?</h4><p>As I mentioned, the Ruler's Office is working on a long term strategic plan called Vision 2030. This plan has two clear focus areas, which are manufacturing and tourism. Free zones are continuing to attract manufacturing, while tourism is experiencing strong growth as the necessary infrastructure is being put in place and capacity expands. The economic environment in the Emirate is both very stable and attractive for business, and these facts have been repeatedly acknowledged in rating agency reports. One element of this is a USD-pegged currency, which is a credible mechanism for this part of the world. These factors, together with an excellent infrastructure and a supportive legal and policy environment, will continue to be the drivers that attract manufacturing</p><h4>How is the sovereign rating landscape in the GCC, and how does Ras Al Khaimah fit in it?</h4><p>There are certain key elements that shape it. Chief among these was the fall in oil prices two years ago, and the consequent emergence of large fiscal deficits, which led to rising government debt. Indeed, if one looks at the debt trajectories of GCC sovereigns, RAK is the only one where government debt is on a declining trend. Thus, our rating has been stable at 'A' for 10 years now, even as the majority of GCC sovereigns have been downgraded, some of them multiple times.  The diplomatic rift with Qatar has added a new dimension of uncertainty to the region's politics and had a direct impact on RAK's exports. However, the Emirate's strong credit fundamentals withstood this shock as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have relations between the UAE and Panama evolved since you took office in 2014?</h4><p>As soon as I won the election, I decided to establish an embassy here in order to expand our diplomatic footprint. Since then, we sent an ambassador and have exchanged a number of missions. The Dubai Chamber of Commerce came to Panama and wants to open an office there. Additionally, we plan on bringing a business delegation here and have confirmed that Panama will participate in Expo 2020. We are signing different agreements aimed at protecting investment and supporting tourism between our countries. Going forward, the main challenge we face is ensuring that we add value to all of the cargo that comes through the canal. This would not only ensure Panama's position as a shipping and logistics hub, but would also allow firms and countries to maximize their industrial and economic potential. </p><h4>What are the strategic priorities and areas of cooperation between Panama and the UAE moving forward?</h4><p>Trade is a vital component of relations between Panama and Dubai, and can be further leveraged to support both nations. If we are able to establish a direct flight, trade could expand a great deal. Panama and the UAE both represent international success stories: both are global hubs with air connectivity and financial centers that play an important role in the global economy. Each place is also a gateway to their respective regions: the UAE for the Middle East, India, and Africa, and Panama for Central and Latin America, with the canal the most modern and visible symbol of our ability to connect the world and bring people together. Moreover, our airport serves 15 million passengers and has 15,000 employees, which we seek to grow to 30-45,000 in the coming years. In terms of investment, we are trying to invite the UAE's investment fund to bring capital into Panama, invigorating sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and real estate. </p><h4>What are the biggest lessons Panama can learn from the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE is a country that promotes peace, dialog, tolerance, and investment protection. As such, it has a great future ahead. A key area we can learn from is immigration. Changing regulations to drive immigration is vital, including visa requirements, so that we can support expanded tourism. The UAE is a country with a beautiful soul that makes a great effort to ensure that the people who are building it are happy and supported. In Panama, we changed from restricted visas to stamp visas, and I hope that one day we can open the country entirely, doing away with visas. Of course, this takes time. From a business point of view, immigration reform would facilitate a smooth transition for international SMEs looking to enter the country with their expertise. By having nationals from more than 150 countries working together in the Emirates, it sends a very strong message to countries closing their borders and restricting access. You cannot define people by their country of origin, and the UAE is doing an excellent job illustrating this.</p><h4>What would be your message for UAE investors interested in Panama?</h4><p>Panama's FDI has grown by more than USD4.5 billion every year in recent years, coming from Asia, the US, Europe and the Middle East. Thanks to our robust regulatory system, investing in our country is very secure, profitable, and safe. In this sense, we have directed more than USD500 million in the fight against corruption. Panama's USD65-billion GDP has been growing steadily for the past 10 years, averaging 6-7% growth per year. Unemployment is less than 5% and inflation is less than 1%. As proof of our extremely business friendly environment, 150 international companies from every industry and service specialty have moved their headquarters to Panama. Work permits can be granted with nearly same-day service, and the government is constantly trying to introduce and implement the highest technological standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What brand do you seek to create for Ras Al Khaimah, and what are the challenges in creating that brand?</h4><p>In January 2016, we launched a 10-year strategy for tourism in RAK and part of that strategy was its repositioning and rebranding. Through that, we were able to change the misconceptions of RAK as a destination that only catered to people seeking the sun, sand, and the sea; RAK's 64km of uninterrupted pristine beaches, and fantastic resorts make it a great value for money. Notably, the highest mountain in the UAE is situated in RAK, and upon conducting a survey, we found out that only 10% of people were aware of it. The focus and repositioning of Ras Al Khaimah's brand involved a great deal of work on the ground to define the unique selling points of the Emirate: its natural assets, such as the mountains, the desert, sea, and so on. These provide us with a stronger ground to showcase RAK as the future hub of adventure tourism. That involves not only focusing on adventures but also wellness seekers and people who want to connect with culture, heritage, and history.</p><h4>How do you focus on international tourism in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>Four years ago, RAK had about half a million visitors and today, the numbers are close to 1 million. This is a testament of the hard work and efforts we have done to create awareness by giving RAK its own identity. Initially, we were extremely reliant on one or two major operators and three markets, namely Germany, the UK, and Russia. Later, all three markets went in decline due to devaluation of currencies and Brexit.  The diversity that we have worked toward is attracting new markets such as India, Poland, Czech Republic, Scandinavia, and Eastern European countries. RAK is a beach destination that is offering a five-star product at a four-star price point. </p><h4>What role does domestic tourism play?</h4><p>Three years ago, 60% of our business was from the domestic market. The growth in the international market had an impact on the domestic market, though that was a deliberate strategic decision. While a domestic tourist stays for one or two nights on average, an international tourist stays almost six nights. Still, we continue to focus on the domestic market; it is important for us, especially during holidays where Ras Al Khaimah has naturally become a getaway. </p><h4>What are the major investment opportunities for the tourism sector?</h4><p>The growth in visitors in 2018 is close to 20%, compared to 11% in 2017. However, hotel room supply is only growing by 3%. Our demand periods and windows of opportunity are limited. For example, the opportunities for growth now are limited to the summer months or the last two weeks of January because the rest of the year we run at an average of 80-85%. Whilst we have about 5,000 rooms in the pipeline, they are not due to open until 2020 or 2021. When we look at 2025, our target is to reach 3 million visitors, which is why we need another 10,000 rooms to cater to that demand. Besides the hotel business, the longest zip line in the world was built in Ras Al Khaimah by a foreign investor from Costa Rica, and we are now looking at proposals for further adventure activities. Moreover, we are investing in building accommodation that will be the first luxury camp in the mountains with about 36 units. In order to attract further international investors, we have identified seven clusters in Ras Al Khaimah's master plan for tourist attractions.</p><h4>How does MICE tourism fit into the strategy?</h4><p>We are a 95% leisure destination. However, part of our strategy is to grow the business sector through MICE. The Arabian Hotel Investment Conference (AHIC) was one such initiative in the strategy for 2018. Thus far, we have been able to host the German, Austrian, Indian, and British travel associations.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do one-day cases benefit investors?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has been able to make judgments and execute contracts for over 50% of cases in less than one day. This is a quick turnaround; however, the most important aspect of this speed is that there are absolutely no appeals. Every party is satisfied by the judgment. We have an independent law body, which provides investors with confidence in knowing that no one will interfere with the rendered judgments.</p><h4>How does the court system in Ras Al Khaimah defy expectations about law in the Arab world?<br></h4><p>The world is misinformed about the basis of our legal system; it is modeled on the French system in a number of ways. Our new one-day initiatives are partly aimed at creating a new perception about how the law works in the Emirate. The courts are continuously seeking to develop new systems for a more efficient and transparent legal format.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the role of Prime Minister, I have traveled to the Gulf region several times before 2018. However, whenever I come here to the UAE, I feel a special attachment. Nearly 1.2 million non-resident Indians have found a home away from their homes in Dubai and across the UAE. For this, India is extremely grateful to the UAE and Dubai.<br>Dubai and the UAE are unmatched in its use of technology for development. Here the desert sands have been transformed into gold richness, a miracle that has come true. In today's Dubai, there is a vision behind the glory of the tall buildings reaching the sky and behind the imagination of the future. There is also resolution. Behind them are technology, innovation, and enterprise, which is visible in the Museum of Future. This is because the UAE has not only allowed successful experiments in technology to be confined to labs, but in everyday life: what I witnessed in Masdar is a win-win experience.<br>After several decades, India's relations with Gulf countries have become extremely deep, comprehensive, and vibrant. Today, our dynamics with the Gulf countries are not just confined to a buyer-seller relationship, but have become a true partnership. I was in Abu Dhabi and signed several agreements; one of them, the Lower Zakum Concession, is the first-ever investment of an Indian company in the upstream sector in the Middle East. The brighter aspect of the partnership has begun.<br>The Indian community not only sowed the seeds of its dreams along with the dreams of local people, but also with the same commitment by considering this place as its own home. India takes pride in that more than 3 million Indians living in Gulf countries, as they have become partners in the developmental journey of this region.<br>In the UAE, people were surprised when His Highness Crown Prince took the initiative to construct a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi when I came here last time. I would like to express my gratitude to His Highness Crown Prince on behalf of all the 1.25 billion Indians. The construction of a temple is significant also in the form of a bridge of goodwill. We have been raised in a tradition in which a temple and a holy place is an agent of humanity, where a holy place is an agent of harmony. I believe this temple will be unique in terms of architecture, technology, and the message it sends. It will also be an opportunity to make the global community experience the mantra that we have followed to live our lives: the whole world is one family. And because of this, it will also become a medium for acquiring a unique Indian identity. I would like to tell all those who are related to the construction of the temple that the rulers of this place have shown a great deal of respect for India and have given so much respect to India's cultural traditions: it is now our responsibility not to leave any loose ends or commit any mistake.<br></p><p>In a way, a small India resides here. There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented. And that is why one can experience extremely well how rapidly India has been changing and the confidence with which 1.25 billion Indians have been moving ahead to realize their dreams. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the university's main accomplishments in the past decade? </h4><p>When I was appointed rector, I was only 32, so what we have been doing is innovation and renovation. This means making sure that all the administrative procedures are focused on academic excellence, are flexible enough to allow students to get answers in an efficient way, and that all of our collaborators, teachers, and administrative and general staff are always working to better our students and teachers. This is one of the things I have been focused on. But, we have also been working toward new academic programs at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, and we are waiting for a positive answer from the Ministry of Education because we are looking forward to having our first 100% online programs, in accounting, business administration, and economics. We have 15,000 students now and have formal academic programs in Bogotá and Armenia, in the department of Quindí­o, and are now building a new campus in Medellí­n, which we hope to continue to grow.</p><h4>What are competitive advantages make you stand out within the sector?</h4><p>First, we have a long tradition. This university was founded back in 1951. We have been able to continue to be a popular university, so we keep tuition prices very low so that none of our undergraduate programs are more than six-seven monthly minimum wages per semester. Good-quality higher education need not be tremendously expensive. We are competitive in three areas. First, we only charge what we have to charge since we are a non-profit institution. This makes us very competitive. Second, we are flexible. Students get answers to their questions, to their issues, and to their problems quickly. Third, we have a new team of collaborators working toward the creation of new and better academic programs at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In short, we are changing the DNA of a traditional university like ours while still being faithful to our founding principles. We are an expanding university, a Catholic university, a Bolivarian university, and a university of solidarity; in short, a popular university. But we are flexible and that makes us competitive. </p><h4>Does the university work with the public or private sector to help graduates find employment? </h4><p>One of the things we are working toward now is to strengthen the relation between the state, the private sector, and universities. We have a company incubator that we finance and hope our students will think about entrepreneurship programs, what they want to do, and the companies they want to create. From there, we hope to help them get financing and help them properly structure their project. There are many things the state and private sector are not doing properly. It is a path—an innovative path—that is very hard. We have a social and political culture in Colombia that is against failure, and thus, too often, against innovation. To change that is the huge challenge we now face. In fact, the path to innovation with our talent innovation center incubator hopes to give people an alternative. Once they have a job, our employees and the future professionals from this university need to look far into the future in that job to change things and do things in a different way, to innovate and transform the companies they work in. We are doing a good job of getting them there.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve this year? </h4><p>I hope to open at least six or seven new undergraduate program, two new post-graduate programs, and our first three online undergraduate programs, through which we want to reach the entire country. I also hope to make sure we continue this innovative process by hiring a new generation of younger people. Finally, I hope to finish our new campus in Medellí­n. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted you to enter this new business?</h4><p>About two years ago, the government of Colombia started talking about introducing a new cannabis industry. When I saw that Colombia was thinking about becoming a global leader in medical cannabis, the potential was clear. We have an obvious low-cost advantage, optimal climate, large population, and know how to leverage our strengths to cultivate great cannabis. I wanted to know how to replicate this success in the cannabis industry. We recognized that we needed to become the best in the field; therefore, we began researching the market and developing a plan for how to expand. Our idea was to bring our strategy into the Canadian capital markets, because Canada thrives in this. There are now almost 80 companies going public, with a market cap of USD25 billion. We wanted to create a Colombian economy focused on Colombia's domestic market and then expand into Latin America and understand the industry so we could bring a safer form of medicine to the area. In February 2017, we started in Canada and have worked to expand market awareness about our activities. We are working to brand ourselves as a value-added pharmaceutical. </p><h4>What were the biggest challenges you encountered?</h4><p>The challenges have been great and many, and I am sure there are more to come. The greatest, thankfully, were not from the government, which has been supportive of the industry in terms of regulation. The greatest challenge has been changing misconceptions of cannabis. We need to build a company that more closely resembles a pharmaceutical than a cannabis company, and we have been trying to make the business community understand exactly what this business can be. Now, we are working on improving perceptions about these products among physicians. Another challenge has been getting investors excited about bringing capital to a Canadian company focused on bringing medical cannabis to Colombia. We have worked hard to improve perceptions of Colombia's past, and we are making headway.</p><h4>What has been the strategy to attract investors in such a new and unique industry?</h4><p>There are three categories for approaching investors. One is the cannabis market itself, which is growing significantly, and where there is a healthy appetite for investors. Because we are pitching cannabis in Canada, which is already growing significantly, we have a great leg up in terms of attracting investors. The second is the team. Our COO was an executive in supply chain and product development at Merck for 17 years, while our Chief Compliance Officer is the former DEA Chief of Pharmaceutical investigations. We have the best master grower in Colombia and staff fluent in both Spanish and English. The third is the level of market saturation for companies operating in Canada. There are too many companies in a limited market. We, on the other hand, have the right team with the right credentials and are operating in a market with great opportunity.</p><h4>What is your commitment to developing a strong medical business in Colombia?<br></h4><p>We are doing two things in this regard. The first is developing strong relationships with medical associations. This has taken a great deal of time and effort, because doctors are extremely concerned about the safety of their patients. We develop these relationships by highlighting the quality of our team and experience. In fact, we had a conference during which we brought together 400 physicians to begin educating them about the benefits of medical cannabis, which serves the purposes of the industry and doctors. By being the first company to engage with the medical community in this way, it allows us to become a leading brand and opens the way for other firms. Our second approach has been to form the first cannabis guild, the president of which is a respected executive. We cannot build a successful business on an empty street: we need a thriving community of companies to develop a new industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Cruz Verde's major developments since starting operations?</h4><p>Cruz Verde began operations in Colombia in 2012 after spotting an opportunity to buy Farmasanitas. Since then, we have undertaken an important journey to transform the company. So far the biggest issue we have overcome is understanding the Colombian market and consumer, local and regional differences, and the country in general. Another important element throughout our journey here has been to develop a logistics scheme that delivers a level of service that is in line with company standards. Cruz Verde operates four business lines in Colombia, and it has been a difficult challenge to develop each line in different sectors while consolidating as a company in all the segments we serve. One of our business lines is traditional retail, and over time we have grown that line to the point that we are delivering medicines to health insurers, supplying clinics and hospitals through our wholesale distribution, and operating in-hospital pharmacies to meet clinics' needs. Overall, we are satisfied with the development and growth prospects present in the market. The company has come a long way in positioning the brand in a way that has earned it immense recognition. Our aim is to establish Cruz Verde's recognition as a reliable company that strives to contribute to improving people's quality of life.</p><h4>What was the most successful line of business in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, the company experienced some great achievements on the back of significant growth in sales as we managed to expand our footprint and coverage in nationwide stores. In addition, we have developed several innovation projects aimed at maintaining our high service standards. Some of the innovation projects we have developed point the company toward services that go hand in hand with investments in technological infrastructure, helping us develop each of our business lines. Furthermore, we were able to complete the remodeling of our distribution center—one that covers the entire country and helps us further strengthen our business lines. In terms of turnover and growth, 2017 was an excellent year. With a growth rate of 17%, our turnover almost reached USD480 million. </p><h4>What characteristics differentiate you from your competitors?</h4><p>Cruz Verde contributes to and helps develop the health sector by introducing high standards of performance, formalizing the market, updating practices, and raising industry standards. We want to be a key player in the Colombian market. Despite the presence of other international actors, we believe in our ability to lead the Colombian market.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the “dispensación" service you offer?</h4><p>Apart from traditional retail, our dispensation service delivers medicines to affiliates and insurers of health coverage plans that fall under the social security system through our drugstores. </p><h4>How are you planning to develop your regional strategy?<br></h4><p>We have a vision of leading the region in the health sector. Cruz Verde's parent company, Socofar, has an alliance with Femsa, a Mexican multinational company, and a Chilean shareholder that focuses on a regional project that aims to establish us as a market leader across the entire region. Through our standard of service, expertise, and understanding of the differences between various regional markets, we will position ourselves as a group that contributes to the health sector and aims to have a social impact. </p><h4>What goals do you want to achieve in 2018?</h4><p>We want to maintain our pace of growth and will continue investing in innovation projects focused on improving service. Modern consumers are highly demanding, and modern technology pushes us to develop a business model where the digital component and technology are key. In general terms, the company's goal is to continue with the consolidation and positioning process and build a company that is recognized and valued across Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your operations in the past year?</h4><p>In 2017, we went deeper into our strategy regarding the general population. Our plan consists of following every user individually beyond their specific epidemic profile to understand each person and the relations they have with their social and health environments. We will then integrate each individual identified as pertaining to a risk group. To execute effective and comprehensive interventions, we must always remember what benefits society. All this is done within the legal framework of the intervention models established by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. </p><h4>What is your strategy to maintain high levels of satisfaction?</h4><p>In the subsidized regime, our public health insurance (EPS) ranks first in reputation. Indeed, this is a marker of what we do for the community and a reflection of our productivity. It demonstrates that our health indicators are solid and that we are financially sustainable in the sector and community. Half of our mission is to make the general population more productive. If the sector considers the wellbeing of our population as we do, our society will prosper. </p><h4>Colombia spends about USD20 billion on healthcare per year. How would you evaluate the current system and EPS network?</h4><p>The system must and will be sustainable. The dilemma lies in deciding whether the money is sufficient. We have to analyze in depth past movements of capital and prospects for the future. There are clear success factors, such as the models used against health stress tests, but we must also ask ourselves how to make smart purchases of services and how to make the value chain of insurers more technically competent. Each time we disperse funding, we must also determine whether we are making a financial or a health-related decision. We also need to coordinate and get providers to think as insurers, and vice versa. If we can do this, we can succeed.</p><h4>What CSR initiatives has Coosalud been participating in recent months?</h4><p>For us, social responsibility has to do with being environmentally and financially sustainable, being responsible with our collaborators, and having the financial capacity to provide the best services. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on your project of digitalization?</h4><p>We want to provide most of our services within a patient's home, where they are much more likely to recover, and where they have a much better chance of preventing the illness in the first place. Thus we want to monitor patients from their homes and are seeking strategies to make this technology accessible to any user, regardless of their socioeconomic status.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We aim to create a comprehensive model of care with an individualized follow-up focused on at-risk patients without ignoring the legal basis of equity. This means we will also intervene with healthy people by suggesting preventative methods. We will have an accessibility strategy to provide services that go beyond the presence of users in special attention sites, though that will have the capacity to move freely between the different areas where we offer those services. We will complete this strategy by digitalizing our information systems to help us make better decisions and deliver statistics, building a company with greater financial solvency.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?<br></h4><p>We will grow. We are a subsidized company and work with the disadvantaged of Colombia; however, our ability to act has led us to think about entering a higher demographic of net contributors. This would improve our finances and let us invest more in the poor, which is after all our target audience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your current situation? </h4><p><strong>JUAN CARLOS ECHANDí­A BAUTISTA </strong>From a growth perspective, there has been a great deal of work and excellence provided in terms of caring for our users that has contributed to significant growth in our medical centers and hospitals, as well as our general operations. We are optimistic in undertaking our 2018-2020 strategic plan. And we are pleased to see our accomplishments and see how we have excelled due to the hard work of our team of professionals. Political uncertainty regarding the upcoming presidential election and the country's economical results are a major concern, of course, as they may directly impact the health sector. </p><p><strong>IGNACIO CORREA SEBASTIÁN</strong> Our recent evolution has been positive, as we started a strategic plan two years ago and have accomplished the figures and indicators for 2016 and 2017. Projects have been moving smoothly, and people are very positive about developments slated to occur between 2018 and 2020. Our Health Promotion Agency (HPA) offers the best health quality, and we are always at the top of the rankings. In addition, we are not the only ones to provide prepaid medicine in the market, even when it is small; HPA always provides the best customer service for our patients. There are prepaid medicine products that are cheaper than ours, but it is not only about the price—it is also about customer satisfaction. A report in 2016 said that 34% of prepaid medicine customers are Colsanitas, followed by Comeva, Colmedica, and SURA Insurance.</p><h4>What are some of your strategies for expansion? </h4><p><strong>JCEB</strong> We have changed the brand of our holding company, Organizacion Sanitas International, since in recent years we have invested in different countries, initially in South America but also in the US, Mexico, and Asia. Since we wanted a global brand that could be used globally, without restrictions, after a decision-making process of over a year we decided on the brand Keralty. Keralty is made-up by the word KARE (care), which represents care, health, and wellbeing, and by ALT for altitude, excellence, and high quality standards. Colsanitas, which has been operating for more than 40 years in Colombia, will remain the same. Throughout our portfolio, Colombia represents around 70% of total operations. That said, there has been significant growth driven by the US, and Mexico will play an important role in the coming years. We also expect improvements in terms of global participation from other countries we operate in, such as Brazil and Peru. Our objective is to be in 12 countries in the next few years, all the while expanding our growth within individual US states. </p><p><strong>ICS</strong> Our business is doing well and creates many benefits for our customers, bringing many of them measurable health breakthroughs. We have a portfolio crossing that we applied to the dentistry industry through a prepaid program that has thus far had about 50,000 consumers and been a huge success, even becoming our leading market program. Regarding prepaid service coverage, customers have a sophisticated service in the laboratory, consultations, diagnostics, ultrasounds, and elsewhere. However, in terms of the coverage, the regulations can often be difficult, especially when there is a new change in the system. Altogether the legal regulations have become more demanding for coverage. We are also investing large sums of money into our virtual payment system and changing the insurance business in terms of DTS and prepaid. Both options have a similar functionality when customers use the service. We are competing within channels that have no presence with users, such as apps, website, and online offices. On our app, users have the option to see their medical directory and then make their appointments online, looking at doctors' information. In 2018, we want to have an integrated system that includes apps, online offices, and a website, giving customers maximum choice. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Beyond Bogotá]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[beyond-bogota]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2017 marked the 35th anniversary of the inception of Cano Jiménez. How have your operations developed in the last few years?</h4><p>This organization has three lines of business and each line has its own management team. Our holding company is Cano Jiménez Estudios, which was founded 35 years ago, and in the last two years we have been focused on engineering design and consulting. We have been supporting the 4G programs of the national government. We have also been working on designs for the construction of highways and doing proposals for PPPs. These proposals are focused on different types of construction projects that we evaluated; thus far, this has been our focus in the last two years. In the past, we lost the bid with two of our partners from Spain for the metro in Bogotá. Our proposal was for an underground metro, and the mayor changed the project to an aboveground metro system because the budget was not big enough. Therefore, we started our second proposal for an over-ground metro system, which is less expensive than the underground system originally proposed. We hope to meet the mayor's expectations so that we can start work on these important projects for the city. In terms of construction and infrastructure, we are working on extensions for the water and sewage systems. This plan is being developed in a way that minimizes disruptions for citizens. Currently, we have been developing these conversations with EPM in Medellí­n and Acueducto in Bogotá. Regarding real estate, we are developing homes for the upper class; Oceisa does our real state work while Promobily has been our promoter of real estate projects. We have been providing solutions to our customers for a better quality of life. We are implementing a new roof garden design, including community spaces for eating, playing, exercise, gatherings, city views, and more. In the last two years, sales have fallen slightly; however, this green proposal has resulted in great sales figures. For 2018, we have three large, new projects coming and we are currently completing 165 apartments in a project called Botanika Telus in Bogotá.</p><h4>Do you plan to enter into a new market?</h4><p>In auditing and design, we want to be in Costa Rica, Panama, and Peru. In construction and infrastructure, we are working on proposals for Panama and are exploring a new business in Peru. Our main customers are in Bogotá; our designers and construction company have a full national market. Some have international businesses as well. In terms of our auditing business, we will start some projects with Peruvian companies in Cajamarca considering that the area has great problems because of excessive rain.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the construction sector in 2018?</h4><p>We are waiting for the Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial (POT), which is the guide that will help us understand how the city will be developed. With this plan, the demands on the industry will grow. Currently, we see great results with the upper-middle class; however, thus far, our goal has only been the upper class.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, we will continue to participate in our design and audit market considering that our market will be slightly restricted because of the 4G programs. We want to increase our international presence, especially in Peru and Panama. We will continue to work on the local business, though our main goal is international business. Regarding sanitation services and extensions for water and sewage, we expect to see an increase in our demand. Regarding real estate, we will launch a project for upper and upper-middle classes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[it-has-never-been-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main markets?</h4><p>We export mainly to Europe—the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain—but we are beginning to export to the US. We recently exported our first container there from Colombia. Our packing house is located in Pereira and our farms, measuring 1,500ha in total, are located in Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, and Valle del Cauca.</p><h4>Cartama signed an agreement with Mission Produce. What opportunities will this bring to the group?</h4><p>Mission Produce in the US is the largest marketer and grower of Hass avocados in the world. Cartama signed a joint venture with Mission in July to grow Hass avocados in Colombia—over 1,000ha—and also source from third-party growers. This new company, called CoPaltas, will give Mission the opportunity to source avocados out of Colombia throughout the year. For Cartama, this will provide an opportunity to gain access to the US and Asian markets.</p><h4>How do you foresee the Colombian avocado market evolving?</h4><p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, Colombia is the third-largest producer of avocados globally, if we include green skins and Hass. Colombia has many advantages in terms of climate and logistics. We can produce all-year round and have well-distributed rainfall throughout the year, as well as volcanic soils. We can also grow Hass avocados 1,600-2,600m above sea level. In terms of logistics, we have ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, which gives us the ability to rapidly ship our produce—three days to the east coast of the US, 11 days to Portsmouth, UK, and 12 days to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In comparison, Chile and Peru take 25 days to ship to Rotterdam and have to cross the Panama Canal. Undoubtedly, Colombia will become one of the largest producers of Hass avocados in the world and will be recognized not only for its coffee and flowers but also Hass avocados. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to adjust to recent economic changes?</h4><p>We have a business model that focuses firstly on creating a better future for our employees, since they are the only competitive advantage we have. Second, we focus on creating value for our customers because Cemex can only succeed when our customers do. If we are able to create value for our employees and customers, by default we will create value for our shareholders and the communities where we operate. To translate that into our day-to-day operations, the safety of our employees is our number-one responsibility. We have a rigorous system to ensure that we create a safer environment for them and reduce the number of operational accidents by more than 50%. There is nothing more important than our people, and we are proud that Colombia is ranked number two in the global Cemex system for having the most committed employees.</p><h4>What is the composition of your customer portfolio?</h4><p>We serve close to 3,000 customers on a daily basis and make close to 2,000 deliveries a day either directly to job sites or distribution businesses requesting small quantities of cement. Therefore, we have a wide variety of customers. We split our customers into four major segments. In our distribution segment, we sell both cement and business strategies to small entrepreneurs, helping them run their business more efficiently. That is one of the most important and relevant segments. The other is the construction segment, which mostly consumes ready-mix concrete or cement and serves the whole Colombian market. The third is the industrial segment, whose customers purchase ready-mix concrete, pre-cast products, or blocks. For these customers, we sell a whole package and a unique solution. The fourth is the infrastructure segment, the 3,000 customers we serve on a daily basis.</p><h4>How was the recent launch of your online platform?</h4><p>That is one of the important efforts that the company is launching globally. Cemex has decided to bet on digitizing the company and industry. We just launched Cemex Go in Colombia, which is only the third country after Mexico and the US. We are happy to say that customer adoption is promising. The industry is going through a deep transformation, but construction has been late in adopting certain technologies.</p><h4>How would evaluate your corporate social responsibility efforts?</h4><p>We have a set of programs related to the environment and are concerned with reducing our carbon footprint in the production process. Our largest cement plant, Caracolito, sells 25% of all the industry's cement, and 20% of its fuel now comes from alternative sources, while 50% of our energy consumption comes from renewables. We have other programs and believe in the peace process the government launched. There is no better way to do so than provide job opportunities for ex-combatants.</p><h4>What targets and goals are you setting for Cemex Colombia?</h4><p>2018 will be a transitional year for the sector. In 2016 and 2017, the cement industry had negative demand and the first quarter of 2018 has proven still to be challenging. However, there will be more clarity, and consumer confidence will continue to improve, which will trigger more investment in this market. The foundations are strong, but the country has tremendous infrastructure and housing needs; therefore, it truly is the type of country we like to operate in. Megacities such as Bogotá will continue to have increasing infrastructure and housing needs, and there is a massive program to renew its transport, infrastructure, and housing. Colombia will be a protagonist in the Cemex portfolio, so we will continue investing in our people and the assets we have here to ensure we ride this wave. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[only-as-strong-as-your-weakest-link]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some recent challenges and accomplishments?</h4><p>In 2015, we were in the middle of completing an acquisition and today are one company in Colombia. In the last few years, we have worked a lot on our culture because a global, northern European company buying a regional Latin American one can often result in an initial culture clash. So we have worked hard to ensure that people feel at home and are motivated. The second has been maintaining and reinforcing our relationship with our most important stakeholders, the farmers. Yara is a company that mainly works with fertilizers, and we know that the relationship with the end user is key to our success; therefore, assuring the user that their business is improving is important. The fact that customer satisfaction is so closely linked to both growth and company value means that we spend quite a lot of time on that dimension. </p><h4>How has your commitment to the sector changed since the peace deal?</h4><p>One of the causes of the conflict was the difference between urban and rural areas. People in rural areas felt they had been left behind, and our end users are all in rural areas. We see ourselves as an important partner in the post-conflict period because Colombia still has an enormous amount of small farmers. Since they seek for support as they improve themselves, this is where Yara is different from other companies in our sector. We have agronomists and sales people on the ground; we are not just a producer or importer, but work closely to establish a measure and follow up on the relationship with end users with a view to help them to improve quality and productivity. </p><h4>What is the role of Yara in helping farmers understand the use of new technologies?  </h4><p>Colombia is well known for its coffee crop, and there are 550,000 coffee farmers; socially it is an important product. There are different stages of development for each crop, and we show the farmer simple information sheets that showcase the different growth stages and what products they can use to feed the crops properly. We make it visible and simple to use. Then, we have our sales team on the ground working with associations. When we talk to a farmer that may have a lower level of education or income, they are often wary of people simply looking to make another sale, which is why we often use field trials to demonstrate what our solutions can do compared to traditional ones. </p><h4>What initiatives are you pushing to promote a more sustainable agri-business?</h4><p>The most important area of improvement for the Colombian agriculture sector is productivity. The problem with low productivity is not only lower incomes, but also inefficient use of land. This is why we work to protect forests, protected areas, and national parks, and have a number of sustainable development goals such as zero hunger, no poverty, and more profitable farmers. Zero hunger means producing more food close to where consumers are. This leads to lower emissions, especially considering that the agricultural sector emits a fair amount. </p><h4>What must the new administration do to improve and incentivize the agriculture business? </h4><p>One of the key areas for us is land ownership. Farmers must know they have a title to the land they till and that no one will come tomorrow and claim it back. Otherwise, they will not invest in it. The profitability and quality of life of farmers is another key area, not to mention the country's overall commitment to the peace process. Depending on the new government the peace process can go in different directions. The private sector is an important partner in this. If farmers are stronger, then we are stronger as a company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have FCC's operations in Colombia progressed in the past year?</h4><p>Regarding the Toyo tunnel in Antioquia, we have completed all the construction designs and have received the environmental licensing in December 2017. The Salitre wastewater treatment plant project, meanwhile, is funded by the World Bank, and we are working on the design and construction plans now. We are working on the foundation of the plant and the design phase, which we will finish in September. While we work on the design phase, we are also preparing for construction. For this project, we have a five-year contract, with one year projected for design. Currently, we are about three and a half years into building, and then it will be another six months of development. In Colombia, we are selective with our projects and try to choose ones that we can better contribute our time and resources. We have a few projects that we are working on right now, though these are symbolic and large projects. We are interested in the recovery project for the navigability of the Magdalena River, the subway project in Bogotá, and the Canoas wastewater plant, which will be twice as large as the Salitre plant.</p><h4>FCC has extensive expertise in metro projects around the world. What role will FCC play in the construction of Metro de Bogotá?</h4><p>Bogotá has two significant problems: mobility and water treatment. Not addressing water treatment would be a problem. 75% of wastewater is disposed of directly into the river without any form of treatment. Regarding mobility in Bogotá, it is essential to have a massive transport system to help regulate the rest of the modalities that exist in the city. Having an overland subway in Bogotá could have an impact and would be similar to the TransMilenio concept. In this regard, we hired a team that is doing studies and designs. City Hall and the subway company of Bogotá will launch the tender before May 2018; 70% of this project is financed through national resources and 30% through local resources. The analysis of the presentation of offers will be seen in the second half of 2018, and the allocation will be decided at the end of 2018 or start of 2019.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand?</h4><p>We are executing projects in Canada, the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. We are interested in Uruguay and perhaps Paraguay, though we are still analyzing the cases. Any activity in the company involves many resources. Profitability must be constant since it is the only way to make a business sustainable.</p><h4>What legal change would you like to have in your industry?</h4><p>I would like to have a reduction of the tax burden; Colombia has one of the highest tax burdens compared to other countries, and it hurts the economy and its competitiveness.</p><h4>What are the main benefits and challenges of doing business in Colombia?</h4><p>What we like about doing business in Colombia is that it has great needs, which we can address and create a large impact on. We like to focus our projects in Colombia better than in other countries because we can help enhance its development. We see great opportunities in Colombia, such as working on water treatment facilities, improving drinking water, and purifying sewage; helping communities and being a strong part of the community is exciting for us. In terms of challenges, as we are a foreign company, we would like to be recognized as a national company to help them better see us as contributors to development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-roads-lead-to-invias]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments, accomplishments, and challenges of INVIAS since its establishment?</h4><p>We are under the guiding axis of the Ministry of Transport, which has attached entities such as the National Institute of Roads, the National Infrastructure Agency, Civil Aeronautics with Magdalena, and the Superintendence of Products and Transport, and it recently created the National Road Safety Agency. INVIAS is responsible for everything to do with nationwide roads whose operation does not depend on the private sector. The Colombian national road network is approximately 18,000km, of which we administer around 9,000km, almost 50%. We develop infrastructure through public resources called nation. Only 10% of our resources come from our own rent. We collect this money via road tolls, taxes in ports, and a port counter-provision. We use this port resource specifically to guarantee the navigability and access to the ports. During the administration of President Santos, we made an investment of COP26.5 billion, with which we built 250 bridges over a period of seven years. We did the maintenance and rehabilitation of 4,800km of the roads under our charge and built 31km of tunnels. Additionally, we paved around 982km of national roads. Of the 9,000km under our charge, 2,500km are unpaved. The last program created was called the Program of Roads for Equity, which has a cost of USD1.3 billion and carries out road infrastructure works in practically all departments of the country. In Magdalena, there are approximately 16 bridges, and some of the 11 we are building will replace older or obsolete bridges.</p><h4>What is your strategy to become a leader in the sector, and how does it involve decentralization?</h4><p>Under the current government, and in conjunction with the Ministry of Transport and the entities of the sector, we managed to create a master plan of intermodal transport for the whole country, with a planned realization in 2035. The competitiveness indices of the country in relation to other countries are low due to the logistical and transportation costs. Within the master transport plan, INVIAS will leave to the next government structured projects to be executed all over the country. INVIAS is a decentralized agency, as we have territorial branches. Colombia has 32 departments, and we have 26 territories throughout the country. This strength allows us to interact in regions with governors and mayors. We have a document that will allow the next government to continue making investments in infrastructure.</p><h4>What can be done to improve the infrastructure sector in Colombia, and what are the opportunities in 2018 in this regard?</h4><p>The agreement with FARC allows many areas of the country to become more competitive and generate more space for Colombian industries, which includes tourism and agriculture. The institute wishes to develop projects in the south and east of the country that were affected by the armed conflict. We have carried out low-profile works in those areas, but now the improvement is impressive and people are noticing the projects. Previously, few people came to these areas because they did not want to run into conflict; however, now the number of vehicles traveling through is enormous. The institute is committed to working in the regions because our mission is not only to serve the national road network, but also to support the government in the secondary network and the municipalities in the tertiary network. The primary national network consists of 18,000km, the secondary network has 44,000km, and the tertiary network has 150,000km. Support for investment in the tertiary network is important because it links the production areas with the consumption zones. There are several important projects that still do not have financing, but within the projects of concession, there is the private initiative. Colombia is attractive for foreign companies from Spain, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Chile. Some are branches of European and even Chinese companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do 50 years of operations mean for the company?</h4><p>Over the last 50 years, HeH has successfully completed a significant number of projects achieving contractual compliance, reaching the utmost technical standards, improving workers' quality of life, and creating a positive impact on communities, cities, and countries. We work on road infrastructure such as freeways, tunnels, and bridges, as well as sanitation, potable water, sewage, ports, airports, irrigation systems, and waste collection. HeH works in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Honduras, Panama, Bolivia, and El Salvador. Working for 50 years has created a highly experienced team to carry out these diverse projects. HeH has contributed to productivity and growth in Colombia since 2011, when we started working in the country. </p><h4>What were the major accomplishments of the company in 2017?</h4><p>We worked on five projects of Ví­as para la Equidad by INVIAS that take place in marginalized areas of Colombia such as Chocó, Caquetá, and Arauca. In these areas, the disparities in infrastructure are evident. This is one of the biggest challenges in Colombia; there is much to do in the infrastructure sector. These gaps are also great opportunities to continue working and improving the country. We have a 4G project involving a 30-year concession in Popayán-Santander de Quilichao. This project is currently in the pre-construction stage, and in the next year the construction of four lanes will commence. The project is located in the southern zone, which is necessary for the productive sector and the connection with Ecuador.</p><h4>How did you come to develop these important projects in these areas?</h4><p>We seek closeness with the communities that we work with. We require employees from the beneficiary communities to work on our projects and establish close collaborations with the people of those communities. Our work is characterized by our efficacy to fulfill contracts, compliance with high-quality standards and proper cost records, good performance achievements on time, and social responsibility. </p><h4>What new opportunities do you seek in 2018?</h4><p>We hope that 2018 brings larger actions than 2017. All countries have cycles; we cannot lose hope and must move forward. We were fortunate to win the project of waste collection in Bogotá in January for an eight-year concession. Although electoral processes create some uncertainty, institutions in Colombia are strong; therefore, we expect the new government will hit the ground running and foster new investment opportunities. In Colombia, there is much to be done, and the human capital of this country will take things forward. We must work with the next leaders to do what is necessary, and do it well. We will continue to comply with contracts, be technically competent, maintain occupational health and safety, pay taxes, and focus on environmental preservation and social responsibility standards. HeH provides the best quality construction, maintenance, and infrastructure management services. Our commitment to excellence will open more opportunities in the future</p><h4>How do you ensure sustainability within the communities surrounding your projects?</h4><p>Each country has different laws regarding prior consultations with the communities. Beyond complying with all legal requirements, we must build an authentic relationship with the community. For example, in Peru, we have three important 30-year road concessions and an amazon port in the Huallaga river. We provided help to organized microenterprises and they hired graduates from the communities to provide maintenance. We offer protective equipment and training. These actions generate a long-term relationship. In Colombia, we work in conflict zones, and contributing to the peace building process is important to us. Additionally, the environmental issue is key, and everyone must participate. We work in the waste sector in Colombia; if we do not take personal responsibility we could destroy the environment. We need to generate more recycling and greater goals to reduce waste production and develop sanitation and water treatment projects.  We guarantee our constructive commitment to support competitiveness, integration, and sustainable development in the countries we operate in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Metro Culture]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[metro-culture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Metro of Medellí­n evolved since it started operations 23 years ago?</h4><p>In 2018, we will be celebrating 30 years of a concept that our users have declared "metro culture," which is seven years older than the system. During construction of the metro, we saw the need to deploy a communication strategy along with some local partners in order to regain the trust and credibility from the community. At that time, the project had become complicated in its final stage because the city seemed to be in a post-war state, with open trenches, lots of construction in the city center, closed roads, and general chaos, that people feared the project would become a white elephant. Thus, 30 years ago, we began a credibility recovery campaign in the mass transport system. Later, this became the corporate DNA of the company and resulted in credibility and respect for the company and for the services rendered. This is one of the greatest achievements of the company, having generated a successful dynamic with its stakeholders that is not limited only to users. It is a relationship model including owners, who are local and regional governments; suppliers; employees; and the broader community.</p><h4>Do you have any plans for future projects?</h4><p>Something that is important for a company such as ours is long-term planning, but this is difficult to achieve for companies that have to respond to the political dynamics of their owners. They are companies that depend on municipalities and town halls, on the political cycles of elections that occur in those areas. Long-term planning is fundamental because the construction of transport networks requires large capital and time for its execution. We took on the task in 2004 of making a master plan, a plan that had not only reposition, but had in mind the coherent growth that would respond to the plans of territorial ordering, regional plans, population growth, and reorganization of the territory. Transport corridor plans have to respond to these factors. There are 19 transport corridors, all with different characteristics, so the different governors have to review their local government plans within those transport lines and register a specific transport line on their government plans. So far, the impact that transportation has on social equality here in Medellí­n has been great, allowing the population to move to service and work centers.</p><h4>What new lines of business have boosted real estate, commercial projects, infrastructure for advertising, and telecommunications systems?</h4><p>Urban mass transit systems are not a business to the extent that the rates do not usually cover operating costs and require subsidies. However, these subsidies may be smaller and less of a burden for local or regional governments to the extent that transport companies can have additional income, which generally does not exceed 20% of revenue due to structural limitations. Generally, metro systems have around 10-20% of their income sustained in other businesses that do not have to do with directly selling tickets. These businesses are, for example, operating other transport systems in other cities, consultancies, and perhaps the most important in these possible additional incomes is real estate development or urban operations. Bogotá is doing it with its metro by recommendation of the Medellí­n Metro. Medellí­n is doing so as well, giving those 19 transport corridors control over their real estate development, which can generate some income from the use of land. </p><h4>What is the main objective for the Metro of Medellí­n in 2018?</h4><p>We have two main objectives. First, we have to reinforce, repower, and rejuvenate the concepts on how to execute all our actions around the metro culture. The other important challenge is to finish structuring the repowering of the train fleet; the fleet already reached its initial lifespan of 30 years, which can be extended another 20 years but requires a repowering process. This is important from a technical and financial perspective. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the achievements and challenges the company has faced since entering the market?</h4><p>Derco arrived in Colombia almost eight years ago. Since then, the market has pushed us to improve our business and provide better customer service. Derco is a distributor and certainly has the talent to be a major player in the car market in Colombia. In 2017, we improved our returns in the Suzuki brand, and we intend to continue this trend. We also added the Citroí«n and DS brands to our portfolio. Citroí«n is a European brand, and our challenge is not only to increase the number of Citroí«n cars we sell here, but also to position the brand in Colombia. The Suzuki and Citroí«n brands are our key focus for the coming years. We are always looking for new brands to add to our distribution portfolio. Colombia has a population of almost 57 million; however, vehicle sales are only 240,000 cars per year, compared to 400,000 in the Chilean market. This means there is both a challenge and an opportunity to grow in the car industry in Colombia.</p><h4>What is Derco's current market share in Colombia, and how do you manage to compete in such a competitive market?</h4><p>We have a 3.7% market share in Colombia's automotive sector. We definitely want to increase that share. Nevertheless, there are still some areas, such as machinery and spare parts, where we can continue growing the business, and one way is to continue adding new brands to our portfolio. We are always looking to do that. For example, in Colombia's automotive industry, we only sell four brands—Suzuki, Great Wall, Citroí«n, and DS, but in Chile we have seven brands.</p><h4>What is Derco's strategy to partner with high-end or luxury car brands?</h4><p>Our distribution system works under an umbrella structure with retailers. What we do here and in our other markets of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru is to distribute and sell under the umbrella of Derco Center, which is our retail brand. This strategy has been working well for several years. The Derco Center brand is powerful and provides the right support to grow the various car brands we sell as well as their market shares. We have been using the Derco Center umbrella for 50 years in Chile, and we are using the same structure in Colombia.</p><h4>Is Derco planning to explore new markets in the near future?</h4><p>Right now, we are not. We are in Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. We still have a lot to do in these countries, especially in our markets outside Chile. There is room for us to continue growing in these existing markets and we are always looking for new brands. We would not discount the idea of going into new markets in the future; however, right now we are focused on our existing four markets to continue positioning ourselves in them.</p><h4>What are your expectations at Derco for 2018?</h4><p>We are active in the car sales business, machinery, spare parts, and in our own retail business. Our first goal is to continue to consolidate those four core lines of business. This means establishing a solid base that allows us to continue growing those activities in the future. Our targets are more about efficiency and productivity. In retail, we want to increase our sales staff. In our car business, we want to achieve over 4% market share. We are uncertain about how the machinery sales segment is going to perform in 2018 because it depends on industry in the country. Currently, industrial growth is stagnant in the country; however, we are trying to get additional sales of machinery in different sectors, such as agriculture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Automotive Alliance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[automotive-alliance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Motorysa's main accomplishments and developments in the last two years?</h4><p>In 2016, Mitsubishi Motors became a part of the global alliance of Renault-Nissan, and the group is now Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors worldwide. Based on the most recent figures for 2017, the alliance has become the largest automotive partnership in the world. This alliance is mainly in headquarters; it does not affect the retail or distribution business in Colombia. However, Motorysa must change its business and future vision taking into consideration we are a part of the alliance. We saw the entire strategy for the Mitsubishi brand in Japan and, subsequently, have developed new departments, for example, a digital innovation department (DID). We have also invested in our dealer network by opening three new dealers in places we were not present. The second-biggest challenge is that we also have the Daimler retail operation with its brands Mercedes Benz, Fuso, and Freighlineras; we are one of the most important dealers of Daimler in Colombia, which includes retail both in sales and aftersales, especially for truck business. For the passenger cars business, we acquired an operation of a new dealership situated in the north of Bogotá that will complement the one in Ibagué City. Mitsubishi is more oriented toward the new alliance, while Daimler is developing our current showrooms and doing most of the operation. We are investing in hiring new people and also in the infrastructure of our dealerships.</p><h4>How has the strategy to attract these brands changed?</h4><p>The strategy is divided in two: 50% of the strategy is directed toward business in the traditional automotive sector, while the remaining 50% is dedicated to new businesses. Motorysa must look for new businesses in order to gain know-how. This is one of our biggest challenges. The business model of selling cars will change significantly. We are looking at the changes necessary for that vision. We are working within a strong network in Colombia, which includes the government, and we are active trying to build a public policy favorable for the automotive business, mobility, transport, and so on. Moreover, we have plans to expand geographically in Colombia, though not in the short term. Our recent financial investments were quite large, and our plan is to stabilize the operations before looking into possibilities.</p><h4>How would you assess the market for 2018?</h4><p>We expect the market to be like 2017. Unfortunately, there are economic signs that are not clear for Colombia. The economy and the automotive market will depend on developments, specifically with regards to the US. In the past, we were dependent on the oil price and the industry. However, that stopped two years ago. Currently, the US is one of our main partners, and we expect to see similar exchange rates in 2018 compared to 2017. Motorysa has three scenarios for 2018: a contraction, neutral, and expansion scenario. All our businesses are prepared for the contraction scenario. We expect a recovery of the economy around 2020, but the details of that recovery will depend on the new president of Colombia and the new administration's direction for the economy.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2018?</h4><p>We must be in line with all of the new challenges we have with the alliance as well as the Daimler business. We are preparing for growth between 20 and 30%. We have the resources, strategy, and people, as well as a detailed analysis of the market. Even though the economy will stay the same, Motorysa will see growth. In the Mitsubishi business, we have developed a new fleet department. This corporate department is large, with a manager, resources, and sales advisors exclusively dedicated to the fleet. Large mining, coal, and transport companies are buying cars for renting, and we want to be present in that sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for Agility Colombia since expanding your operations in the country?</h4><p>One milestone has been the recognition of Agility as a major company in logistics. Agility has over 500 offices around the world. We have a major competitive advantage with all the agents in different places. Another major milestone is the opening of the Agility Colombia branch as a joint venture. We have been here over the last 10 years with agents, and we saw the potential of Colombia. Therefore, we started an Agility branch. Since then, everything has gone up.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of Colombia's logistics sector?</h4><p>The infrastructure of Colombia has changed; it has improved drastically in the last 10 years. The road from Cali to Buenaventura is almost done after six years of construction. From Cartagena to Bogotá there is a new road called Ruta del Sol, a great highway around 1,000km that is almost completed. The problem for importers and exporters is that most of the industries in Colombia are located in cities like Bogotá and Medellí­n, which are far from ports. Ocean freight from Shanghai to Buenaventura is less expensive than Buenaventura to Cali or Bogotá.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[legacy-brand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is GM's approach regarding local investments for 2018-2019?</h4><p>In recent years, GM has adapted quickly to the economic changes and has been innovative, offering customers a broad portfolio of products with new standards of design, technology, security, connectivity, and performance. Recently, we made a COP22 billion (USD7.59 million) investment in the production and commissioning of our new models Chevrolet Spark GT and Chevrolet Beat that were launched in 1Q2018 in Colombia. This project was planned and executed in a record time of 12 months, in which more than 800 people participated and more than 31,000 hours of work were invested in the assembly and automation. Additionally, we spent about 69,000 hours in training. On top of this, we presented the new Chevrolet DMAX, characterized by its power, superior performance and technology. We remain focused on offering innovative products and services with superior technological development, excellent performance, unmatched quality, and the best after-sales service in the country.</p><h4>Now that the political situation is clearer, what are your expectations for the future?</h4><p>In GM, we are committed to cooperation between the private sector and the government; we actively participate and support policies that promote competitiveness, productivity, innovation, and the continuous improvement of the national industry. For GM, it is crucial to have the national government support the promotion and development of the automotive sector, toward the generation of scenarios and conditions to achieve the required balance in the operation, in promoting incentives for new investments, and for the sustainability of the industry in Colombia. We are optimistic about the recovery of the market during the second half of the year. We trust in the rebound of the economic indicators that will lead to an increase in consumer confidence, so the automotive industry can resume its growth path. Despite the decrease in sales, Colombia is still an interesting market because it has one of the most important potentials in the region.</p><h4>What new models will GM introduce into the local market?</h4><p>In addition to the great and successful launches we made during 1H2018—Chevrolet Spark GT, Chevrolet Beat, and Chevrolet DMAX—our brand will continue to surprise our customers by offering products with the best design, comfort, efficiency, connectivity, and advanced security features. Furthermore, we will take advantage of the XVI version of the Motor Show in Bogotá to present brand-new features. Besides the strengthening of the products we offer in the local market, exporting is the main priority for our business. The consolidation of GM in South America's west region has allowed an increase of our exports for vehicles such as the Chevrolet Spark, Chevrolet Sail, and our Chevrolet NQR bus to Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In 2018, from January to May, we exported around COP114 billion (USD39.33 million) and expect that to grow to COP367 billion (USD126.615 million) by the end of the year and COP600 billion (USD207 million) in 2019 according to our export plan. </p><h4>What are GM's long-term commitment and strategic investment plans in the country and South America West region?<br></h4><p>Colombia is now part of General Motors South America West region and is also the headquarters, not only as a sign of our commitment to the Colombian national industry, but also as an appeal to work on the competitiveness and a long-term sustainability through the production for the national market and for the increase of exports. Our objective with the consolidation of the region is to strengthen the leadership of Chevrolet's brand, taking advantage of global products and increasing exports to become a profitable and sustainable operation. We are ranked in the top 20 of the main companies in Colombia, one of the five most important industrial companies, and the leaders in the automotive Colombian market. We have built this legacy for over more than six decades, generating qualified employment, technology, economic, and social development for the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did JLR decide to bet on the Colombian market, and how important is thus operation for you?</h4><p>Colombia is the second Latin American automotive market after Brazil and is part of our growth plan within the region. We decided to set up our operations with an eye on opportunities for the brands, products, and country with special focus to be closer to our customers and enhance their satisfaction. The locally owned operation was launched in late 2016, already delivering an amazing 50% growth and 2% market share in a decreasing market—all with just one dealer in Bogotá. Now, we are also in Medellí­n with immediate plans for Cali.</p><h4>What was your strategy to promote your brands and grow in the future?</h4><p>When we decided to launch our operations in Colombia we had only one dealer in Bogotá, and the basic strategy was to grow throughout the country. In March 2018, we announced the launch of two new dealers—Praco Didacol in Bogotá and British Motor in Medellí­n. With this strategy, we are not only growing in sales, but also in services, since we now have service points in both Bogotá and Medellí­n. We are now going for Cali, the coast and the north of the country, where we hope to open two more dealerships in 2018.</p><h4>How did you start competing with other premium brands?</h4><p>We have two main advantages besides our products, which are strong luxury items. The Jaguar brand in known for its motor racing heritage and incredible driving dynamics with its: “The Art of Performance" branding, while Land Rover is known for its elegant but capable off-road cars positioning itself as “Above and Beyond." All product line-ups have been completely renewed in all senses including new products, new powertrains, new technologies, and amazing modern design. We are working on new products and segments in which we were not participating before. For example, we have the Jaguar F-Pace SUV that we launched in 2016 and is the first Jaguar SUV matching sport dynamics with SUV practicality. On the Land Rover side, the Range Rover Velar has been launched to re-think the SUV segment with technologies and design never seen before. There are some examples of where we are heading with our products, with more to come. We are about to launch the new Jaguar E-Pace, a smaller SUV for modern and active customers without losing any sport or practicality elements. In Colombia, we also have our own financial services in partnership with Santander bank. This is our strategy: we look at the market, see what our customers want, and then work together with our partners and team to give what they want. We also have three years of guarantee and five years of maintenance and service included in the initial price. In addition, we have a program called Approved, in which customers can buy pre-owned JLR cars with all the peace of mind in terms of origin and quality. This is beneficial to the new buyer, but also for the initial owner, protecting interesting resale values.</p><h4>How is JLR pushing forward for a more sustainable transport system?</h4><p>We are participating in the Formula E and were one of the first luxury brands to do so. Jaguar team has a successful background there. Furthermore, our product strategy is that every Jaguar Land Rover launched from 2020 will be electrified, either through all electric motion or hybrids.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>Colombia has been nominated as the new hub of JLR Latin America, replacing Sío Paulo. That said, none of our competitors are present here in Colombia to manage the rest of the region. This means that we will have more dedicated operations and people with different knowledge of our cars, brands, and markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations been for Huawei over the past two years?</h4><p>IVÁN HERRERA For the last two years, we were focused on growing our market in the operative side. We have built teams in our company to start attending to the enterprise market. Within that, we started talking with governments, municipalities, and mayors to understand the needs from different sides. In the last two years, we have been changing our customers and our business perspective, and now we target not only the operators market, which is our strongest part, but also the real market.</p><p>CAO WEI For the smartphone business, 2017 was a great year for us. We saw over 30% growth compared to 2016, the highest growth Huawei has seen. And, according to my analysis, our revenue surpasses the average in this industry. Colombia is an important country for Huawei, particularly in Latin America. Based on investments, Colombia is the top priority on our list. Our units are about 20% in 2017 in terms of market share.</p><h4>Is there a specific sector that you seek to enter in the next year?</h4><p>IH There has been a great deal of investment in ICT from the financial sector in the past year, though we never dealt with that before. At the moment, we are ready to enter that market as we have more people and greater capabilities to bring solutions in that sector. We are also thinking about the Internet of Things (IoT), which deals with all the different markets. We have already worked in some of these markets such as agriculture.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the expansion of Huawei stores in Colombia?</h4><p>CW We will adjust our strategy with the new stores. We want to have impressive Huawei stores in Bogotá and plan to open new ones in 2017. In the meantime, we want to open more customer service stores in other cities. For us, service is the main differentiator for our company in the industry. We currently have several service stores in Bogotá and one in Barranquilla and plan to have more service stores in Cali and Medellí­n.</p><h4>What sets apart Huawei from its competitors?</h4><p>IH There are different business models. Our model is a traditional model, which means we sell the equipment, support, operation, and maintenance to our customers. The real difference that sets us apart from others is innovation. Our global revenue in 2015 was USD75 billion and 10% is dedicated to R&amp;D. Moreover, 50% of the 190,000 people working globally at Huawei are in R&amp;D; we dedicate massive resources to innovation. The latter, along with our 17 years in the country, are our strongest points.</p><p>CW We view ourselves as an iconic technology leader in the industry. We always want to bring the most advanced Huawei devices to our final users. This is the key to our final users having the best experience. We want to pass on a service to our final users. We always seek to design the products based on user experiences; that is the differentiation.</p><h4>What are the main benefits and challenges of doing business in Colombia?</h4><p>IH When I came to Colombia, people had the misconception that things from China were perhaps not the best quality. This was the first challenge we faced in the first three or four years, though we just broke through. Moreover, we built great relationships with our customers who wanted to do business with us. We are in the electrical market, government, and finance, which is another challenge for us as we had to get out of our comfort zone to try these new markets. Today, the challenge is to learn those markets because we do not need to talk about technology in those ones.</p><p>CW In terms of benefits, more people know our brand, and our expansion has been great. A challenge for us is that we are still on the way to becoming the top brand. Currently in Colombia our brand recognition is fairly high. According to certain polls, we are number two in Colombia; however, we want to be number one in the industry. Another challenge is developing this market. The economic situation of the country and Latin America, as a whole, is in a growing stage. Therefore, figuring out how to grow as well is a challenge for us.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the next year?</h4><p>IH We will move more into the IT business, which will help with the digital transformation. For example, we are currently building artificial intelligence and have a platform called Enterprise Intelligence. The idea with this is to give more intelligence to the cloud to help businesses, for example. We are moving toward that and promoting the business of cloud and get Colombian customers to think about cloud computing and IoT.</p><p>CW We have strong confidence in 2018 compared to 2017. We plan to launch many new models with different technology this year. Our goal is to improve our service to our customers, bring out different models compared to our competitors in the market, and continue the current trend of growth in the company. We want people to realize Huawei is iconic and a leading brand in technology. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

As a result, today AVIS Colombia is recognized as the best AVIS franchise in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><h4>How was 2017 for the company, and what is your forecast for 2018?</h4><p>Due to remarkable commercial management, in 2017 we achieved larger growth than the market, growing in operation above 30% and placing AVIS as the second player in the car rental market in Colombia. In 2018 we expect to maintain the trend and grow by 20%.</p><h4>What has been the strategy behind this growth?</h4><p>The strategy of AVIS has three main pillars: the consolidation of a top-notch team, improvement of service quality by reaching international standards (ISO 9001), and an aggressive commercial strategy. These three pillars have given us a vision of the future of a large company.</p><h4>How does AVIS compete in the Colombian market with other international car rental companies?</h4><p>AVIS is a premium brand; our goal is to provide a memorable experience for those who rent a car with us.

Our international clients seek us out because they know we offer a premium service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of Accenture Colombia's major accomplishments and challenges in 2017?</h4><p>Accenture has been operating in Colombia for more than 10 years, during which our focus has expanded from the financial sector to consumer goods and natural resources. Accenture operates in more than 120 countries and thus has a very thorough selection procedure on where to invest. Accenture selected Colombia as a key country for our investments in Latam because we are convinced about the potential of Colombia. Since I arrived here a few years ago and took over, the company has grown and increased investment, and we are now focused on recruiting the best talent in the country. While Accenture is well connected to the start-up ecosystem in other countries, it is a new step for the company in Colombia. Our goal is to connect the start-up world with the biggest companies in Colombia by promoting Open Innovation concepts that have already worked for Accenture in other countries.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in terms of digital transformation?</h4><p>Colombia has huge potential to improve processing and the consumer experience; in a word, there is great potential for better client services. The market is mainly dependent on call centers with a physical presence for client contact. However, we see that Colombia can and will overcome other markets due to the availability of easily implementable technology and connectivity.</p><h4>The World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) has Accenture as a partner for its new platform, DigiLab. How is Accenture Colombia involved in this partnership?</h4><p>There are two aspects of the partnership with IFC: Colombia's use of financial products lags behind that of the majority in Latin America, and only around 30% of Colombians have access to traditional banking product. Greater access to banks makes it easier to reduce money laundering, corruption, tax evasion, and informality. The initiative is aimed at helping countries in Latam, including Colombia, make better use of digital in the financial sector. Cultural barriers also need to be addressed since traditional institutions will need to work closely with fintech. To overcome this, Accenture is working with several banks on concepts such as frictionless payments that will allow cell phone payments without a need for physical credit cards or traditional bank accounts. Similar systems are already in place around the world, and there is huge potential for Colombia, where 50 million people own more than 50 million cell phones.</p><h4>What are the main innovation trends you see coming up in Colombia over the next five years?</h4><p>An established and strong ecosystem for start-ups is definitely one, and external investment in the country is growing year after year. Comparatively, the start-up ecosystem in Israel allowed us to attract large investments from big companies. Colombia's ecosystem needs to gain size and strength to join the current innovation wave. Another upcoming trend is the transformation of the customer experience through much better support.</p><h4>What industries will grow the most in 2018?</h4><p>There is the usual feeling of uncertainty due to the imminent presidential elections, but growth prospects in Colombia are imminent. We upgraded our investments after analyzing the country's underlying fundamentals over the past 10 years. In the face of declining oil prices, Colombia managed to address its deficit concerns in an exemplary way. Its strong local market boasts one key characteristic in the region: its dependency on external consumption ranks. For this reason, it is more immune to external shocks, such as fluctuating oil prices.</p><h4>What main targets and goals are you setting for Accenture Colombia in 2018?</h4><p>Our prime target is to be at the heart of the country's digital transformation and all the other transformations surrounding the use of new technology. Accenture Colombia wants to participate with all actors and help Colombia. Similar to other countries where we operate, we are about to open a Center for Innovation and Technology in Medellí­n because we believe in the talent of Colombians and the strength of its domestic companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bound-for-greener-skies]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights and challenges of 2017 for Aviatur?</h4><p>2017 was great for Aviatur: we made progress on our automation development and were extremely successful with our commerce. We have experienced impressive growth, the fastest in Latin America, and progressed with the hotel we are building on the Colombian coast, which is expected to be ready before the end of 1Q2018. The peace process has increased inbound tourism traffic to Colombia. Though it is always a challenge to adapt to the changing conditions in Colombia: exchange rate fluctuations, presidential elections, and the World Cup that traditionally paralyzes the country.</p><h4>You predicted a 500% increase in the number of tourists in the next 10 years. What is your strategy to keep up with this massive increase?</h4><p>The number of business tourists is falling, which may be due to the general reduction in Colombia's economic activity. However, there is an increase in the number of those coming here to discover the country, and it is these people we are interested in. Our inbound tourists department has a great deal of work. In terms of our strategy to cope with the increase, we will do what we have done for the last 50 years. </p><h4>How does Aviatur plan to compete with new international players in the market that have set up operations in Colombia?</h4><p>We typically do not worry about what other players are doing, and try to compete through our reliability and by striving for perfection in the service we deliver. We are present in 38 cities across Colombia. We are reliable due to our local knowledge and presence. We are fast at making decisions and adapting as a company, and we know the country well. A company is only as bad as the worst of its employees, and we focus on having the best staff. Competition from abroad is just part of working in a global market. The rise of corporate travel began 20 years ago in 1997-1998, but now we face a change in the corporate ecosystem with the newly available communication and statistical tools.</p><h4>How important is the corporate travel side of Aviatur's business compared to individual travellers?</h4><p>Outbound travel makes up 95% of our business and incoming 5%. Of this, 70-75% of our outbound business is corporate travel.</p><h4>What is your growth forecast for 1H2018?</h4><p>In 1Q2018, activity in our offices has been up 30% on the same period in 2017. We do not have an annual target; we never do predictions in Colombia. At the group level, Aviatur's YoY growth is 56%. There is no particular strategy to achieve these results other than trying to do our best, be efficient, and have the lowest cost possible.</p><h4>Is Colombia on a path to becoming a world-class tourist destination?</h4><p>It is. The peace process has had a significant impact on the image of the country. Colombia has 1 million sqkm without infrastructure, so there is a great deal to do. Green or ecotourism is the future for us because Colombia's biodiversity is the country's specialty.</p><h4>What sector is most in need of FDI in Colombia?<br></h4><p>Industry, though Colombia's tax levels are competitive at about 75%. One of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez's main programs was mining, but local communities blocked it because of their concerns about the environmental impact. However, mining can be carried out responsibly. If mining and petroleum are problematic, then perhaps industry would be the best sector to attract large production companies to Colombia. </p><h4>What legislative change would you like to see in the tourism sector?</h4><p>The problem is we have too many laws; there are so many layers that no one knows what to do or how to apply the requirements. Our legislative branch of government is working too hard while our judicial branch is not working at all; there are too many laws and no justice.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ruta N has become one of the main business incubators in the region; how has it evolved in the past few years?</h4><p>Ruta N does tactical planning based on three elements: first, the application of science, technology and innovation to help the citizens gain a better quality of life. Second, we are transforming the economy of Medellí­n from a traditional one to a knowledge-based economy. Third, we are assessing how innovation regulates the economy. As a result of these efforts, Medellí­n has attracted more than 195 companies from 27 countries providing more than 4,100 jobs. We have built a portfolio of more than 270 projects based on applied research and technological development worth more than USD100 million, of which we have been able to leverage more than USD30 million. Under this modality, we have more than 60 projects, 10 of which are about to be launched in the market. We are having an improvement in our innovation, providing seed capital for start-ups, and structuring debt and venture capital financing. This financing model has also developed a smart capital with 18 sources of venture capital and 21 investments worth USD280 million. Another element is the innovation in business development: more than 730 companies have participated in innovation processes by connecting budgets and innovation concepts with the best route to innovating and reaching a minimum viable product (MVP). We have also been working on an open innovation program with the purpose of helping people learn more about innovation.</p><h4>What strategy do you use to attract large customers such as Huawei or Konecta?</h4><p>The strategy is based on understanding Medellí­n as an ecosystem made up of universities, corporations, and government. What international companies like best about us is our collective work. As a city we also provide a quality of life that consists of our favorable attitude to business, and our climate, culture, and security. Finally, we have also put a lot of effort into activating our innovation, science, and technology ecosystem.</p><h4>What advantages does Ruta N offer ICT companies located here?</h4><p>Between all of our companies, there is support and collaboration. In a nutshell, we want things to happen here, and we like to see progress in Medellí­n. From the technical point of view, there is a strong technological position; we have a certified silver building, our technology infrastructure is in great condition, our servers work very good, and our technology plants can meet any technical eventualities that might occur.</p><h4>Ruta N has partnered with a leading innovation hub at the University of Miami. What is the significance of this project?</h4><p>We want to work on the technology hub because the supercomputers will be at high speed and it would help to have more data collection. Regarding the Alcobendas hub in Spain, we have just signed an agreement to promote the development of innovative projects based on technology. This corporation has more than 15,000 companies, including multinationals, focused on biotechnology.</p><h4>What was the result of the Smart Capital Event in November?</h4><p>That was a truly successful event. More than 600 participated, including the US Embassy with Ambassador Kevin Whitaker, the main representatives in terms of investment and financing of entrepreneurship of the Pacific Alliance, 273 investors, among them angel investors, family offices, capital funds managing over USD400 million, main business groups, entrepreneurs, and innovation agencies of entrepreneurship were present. The main actor in impact investment worldwide, Capria, led the work agenda to establish partnerships with local investors. There was also a training course for investors to strengthen the region's capacities, offered by Venture Well, an organization commissioned by the US Department of State to strengthen emerging economies through angel investment in initiatives that have components in science and technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[its-colombias-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major strategies to increase foreign visitors, employment, and foreign currency in Colombia?</h4><p>We are working according to a policy conceived by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism within specific policy axes whose main goal is to increase foreign visitors, currency, and the hospitality sector. The ministry developed this idea, and FONTUR, as a resource pool, is in charge of carrying out these projects. As such, we are responsible for projects concerning competitiveness, promotion, and infrastructure from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, and from the industry in general such as hotels, travel agencies, airlines, convention and event hosts, restaurants, and bars. All of them contribute with parafiscal taxes that make up FONTUR's budget. </p><h4>What strategies have worked in the past eight years?</h4><p>The government has made an historic investment of COP1 trillion in competitiveness, promotion, and infrastructure. In terms of competitiveness, we are in charge of tourism planning and support the administrative entities in developing their tourism market and promoting their regions, training every part of the sector's value chain, and administrative entities regarding tourism quality. We also help hotels and travel agencies get quality and sustainability certifications, which is important. There are 12 certified tourist destinations and 13 more in the process of certification. Additionally, the culture of sustainability in Colombian tourism did not exist before, but now we have strict quality controls. In terms of promotion, we are in charge at the national level. We also finance ProColombia to promote the country at the international level in its function as the foreign promotion agency. We approve projects for the administrative entities and the industry value-chain, and are also in charge of everything related to advertising, media, and audio-visual material. In terms of infrastructure, around 50% of the COP1 trillion budget went to the construction of tourism-related infrastructure, since a certified tourist destination needs this infrastructure to attract visitors and make them have a great experience. Colombia has four high-importance tourism products: culture, nature, health and wellness, and congresses and meetings. For example, for nature tourism, we built docks, yacht club and marinas, ecological trails, theme parks, and bird watching towers. Colombia has a very privileged location as a high-interest destination for Latin America.</p><h4>What are the most important partners for FONTUR?</h4><p>Our allies are the regional, state, and municipal authorities, and our efforts are focused on making these regions aware of the importance of tourism as an economic booster, though they used to just pay attention to health, transportation, education, and employment. In terms of private partners, we work with institutions that contribute parafiscal taxes, such as hotels, travel agencies, and airlines. </p><h4>How does FONTUR promote a safe child environment?<br></h4><p>The ministry's policies are focused on working together with both the private and public sectors regarding the safety of children and teenagers when traveling. This is called responsible tourism and involves making tourists and society in general aware of the importance of protecting children and teenagers from sexual exploitation. Recently, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism and FONTUR organized a global summit in which more than 100 countries and 92 international exhibitors came to talk about the topic and raise awareness about its seriousness. We have created a successful campaign together with the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare, the police, and many other private and public institutions. </p><h4>What is FONTUR doing to attract foreign investment and partners to Colombia?<br></h4><p>We have recently been holding many events. Since we are the administrators for the sector's resources, we are in charge of training and awareness along the entire value chain, so we finance congresses and forums for all labor unions related to tourism and bring in international exhibitors. Colombia is in the global spotlight and is seeing a transformation that is bringing in more and more foreign currency. As our campaign says: “It's Colombia's time." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[components-of-design]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Eurocerámica since its creation, and what have been your main achievements and challenges?</h4><p>The idea for the company arose in the minds of industrialists from Medellí­n to create an alternative in ceramics. This thought materialized in the municipality of Guarne, Antioquia, where the facilities of Eurocerámica were built in a 200,000sqm terrain. By 1991, we had automated the process and the first dispatch was made. The market was consolidated with demand of around 840,000sqm per year. We stand out with our varied product portfolio. In 1998, a new extension was made, with a production capacity of 4.8 million sqm per year. We also got ISO 9002:94 certification from BVQI. Entering the 21st century, the distribution channels nationally and internationally strengthened. In 2005, further expansion of the production plant began, which increased production levels to 6.6 million sqm per year. When manufacturing, our emphasis on every stage allows for a logical progression; the technology we use is state-of-the-art and the product is manufactured according to customers' orders. Today, the main challenge is to face the enterprise restructuring in accordance with Law 1116, which we are working on consciously, dependent on the availability of new products and services to the distribution network. We are working to increase the profitability of the company and promote training, evaluation, and the growth of our employees.</p><h4>Does Eurocerámica export to the region?</h4><p>Exporting is something we established as a corporate strategy, and we are in the process of internationalizing the company. With exposure to international markets, risk is diversified, a competitive level is gained, pressure is reduced, and the company's value increases. Exporting improves the packaging, as the quality criteria are raised to international standards, our portfolio expands, and marketing channels increase, among other advantages. A company that sells internationally is worth more than one that depends solely on the national market. In addition, exporting allows us to balance the ratio between imports and exports. It is a form of insurance to compensate for the greater value of imports before a possible devaluation of the peso. Currently, we export to Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the US.</p><h4>What are the main trends in design for the ceramic market?</h4><p>For 2018, five ceramic trends are projected, and we will adapt to each market according to its requirements. The first design trend is nature inspired. Nature continues to be our main source of inspiration, marbles in large dimensions, natural stones, and above all wood, with endless possibilities that new technologies now allow us. Second is a return to the home. Traditional pottery and mosaics reminiscent of the home are inspired by the latest graphic and textile trends. Customers see the home as a personal space. Today's ceramics are capable of converting small spaces into personal and intimate areas, changing traditional restaurants into contemporary spaces with an impressive design component. The third trend is about magical atmospheres. Ceramics are used outside, and the number of ceramic solutions for exteriors is great. We can also produce things such as large marble pieces with all the accents, large thicknesses to withstand any traffic, anti-slip finishes with great technical features, and other new developments from our R&amp;D department that allow us to clean the water and collaborate with the environment in a committed and aesthetic way during the manufacturing process. The fifth trend will be about texture and movement. These include incredible reliefs on small formats, microreliefs, lines defined in wood, marbles, and large format stones.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We will ensure our compliance with agreements with creditors. Incursion, development, and consolidation of our exports in the regional and the US market are important as well; we hope to export 1.2 million sqm in 2018. We also want to expand our installed capacity to 12 million sqm per year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for the company?</h4><p>2017 presented a few challenges for the company. First, we focused on searching for safe products; there is a continuing discussion about using safe products in the chemical industry and how finding products that do not impact the environment or health is difficult. Nonetheless, we want to change the mindset and work toward creating an ethical industry. It is normal for private companies to seek benefits; however, those benefits should be earned in an honest and ethical way: by selling environmentally friendly products that are produced with the society in mind. In Latin America, there are no strict policies and regulations regarding raw materials for the production of chemical products. This is the reason why the company has been working on this idea for around nine years; we look to be leaders on this matter. With the aforementioned concerns in mind, we decided to design safe products, and the idea came to fruition with the launch of an environmentally friendly product line called Green Heritage, a product line comprising more than 100 products for indoor use that are designed to keep the earth's volatile organic compounds (VOC) levels in check. The products respect the atmosphere and counter the risks posed by VOC against the ozone layer.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your social responsibility program Colores que reparan?<br></h4><p>All businesses share a collective responsibility in the society they operate in; a business is successful only if it shares the success with the community. Pinturas Tito Pabón takes pride in undertaking responsible initiatives in the community. For example, Colores que reparan is a social program that gives us the opportunity to give hope to people through painting; we paint entire towns that have been destroyed in the internal conflict and rebuild these communities with the assistance of artists and painters. In addition, we collect the trash that is thrown into the rivers and spread awareness of recycling by turning the waste into decorative pieces.</p><h4>Who are the main partners and clients that you're working with?</h4><p>The company's most important partners are the suppliers of raw materials, such as Dow Chemicals and BASF. Our contracted suppliers, with whom we enjoy friendly relations, provide us with the latest raw materials. For example, I frequently visit Dow's facilities to contribute to the improvement in its chemical components and pursue the fabrication of safer products. In addition, our client base extends to the local government, artists, and the general public.</p><h4>What is your strategy to become a leader in Latin America's industry?</h4><p>We plan to further strengthen our customer relations along with finding efficient ways to spread our message. For example, a Latin American football cup for people who use our paint is in the pipeline. No other player in the industry is involved in anything like this; such events are a great opportunity for businesses to build strong customer relations.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2018?</h4><p>Our number-one goal is to demonstrate that it is possible to build a successful business on the back of an ethical business model. The whole company is driven with a day-to-day focus on minimizing the risks posed by our products, because we respect the society and our client's quality of life. Despite numerous unpopular business practices and a sales force, we are growing at a steady pace because we have a profound belief that honesty pays out in the end. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of PPG Industries over the past year?</h4><p>It has been a difficult environment in Colombia with low consumer confidence, depressed consumer spending, as well as an industrial contraction; however, we gained market share in all our segments. We consolidated our leadership in the segments that we participate in and have positioned ourselves to make a strong recovery once the market picks up. We took advantage of the slight recovery of Ecuador, making an extremely positive turnaround there. We introduced several new technologies that helped our clients to be more productive and streamlined our supply chain with the localization in Colombia of key products in order to be more responsive and competitive for the needs of the regional market.<br>What are the main highlights of the business units in the Andean region that PPG manages from Colombia?<br>In automotive original equipment manufacturing (OEM), we maintained our leading market share and helped our clients become more competitive with the introduction of new technologies. We were able to achieve 100% customer satisfaction and were recognized as the supplier of the year. Protective and marine coatings (PMC) had a difficult year, with many projects put on hold due to the oil crisis and the corruption scandals; nevertheless, we saw certain market share gains in our marine and infrastructure businesses. Automotive repairs experienced one of the most difficult years. Despite a drop of over 50% in car repairs as reported by insurance companies, we grew our presence in collision centers and gained a significant market share in the commercial transportation segment. In terms of the general industrial and packaging businesses, we saw double-digit growth, despite a market contraction. Our proposal for new technologies and value-added services proved to be a strong competitive advantage that our customers value more every day.</p><h4>What is your current strategy in terms of expansion and increasing market share?</h4><p>We continue to look for opportunities to grow our distribution channels and increase our local presence in both countries to support those channels.</p><h4>What is your strategy to maintain high levels of satisfaction in a competitive market?</h4><p>Our strategy is clear; we do not want to become just an excellent supplier but rather become a strategic partner. We are focused on making our clients more competitive and successful and for that we provide them with the best technology—in many cases tailor-made—for their needs and the best technical service. When required, we support them with investments and provide their organizations with training, and in some cases we even accompany them to support their own customers.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We want to return to a more even and profitable growth across all our segments in Colombia, continue to grow our presence and market share in Peru and Ecuador, and carry on strengthening our organizational capabilities to become the preferred strategic partner for our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[meeting-the-expectations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major challenges and accomplishments did the company have in 2017?</h4><p>Talking about Colombia, even though it was a challenging year, there were many things that we can be proud of. For example, we had our 90th anniversary here last year and we continue to become a complete beverage company. In our search to do so, we were able to add AdeS to our portfolio, which is plant-based and is part of our efforts to expand our portfolio beyond sparkling beverages. Moreover, we are listening to our regional consumers about their needs. Through this, we have been able to reformulate about 67% of our portfolio to provide our consumers with better tasting products with lower calorie content.</p><h4>What's the importance of the Colombian market for Coca-Cola?</h4><p>As the third-most populous country in the region, it is an important market for us, and we have a lot of expectations for it. We want to grow in double digits here for the foreseeable future—that is what we are working on. We decided to move a significant chunk of our headquarters to Colombia for that reason. From the marketing side, 2018 is a World Cup year, and Colombia and football are synonymous. Thus, 2018 is about Coke, the World Cup, and all the passion that comes along. We are also working on the social and the environmental front. For the former, we are consolidating our social programs to focus on women's economic empowerment. We recently launched a program called “Emprendamos juntas," which aspires to economically empower 5,000 women with small shops in cities like Barranquilla, Cartagena, Valledupar, and Monterí­a. Since these are mostly rural areas, we will invest an extra USD1 million to ensure that our plan follows through. On the environmental front, we accomplished what we set out to do two years ago, which was to return every drop of water we used in our products. Today, we are what we call “water neutral" and that has been confirmed by third party audits. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about the acquisition of AdeS?</h4><p>AdeS is a plant-based beverage brand that stands for “alimentos de semilla" (foods from seeds) and is a strong player in the market that originally started with soy-based beverages. Now, given consumer changes, almond is a big player within the portfolio. This is an exciting venture for Coca-Cola, and we are expecting it to be as successful as our Del Valle juices acquisition. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about your initiative to reduce sugar in your beverages? </h4><p>The most important aspect for a company is to listen to its consumers. We launched a no-sugar Coke after five years of hard work. Under the leadership of our new CEO, we want to become a company that's comfortable with trying new things. That's why he says that if you're not making mistakes, you're probably not trying hard enough. </p><h4>How do you see the short-term market for Coca-Cola?</h4><p>Latin America is arguably the most successful region in the world for the company. Given that the continent's history has not always been stable, our ability to create a tremendous business gives us tremendous hope for Colombia. We have high expectations for the foreseeable future, despite whatever road-bumps there may be. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?<br></h4><p>We would like to achieve double-digit growth over a sustained period of time. Given the digitalization of our communities, we want our consumers to have our product one click away. Thus, not only do we have plans to continue to expand our distribution on a national basis, we also have to play an important role in the digital world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Postobón evolved since its establishment and what has been its role in the development of the country?</h4><p>2018 is our 114th anniversary and we continue to be one of the most successful private companies in Colombia. In order to achieve growth, we have to support the growth of the country, including that of the population. As a result, our business knowledge base is nationwide, and we have an intensive footprint both in manufacturing and distribution. Postobón made a decision to change and expand its portfolio, and has thus been working on a multi-category concept that covers above and beyond what we have done in the last 114 years. That is why we are investing in the beer market and have signed a JV with a Chilean group, CCU, to invest in Colombia. We are now taking a step forward to penetrate the beer industry, which is a great opportunity for us. We are also trying to understand the opportunities we can tackle based on our knowledge of logistics and distribution and our capacity to build brands and categories.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the main initiatives the company is taking to reposition itself?</h4><p>We understand the market trends; innovation is a must for us. Every day we work in R&amp;D to reconfigure our beverages. Our portfolio is truly varied, and we really do not depend merely on carbonated soft drinks (CSD). 50% of our portfolio sales are low-calorie or zero-calorie products. 30% of our portfolio consists of zero-calorie products, and the products that grow the most are not related to CSDs. The per capita consumption of CSDs in Colombia is low compared to other countries, and blaming CSDs for obesity is unjust. Studies from consulting companies have shown sugar in CSDs is less than 2.5% of the daily sugar intake of Colombians. We are confident that regardless of the regulations—which we welcome because they are necessary—we are in a great shape.</p><h4>In 2016 Postobón registered 14% growth. What is the strategy behind this growth?</h4><p>The strategy is simple: we work every day to conquer the hearts of Colombian consumers. It is our inspiration for the company. The reason why we have had double-digit growth in the last few years is because we have a great variety of portfolio, especially in terms of options, so we are able to understand all the segments, from value to premium. We have all types of products for all types of consumers in every category. We never increase prices and work hard to design great products for every segment of the population.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your goals for making the company more sustainable?</h4><p>In terms of sustainability, the economic portion is fundamental, though we also have social programs with local communities. The environmental sector is fundamental to us because we sell and put packages into the industry every single second of the day. We have a large truck distribution system and a great focus on packaging and transportation to reduce our carbon footprint. In packaging, we use different elements such as glass, plastics, Tetra Pak, and so on. We have a solid program to use recycled content in every single package or bottle that we use every day. We continue to make investments with our PET suppliers to continue to increase the percentage of recyclable material in every bottle.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be a challenge for Colombia. The country has worked hard to settle the peace process, and there is a great deal of confusion around that. Therefore, 2018 will not going to be an easy year in terms of consumption, though we are optimistic that we will keep the peace process in great shape and that there will be healthy growth for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[developing-infrastructure]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company perform last year?</h4><p>2017 was a particularly challenging year, not only because of the market and the political and economic environment, but also because of the changes in tax legislation. Despite this, we managed to exceed our sales target and reached USD9 million, a growth of 11% compared to 2016.</p><h4>What are your business lines, and which ones are more in demand?</h4><p>Our business is aimed at companies in the sector that develop infrastructure projects, mainly in terms of energy generation, transformation, transmission, and distribution in the medium-, high-, and extra high-voltage levels. Additionally, our services have a great systematic scope and are aimed at accompanying all stages of infrastructure projects. We have five business lines. The first is predial management, namely property identification, implementation of GIS, census and inventories, obtaining documents, studying titles, and so on. The second is judicial representation, which includes solution of surface needs in linear infrastructure through judicial representation, advice, and consultancy in processes of imposition of easement, police shelters, and so on. The third area is engineering, namely consulting, design, maintenance, and supervision placed at the service of electrical, civil, mechanical, and related engineering project. The fourth is the telecoms business, which works with the administration, operation, and maintenance of telecommunications networks in technologies such as fiber optics, multiplexing systems in PDH and SDH technologies, microwave radios equipment, and so on. Our last business line is administrative services, which involves administration of the virtual technical file BIV, analysis and administration of databases, logistic and administrative services, and more.</p><h4>Over the years IGGA has worked on several projects related to energy infrastructure. Which ones are the most iconic?</h4><p>Our experience dates back more than 15 years, going through different economic models, always adapting to the exogenous demands of the environment and the market, in which a vast experience has been forged in Colombia, researching and developing the best practices and expertise put into service of our clients. We have become one of the main national companies with extensive experience in solutions, development, and the implementation of infrastructure projects such as services, consulting, auditing, civil engineering, electrical, mechanical, design, lines and substations, telecommunications, maintenance, property management, surface needs solutions, warehousing and logistics management, and customer orientation, among others. We continually analyze our strategic direction as well as a solid structure, based on principles and values. Our know-how is based on the permanent strengthening of the competencies, training, and development of our collaborators, and we are always in search of excellence in service as an organizational culture, thereby contributing to sustainable development and generating environmental, economic, and social value to our stakeholders.</p><h4>Why do customers look to IGGA as their partner of choice?</h4><p>Customers turn to us because of our trajectory and knowledge. In addition to our qualities and trajectory, we have had the opportunity to truly understand the length and breadth of our country in terms of all the various issues that directly or indirectly affect our clients in areas such as communities, cultures, risks, coverage, and management, among others.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2018?</h4><p>The priorities for 2018 are the competitiveness and expansion of our portfolio of clients and services, integrating into our operations a greater scope in the services provided with the purpose of guaranteeing greater coverage, optimization, and competitiveness, which will all be reflected onto our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[customized-mining-operations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights from the past two years?</h4><p>The mining sector has been in a difficult situation in the last two years, both in Colombia and around the world. However, in our case, we created great strategic initiatives to grow in Colombia. Austin  Ingenieros has only been in Colombia for five or six years; we are practically a new company in the mining engineering segment offering engineering customized services and solutions. Currently, we are in a great position as a non-OEM manufacturer and engineering solution provider. One of our priorities is to strengthen the values of the people we work with. The idea is to create a strong relationship with our clients; we want them to view us as more than just a company.</p><h4>How important are Austin Ingenieros's Colombia operations to the overall group?</h4><p>Currently, Colombia is the strongest and best-performing unit in South America for Austin Ingenieros and the second most important globally. Besides Colombia, we have operations in Chile and Peru, through which we are covering all of South America. In terms of revenue margins and financial numbers, the Colombian market ranks number two in the world. Austin Ingenieros can offer engineering services, manufacturing processes for different components, and site services such as maintenance. If we consider all of our products and services, we occupy more than 53% of the market in Colombia's coal mining sector.</p><h4>What is your strategy to continue to increase your client's portfolio every year?</h4><p>Austin Ingenieros has a unique business model, holding a market-leading position as a non-OEM producer of custom truck bodies and buckets, with strategic locations across four major mining continents including Australia, Asia, North America, and South America. The company provides a large and diversified product range for aboveground and underground mining operations that are customized to meet client requirements. Our new product development will continue to position us as the leader in mining truck bodies, buckets, and attachments within the industry. This will protect Austin Ingenieros's existing market share and provide further growth opportunities. Our R&amp;D activities have produced lighter weight, high performance truck bodies, as well as innovative new bucket designs. In terms of safety standards, we strive to provide our workers with the best working environment. Our list of products is also extremely diverse; we are the leading designer and manufacturer of customized dump truck bodies, buckets, and ancillary products. Our core competitive strength is our engineering knowledge that provides compelling productivity gains for clients. What truly and rightly separates us from the competition is the ability to manufacture products at clients' operations located in key mining regions around the world.</p><h4>What are your opinions about the government's plan for mining development?</h4><p>Colombia is trying to open up the sector and create more investment opportunities. However, there are different barriers and more requirements in terms of environmental impact. Rather than giving licenses to large companies, the government is preferring smaller companies, whereas large companies have the potential to hire thousands of new employees in the region and improve the conditions of the area surrounding the mines. The government needs to take action in order to safeguard the interest of large mining companies in Colombia.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities in 2018?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the number-one mining services company in Colombia and the entire Caribbean region. To do that, we have to be able to offer the passion that we have for our projects and our work, create great leadership, and grow our business in Colombia. Currently, we have an advantage because all our clients know the Austin  Ingenieros brand. We have great support from the corporate sector in Australia and are communicating and working diligently with it and our clients' head companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Global LNG Wave]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[global-lng-wave]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on SPEC's LNG terminal, a 20-year concession?</h4><p>In 2013, Colombia's government decided that an LNG terminal was the best solution to guarantee the supply of natural gas for electricity generation and align the supply contracts with the variable pattern of thermal generation. The government opened up a bidding process, and SPEC was awarded to build and operate Colombia's first LNG Terminal. We received the environmental license in April 2015, started construction in July 2015, and started operations in December 2016. SPEC is pleased and proud to be LNG pioneers in Colombia. Our terminal and operations are a reference point for other countries in the region that want to open up their energy matrix to LNG. Our terminal consists of onshore and offshore facilities, through a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU). We operate the terminal in line with all the international social, sustainability, and security standards.</p><h4>What is SPEC's role in exporting its expertise to other countries in the region?</h4><p>We are open to sharing our experience and knowledge with other countries that would like to get into LNG. Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has visited us, and we have been able to share our views and knowledge with them. We were also invited to participate in some LNG discussions with the US Department of State in Washington in October to identify opportunities to further develop LNG business in the region. The US will become a major exporter of LNG in 2019 and is extremely focused on facilitating this development. We had two or three days of meetings with IDB, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and other multilateral agencies that are committed to providing support for this development. </p><h4>What is SPEC's current capacity and medium-term expectations?</h4><p>SPEC has a 20-year port concession. The terminal's storage capacity is currently 170,000cbm of LNG and its capacity to convert LNG to natural gas is 400mscfd, which represents 40% of Colombia's demand on any given day. Various sectors of the economy have spoken highly about our operation and the benefits it has brought to Colombia. The whole program represents savings of around USD600 million per annum in reliability costs.</p><h4>What are your main initiatives in terms of taking care of the communities affected by the project?<br></h4><p>We operate in accordance with the highest international standards, codes, and agreements in the shipping industry in order to protect the environment and neighboring communities. We understand the key role of the six neighboring communities around our project, which is why we involved them since the beginning. We made commitments with our neighboring communities; we hired their people during the construction phase, allowing us to establish a great relationship of trust. SPEC has a department dedicated solely to our relationship with the communities, and daily contact has facilitated the development of the project. The fact that we were able to do this project in 18 months demonstrates our success in terms of our community relationships. This is one of the things that we are proud of, and we are committed to maintaining this relationship over the long term.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities at SPEC for the coming year?</h4><p>Our top priority is to continue guaranteeing the capacity to our clients and maintain a secure source of natural gas supply to Colombia for electricity generation at any given point. Another goal is to share our knowledge and experience with other countries to develop the LNG business in the region further.  Globally, there are over 40 countries with LNG terminals, compared to just 15 countries in 2005. The trend is for the number to continue to grow, and we are interested in participating in this global LNG development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[colombias-gold-mines]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights, accomplishments, and challenges for the company in 2017?</h4><p>2017 was a year of technical work around licensing; we submitted both our environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) and our mining contract license (PTO). The PTO was approved in September; however, we cannot start work until the environmental license has been approved. The challenges for us is the political environment, as we are in an election year. Mining is always the easiest target for political votes. This has caused us some difficulty with the federal government and our communication strategies have been ramped up to combat that negative press. </p><h4>What are the peculiarities of the collaborative model applied by Minesa?</h4><p>In terms of the technology we have implemented in our plant, we produce a gold concentrate based on a flotation process, not a chemical process, so there is no chemical transformation of the mineral. We export the concentrate that is later chemically transformed into gold, copper, or silver somewhere else. In addition, we have created a model that every mining company needs to look into in terms of bringing into the fold those miners who cause damage to the local environment while protecting their traditions and their history. The coexistence plan involves giving them the opportunity to work in a safe environment by developing a plan incorporating the same level of technology that we use, training them on safer and better activities, and developing a cooperative. We have a detailed mine plan for the coexistence operations for traditional miners and are currently completing the technical and environmental studies required for licensing.  This collaborative approach goes beyond current formalization structures as we invest in the environment through technology improving the livelihoods of not only the miners but the community at large.</p><h4>How do you plan to become the leader in the mining sector in Colombia?</h4><p>With regard to the technology that we use in the project, our mine is fully developed to be the most automated underground mine in the world, and we apply the highest and most sophisticated technologies that exist in underground mining today, including fully automated trucks. Our sustainability models and our investment in local communities beyond the coexistence model are centered around education and sustainable industries outside of mining. <br> <br>What can be done to better utilize the great potential in the sector?<br>There have been figures published that around 250,000 people work in illegal mining, and that approximately 2 million ounces of gold is produced in illegal mines each year. To combat this significant environmental impact, the federal government needs to encourage and proactively manage the licensing of responsible mining in a timely manner. Formal responsible mining is currently losing the foot race with illegal mining due to the timeframes between being able to establish a mining project.  An illegal mine can take weeks to establish; however, being able to license a formal responsible mining project takes five-plus years. Unless the government can promote a more efficient process, Colombia will not be able to realize its huge potential in a responsible and environmentally friendly manner.</p><h4>What more should be done to fight illegal mining?</h4><p>Once there is understanding that the government will deliver, confidence will grow, investment will come and things will change. Our business model aims to promote not only local communities but also an integrated harmonious mining scale strategy. Combating illegal mining requires an integrated approach from both the government and private companies and will take time and requires an effective business model but is not impossible.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2018?</h4><p>Our main goal is to get our environmental license before the change of government. If that happens, then by early 2019 we will be well into construction. Our current goals are to finalize construction by end 2020 and operate in 2021. In the next five years, we will invest nearly USD1 billion in Minesa to get this project operational. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Providers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-providers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main achievements and milestones of OBS?</h4><p>IVÁN QUINTERO OBS is a family-run business. The company was founded in 2007 and in 2012, we were recognized as the second fastest-growing company in Colombia. We have gone from being a small company to a large provider in the services sector. We had a chance to work with Pacific Rubiales on specific projects, such as its largest project at the moment—an injection path. That gave us the opportunity to become the company with the most experience in this field in Colombia; we inject nearly 1 million barrels of water per day. </p><h4>Why is OBS the company of choice for oil and gas services in Colombia?</h4><p>IQ When we first approached large companies, we became involved in operational maintenance and the renting of technology for their needs. In the beginning, we had a solid connection with certain providers who provided great prices and excellent delivery times. That helped us to get where we are today: we were fast and cost effective. We also have great experience in managing the communities where we operate. For example, the area we were working in Castilla was a difficult place to work due to the syndicates that operate there; however, we were able to build a strong relationship with both the community and syndicates.</p><p>ALEJANDRO QUINTERO One of the main reasons is that OBS does not have a high level of bureaucracy; even if there is a large project, the management is always in charge. For example, when there are people who lead a project on the ground, upper management is aware of updates at all times. Moreover, we maintain direct communication lines with customers and project leaders. Another important factor that puts OBS on top of the list is that it completes all undertaken projects. Our clients do not have to face any delays or concerns regarding a project that is abandoned midway. Even if a project puts the company at a loss, we remain committed to finishing it.</p><h4>What is the progress on your operations abroad?</h4><p>IQ Currently, we have a project in Peru at the Talara Refinery. At the same time, we are bidding and making offers on other projects in Peru that are interesting to us. We also have a presence in Bolivia, where we are working to get more involved in water treatment projects. In Panama, infrastructure is a promising area. We have a branch in Mexico as well and although we have not formally entered operations, it could be an excellent opportunity for us as we do not produce oil; we contract services to people who own the oil.</p><h4>Are you seeking international or local partnerships in Colombia that could make your business more robust?</h4><p>AQ We especially need partners in terms of technology. In terms of offshore, it is difficult for Colombian companies. We would like to have more large companies working here for us to learn from. We are working to develop other businesses, such as hydroelectric power in Antioquia. We already own a hydroelectric plant called Virginias in Antioquia, and we have the license that has allowed us to construct it. According to the government, we have reserves for five years of production, and we are seeking alternative energy sources as potential business lines. We also have an agreement with an Italian company for water treatment plants and seek to attract partnerships in other industries.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018 and beyond?</h4><p>IQ Our main goal is to start working in other sectors. Our other goal is to enter the Mexican market in full. It is possible that in 2019 we could enter the food production business. We see food production to emerge as a strong industry in the future, especially after the decline in the oil industry.</p><h4>What are the benefits of doing business in Colombia?</h4><p>IQ The opportunities are the ease of building relationships with people. Company owners are open to forming new business partnerships and there are many opportunities here. However, Colombia is a developing country and we need a great deal of work. There are no huge companies here yet and those who come will find many opportunities because the market offers possibilities that Colombian companies do not have the capacity to tackle. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Exploring Opportunities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[exploring-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Summum has been working in projects in Mexico, Ecuador, Spain, Peru, Panama, and Colombia. How has the group evolved?</h4><p>We have 33 companies across the globe, and in Colombia we operate through three companies: Summum Energy (oil and gas services), Summum Projects (engineering for power sector), and Gomez Cajiao (engineering for infrastructure). We also worked with Summum Energy in Ecuador and Mexico in the past. Currently, with Gómez Cajiao and Summum Energy, we just have operations in Colombia, though we intend to establish in Mexico and Peru. Summum Energy in Colombia has almost all the large private players and the state as clients. Gómez Cajiao is an engineering company focused on the infrastructure side of the business, which includes ports, roads, free trade zones, power projects, and buildings. Although it is focused on the power sector and has significant experience in the downstream and midstream, Summum Projects is also an engineering company. Our headquarters are in Bogotá, and we also have operations in Meta department, Buenaventura, Barrancabermeja, Arauca, Cartagena, and Casanare. In Mexico, we are working in the power sector and also in oil and gas, both with public and private companies. In Peru, we are supervising the modernization of Talara refinery, which is perhaps the most important project in Latin America in terms of oil and gas. </p><h4>How does Summum finance those projects and who are your shareholders?</h4><p>Our company belongs to investment funds, the largest of which is a Canadian fund. It is a fund that manages assets of around USD90 billion around the world and is one of the top-five investment funds in the world. The second one is a regional fund that is 10 years old and manages around USD600 million, whereas the third is another investment fund that manages around USD9 billion. They are the largest shareholders of our company, and they manage resources from retired people, institutional entities, and multilateral entities</p><h4>What projects is Summum currently working on in Colombia?</h4><p>In Gómez Cajiao's infrastructure division, we have been the strongest company in ports in recent times, and just in 2017 alone, we completed two ports: a river port in Barrancabermeja and a seaport in Buenaventura. Other than that, we have some projects in Colombia that are being performed through framework agreements with private operators. We have also oil and gas projects with the largest private players in Colombia in Arauca, Meta, Casanare, and Guajira.</p><h4>Due to Summum's wide experience in building metros in the region, do you plan to work on the project for the Metro of Bogotá?</h4><p>Part of the conversations we are having with potential strategic partners are related to Metro Bogotá. We have a great deal of expectations for that project and are waiting for such opportunities to show our capabilities. </p><h4>Colombia has unveiled plans to offer 15 exploration blocks for licensing in 2017, focusing on the northeast. What role will Summum take within these explorations?<br></h4><p>Our role is to offer services to the operators that get those fields. We are not an operator; we are a services company. During the last three years in Mexico, the government issued different fields for different companies, both onshore and offshore; those are the kind of opportunities we are seeking. </p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our purpose is to keep growing in Latin America, with special focus on Mexico and Peru. We will sign a new agreement in Peru with a private client for Summum Project. Moreover, we initiated work for two new clients in Colombia in 2017. In 2016, companies were adjusting their size due to the economic challenges in the region. However, since the start of 2017, companies have been making serious investments. 2018 will be better than 2017 in those terms despite the elections in Colombia and Mexico, which will affect things a little, though more on the public side of the business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[magnifying-the-truck-effect]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Distracom's main achievements and challenges in the last few years?</h4><p>In essence, our strategic objective continues to be generating added value for Colombian truck drivers through a portfolio of integral services adjusted to their needs on the road in terms of quality, service, price, and specialization. Over the last two years, we have added more than 40 new business units for a total of 210 service stations in 18 departments across the country. We continue to expand the coverage of our services, with nine truck centers that not only have service stations but also hotels, parking, restaurants, convenience stores, lubrication centers, laundries, and both banking and courier services. We firmly believe in the important work carried out by Colombian truck drivers, which is why we work every day to offer tailor-made services that make their work easier. Additionally, our lines of industrial marketing, lubricants, and vehicular natural gas presented growth of 15%, 28%, and 20%, respectively, with significant participation in the agricultural, mining, and construction sectors.</p><h4>What is your comparative advantage, and what service sees the greatest demand in Colombia?</h4><p>Our comparative advantage is undoubtedly the specialization of our portfolio for the Colombian truck drivers. From the location and design to the specifications and rates of our service centers, the focus is on convenience for our customers. The development of transport as an economic activity in Colombia is highly complex due to the varying conditions of infrastructure and security, as well as the demanding level of efficiency that it demands to be profitable. That is why we focus all our efforts on promoting the professionalization of the sector not only through a network of wide coverage and competitive prices, but also using an electronic platform to control the fleets allowing us to make decisions in real time regarding the supplies of all the units. This allows truck drivers to exhaustively monitor the most relevant variables of the operation, such as the performance in kilometers per gallon and tons per gallon, as well as the ratio of money per ton and kilometer transported. We are convinced that such professionalization is possible as long as the carriers can find safe, comfortable, and reliable places to supply all their needs and those of their vehicles on the road to continue on their way.</p><h4>What expansion plans do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>The expansion of our network is one of the most important objectives in the coming years, because we want to ensure that those truck drivers that seek to professionalize their operation can find us in every corner of the country. Our goal is to construct and purchase at least 25 new business units in 2018, as well as continue to work on our existing ones around an increasingly complete portfolio of products and services for Colombian truck drivers.</p><h4>How do you foresee the business developing in 2018?</h4><p>2018 represents important challenges for the Colombian transportation sector in terms of competitiveness, due to excess supply and low freight margins. We assume this challenge as our own, since professionalization of the sector is the only way to generate the necessary operational efficiencies for our clients to maintain their profitability. Taking into account that fuel represents 34% of the operating costs of the industry, our fuel control platform is the main tool to ensure that the yields of each fleet unit are kept within optimum levels. In the same way, ensuring the proper rest, nutrition, and needs of drivers are met is essential for a safe and risk-free operation, which is why our truck centers are the best option. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Jacana Field developed over the last year?</h4><p>In 2016, we were focused on continuing to explore Jacana Field. Most of our efforts have been devoted to testing those limits. With the exception of a couple of exploratory wells, Jacana Field was the focus of our work program. Currently, we are trying to determine characteristics in common areas between Jacana and Tigana. For 2017, our drilling campaign closed with 24 wells, for total production in Jacana of 7,800bpd and total GeoPark production (full year 2017) of 21,700bpd gross. Even when this year has been a recovery period for oil prices, the company had one of the most aggressive work programs in the industry. This campaign has a 96% success rate taking into account the idiosyncratic geological risks in this field.</p><h4>How did GeoPark manage to achieve 43% growth?</h4><p>During 4Q2017 we produced 24.4kbpd, which was a 39% increase compared to 4Q2016. Our performance in drilling and completion activities is above the standards in industry, mainly because our personnel and contractors operate in high safety conditions. Equally important, our work program includes building facilities in a modular fashion that is consistent with our growth and based on our long-term plans. Another driver is the flexibility in our evacuation strategy; it helps us maintain our operational advantages for lower lifting costs in a low-price environment.</p><h4>How is your company working with local communities to improve relationships?<br></h4><p>We are developing a methodology with our neighbors around dealing with and overcoming conflict. We are focused on creating a constant and open dialog with feedback as common practice. We want our neighbors to know how to communicate and overcome conflict, because this will create a more productive and transparent relationship. Taking into account the challenging social environment in the last three to four years, we have had no blockades to our operations. We have been working hard to understand the impact we have on our neighbors and currently, we are also training local contractors on how to handle labor issues in a responsible and articulated way.</p><h4>What role do PPPs play in the sector, and what has been your experience with them?</h4><p>We have not had a PPP as such because they have special regulations. Certain areas will fail to overcome poverty levels or reach the UN Millennium Development Goals unless the government and the private sector work together. We are working hard to ensure that the infrastructure we use is appropriately maintained. We are currently conducting maintenance works for roughly 100km of roadways; we have financed studies for the local government to allow the improvement of their road system and maximize efficiency; we contributed with Casanare in getting government approval for nearly USD23 million to pave the roadways in the areas we operate in and together with our partner, we contributed USD6.6 million to the project. We are now working to bring international aid resources to several areas in which we operate. </p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for next year?</h4><p>We will continue developing Tigana and Jacana fields and conducting exploratory activities in Llanos 34 and other blocks. To do that, we are consolidating our team in order to guarantee our main goals.  GeoPark has approved a self-funded and risk-balanced work program for 2018 that will increase production by an estimated 15-20% and boost operating cash flows. </p><h4>What are the top benefits of doing business in Colombia and the top challenges?</h4><p>There is still a great deal of areas with potential in the country. There is also a competent and professional pool of personnel. The main challenges are legal stability, fiscal policies, and regional unrest, including the impact of politically influenced environmental regulation. Opportunistic and uninformed environmentalism must be dealt with because it is a major risk that jeopardizes Colombia's economy and its future stability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your operations over the past two years?</h4><p>The global economic scenario of the last two years represented an important challenge for the entire commodity industry in all its branches and sectors. In terms of the exploration and extractive sector, which are the basis of the companies with which we contract, the brake in its dynamics was fairly evident. The global situation presented a significant oversupply of the main raw materials and especially in the oil industry. This required a revaluation of the negotiation and operation of our company, introducing new lines of business and entering less conventional markets. Together with this, the Colombian market presented the conjuncture of the peace process, which brought a moment of certain expectation on the part of the major players to make their investment decisions, a trend that continued in SMEs. Now with the recovery scenario, the challenge is completely different. As a result of the situation of the last two years, we managed to build a flexible operating method that allows us to move quickly in the new scenario of oil prices. We look forward to the future of the Colombian market. The hydrocarbons sector went through a learning process and is now prepared to compete with this current price level. The cost and process optimization that was carried out was deep, and we now have to begin a comprehensive process of strong resource exploration. This is already taking place at the head of Ecopetrol, and we are seeing the entry of new players such as ConocoPhillips in the non-conventional sector. As a result of all this, we clearly see a recovery process for which we must be prepared.</p><h4>Which areas of your portfolio show the most potential and how would you divide them in terms of revenue?</h4><p>For 2018, with the rise in oil prices, we aim to revitalize the entire oil and gas finder technology (OFT) market. However, we are considering giving it a level of importance equal to that of minerals. The idea is to divide the efforts of market penetration in the same way as oil and mining. Therefore, we consider as a goal that the oil and mining market will reach 80% of our total income, that is, 40% each. The next order is to reinforce all the strategy that corresponds to water finder technology (WFT). Water is more important every day, and we see there are possibilities where it can even become our main market.</p><h4>What is your current geographical presence and your expansion plans? </h4><p>The global conjuncture forced us to opt for a strategy of just staying in the markets that were already present. The challenge was not having to close any of the projects we already achieved. We are currently thinking of Africa as a possible next step, as well as to strengthen ourselves in the markets where we are already present.</p><h4>Communities and environment concerns remain two main challenges for the energy sector. How is CTAC committed to preserving the environment? </h4><p>CTAC maintains its commitment to the sector by offering technologies with zero environmental impact and with the willingness to work hand-in-hand with communities. We have examined different alternatives to contribute to the preservation of the environment and to benefit communities, through projects such as making an inventory of aquifers and monitoring them over time. The heart of our mission is to perform the exploratory process with a minimum amount of environmental impact, and during the extraction process to advise companies on how to make as little impact as possible, going only to the areas that really are profitable and environmentally viable to exploit</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our priorities for 2018 are to increase our presence in the markets where we are already present and to deepen the relationship with customers that we have been working on prior to the crisis in the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ISA holds COP43.409 billion in assets and has over 38,000 shareholders. What have been its main achievements over the past year?</h4><p>ISA has gone through an interesting 50 years. It is a mixed-ownership company, with 51% owned by the central government of Colombia, 10% by Empresas Públicas de Medellin (EPM), and around 40% free float. ISA has been recognized for the best corporate governance in Colombia two years in a row. It is run by people with years of experience as technicians, though it is also a company that incorporates several businesses. It is perhaps the largest Colombian multinational, or at least the one with the largest presence in Latin America.</p><h4>What is ISA's expansion strategy and its projects in Latin America?</h4><p>ISA is a multi-country and multi-business organization, and we have presence in a variety of places, including Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. On top of this, we have a small presence in Ecuador and Argentina via telecoms businesses. Additionally, in Panama and other countries in Central America, we also have 11% of investments in Empresa Propietaria de la Red (EPR) line that goes through Central America. In all these countries, especially in the ones where we have a large presence, the great news is that there are many opportunities to grow. Even though we have 80% of the market in Colombia, there are still many opportunities. In 2017, we were awarded the Copey-Cuestecitas transmission line, which is perhaps the largest line awarded in Colombia. In Brazil, we grew significantly; we acquired 46.1% control block stock of Taesa, the most profitable transmission company in Brazil. Moreover, our main company in Brazil, CTEEP, has about 19,000km of lines and is doing extremely well.</p><h4>ISA appears on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. What is your strategy to place ISA among the top sustainable companies?</h4><p>Given that we are a lineal infrastructure company, we touch many communities; therefore, we need to be extremely responsible, not only with the people who work for the company, our suppliers, and co-contractors, but also with the people that we touch. Even our logo conveys this; it is more open to the community and friendly because we want to send that message. The logo is accompanied by a manifesto that is carried by the whole company: Connections that inspire (Conexiones que inspiran). When Dow Jones comes every year to look at us, it digs deep into our work: how we honor contracts, how we create standards for our suppliers, and how we create standards to protect the lives of our workers that work in high-risk operations. We were recognized as the top company in the region in terms of social corporative responsibilities and sustainability. We have an amazing program called Jaguar Connection that we launched in 2016. It is a sustainability program created and developed by ISA, local communities, and experts. Its aim is to protect biodiversity and mitigate climate change through forestry projects in priority areas along with recovery and connection of jaguar habitats in countries where ISA is currently operating.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities to be accomplished in 2018?</h4><p>2017 was an amazing year for us as we hit all our targets; we were the best-performing company in Colombia in terms of profits. The main challenge is to do better than last year as Colombia is going through a difficult year, especially due to political changes. We are searching for potential countries for our future plans. We are looking at Argentina as well as Mexico. We are careful not to invest as much as we have done Brazil; our debt is legal according to international standards, though we are conservative in the way we manage it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[focusing-on-renewables]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of 2017 for Grupo Energí­a Bogotá?</h4><p>We continued reinforcing corporate governance in our company. It was extremely important for us to accomplish our goal of implementing 92% of the recommendations made by the OECD on Corporate Governance standards. This is an excellent base for companies to develop their business plans. It also shows our investors that management is aligned with the best international standards. </p><h4>How much did Grupo Energí­a Bogotá's profit increase in 2017, and what dividends will it pay out to shareholders this year? </h4><p>Grupo Energí­a Bogotá had remarkable results in 2017. We reported consolidated net income of USD525.7 million, that is up 16.4% from 2016. Moreover, we will distribute dividends of more than USD350 million, the highest in GEB's history, with a dividend yield of 5.7%.</p><h4>What strategies were behind the company's new rebranding, and what is its growth strategy for 2018?</h4><p>The market is not aware that we are a holding corporation. Our first message to the market is that we want to be recognized as a group of companies working at high corporate governance standards, like that of the OECD, while also caring for the environment and the communities that surround us. We are aiming for growth in 2018 in different countries such as Brazil, where there is a massive market for transmission and renewable energy. We are also considering the potential to make new investments in Mexico and expand business in Colombia where renewable generation will be a goal for 2H2018. We seek to develop large and strategic natural gas projects like the regasification plant at Buenaventura on the Pacific Ocean. Cálidda, a GEB company, is helping us expand operations in Lima, where we also seek to develop business with the industrial sector. Our new focus on the commercial areas has resulted in restructuring Cálidda in Peru and TGI in Colombia. </p><h4>How is the region positioned for renewable energy?</h4><p>Renewable energy offers a fantastic opportunity for GEB to generate energy from non-conventional sources, particularly, solar energy. Our group is a pioneer in renewable energy; we began generating hydroelectric energy more than 120 years ago. Through our associate Emgesa, we are one of the main electric power generators in the country, positioning us as number one or two in the Colombian market. Mexico and Brazil are also important to us, and we share the Colombian government's goal to increase electric power generation with green energy. </p><h4>What position is Grupo Energí­a Bogotá taking in terms of educating the public on a more sustainable electricity sector and environment in Colombia and in the region?</h4><p>We have many projects across Colombia and the region, and we develop social programs to care for the communities affected by those projects. Now, we are better-known for developing sustainable energy projects in the sector. One of the main targets of our organization is to use natural gas. TGI is our main gas transportation company in Colombia. Using our companies and developing strategic alliances, we foster the growth and increase our natural gas market share.</p><h4>How is Colombia positioned to meet national standards for emission targets?</h4><p>We have worked hard, but there is still room for improvement. For example, in Bogotá's mass transportation systems we must use the Euro Six technology. Our responsibility as an energy sector leader is to assist authorities and promote cleaner and more efficient energy sources. We can only provide a technical perspective, but final decisions are made by the city authorities. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>GEB is shifting from a municipality-owned entity to a private company that return cash dividends to its shareholders. The city, our controlling shareholder, has decided to divest 20% of its holdings in GEB; thus, we are working hard to show the market that we are an excellent group of companies. The city and its people need to commit to the GEB's Corporate Governance guidelines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your biggest challenges and accomplishments in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, we began to see the results of the work we did as an agency in charge of regulating and promoting the hydrocarbon sector during the 2016 crisis. Given the fall in prices in 2015 and 2016, our biggest task was to create incentives for companies to continue with their current contracts. In 2016, we fell to the lowest point, with 26 wells, given that our average previously was above 100. With the adjustment measures of the ANH and signs of recovery, companies honored the contractual commitments we had and increased our total of exploratory wells to 54. From 28 drilling rigs, we went up to 78. According to ranks of direct investment in exploration and development, companies increased their budgets by almost 80%. 2017 closed much more positively. Companies also showed clear signs of recovery, and many of them adjusted their business cost structures after the readjustment in the price of a barrel. This trend will grow as long as price levels remain stable. </p><h4>What is the current commitment to give the sector more stability?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have focused on making a much more attractive contract. In May, we implemented new regulation for assigning oil contracts in Colombia, establishing higher competitive terms than in previous contracts and using new ways to end a contract with mutual agreements. Now, there are new mechanisms for block distribution, new criteria for qualification and area allocation, and a proper method to define the company's exploratory objectives in relation to prices. We adopted these measures permanently in our contractual structure and are thus prepared for a renewed fall in prices. In the country's latest tax reform, we added a new incentive aimed at boosting interest in exploration and development, in order to increase our reserves. With these incentives, companies get a tax refund for every dollar they invest in exploration or the incorporation of new reserves in Colombia. This Tax Refund Certificate was recently regulated and is appreciated by companies—many have already submitted their proposals. Nowadays, we are seeking to increase the number of reservations in the country as we want companies to be able to carry out their activities in the region more easily.</p><h4>What are the initiatives that bring the industry closer to the communities in areas where projects are underway?</h4><p>Four years ago, we developed a recognized initiative called the Territorial Strategy of Hydrocarbons. This seeks to create dialog between communities, companies, and the national government to find points of agreement to facilitate the industry for communities to see their expectations regarding the industry, and for the government to receive tax benefits. We have to perfect these initiatives until there are territories more satisfied with exploratory activity. We have developed a pedagogical program in the regions to demystify the industry and counteract those who blame the industry. We have managed to articulate with all government entities to address social, environmental, and labor issues as well as the regulatory issues.</p><h4>What is your international strategy to promote the company?</h4><p>We have spent the last two years working to show our qualities at events worldwide. We have been in the US, the UK, Australia, Brazil, and Argentina, and have increased government investments to improve our geological knowledge of watersheds—that is, to lower our geological risk. While many top-100 companies have come to invest and operate inside the country, many others in this ranking are interested in Colombia's offshore investments.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges you face in 2018?  <br></h4><p>Colombia is a country characterized by its strong institutions and a clear separation of powers. The hydrocarbon sector has been vital to the country's economic health. We want to continue defending the sanctity of the contracts while maintaining the same levels of exploration. We also want to reach a level of production greater than 850,000 barrels. The utmost aim is to generate a constant and sufficient supply of oil in order to safeguard the future energy mix of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-al-tuwaijri-minister-economy-planning-saudi-arabia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Saudi Arabia capitalize on the demographic bonus of having a young population for the country's economic transformation?</h4><p>As His Royal Highness the Crown Prince mentioned, although we are a resource-rich country, our real wealth is our youth. Being a young nation is a strong enabler for economic growth, but to harness this advantage and reap the benefits of the country's demographic characteristics we must focus on education, job creation and access to employment opportunities and the provision of quality healthcare services. When it comes to education, we are focused on equipping our youth with high-quality education that is aligned with market needs, as this will enable the population to be active contributors to economic growth and progress. As for employment opportunities, there are a number of improvements in this area. The labor market reforms agenda is focused on addressing labor market segmentation, improving labor mobility, addressing the wage gap and reducing barriers to female labor force participation as well as obstacles to SME development. Efforts around female labor force participation span across mobility, suitable working environments and equitable investments in women compared to their male peers. With regards to SMEs, fostering an entrepreneurial culture will increase employment opportunities and nurture innovation. In essence, a skilled labor force with access to productive jobs will facilitate sustainable economic growth.</p><h4>What role should the government play in further diversifying away from the oil industry?</h4><p>Economic diversification is among the government's top policy priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the government is developing an approach and framework that identifies sectors and areas where our comparative advantages can be best realized. One notable example is the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program. This program aims to transform Saudi Arabia into a regional industrial powerhouse and logistics hub. Additionally, this strategy is complemented by efforts to strengthen the business environment and its increase attractiveness to entrepreneurs, both locally and internationally. Achieving these goals entails the implementation of coherent, consistent, and transparent policies and regulations that foster economic growth and diversification, so steps are being taken to remove the barriers and obstacles to productivity and competitiveness. With this, we aim to improve the structure, depth, and interconnectedness of the Saudi economy. These efforts will better integrate Saudi Arabia into the global economy and attract the right domestic and international investments. Physical and human capital are central to development, to delivering substantial economic and social benefits. The government continues to build and invest in infrastructure; quality infrastructure is needed to facilitate private sector activity and enable economic growth. In addition to infrastructure, the government has placed human capital development atop the policy agenda. Evidence shows that when human capital investments are made during the early years of one's life, they lay a particularly strong foundation for both adult prosperity and resilience, and the growth, diversification and competitiveness of economies. Investing in people through nutrition, health care, quality education, jobs and skills will help build the human capital needed for Saudi Arabia to realize its goals of economic diversification and sustainability. If left unaddressed, we will not be able to sustain economic growth, prepare the workforce for the more highly-skilled jobs of the future or compete effectively in the global economy.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>Over the past three years, the Ministry of Economy and Planning played, and continues to play, a significant role in the realization of Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program. In the future, the ministry seeks to develop greater topical and analytical expertise so that it can better support Vision 2030 and its various Vision Realization Programs. By focusing on strengthening policy research and analysis across various policy areas, the ministry will be better positioned to support the rapidly evolving and complex policy environment. We aim to add greater empiricism and evidence to the policy formulation process in the areas the ministry is currently focused on including economic diversification, labor market structural reform, social protection among others. A crucial success factor is the engagement with key stakeholders within the government and beyond, such as the private sector and NGOs. We are working alongside our partners in the public and private sectors to innovate when it comes to policy design and implementation efforts. Often times, poor communication and implementation can get in the way of a well-designed policy intervention or program.</p><h4>How do you envision the planning and coordination roles for the ministry going forward?</h4><p>Economic planning and policy coordination have been given new meaning in Saudi Arabia in recent years. The role of the ministry has grown and evolved well beyond its original mandate. Long-term planning is essential, but the policy landscape and context require that such planning be coupled with support that is dynamic, analytical and grounded in methods that will yield an evidence-based approach to policy making. Our envisioned role moving forward can be framed along the following dimension. First, using data driven methods and approaches to highlight the interdependence across many policy areas, such as labor, health and education. Ensuring an evidence-based approach to policy design and implementation is critical. Second, the facilitation of a rich and nuanced dialog alongside key stakeholders, as understanding the policy needs and preferences of stakeholders will allow us to better design and implement policies. Third, better coordinate policy efforts across ministries to prevent overlap and duplication of efforts. And fourth, use impact assessment tools to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of policies and programs in order to better inform the allocation of government resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[antonio-saravia-president-of-the-confederation-of-portuguese-industries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How do you define CIP's role in the context of business in Portugal?<br>The global economy is going through a series of rapid changes, demanding that organizations adapt to new challenges in the business context. CIP interprets these challenges and finds the best solutions, thus acting as a lighthouse that guides companies. CIP must focus on finding the answers to these new challenges. We represent 140,000 Portuguese companies and are the largest employers' confederation among 70 associations. The diversity of the companies that we represent provides us with a deep knowledge on the day-to-day activities and needs of our companies, replicating best practices that have worked for other companies in need.</p><h4>What are Portugal's current competitive factors and what needs to be done to improve them?</h4><p>We have an excellent communication network, great highways, and young people who are highly qualified. However, we still need to improve the qualification of our human resources, because it is through knowledge that differentiation among countries will prevail. Incorporating knowledge to create innovation will allow us to differentiate ourselves in the highly competitive game of the global economy. In addition, more structural reforms are needed. The wealth of the country does not support the dimension of the state we currently have. Portugal must improve the qualification of its human resources and free the state from activities that consume a great deal of the wealth generated in order to transfer the surplus to the economy. We must stimulate the improvement of competitiveness factors by reforming tax and reducing bureaucracy so it is less asphyxiating. If the state manages these points, then companies will be able to perform their roles far better.</p><h4>The profile of European commerce is changing. How do you see Portugal performing in the EU moving forward?</h4><p>Portugal is a small but open economy. It has had throughout its history a differentiation: its relationship with both Africa and the Americas. We have a virtuous triangle: Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Through our history, our culture, and the relationship with countries that speak Portuguese as an official language, Portugal can help the EU face the challenge of globalization. Our privileged relationships can bring greater synergies to Europe and simultaneously allow Africa and the Americas to see Portugal as the gateway to Europe. However, Europe also has challenges, its biggest being dissolution. It is not just Brexit, but also Catalonia and the autonomous movements in Spain. We also have to consider how Brexit reflects on the reality of the UK. These are challenges that are beginning to undermine European cohesion. If we start thinking about the future, we will have not one Europe but 27 states with distinct realities. Portugal through its historical relationship with the world has a great power of knowledge and this rich history can be utilized by Europe.</p><h4>What is the importance of strategy in terms of Portugal's efforts to change its industrial profile theme?</h4><p>Our Strategic Council on Industry released a publication called “Industrial Politics in Portugal in the Twenty First Century" about how Portugal can position itself in terms of industrial policies. The country cannot be based on services alone. For example, we have reduced the unemployment rate through tourism activities; however, the country cannot live on tourism alone. The sector is extremely volatile, and Portugal could lose its revenue from tourism. That is why we cannot rely on a service economy alone; we must also have an industrial base. The weight of industry in the economy must increase, and this can be reached with a well-defined strategy. Portugal must bet on sectors such as aeronautics or the maritime sector. The country must also look to traditional industries such as footwear and textiles, where we have excellent examples. Portugal must define its strategy and business model to diversify and improve. The country must know what it wants and what it can do; we have excellent examples in the metallurgical and metal-mechanics industry, where we are increasing sales and exports. There are great successes in the aeronautics industry, where Embraer and other companies have come to Portugal. Then, there is the automotive industry, where we are attracting companies through clusters that provide components to the sector. Portugal must define industries and within these definitions aggregate, develop strategies, promote reforms, and fiscally encourage possible ways to invest. We must attract productive investment and bring more national and foreign investments that will bet on internal production, substituting imports for internal manufacturing and developing more industry than what we currently have. The weight of industry in Portugal's GDP has fallen in the last 20 years, and we must bring back industry. This is what we represent with our work: the concept of re-industrialization to return industry to the center of the Portuguese economy.</p><h4>What are the priorities for CIP in the coming year?</h4><p>As a social partner, we will continue to demand that the government look at our internal politics and our role in Europe and the world. We want the government to promote reforms that must be undertaken. We need fiscal stability and our fiscal policy must be more predictable. We cannot change the fiscal framework every year; there must be an attractive fiscal policy toward investment. It must allow predictability for investors and ensure that taxes will not change in next five or eight years. The reform of the state must allow the economy to set itself free and entice stimulus so that it can benefit. We need a more efficient legal system with less bureaucracy in order to benefit economic agents. These are our key areas of focus, and we must focus on them until they are achieved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[engr-gbola-sobande-managing-director-crestech]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide and where does your main revenue stream come from?</h4><p>Crestech Engineering has been in operation for over 10 years. Our services include conceptual studies, through front end engineering design (FEED), detailed engineering design to construction follow-on engineering, project management and construction supervision. We are also gradually beginning to provide procurement services. We are one of the leading engineering services companies in Nigeria; we are in the top league in terms of providing engineering services to the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>What were some of the largest projects you were involved in?</h4><p>We have been involved in a number of brown field and green field inland basin and deepwater projects for the IOCs covering mainly FEED and detailed engineering design aspects. At present, our major effort is in partnering with Penspen Limited to provide project management services for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's (NNPC's) seven critical gas development projects.</p><h4>Are you bidding for more projects?</h4><p>Our commercial and business development team is the busiest of our departments this year and yes, we are currently bidding for a number of projects. We will soon mobilize for a major LNG front-end engineering design work; this is our biggest project for 2018, and the outlook shows that we will be getting involved in more major projects as the Nigerian economy continues to recover.</p><h4>What is your strategy to retain and gain new clients, and what is your competitive edge?</h4><p>We have an excellent reputation for quality and are in the final stages of securing international standards organization (ISO) certification for integrated management system (IMS). At the beginning of the year, we decided on a clear vision, an ambitious mission and a culture that will assure a sustainable future. Fundamentally, safety first in all we do; honesty, integrity and respect for people. Second, focus on the customer as king, because the customer determines our success. Third, it is important to remain cost effective and ensure value for money. We also aim to create a learning environment; therefore, training is vital. The culture we are building is highly influenced by my experience from Shell and GE. Structure is another thing where our integrated management system (IMS) comes into play. We are building a strong foundation for growth. It is inevitable for a company like Crestech to grow with the economy because of the reputation we have established; the company already sees signs of that in the big projects we are getting involved in. So, to summarize: a clear vision, an ambitious mission, sustainable culture and a structure for quality underpin our strategy.</p><h4>With more localization happening in Nigeria, how is your portfolio of clients evolving?</h4><p>One of our objectives in 2018 is to enter the indigenous market, so we are now bidding for several projects with companies such as Seplat and First E&amp;P, and the outlook is encouraging. We see the indigenous companies as the future of the oil and gas business in Nigeria. There is continuous divestment of land and swamp oil and gas fields to indigenous companies and a number of them are also going offshore.</p><h4>What are the existing challenges for companies like Crestech?</h4><p>One challenge is education and the quality of graduates being produced in Nigeria. Several decades ago, there was no difference between western and Nigeria-educated graduates. For example, when I returned from the UK, my colleagues from the University of Lagos or Ibadan or Ife or Ahmadu-Bello or Nsukka were just as qualified and competent as I was; unfortunately, standards have fallen over time. Nigeria needs to overcome this challenge. To that end, Crestech pays great attention to training and encourages interns to learn from us.</p><h4>Is Nigeria doing enough to unleash its potential of gas resources?</h4><p>The gas infrastructure in Nigeria is gradually being developed with new major pipelines. At the same time, the commercial aspects are also being addressed. A couple of the projects we are working on contribute to the objectives of the gas master plan, because for the domestic gas market and offshore gas market there is a need to develop the gas first. We need to find the gas, explore it, develop it, and produce it; we need the proper infrastructure to transfer the gas to its ultimate destination. Domestically, gas can be used for power plants and for LNG in the offshore market. It is of course paramount to set the commercial terms at levels that would attract foreign investment. Gas price has been an issue, and in the last few years it has received attention in terms of parity between how much one sells gas for the domestic and offshore markets. Equally important are the fiscal terms, and there are aspects that need to be addressed through the Petroleum Industry Bill to not only ensure that the price is right, but that tax, royalty, and other fiscal terms are made clear and all ambiguities removed.</p><h4>What fiscal challenges exist today?</h4><p>We always had incentives in terms of tax and customs duty that encouraged investors to develop the gas business, so one hopes those incentives will remain, so that there is the encouragement for companies to develop gas. Like I mentioned earlier, the gas price has improved; it was significantly lower than it is now. We are almost there, as there has been great improvement in the commercial terms to attract investors.</p><h4>What are your expectations from 2019?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry in Nigeria will continue to recover, and some of the projects that we look forward to will progress; specifically, additional gas and deepwater development projects should attain final investment decision (FID) in 2019. Overall, I see a more vibrant oil and gas industry than what we have seen in the past four to five years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[insuring-the-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the past year and what have been your main areas of business?</h4><p>2017 has been an excellent year for us in terms of growth and, more importantly, the adaptation of the new team we have built. JLT Re is the largest advisor on financial line risks, power, and aviation, and we could better develop the spaces in certain areas. As a consequence of that, we will achieve around 15-17% growth in 2017. It has been a fantastic year in the logistics and cargo insurance and reinsurance sectors, as well as for our financial lines practice with business in Colombia and Central America. Moreover, our marine and property teams have been successful, and we have secured major treaty clients, which is one of the last businesses we intend to grow in the coming years. As a client-first organization, we want to present our clients with the best offerings available in the global market. In essence, the tough market conditions that we will experience towards the end of 2017 and 2018 mean that JLT Re needs to be more ambitious, strategic, and agile to continue to provide the best offering to its clients.</p><h4>How important is Colombia to your regional operation?</h4><p>JLT Latin America has been a great success for the JLT group, and proof of that is the 15% weight that JLT LATAM has in JLT's global profits. Our competitors' weight in Latin America is much less than 15% or even 5%. Our business model has to do with us being a specialized broker in the sense that if the countries grow around infrastructure or invest in energy, those are the sectors we want to capture from a reinsurance broker standpoint. Colombia is important in the context of other operations in Latin America. The importance of this office goes beyond financial performance; it is more about knowledge. </p><h4>How has your portfolio changed over the years?</h4><p>There are three or four classes of businesses with areas of opportunity or spaces to capture. One is marine, as Colombia has developed a port industry in recent years and of the country's 18 ports, JLT Re only had one or two. We thus brought in a specialized marine broker from AIG to direct our marine practice. We also enhanced the financial lines team and brought in two new members: a cyber risk and a financial lines expert. The current theme around financial risks is cyber risks, with viruses and hacking problems; however, there are also a number of issues that come from individual risks. </p><h4>What is your strategy to find solutions for this line of business?</h4><p>When developing a business, we need to see the opportunity beforehand to plan and provide solutions to clients. It was a combination of anticipating needs and speaking with corporations around the world to receive feedback. We listen to clients, which is important as we think outside the box when addressing an exposure. When we started evaluating solutions for clients around cyber, an important element is bringing in people who truly have the knowledge. </p><h4>What are your goals and targets for 2018?</h4><p>The main space that we want to capture in 2018 is infrastructure. That is a core business for us and has been quiet for the last year, though we are optimistic about the increasing need of reinsurance solutions around infrastructure in 2018. We will continue to grow our treaty book, namely insurance companies coming to us and seeking our advice. Treaty business is a class of business that we want to grow dramatically because we are prepared to offer value for our clients on many fronts, not only transactional with the right price and coverage but also on the analytic part of the business with catastrophic modeling. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Raising Colombia’s Insurance Penetration]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[raising-colombias-insurance-penetration]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your operations over the past year?</h4><p>2017 has been a tough year for the insurance sector. The central government has not invested as expected in infrastructure and other areas of the economy. Colombia has placed the brakes on investment in all sectors. That directly affects the insurance sector, taking into account that we move in all the economic sectors. Perhaps new projects are being signed now; however, the new signings did not impact the dynamics of the sector until the end of 2017; it is possible that the market will experience the effects in 2018. On the other hand, it will be an election year and the first half of 2018 will have another rhythm as well. We are doing well, though it could be much better. We have approximately 5% of the market share and are increasing our production by approximately 15% YoY. We are not increasing our production as much as we like; however, the other companies are slowing down as well. Corporates make up about 90% of our clientele base.</p><h4>In Colombia, there is huge potential due to upcoming infrastructure projects. How do you foresee the sector and your company evolving?</h4><p>Unfortunately, Colombia has many regulatory changes that make it hard to plan a strategy in advance. In the past year and a half, the Superintendencia Financiera issued several rules for insurance companies that changed our entire business model. Some aspects have changed in a positive way; others, not as much. In the past two years, the regulator issued new reforms and regulations that changed the rules of the game. For example,  there are predictions that a new tax reform will be implemented six months after a new president is elected. If we do not have tax stability, it will be difficult to reach sustainable growth and maintain satisfactory levels of foreign investment. In addition, the regulator in Colombia always looks to the best practices in other countries to adapt them in Colombia, which also makes the market change often. There is another issue that slows down the sector and the economy in general, and this is the banking level of the local population, which limits the growth of certain businesses such as insurance companies. </p><h4>From a customer point of view, what is the difference in arranging a policy through a broker?<br></h4><p>Our business model is based on the work of our intermediaries; we do not have a direct sales force, though those intermediaries are highly specialized. In Colombia, there are approximately 25,000 intermediaries for insurance. Of those, we employ just 60 because we are a specialized company and are only willing to work with experienced representatives. That sets us apart from the majority of the competition. Our intermediaries are true partners in our business model.</p><h4>What initiatives is Nacional de Seguros taking to raise awareness of the importance of being insured?<br></h4><p>Ours is not a massive insurance product; therefore, the low penetration in the market does not directly affect the company. Colombia's insurance penetration is 1.6%, while the global average is more than 6%. However, considering that we are a specialized company in a specific product for a corporate niche, these figures do not directly affect us. We attract companies that we would like to have in our portfolio directly and in association with brokers.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We are an extremely new company and are still stabilizing our processes. Therefore, we first have to move past this stabilization process. We have to look to other sizes, and perhaps other and newer products. We are working on that right now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Corficolombiana has become the largest financial corporation in the country. How has the company evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>Corficolombiana is a financial institution that is regulated and supervised by the same regulator that supervises banks and other financial entities in Colombia. It is a special financial institution because the regulator allows Corficolombiana to take deposits from the public through fixed term time deposit certificates and savings accounts. In addition, it allows Corficolombiana, on the asset side, to undertake several tasks, such as investing in fixed-income instruments, equity investments, and loans. However, we currently do not lend money as we are part of a group that has four banks that provide loans. Over the years, there have been a number of mergers amongst financial institutions, and Corficolombiana is the result of mergers that were made at the end of the 1990s, when seven financial corporations merged. The last merger, which is perhaps the most important, was with Corporación Financiera del Valle in 2005. All these mergers have led us to build a solid portfolio of investments. Currently in Colombia there are four important financial corporations: Corficolombiana, JP Morgan, BNP, and Banca de Inversion Bancolombia, but the only one that truly acts in the market as a financial corporation is Corficolombiana. When we merged, we sold the portfolio of our loans to the banks in our group and focused on the business of investment banking, treasury, and equity investments.</p><h4>Are you considering expanding Corficolombiana to a regional level of operations?</h4><p>It depends greatly on the specific kind of business. The markets business is a more or less local business, where we participate in the government debt business. We participate in the FX market and the derivatives market on FX. In addition, we have companies that complement the markets business; we have Casa de Bolsa, which is a brokerage house and we have a trust company and a bank in Panama. Additionally, we have the investment banking business that is dedicated to advising on capital markets, bond issuance, equity issuance, M&amp;As, and project finance. Finally, we have an equity investment business where we focus on four investment sectors. We invest in energy and gas, where we have a significant participation in Promigas, a gas transportation and distribution business in Colombia and Peru. We are in the hotel business through Hoteles Estelar, where we have 31 hotels in Colombia, Panama, and Peru. We also have an important agro industrial business; we have 25,000ha of land, one in the center of Colombia and the other in the eastern part. Then, we have a concessions business. We have been in the road construction business since 1991; we have eight road concessions and two airport concessions. We were commissioned for 49.9% of Cali's airport together with AENA from Spain, as well as 11% of Cartagena Airport with AENA and other local investors.</p><h4>Corficolombiana is leading the construction of the Bogotá-Villavicencio road. Can you elaborate on the significance of this project?</h4><p>This is a 90km road that is significant because it connects Bogotá with Villavicencio and the entire eastern plains at Llanos Orientales. We know this road well and have been building and maintaining it for the last 25 years. We initially expanded the road from Bogotá to Villavicencio. Then, we started the construction of the second phase to convert the road into a highway, including certain important tunnels, for a stretch of 30km. These tunnels are some of the longest in Latin America.</p><h4>What is your priority and main objective for 2018?</h4><p>Our main purpose for 2018 is completing the execution of current road projects and evolving our proposal of joint added value in the markets business, together with financial entities. In terms of possible regional expansion, Promigas has a great potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-banking-sector-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Credit Suisse's main achievements and developments in Colombia?</h4><p>Credit Suisse has been in Colombia for 40 uninterrupted years, during which time we have been supportive of the country's development from many different angles. We have wide coverage of the private banking, asset management, and investment banking business. In terms of private banking business, Credit Suisse has been close to the most important entrepreneurial families in Colombia over the past 40 years. Credit Suisse's brand and footprint are set for the long term. We have patiently experienced all cycles of the Colombian economy and sociopolitical scenarios. Our achievement has been to establish ourselves as one of the leading banks in Colombia that has carried out landmark transactions both in the public sector and in private banking. </p><h4>Credit Suisse is well known for its integrated banking business model. How well does this model apply to the Colombian market?</h4><p>In wealth management, asset management, and investment banking, the profiles of the professionals and the business vary. The reason Credit Suisse offers these different segments is that they have many synergies, and business is generated by collaborating across divisions. Every part of the business is in constant communication to support our clients in a holistic manner in line with their needs. In addition, we offer lending to clients from the corporate side that require funding. For example, in early 2017 we granted a syndicated loan for which Credit Suisse not only arranged the syndication, but also contributed a large portion of the funds. In 4Q2017, we dispersed a loan to a private company supported by the borrower's cash flow generation. </p><h4>What is Credit Suisse's strategy to improve financial inclusion, a huge problem in Colombia?</h4><p>From a global perspective, Credit Suisse is celebrating 10 years of our Financial Inclusion Initiative. We are extremely active in working with financial inclusion-focused partner organizations around the world. From 2011 to 2014, we supported Women's World Banking on product development for gendered products in rural finance in Colombia and supported Opportunity International (OI) to implement their projects. Since 2014, Credit Suisse has supported OI in the delivery of its Education Finance program, a specialized loan product for school owners and school fee loans for parents to send their children to affordable, quality private schools, which is also implemented in Colombia. We also support the Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI) at Accion as a founding partner. The CFI serves as a think tank for the financial inclusion industry for advocacy and training, and produces research on many pressing topics, such as digital financial health and risks in the microfinance industry. In addition, we provide grant money and capacity building support to Accion's Venture Lab, its venture capital investment vehicle that invests Accion's money in fintechs with a financially inclusive business model. Last year, an executive and a female talent of Fundación Delamujer Colombia participated in the “Leadership and Diversity for Innovation Program" of Women's World Banking that teaches participants leadership tools and methods with the goal of strengthening the offering of financial products and services for women in the participants' institutions. </p><h4>What are your main goals and targets at Credit Suisse for 2018?</h4><p>It will be a challenging year for the whole region. First of all, there are a number of presidential elections coming up in the region. Second, many are looking to the US economy. Added to this, any movement on the tax reforms in the US will have a direct impact on the Latin American economy. Hence, there are internal and external issues that will impact Colombia in 2018. Currently, Colombia has maintained its investment grade, and the fundamentals still seem strong enough. Now, it will depend on what happens on the macro and micro levels. Despite this, the Colombian economy is in an excellent position right now, and the peace agreement is in place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[reinforcing-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major accomplishments has Santander achieved in the past five years?</h4><p>The mission of Santander Group is to contribute to the growth and development of people and companies. The Santander Group has a balanced geographical spread across its top 10 markets, where it also enjoys market shares in Latin America, such as Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. Colombia develops products distributed through the group's commercial networks to meet the needs of customers around the world and the country. Our major accomplishments are the consolidation of corporate banking services addressed to middle and large sized companies interested in enhancing their business overseas and opening branches in Colombia; the reinforcement of our social responsibility through our partner Universia, whose management started 15 years ago by offering services and supporting projects led by main Colombian universities focused on digital transformation, professional guidance, and implementing the “first job experience" for graduates; the consolidation of our credit finance solutions through Premier Credit, one of our five companies dedicated to design complete solutions to the manufacturer, dealer, and final consumer; and our investment banking company, Santander, born as a strategic partner in financing important infrastructure projects and offering M&amp;A services to global and local companies.</p><h4>How did Santander increase its operational income over 46% in 2017?</h4><p>Our business operational model has three pillars: loans portfolio, return on financial transactions, and fees. Our risk admission process allows us to have an extremely healthy and harmonious growth in our loans portfolio, as we can guarantee the level of duty of our customers when fulfilling their payment commitments. We also had an important and homogeneous growth in the return on financial transactions and fees, especially a greater impact on the latter, which create high value to the customers and group itself.</p><h4>Can you give us an overview of the specific products and services you offer international and local investors?</h4><p>As an international bank, we offer our customers the following services: an international desk for companies trading internationally; confirming and factoring with accurate and appropriate financial advice, such as the type of transaction, term, amount, currency, buyer, country risk conditions, and so on; a treasury desk linked to the Santander Group Treasury teams around the world to guarantee competitive trade conditions to our customers; global debt financing to offer specific and corporate business solutions for infrastructure projects within the country; exclusive financial solutions such as Export Credit Agreements (ECA) that allows Colombian companies to get excellent financing conditions in order to optimize their production equipment, expansion, and refurbishment of existing facilities; as well as a Nexus platform that allows multinationals access to all their banking accounts with one click and the ability to make transfers between all their branches.</p><h4>Why did you decide to start car loans?</h4><p>One of Santander's strategies is consumer finance services, and as a result of this knowledge, Banco Santander launched loan facilities for individuals. We took advantage of Premier Credit's understanding and experience in this market and, bearing in mind Santander's capabilities, we created a consolidated proposal addressed to the final consumer that goes through the needs of a multinational company and a local car dealer.</p><h4>What are your main targets and goals for 2018?</h4><p>We plan to maintain the healthy path of growth we have built in the last years, and for that reason we are investing in the best, people and tech, to develop the best services. Our main goal is to achieve 40% annual growth in our year-end closing results, continue to strengthen the corporate business by increasing our presence in the market, and thereby reinforce the operation. We recently set up Santander Services Securities, our trust company, focused on the custodian business. We are currently processing and requesting the mandatory licenses from the regulator, and we intend to conquer a relevant position in this market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main accomplishments of the bank in 2017, and what are your priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our main accomplishment was the reduction of inflation. A low level of inflation helps the economy grow more in the long run, protects Colombians' real income and contributes to sustainable and dynamic capital markets, among others. In June 2016, we had 9% inflation, and when I became governor in January 2017 it was 7.5%. We closed 2017 with 4.09%, and the goal is to move to our long term target of 3% in 2018. The reduction of inflation allowed us to reduce policy rates by 325 points, from 7.75% to 4.75%, our second achievement. Private banks also reduced most rates, active and passive, short term and long term, which means monetary policy has been transmitted to the rest of the economy. The only exception has been interest rates on consumption, which fell slowly, an event partially related to higher risk in an economy with slow growth. However, interest rates on consumption will fall once the economy recovers its long-term growth. The economy will probably grow 1.6-1.8% in 2017, a bad figure by Colombian historical standards, 2.7-2.9% in 2018 and 3.3-3.5% in 2019, close to Colombian potential GDP growth.</p><h4>How can the next government consolidate the economic recovery expected by the Central Bank in 2018?</h4><p>Growth in the last few years has been lower than in the past, not only in Colombia but in many other countries in the region. On the other hand, comparative evidence shows that the size of the negative shocks suffered by the Colombian economy was much higher than in other countries and much higher than during other shocks, including the 1930s. Oil prices fell much more than other commodities (i.e. metals), and the importance of oil in the Colombian economy is extremely high.</p><h4>What was the bank's first reaction to the drop in Colombia's credit rating?</h4><p>The market's reaction after the drop has been negligible: the exchange rate even fell (i.e. a revaluation) and bond prices increased. Neither the Ministry of Finance nor the Central Bank were expecting the drop, and we agree with the Minister of Finance: it is clearly unjust when focusing on outcomes (low growth and so on) instead of the adjustment process, which was correct. In other words, those policies implemented will help future growth and were needed.</p><h4>Which sectors will see stronger growth in 2018?</h4><p>In general, I am optimistic about future Colombian growth. Corporate taxation was reduced, a historic peace agreement was signed, financing conditions are excellent, and massive infrastructure projects have been undertaken. The large devaluation of the exchange rate in 2014-2016 will favor exports, manufacturing growth, and agriculture. Manufactured exports to the US and Ecuador are growing by 12% and 20%, respectively. Potential Colombian growth is larger than actual growth, with values close to 3.3-3.5%, a figure we expect to obtain in 2019.</p><h4>What is the Central Bank's macroeconomic outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We had a current account deficit of 6.5% in mid-2016 that stood at 3.7% at the end of 2017. This means the adjustment of the external sector is not complete yet. But the effects of most shocks will end in 2018: the devaluation of the exchange rate is gone, and the exchange rate has been extremely stable for more than 12 months; we hope that bad weather will not affect the economy this year; and there are no tax reforms in sight. Besides, oil prices have increased from USD30 to more than USD65 per barrel. The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2016 and 2017 is similar, despite the fact that a large company, Isagen, was sold in 2016. Portfolio flows continue to enter the country, helping us with the fiscal and external adjustments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since you set up operations in the country?</h4><p>We started in Colombia in 2010, when MetLife purchased Alico, a company specialized in life insurance. MetLife is celebrating 150 years of business in 2018, and since we set up operations in Colombia, we have experienced a significant YoY average growth of 20%, which has allowed us to gain market share and have an important footprint in the sector. </p><h4>What has been your growth strategy in Colombia?</h4><p>The most important way to grow in a country such as Colombia is to develop and strengthen different distribution channels to reach specific target markets and needs. One of the channels we have is face-to-face, where we develop consultancy services and analyze each customer to learn which products or services they require. In order to do so, we developed a specific and differential salesforce. At the same time, we explored other avenues such as mass and digital channels in order to impact a larger group of the population with lower premium and attractive insurance products. We currently have approximately 1.3 million policies. In our B2B channel, we distribute employee benefits programs for more than 350 companies, and we have more than 150,000 active customers. Our B2B channel works through our partner brokers, who are in charge of reaching out to multinational and top companies. While insurance companies and brokers in Colombia put a great deal of effort into improving insurance penetration through different channels, we still see a lot of potential to cover the market. </p><h4>How important is the business segment for you?</h4><p>Approximately, 70% of our business is made up of individual life insurances, in addition to corporate businesses and distribution agreements to reach low and medium income customers, multinationals, and SMEs. We are the only company in the market that has its own salesforce. We have approximately 900 employees, 500 of whom are face-to-face insurance agents. </p><h4>How has your portfolio changed over the years?</h4><p>We have grown faster than our direct competitors and have had greater market participation. In the individual insurance segment, we are the third-largest company. We have been able to increase our participation and earn a larger market share across all years.</p><h4>How important is educating customers to boosting your product, and how committed are you to creating a larger insurance market?</h4><p>It is a huge challenge for a company such as MetLife to contribute to insurance penetration in this country. The premiums from life insurance are a great indicator of a country's economy. Many of the economic indicators that are conducted by developed economies are penetration analysis of different types of insurance over GDP. Developed economies have the possibility of having insurance to cover the cost of catastrophic events and ensure that people can continue their lives unaffected. The insurance penetration in the most developed economies accounts for around 6% of GDP, while in Latin America it is closer to 3% and in Colombia just 2.8%. </p><h4>What are the challenges and goals for MetLife in 2018?</h4><p>The biggest challenges for us are to continue strengthening our competitive differential in terms of distribution, radically increase our salesforce volume, and innovate in terms of digital sales tools. Another challenge is to be agile enough to design and update products to be in line with changing demands. Our products are designed to satisfy the needs of 20% of the Colombian population; hence, one of our largest challenges is to design and offer distribution and product solutions for medium-income people, which amount to 34% of Colombia's population. With that covered, we would be able to serve more than 50% of the total population. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Toward Universal Energy Coverage]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[toward-universal-energy-coverage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your commitment toward a resilient energy and mining sector here?</h4><p>The unit must ensure the national supply of energy and minerals. In that sense, we have to plan for electrical energy, hydrocarbons, and mining, and from that a lot of related activities are derived to be able to guide investors, which is our main focus, in terms of transport, transformation, and usage. The goal is to allow a complete supply, and we have suggested mandatory plans. We must also evaluate projects with applicable tax incentives as non-conventional sources of energy and for energy efficiency projects in transport, industry, household consumption, and buildings. We participate in the evaluation of public funds to promote energy efficiency. In post-conflict issues, we also have an interesting role in evaluating projects that aim to extend coverage. We have almost universal energy coverage but still have some gaps. We are also committed to the use of modern fuels in Colombia and the substitution of wood. We have a commitment to the country to build the required electrical transmission infrastructure. The planning work at an institutional level is rare. In that sense, we believe we can be leaders in Latin America in terms of energy and mining planning.</p><h4>What commitments do you have for the development of those areas which are highly undeveloped?</h4><p>In terms of planning, there are two Colombian institutions specifically in extractive activities: the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) and the National Mining Agency (ANM). We use their information to plan, which in turn gives them more information to do their work. One of the objectives of the mining plan is to guide ANM in terms of title assignation. In terms of energy coverage, we evaluate public projects, and another part is accomplished by evaluating projects of coverage expansion for energy transport infrastructure and credit opportunities to achieve this in 10 years. In terms of fuel, the strategy is incomplete. We do have the trouble areas localized and the alternatives to address them, but have not advanced in terms of implementation.</p><h4>What is your strategy for renewable energies?</h4><p>The ministry issued a decree on energy policy less than a month ago, and it establishes that long-term contracts must have certain characteristics related to diversification of the matrix, resiliency, and other criteria, contributing to the financial leverage for renewable energy contracts. In our work of ensuring transmission infrastructure, we have chosen investors that allow us to bring renewable energy from the places where it is abundant, basically the north of the country, on La Guajira peninsula. We also give tax incentives to goods and services related to the supply of energy from non-conventional sources. The regulatory commission just expedited a resolution to boost the small-scale production of renewable energies. We also plan the generation and transmission to allow the development of renewables. We are also participating in the project of the ministry to have a tender, and this is widely expected. We also do a constant evaluation of which resources are available. We have an atlas of solar, wind, and hydro power resources. For natural gas, we can ensure the supply for the next decade, largely thanks to the increasing production capability of our gas fields.</p><h4>What are the challenges for 2018?</h4><p>The main challenge for the next government is to launch the national energy plan, or at least have it in discussion and development. It has been 10 years since we launched the last formal plan. The refined products supply plan, regarding the supply of fuel and diesel, must also be discussed. The third challenge is related to our work to reopen the regasification plant and the related gas pipe—a structure worth USD700 million—through the ministry's first renewable energy tender. The way to promote this internationally is to have clear rules and infrastructure for the purchase and a contract that makes the projects profitable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Better Environment for All]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[better-environment-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments of Aseo Urbano de la Costa since its creation?</h4><p>Aseo Urbano de la Costa belongs to the SALA Group, which is made up of 20 companies that began operating 22 years ago to provide environmental solutions in water and waste. Our company was established in Cartagena in 2006. We are in charge of the collection, transport, and final disposal of waste. Since 2006, one of our main developments has been to expand the coverage of our services to 48.5% of the continental part of Cartagena de Indias and to 100% of the insular zone. There was no such service in these islands, so one of our greatest achievements was to reach this area. There is no regulation in Colombia for the collection of waste in this area, even after having been in the market for 12 years. However, we provide our service there even when it sometimes takes us six hours to arrive and six hours to return. When we provide a service, innovation must go beyond the standards that impose limits. In Colombia, these standards do not grow along with real needs. At first, people were skeptical; now, the government has adopted the service using containers that allow the temporary storage of the waste before its final disposal.</p><h4>How is Aseo Urbano de la Costa committed to creating a better environment for Colombia?</h4><p>The provision of a public service in Colombia must be updated in accordance with global trends and economic growth. We make innovations focused on the environment that generate benefits and wellbeing both for the community and our staff. Our employees have grown from 220 to 730, all with labor rights. On the other hand, because we are a solid company in the market, we do not require subcontracted personnel. The company is committed to the use of waste. In Colombia, we only recycle 17%. We collect 18,000 tons of waste annually in Cartagena de Indias, which is only 48.5% of the continental part of the city, and we take advantage of 2.6%. We need to raise awareness among generators to reduce the amount of unusable waste that is disposed in landfills and increase the percentage of usable waste. We are working with the exploitation program in our area of service provision. We hire experts in the field to educate ourselves about the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste generated so we can be more sustainable from the environmental point of view.</p><h4>Have you considered expanding your operations to bigger cities like Bogotá?</h4><p>As a company, we have a presence in Bogotá with a provision of non-regulated services. In Colombia, there are two types of waste collection services: regulated, which are oriented to households, and unregulated, which are related to private entities. We are the first business group in Colombia that performs the collection of hazardous and hospital waste. We provide portable cleaning services in Cúcuta, Villa del Rosario, Los Patios, Cali, Pasto, Mocoa, Yopal, Aguachica, and Cesar through some of the companies that belong to the group.</p><h4>How do you work with local communities?</h4><p>The success of our work is measured by social work. We have a social management area that focuses on communities. In Cartagena, in the area we serve, we work together with a team of 12 people. In Colombia, a company cannot succeed if it does not have a social team that measures the impact of the actions developed in education and environmental campaigns. This applies even more to us because we provide our services to communities where 85% belong to socioeconomic strata 1, 2, and 3. We carry out intensive educational work with educational institutions, community leaders, foundations, industrial, residential, and commercial clients with the objective to make users aware of the separation in the source, storage, and presentation of waste. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strategic-expansion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Grupo Argos evolved and what have been its main achievements over the years?</h4><p>This group is defined as an infrastructure holding in the Americas with a presence in 18 countries, including the US and many Central American, Caribbean, and South American countries. We have three main strategic businesses: cement, power generation and distribution, and airport and toll road concessions. Our company has USD16.8 billion in assets under management and revenues close to USD5.6 billion. The company was founded in 1934 as a cement company in Medellí­n and emerged over the years from being a local player to acquiring cement operations throughout the Americas. In early 2000, we decided to go abroad and develop an international growth strategy in the region. Today, Cementos Argos has a large presence in the US, from whence we derive 55% of our revenues, and 14 territories in the Caribbean and Central America, not to mention Colombia. In 2012, we decided to move from a cement company to a holding with the strategy of being an infrastructure holding.</p><h4>How do you ensure synergies amongst such diversified businesses?</h4><p>We are not a portfolio investor but actively participate in the strategic decision-making process of all our subsidiaries. We are a hands-on holding. Thus, in conjunction with the boards and management in the operating businesses, we define our strategy in terms of where we will expand, the assets we want to acquire, the debt and capital structure, and the geographic area we want to be in for each business. We actively decide where to allocate capital between businesses. As a holding, we focus on four main areas: strategic design and execution; financial, institutional, and strategic talent development; governance practices, sustainability, and innovation policies; and the promotion of synergies between subsidiaries. In 2017, we implemented a shared competences center for the group that had huge savings. </p><h4>What is your strategy to remain one of the main sustainable companies in the region?</h4><p>We defined our strategy as a balance between economic, social, and environmental performance. As a company, we want to act in a responsible way with society and the environment producing superior returns to our investors. Today, I cannot conceive of a business that only focuses on making money; a company must be responsible in the way that it conducts business, treats people, interacts with society, and creates value for the community where it operates. For the last five years, we have been part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and this year we received the 2018 Gold Class as the most sustainable company in the sector by the RobecoSam Sustainability Yearbook. </p><h4>What are Grupo Argos's main priorities and goals for 2018?</h4><p>We will keep seeking ways to create more value for our shareholders. Our strategy recognizes that we create value through organic and inorganic growth and being selective in making sure that any possible acquisition generates value for shareholders. In parallel, we are working extremely hard on efficiency and boosting the productivity of the businesses, especially with the cement and power generation subsidiaries. Efficiencies have increased tremendously, though there is still some room to make further improvements. Grupo Argos has developed a core competence and clear track record in building and operating correlated business platforms in the Americas, which we will use to expand. Although we will not shy away from acquisitions, we will be selective and very proactive in having more organic growth over the short term in our businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights of 2017 for ProBarranquilla?</h4><p>ProBarranquilla, like in other sectors, needs to continually revamp and update itself to continue contributing to the development of the region and the country. We have done this traditionally with attractions and amusement; however, now we have the great project of venturing into other strategic areas in this region to make Barranquilla more visible and promote the city. We want to convey the history of Barranquilla to local and international visitors. We want to explain what is happening here, the investment opportunities, the quality of life, and the feelings of pride and belonging in Barranquilla. We are working hard not only to attract investment but also to attract national and international events such as fairs and conventions related to the city's most successful industries. The economic spillover of these events helps to generate business. We also have exciting challenges; we want to move forward and be the pioneers in Colombia in attracting human talent. We will achieve this goal so long as the city has a value proposition that responds to the needs of this human talent. This proposal should consider cultural and educational issues, open areas, security, and everything else that is definitive when it comes to deciding where to live and work</p><h4>What are the most important attractions of Barranquilla for local and international investors interested in the region? </h4><p>Barranquilla is a multicultural and migrant port city. It is open to national and foreign investment. Investors who have come here have not encountered resistance, and that is key. However, the most important thing is that Barranquilla is open to transformation. The public and private sectors can work to transform the city. We can see this in the low level of unemployment, high public investment per capita, and significant infrastructure. Barranquilla is a long-term city, and this perspective affects the city in economic, cultural and social aspects, improving the quality of life and social cohesion. Investors find favorable spaces for business, free zones, industrial parks, and ports. In addition, they see excellent human resources, bilingualism, and a city that is committed to positioning itself and taking the business forward.</p><h4>How has ProBarranquilla worked to promote the city abroad?</h4><p>They are not missions pointing to a single result nor are they linked to a unique ProBarranquilla strategy. The missions have different objectives, and we have an extremely dedicated team committed to this work to identify sectors and opportunities. Some missions go to events to talk with investors who are evaluating investment opportunities in Latin America; other missions are in charge of completing work to identify and strengthen sectors we want to develop. Barranquilla as a city has a clear commitment to become a complete platform that provides services to the industry to the extent that we have decided to explore areas beyond the Caribbean Sea. ProBarranquilla is part of the board of directors of World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA), and we represent the Latin American investment agencies. WAIPA also has offices in Geneva and Turkey. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2018? </h4><p>ProBarranquilla wants to promote international cooperation. We focus on attracting national and international investment. We also want to help local companies expand to develop urban transformation. The sectors with the greatest potential are renewable energy, offshore, chemical industry, plastics, mechanics, and agroindustry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Zona Franca Metropolitana's main accomplishments in the last two years? </h4><p>We currently have 16 companies in the free trade zone. Currently, 40% of the project's area has been built up, while 26% is in construction, which we expect to complete in about three years. We cover sectors of logistics, the automotive industry, services, and manufacturing and are open to receiving all economic activities. Our goal is to reach technology, services, business process outsourcing (BPO), and pharmaceutical companies. We currently have a technology and pharmaceutical organization, and companies from the technology and pharmaceutic sectors. 70% of the companies here are local, while 30% are international. The ones that moved to the free trade zone four years ago have seen consistent growth. They are pleased with us and the regime in general, especially since the government has amended certain taxes and policies. The area where Zona Franca Metropolitana is located is expensive for companies that require a great deal of land, so logistics companies, BPOs, call centers, and technology offices prefer to use multi-story warehouses so they can use the different floor space according to their needs.</p><h4>What is your main strategy to bring more international investors to the free trade zone?</h4><p>If a company needs to be in Bogotá for different reasons, such as the market, sales, and customs, then Zona Franca Metropolitana is the best place to be. It is located close to main highways, El Dorado International Airport, and the center of the city. For logistics, it is the perfect location. We offer all the benefits of a free trade zone. In 2017, we developed a specific strategy to attract pharma companies, starting a joint venture with the CEO of a Colombian pharmaceutical company who had developed a marketing plan to attract similar foreign companies, which has now attracted several companies to the country. IT companies like certain areas for their green energy, cost savings, and visibility, and we have areas within our free trade zone for each of these. Furthermore, we are planning a project with a solar company to use all the warehouse roofs for low-cost energy generation, in addition to having three rings of fiber optics. On the other hand, for logistics, we have the top specifications for warehouses, which are equipped with everything that multinational logistics companies need from around the world.</p><h4>How is Zona Franca Metropolitana different from other free trade zones?</h4><p>We are the smallest free trade zone, but otherwise the logistics are the same. Being the smallest allows us to eliminate bottlenecks for products or employees coming or going from the facilities—everything is just easier. We also have many green areas inside the location, rooftop gardens as well as parks, which contribute to increasing people's levels of happiness, especially for service companies or call centers, where there are many employees. We are considering expanding to a nearby plot of land, but this is a specific business, which means there are many conditions that must be met first.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the current transport and logistics situation in Colombia?</h4><p>In terms of efficiency and the cost of logistics compared to other countries, Colombia is extremely efficient, even though we do not have the best highways or ports, and the capital is in the middle of the country. On the coast, Colombia's logistics are even more efficient. We export flowers and coffee, among many other goods. Export companies always need to use air transport, so in order to compensate for those costs, they need to be cheap.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the coming year?</h4><p>We need to sell and rent more areas and need as many new companies to enter Colombia as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DDW was recently acquired by DP World. How has the integration of activities gone thus far, and how does DDW strengthen DP World's maritime services business?</h4><p>We integrated Drydocks World, P&amp;O Maritime, P&amp;O Ports, P&amp;O Marinas and Dubai Maritime City into one group, the Maritime Services Division (MSD) of DP World. Consolidating these companies improves their efficiency and effectiveness, through beneficial synergies across the group in enhanced specialized services, refined business strategies that maximize the skills of each entity, and streamlined processes to achieve significant improvements. Before the official integration of the companies, we spent a long time on the necessary due diligence, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each company, which is key to successful integration. We found a number of great aspects, as well as some required improvement areas. Now we are developing and aligning the companies, implementing changes to evolve the competitive position of each entity under MSD. Being associated with the large DP World Group provides massive potential. In Dubai, we have the largest single-company operated port, and there are 25,000 different vessels coming through the port. Together MSD has around 320 vessels of all kinds, with these vessels requiring maintenance and rebuilds, that can benefit from services within the group. We have also considered the competitive environment in our business with Saudi Arabia recently announcing that it will invest in the Gulf's biggest and most modern shipyard. We are aware of these developments and understand how to position ourselves to remain competitive and continue capturing business. To succeed in today's constantly changing global marketplace, the newly formed MSD group is structured to adapt to new conditions, continuously improve business processes and upgrade facilities with innovative technology. At Drydocks World, the yard benefits from an excellent location in the center of Dubai—a city that aims to be the cleanest in the world, and we would like to follow this excellent environmental objective. We want to bring added value through the testing services available in our marine section and restructure Drydocks World to utilize solar for our energy needs. Drydocks World is skilled in producing specialized vessels, including high-quality tugs, and we have a number of projects globally that are focused on creating innovative vessels. The yard can do many other specialized work, such as construction of crane frames, since we have the most sophisticated and diversified engineering welding team. We were recently approached by the UK Atomic Energy Authority to produce special cylinders for a nuclear station, and we are also working with international banks and oil firms to clean the unused and derelict rigs polluting the North Sea. Drydocks World is an open-minded company that is always looking for ways to grow and expand; under the MSD group, the yard can draw on synergies from our other business units to create improved strengthened performance.</p><h4>With oil prices on the rise in the past year, what opportunities do you see for your offshore services and other oil-related activities?</h4><p>Drydocks World wins a large number of tenders and consistently delivers a superior quality of service. We have diversified into a more production-oriented repair and maintenance business and we will continue working in the gas industry, with numerous LNG vessel projects. The yard also has quite a number of rig and turret projects ongoing and we plan to have a core business that can bring new technology overhauls. The real offshore opportunities are in removing obsolete vessels; positioning Drydocks World as an expert in vessel removal will put us in an advantageous position. Our Global Offshore Services team can provide maintenance and engineering quickly and efficiently for different types of vessels, at any offshore locations worldwide, bringing the expertise in our yard globally.</p><h4>What new business do you plan to capture?</h4><p>We are negotiating with clients from various sectors, including the navy &amp; passenger vessel owners, to create tailored innovative solutions to meet their specific needs. We also hope to capture more business overhauling the large LNG vessels: at the moment, we have 23% more business going on than at the same time in 2017. The yard is currently working at 100% capacity, and improvements are being made to this capacity by sharpening our focus to ensure all business processes are more efficient. New specialized people are being hired, and additional capital expenditures are being evaluated for robotic technology in the yard. At Drydocks World we are not worried about competition, and rather take it as an impetus to be better. Our diverse services and facilities are capable of handling any type of vessel, are situated near to the largest port and economic free zone, as well as in close proximity to the Dubai city center and marinas. We are carefully positioning ourselves correctly in the market, to ensure our abilities capture all the industry growth opportunities in a competitive way. </p><h4>What are some of the catalysts for growth for Dubai's maritime sector?</h4><p>Currently, China is the major hub of maritime activity, though Dubai's importance remains, considering the amount of vessels moving through the region. Historically, Dubai is a maritime city, and we continue this proud tradition. In order to be a hub, we need to offer a full scope of services, since Dubai indeed attracts many types of maritime activity. Drydocks World has acted to ensure that we do not negatively impact the ecology and health of the city, or degrade the environment. To this end, the yard recently installed additional filters to our dry docks, in order to ensure that the water going back to the ocean is clean. Sustainable growth is of great importance, and alongside the development of our yard, we will continue to take the right steps to preserving the surrounding ecosystems.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Drydocks World is fortunate to have a visionary chairman and the largest dry dock facilities, which are great assets to achieve growth. We are now properly restructuring the company and aligning ourselves with projects of every type and size. On-time delivery and quality services are highly valued in the market, and are of the utmost importance in the yard. As we continue to invest and diversify, I am confident we will continue to grow. Drydocks World has over 240 clients, which is significant but not satisfactory. We are looking to create value-added services that will attract new clients. We have worked to outfit and repair some of the most high-profile and expensive yachts in the world. This is a niche market that requires gifted workers with excellent skills, and an area in which I foresee growth. The yard is positioned to offer excellent services to many areas of our operations, including yachts, navy vessels and advanced specialized ships. Innovation and technology play a central theme in our outlook and strategy going forward, and will act as a catalyst for our business to advance ahead. 2018 is full of opportunity and growth for Drydocks World, as well as the MSD group; by thinking ahead, innovating and adapting to change, we will generate significant growth in our global services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did the Nutresa Group achieve in 2017?</h4><p>Nutresa is a Latin American-wide company with direct activities in 14 countries and sales in 75 around the world. In 2017, the group had a less dynamic consumption but gradually recovered toward the end of the year. Real household expenditure also gradually recovered, as did consumer confidence. Nutresa had a good year; it grew 2.5% in sales in Colombia, reaching COP5.5 billion. In the international market, we grew 5.7% in dollar terms. This growth was organic and does not include any acquisitions. Altogether, we reached total sales of COP8.7 billion and profitability of COP1.04 billion, or a margin of 12%, which was our goal. The growth of exports from Colombia was significant in achieving this, and we grew 19.4% in dollar terms in this sector. However, innovation was also important. Of the total sales of Nutresa in 2017, 20.2% were in innovation—products that did not exist three years ago. From a growth in sales and profitability perspective, it was a good year. We had a stronger commercial dynamic outside of Colombia, but there were positive figures in both markets. 2018 should see even greater growth and profitability. Nutresa also continued to be a leading global company in sustainability; we were part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year and went Silver Class for the fourth time. </p><h4>What has allowed you to have this growth? </h4><p>We have the right business model and strategy. Our business model has three main pillars. First are the people. We work with good people, develop local talent, and invest in human capital in every country in which we operate. The second are the brands. We look for local, strong, and appreciated brands and try to have the best relationship between price and perceived value. The third is our distribution capacity and the ability to deliver the entire value offer. Nutresa has a sustainable and effective innovation frame, to which we added the productivity frame this year. With sustainability, we guarantee results in the medium and long term and work to generate economic, social, and environmental development. The innovation frame also allows us to question what we do to improve processes and products, while the productivity frame help us to make efficient use of all our resources. </p><h4>How is Nutresa committed to Colombia's development? </h4><p>At Nutresa, sustainability is not something isolated from the strategy but central to it. We analyze materiality. We care about knowing the related groups and their expectations and needs before integrating this knowledge into the priorities of the company. In addition, we analyze risks and opportunities. When we do these, we set six priorities related to sustainable development and make plans that allow the company to develop and simultaneously contribute to the achievement of these goals. Because of this, we have extensive supplier development projects such as inclusive projects related to cocoa. Speaking of eco-efficiency, we have goals to reduce energy consumption per ton produced, not to mention water and carbon emission. These are our goals for 2020 and are aggressive, but we have made impressive progress. The plan was to reduce greenhouse gases by 33% by 2020, and we have already reached our 10-year goal. For each ton produced, we have 41.4% fewer greenhouse gases. We want to reduce energy consumption by 25% in those 10 years, and have already done so by 17.3%. From the original goal of reducing water consumption by 30%, we have already lowered it by 28.1%. </p><h4>How will you maintain productivity and growth while lowering your energy consumption?</h4><p>We have many environmental efforts that are also productivity challenges. If through the redesign of processes, technology, and training we can be more efficient and use resources better, we will improve our competitiveness and lower our environmental impact. There is a lot of human effort and innovation behind these projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bilateral-for-the-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Britcham's main achievements over the past year? </h4><p>In Colombia, business has changed for many companies, sectors, and entrepreneurs. In the past, we were focused on oil and gas as well as mining operations and service industries. The fall in prices caused a reduction of many affiliates. This demanded a new strategy and business plan from Britcham Colombia. From the start of the plan, we sought to chart a new course based on new sectors, especially when Colombia, as an emerging economy, was promoting an interesting offer in infrastructure, energy development, technology, innovation, manufacturing, environment, agribusiness, education, IT, and tourism, among many others. Colombia has improved investor confidence, sparked interest among new investors, and can be viewed as one of the most reliable countries in Latin America. The most important achievements were supporting UK companies investing in Colombia, organizing a number of training seminars, opening the government's doors in terms of certifications and services, and supporting Colombians investing in the UK. As a result of our new strategy, Britcham is supporting Colombians considering setting up business in the UK, a market where this has traditionally been difficult. We are committed to the success of those SMEs, large Colombian companies, and entrepreneurs being driven by UK authorities and associations in different sectors.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for UK investors? </h4><p>The ecotourism industry is certainly ready to be developed. For example, the UK has recently discovered bird watching biodiversity in Colombia, an opportunity that we have started to promote among travel consultants that cover three different regions. We have connected two potential companies that will result in a tourism corridor with social inclusion programs and indigenous families being trained as part of the agreement. This will result in new economic activity and income for impoverished communities.</p><h4>What are the main challenges foreign companies face when setting up shop in Colombia?</h4><p>With global coverage of the peace process, an increased security effort in different regions, and hundreds of new investors telling the story through the growth expectations achieved, the most attractive aspects of Colombia are its market of 47 million people and its educated and growing middle-class. Colombia also provides access to neighboring LATAM markets and distributors. Granted, the recent tax reform has resulted in certain issues for various industries, with some companies leaving the country while others have set up new long-term business goals. Colombia has faced difficult times; however, the expectations are always positive, and 2018 should result in a new long-term business view. Foreign investors see a promising economy.</p><h4>How do you foresee bilateral investment relations evolving, especially in light of Brexit?</h4><p>Brexit does not worry Colombian exporters or British investors. Talking to members of both governments, there are still excellent opportunities to be found. Both governments will move forward with signing a new bilateral agreement, gathering from the experience of the FTA with the EU and introducing better benefits for both countries. Furthermore, the Pacific Alliance will translate into greater market integration, which means connecting a larger economy in terms of people and opportunities. Colombia offers opportunities in various areas for the UK government, both politically and commercially, after the peace process. There are important resources coming from different funds that demonstrate the UK's commitment and confidence in the government. During the 2016 state visit, for example, both countries were represented by their finance ministers, who signed a double taxation treaty that will be ratified in 2018. This will encourage the business communities in both and result in increased trade. In 2017, there were more than 12 important UK government visits, incoming trade missions, and a trade envoy seeking to increase bilateral trade in Colombia. We expect even better results in 2018.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the business environment in Bogotá over the past year? </h4><p>Bogotá maintains an excellent business environment. Our agency has been named for the third consecutive year as one of the best investment agencies in Latin America and the Caribbean, which is a sign of the environment. Moreover, Bogotá ranks fifth in Latin America for having the most attractive economy to do business, according to America Economia. It is an attractive city to invest in; although there has been a small economic slowdown, the Colombian economy is still one of the fastest-growing in Latin America. Bogotá continues to be a city with one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America. We are reaching a turning point and believe that 2018 will be better, since the peace negotiations in Colombia will begin to bear the fruits of economic growth and stability. The company was also awarded for having the Best Project in Latin America and the Caribbean at the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) in Dubai. </p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for investors?</h4><p>Sectors such as medical devices, consumer products, pharmaceuticals, software &amp; IT, and building materials are still strong contenders; however, the service sector must also be mentioned, given it generates 62% of Bogotá's GDP. We are also currently promoting the creative industries, which is already giving some early results. For example, HBO has already entered Colombia to carry out cinematographic and television production work, not to mention others that have already entered the market in Bogotá, such as FOX and certain Spanish companies. We have also incorporated the health services sector: a large Chilean company offering telemedicine services has already entered the market. We are optimistic for larger infrastructure projects to also continue improving our competitiveness. The Bogotá Metro, improvements to the Bogotá airport, a wastewater treatment plant, an airport-city tram, public hospitals, cycle paths, and public parks are just the first that come to mind. For all these, foreign investment is welcome, given they are public-private partnerships (PPPs).</p><h4>How has your Strategic Plan 2017-2020 evolved since we spoke last year?</h4><p>From the beginning, we have supported more than 290 FDI projects in our city, which have generated more than 32,000 jobs. In 2018, we expect to get 40 new projects in the creative industries, infrastructure for city projects, biotechnology, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, professional services, construction materials, and processed food.</p><h4>What is the main challenge for a company that wants to invest in Bogotá?</h4><p>The most difficult thing for companies is to first identify business opportunities—that is where we come in. Rare is the company that does not invest in Bogotá after our advice; fully 95% continue the investment process after meeting with us. Our subsequent challenge is to grow in the national and international market, use Bogotá as an export platform, and always look for companies that generate the greatest added value to the city and generate more and higher quality jobs. These are our three main challenges to attract investment. We are proactive and go out looking for companies—we do not wait for them to come looking for us. We do over 30 promotion campaigns, of which more than 20 are abroad.</p><h4>Bogotá is expected to outgrow the country in relative terms. What will drive this?   </h4><p>The first thing to do is bring new investors to the city and generate impact projects in the sectors where we are interested. This includes added value, quality employment, and innovation in using Bogotá as an export platform and attracting anchor companies here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the agency evolved over the past 15 years?</h4><p>We have been working extremely hard in the past 15 years to create a better Medellí­n, not because we want a better reputation in the world, but because we want to provide a higher quality of life for the people who live here and those who visit us. We have been working in different businesses, attracting international cooperation as well as national and international investment. We are doing great, not only because we have solid numbers, but because those who bet on a new field of expansion are able to find the human talent they need here. We want to be different and do not need to compare ourselves to other Colombian or Latin American cities. We want to give foreign investors the confidence that Medellí­n is the ideal place where they can create a platform to open up new local, regional, national, and international businesses</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the 'Why Medellí­n?' event hosted in Mexico last year?</h4><p>We have one tool to attract international investment, and we call it 'Why Medellí­n?' which seeks to capture the attention of businessmen, entrepreneurs, and investors and demonstrate that we know how to play in the international field. Today, we are partners in the Pacific Alliance. Medellí­n is now host to many large projects in different fields, including manufacturing, services, logistics, and education. We will renovate the city's downtown area and invest COP4.2 billion every year until 2019 on this project alone. We want to make our downtown different and enjoyable. This will be a PPP, and both the private and public sectors are working hard on this. Even though Colombia's GDP growth for 2017 was likely 1.7%, that of Medellí­n was 7.1%. </p><h4>80% of the investment that reaches Medellí­n comes from abroad. Where is this coming from, and which markets do you target? </h4><p>We target special countries, though there have been investors from places where we have not promoted Medellí­n to before, such as Singapore, South Korea, and so on, which was a pleasant surprise. Thus far, we have received investment from the US, Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, as well as from Switzerland, Guatemala, the Netherlands, UK, and Panama. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and even Ghana could also be fruitful markets. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the end of this year?</h4><p>We targeted total FDI of USD200 million in 2017 and as of September 30 had reached USD372 million. In terms of sectors, innovation, manufacturing, and agroindustry are the key fields of investment that have come to Medellí­n. For many decades, this was an important manufacturing city; now, we are working on becoming a services city as well. We also target different fields such as health, energy, construction, STI, and the aerospace industry, since we seek to provide maintenance services to the different types of planes flying in Latin America. We are currently improving an important aerospace industry cluster whose headquarters are in the international airport. Today, there are 16 different private companies providing these services that have already been certified by Airbus, Boeing, and other key private air airlines. We now have 10 more companies on our list seeking to be new partners here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Social Innovation in the Middle East]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[lynn-zovighian-managing-director-the-zovighian-partnership]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With The Zovighian Partnership, you focus on social innovation and social investing in the Middle East. Could you tell us more about your organization and your vision for the region? </h4><p>The Zovighian Partnership is a family-owned venture that I co-founded with my father almost five years ago. I believe that our Middle East is a lot more fundamentally capable of stability and prosperity than what meets the eye, but we do not do enough to set the stage for its success. Growth in our region is largely led by government as the largest public investor, as well as champions in the private and third sector. But there is a serious need for other socio-economic forces to join the ranks of nation-building. Our venture is about advancing a fortified and capable community of philanthropists and humanitarians, social and impact investors, and social entrepreneurs to serve our region. </p><h4>Thus far, the Partnership has already worked on several commissioned projects and missions, all in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and you have your own impact portfolio called the Peace Collection. How have you developed your model to bring stakeholders together and to initiate such projects? </h4><p>It has been a journey of building a venture with significant expertise in the design and administering of strategic social impact, creating proprietary evidence-building methodologies based on scientific research, designing prototyping tools to pre-launch impact missions and stress-test their viability, as well as building long-term management capabilities to run impact missions and portfolios. You can only imagine what is learned. You learn how crucial risk taking and risk management is, and the very few ways to get it right. You learn how to not allow for the mismanagement and wastage of philanthropic capital and humanitarian budgets. You learn how to serve in solidarity and partnership. National leaders and active citizens have commissioned us to take this knowledge and capabilities to build and manage a growing portfolio of impact missions in the Kingdom. All these missions are transformative for the community, sustainability, and state institutions.  </p><h4>Under Vision 2030, the Kingdom is aiming for a comprehensive economic diversification agenda, attracting investments in new sectors like sports, culture and entertainment, while opening up more to internationalization. How do you view all this from a social investment lens? </h4><p>The energy, mindset, and transformation we are seeing, and have been a part of, is absolutely wonderful and so crucial. A prosperous Kingdom is a key prerequisite for a thriving Middle East. Vision 2030 is the patron of new mediums for building the nation. Vision 2030 is asking us to be participatory and inclusive, to not limit the boundaries of the imagination, and to put the people first for a prosperous future. Creating socio-economic capacity for growth in new sectors is absolutely spot on. These new sectors are welcoming the participation of local talent and champions. They are creating mechanisms for stronger partnerships with the international community. And they are capacity-building a new infrastructure supported by thoughtful regulations. This is what every country in the Arab World needs.</p><h4>The royal decree allowing women to drive is widely considered to empower more female participation in labor market. What should be done to support this trajectory and continue to empower women — and does Saudi Arabia compare in a regional perspective? What have been the challenges in your successful business career?</h4><p>The royal decree for women to drive was a powerful milestone, and its pulsating energy and ripple effects on the country are still in its early stages. The Kingdom has switched on a new and formidable economic engine by equipping a significant workforce with mobility. At a regional level, I do not see another country investing so heavily and consistently in its women and society-at-large like Saudi Arabia is doing today. Our clients and fellow social investors are embracing this economic might. I would have loved to see the international community rally in parallel with strong support and encouragement. My biggest challenge today is getting a global audience to listen with the intention of learning and understanding what Saudi Arabia is truly about.  </p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the coming years? What would be your message to aspiring business owners, social entrepreneurs, and philanthropists in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and elsewhere?</h4><p>My ambition is to continue to thoughtfully invest in furthering sustainable mechanisms for the building of prosperous nations and societies in our region. Data is at the core of this decision-making journey; we are looking forward to a further wave of investment in scientific research and methodologies that we can call Made in the Middle East. I hope to continue to align my business-building and peace-building worlds together, and help demonstrate the incredibly important roles and responsibilities that businesses have towards their communities and countries. My message would be to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow's Middle East today; we all have a responsibility to identify how we can best serve the region, and there is no time like the present to invest for tomorrow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In Nigeria since 1961]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jeffrey-ewing-managing-director-chevron]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a background to Chevron in Nigeria?</h4><p>Chevron Nigeria Limited is Operator of our joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). We have affiliate companies that run our deep-water operations. For our Joint Venture (JV) operations with NNPC, we have a large onshore operation of oil and gas fields and our shallow offshore fields in both oil and gas. We have our main terminal in Escravos, where all the oil and gas is processed and enters the domestic market on the gas side, while the oil gets sent to the Warri Refinery and also to tankers offshore. We also have our Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (EGTL) plant that takes natural gas produced from the fields and turns it into diesel and naphtha. It is a high-tech operation and one of only two in the world. EGTL is interconnected with our Escravos gas plant. We have the Agbami field where we are the operators, and we are partnered with Petrobras, Statoil and the indigenous company Famfa Oil and NNPC. That field has the largest floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility in the country, with a capacity of 250,000bpd and has been in production for 10 years. We are also partners in certain non-operated fields. We heavily invest here and spend about USD2 billion annually in operating cost and capital. We have three drilling rigs running; two of which are in our JV operations.</p><h4>What is the importance of Nigeria within Chevron's global portfolio?</h4><p>Chevron has been here since 1961, and Nigeria is critical to our global operations, constituting about 10% of our global production. There is great potential here for additional fields and investment if the investment environment is right for us. We want to help the country grow the oil and gas industry as well as the overall economy. We work closely with our stakeholders to help the country prosper.</p><h4>What is Chevron's role in developing Nigeria's natural gas resources?</h4><p>Chevron is the largest producer of domestic gas, and we focus on high-quality gas. We make up about 41% of the domestic market and are focused on keeping our gas facilities and levels full to maintain our gas supply. We are also working with the Nigerian Gas Processing &amp; Transportation Company Ltd, and the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company to bring a new onshore field into the market. We are partners in the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) and have always been committed to help not only Nigeria but also West Africa utilize gas more efficiently and effectively.</p><h4>How has localizing the supply chain helped Chevron?</h4><p>It has helped us reduce some costs, by utilizing local suppliers. We must work with them to make sure every dollar we spend is the most effective; hence, we work closely with our local contractors. A great example is one of our partners Marine Platforms, which supplied us with a vessel for our subsea operations. We initially planned to use an international company but decided to work with Marine Platforms after they proved they had the capabilities to do the work. We ended up paying half of what we were quoted by international companies. If companies work with the right partners, they can add value and reduce cost.</p><h4>Has a weak naira been able to reduce costs for IOCs and grow the industry through localizing the supply chain?</h4><p>It has caused the local companies some challenges, and we have had to work with them on importing products into the country at competitive prices. We work hard to keep our costs competitive within Chevron and work with our contractors to keep our contractors competitive as well.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the exploration environment in Nigeria?</h4><p>We see opportunities for additional discoveries in Nigeria. On the JV side, most companies have not drillled below 12,000ft, as the shallower formations have been prolific. We have plans for two new seismic acquisitions to give us better data on deeper opportunities. There is a great deal of robust potential. From a government standpoint, Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) needs to have globally competitive fiscal terms for investment in exploration in the deep-water and JV. Looking at the current draft of the bill, the JV oil side looks extremely competitive, and that will lead to additional projects on the JV for oil. The terms for deep-water and JV gas are not that competitive. It will reduce the number of deep-water projects to almost none if the fiscal bill passes as currently written.</p><h4>What is the issue with the JV gas terms of the PIB?</h4><p>The tax credits have been eliminated. In terms of the way production-sharing contracts (PSC) are structured, where 60% go to the concessionaire and IOCs only receive 40%, not having the tax credits really hurts oil and gas companies. It is the same thing on the JV gas side. It makes it challenging to do any gas projects. We have been engaging with the consultants that put that together as well as the National Assembly to make them understand what the potential outcomes could be based on their fiscal terms. On the JV gas side, there are attempts to make it a fair playing field. In reality, this will not benefit anyone; many indigenous companies have made that point publicly. On the deep-water side, the government wants more take upfront on projects, so IOCs and partners pay for exploration, development and facilities upfront, and we recover our costs through oil as we produce it.</p><h4>What does Nigeria need to do to harness its potential in gas?</h4><p>It comes down to the pricing mechanism. The right price is needed to make an investment. We need a better structure around marketing, and the cost of gas is an area that needs to be improved.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We want to be here for many more years. Getting the JV arrears resolved has helped boost investor confidence. From a Chevron perspective, we are actively drilling because we have confidence in the funding mechanism. The industry is also working with the NNPC to streamline the contracting process. Anything it can do to boost investor confidence will be helpful. It hinges on what comes out with the PIB, if it gets passed, and what the terms are. If it passes something that is globally competitive and is implemented well, then there is a bright future for additional activity in Nigeria in the oil and gas sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[charles-osezua-chairman-owel-linkso]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the core activities of Owel-Linkso?</h4><p>Our main activities can be classified into two major areas; the gas sector, where we pioneered the first gas distribution company in Nigeria, and the service sector where we provide a number of engineering and technical services to the oil and gas industry. We started our gas infrastructural development from the distribution end through Gaslink, which we promoted and managed as part of Owel-Linkso Group, until we did a share swap with Oando. We have since moved into the mid-stream with a view to capturing gas at the flare, process it and fraction it for distribution. Thus creating a vertically integrated operation for gas production and distribution. Consequently, we created two companies: City Gas, which is purely for gas distribution including LPG, and Gas Train, which today operates its first gas processing plant in Delta State and is probably the only independent gas processing company in Nigeria. These infrastructural development initiatives have been supported by our in-house engineering and project management capabilities. We want to develop more gas plants and gas infrastructure to remain relevant and significant in the gas sector, while extending the services to more companies.</p><h4>What types of services are provided?</h4><p>We offer engineering, project management, inspection and certification services significantly, through Linkso Nigeria Limited, which has been involved in all major gas projects in this country. Beginning with the Nigeria LNG, we project-managed the development of the 1bcf/d Soku gas plant. We also managed the West African Gas Pipeline, and today we are managing the Escravos-Lagos gas pipeline. As to your question, we are not EPC contractors as it is not our core business, but we do undertake EPCM where we essentially do engineering, procurement and construction management, while we outsource the actual construction and installation of equipment. This we have done a number of times, installing gas plants for clients, including multinationals who, satisfied with our services, choose us to guarantee the delivery. In all the areas related to gas, I can say, we have been involved from conception to development and operation.</p><h4>What is your involvement with LNG?</h4><p>We are not involved in LNG at all, though we are interested in it. Currently, we capture gas at the flare and turn waste into wealth. We process gas that would have been flared, and produce four products: condensate, which is naphtha; LPG, which is household cooking gas; propane, which we sell to industrial and commercial users or blend with butane as domestic gas; and a clean lean gas, which is pipped by the producer to power plants, CNG and mini LNG plant operators. In the future, we see opportunities for engaging in the LNG space, which we are still studying, and intend to take advantage of.</p><h4>Do you see a great deal of activity and investment coming in the gas infrastructure in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is inevitable. 30 years ago, we started talking about Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK),and if we had gone ahead with the plan, that pipeline would have been commissioned in 1992. However, the politics and policies of the time, slowed down gas development. But now, driven by the demand for power, politics is beginning to give way to rational policies leading towards a willing seller and willing buyer market. Thus, with policy clarity and consistency, and the right price and economics, investors are more willing to participate, as they see opportunities. The fact remains that investors will invest if they are sure the contract and commercial environment can be trusted and will not change, as was the case in the past. If the regulations cannot guarantee someone a fair return, they will not invest. That's the truth!</p><h4>How would you assess doing business in Nigeria's gas sector?</h4><p>Doing business in the Nigerian gas sector is getting better with clearer policies. And I do say that if I look at the LPG sector, that there are advantages of being a local producer, since more often than not, you are competing against imports, so you can save, if nothing else, on transportation cost since the LPG price is tied to international prices. However, in the case of natural gas, the situation is different since its pricing is based on the alternative fuel or feedstock which are generally deregulated. The only exception to this rule may be the power sector which yet regulated. If Nigeria is to develop economically, we have to develop the power sector, and it would appear government has resolved to do so. Gas infrastructure would grow on the back of power sector growth. The private sector can take a lead, as we did in Gaslink, if government puts the right policy in place. We definitely need to be forward thinking in our views and use gas to create an existing economy that supports growth and creates employment for the teeming population.</p><h4>What policy changes would improve the investment sentiment in the sector?</h4><p>I believe that the investment sentiment in the sector will change if the fiscal regime to govern investment is streamlined and price is determined on the basis of a willing seller and a willing buyer. The gas business is developed on the basis of long-term relationship, so the laws need to be clear, consistent and enforceable. Nigeria has struggled with this over the years. Thus, we have a situation where gas policies have been established, year in, year out through budgetary pronouncements and instruments, which create uncertainty. On your question about domestic supply obligation, the truth is that the policy has not been very successful. As far as I know today, Total is the only International Oil Company (IOC) who in the last five years have been actively investing to meet their domestic supply obligation of about 300mscf/d. The challenge with the domestic supply obligation still has to do with pricing and the issue of installed capacity not taken, which creates further uncertainty for the investor. However, until they achieve their domestic supply obligations, producers cannot sell gas on a willing buyer, willing seller basis. So they remain under the regulated market which today may not support their investment, hence they are subsidized through various fiscal instruments, including capital allowances, and capital write offs against crude oil tax obligations, etc. The government's domestic supply obligation has not been met by producers because there is no guaranteed off taker. In my view, the solution still remains for government to deregulate the market, as the market will not change radically, but this would allow investors to sit across the table and negotiate appropriate price that will support investment across the value chain, from the consumer, the transporters to the producers. This would ensure that at the end of it all I could sell to a consumer that was able to pay a price that supports my investments.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>2019 is an election year, and therefore, for business, it is generally a period of uncertainty and most investors would prefer to hold onto their money. However, we also see an environment where the oil price is creeping up in the right direction. Therefore, we can discuss next year from two perspectives; from the upstream and a service point of view, I see the producers issuing a number of tenders because of the current oil price, but only few contracts will be awarded as they will want to wait for the election period to better understand the government's priorities and their impact on policies. However, on the midstream and infrastructural development, I see the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) pushing for the completion and realization of a number of gas transportation and transmission system. And because of the quality requirement, this should create opportunities for us in the midstream to build more gas processing plants. So I can say that, next year will be a mixed bag, with a great deal of sluggishness in decision making, and hard work to have existing contracts extended, while working hard to win new tenders which should naturally come out by the third and fourth quarter of 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[felix-moral-ceo-exeed-industries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With a long-term perspective, how is Exeed Industries redefining its business model to increase efficiency in its used material and ensure a sustainable line of business?</h4><p>Industry in general is going through an important transformation and the construction and building industry is not insulated from this revolution. Today there are countless new building materials, or reinterpretations of existing materials that are bringing dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes, transport or installation costs, and of course in their quality and properties. Its novelty and competition is deeply transforming our industry, therefore at Exeed Industries we understand that the time has come to take advantage of its facilities. Of course we will continue using cement, steel, and chemical admixtures; however, for example, new nano-materials are filled with innovative possibilities in terms of design and performance. In terms of cost, five years ago it was impossible to think about producing at industrial scale, but today it is economical enough to design and manufacture products based on these materials. One interesting example is the Graphene. This nano-material manufacturing is based on graphite, whose biggest producer is China, who controls the flow of supply of this raw material globally. But new technologies are allowing for the production of graphene with other raw materials like oil coke. We are in a country that is rich with oil; therefore, if we can collaborate with and control the downstream areas of this industry, then we really have a major opportunity to produce innovative materials at a competitive price.</p><h4>How do you expect the supply chain of the industry to adapt to technologies such as 3D printing?</h4><p>Although it seems surprising, 3D printing has been around for 25 years and a relevant number of important industrial companies around the world are already employing to manufacture spare parts and consumables, with major impact on the traditional supply chain processes. It might have come a little late to the UAE, but recently there has been a serious political push to keep these technologies at the fore. However, for 3D printing to have an impact, it must support operations and reduce costs in a sustainable way, which is not always that easy. For example, if we talk about the building materials industry, 3D-printed concrete is an interesting new technology, meaning its effectiveness is yet to be proven. Undoubtedly, these technologies will dramatically reduce the amount of labor input required to produce concrete, and this labor reduction will be a major change in the whole industrial and economic model of countries. This is the future, but there is a great deal of trial and error left to work through. Right now, we have to invest in order to be prepared for this change. Invest in equipment and invest in people to change the mindset. Management should start to get used to think laterally in order to transform the business with the same speed to which it advances the technological development.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on how economies should adjust to the trends you mentioned in industrial construction?</h4><p>The public and private sectors have to shift from thinking about only efficiency to consider effectiveness as one of the main drivers of our future. The coordination and communication between the government and the corporate stakeholders is essential to make sure that change is effectively implemented. Simplifying communication, coordination and processes. In the absence of this, things will still change but it will be a much slower process. Education is another important area that requires much better coordination. Universities and institutes are a precious source of talent and we have to ensure that they are an active part of the process of affecting change on the ground. Only being leaders in innovation and adapting quickly to changes in the needs of the market we can achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. Investing in talent is investing in our future.</p><h4>How do you expect demand to evolve in Abu Dhabi and UAE market as far as building materials are concerned?</h4><p>We do use indicators such as market size and expected development, with some reports predicting around 5% growth in the construction industry over the next five years. However, I know that our target market will remain largely the same in the next few years and that the completion of projects will be higher. This means that even if the economy grows well, it will not be easy, and we must change our operations and our focus, which is why we are looking at exports that can grow the market substantially.  There are good potential markets for our products in Africa, for example, and we will shortly go there to get a real feel for the business dynamics there. Africa is a vast continent in developmental terms, and we are eyeing opportunities in East, West, and Central Africa specifically. We are also keen to develop key partnerships with Companies who offer good synergies with the Exeed family. These are challenging yet exciting times to be in our business sectors. And whilst we look to the export markets for the future, we also note that the UAE construction industry continues to surprise the world with new and innovative solutions and designs. Exeed Industries is proud to be part of the industry in our home nation. And we remain confident that the UAE will continue to provide growth opportunities as more and more new developments are announced here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2018 Mexico offices and retail spaces]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[gabriel-zamorano-ceo-grupo-iredu]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What type of companies do you target?</h4><p>We have two main lines of business: offices and retail spaces. Our clients are specifically large multinational companies. As for national companies, we only have large clients, such as Alsea, Grupo Nacional Provincial (GNP), as well as several banks. We do not have medium or small clients because we offer integral services, and multinationals usually arrive in Mexico and are not sure how to organize their facilities to launch operations; hence, we support them throughout the process. Mexico is a great country to do business and generate large revenues. However, companies that come here must surround themselves with the right people to achieve this.</p><h4>How popular is the 360-degrees model in Mexico, and why do you prefer the design-build model?</h4><p>There are several differences between the design-build and 360 degree model. While the former includes design and construction, the latter has many additional elements such as real estate, which means finding the most appropriate location for the business, and a customized business model, such as including the office furniture, which sometimes causes budgets to exceed. In addition, we also determine how the operation is going to be carried out, for example, whether companies will operate through a third party or whether they have all the equipment to carry it out themselves. We want the client to have a general view of the problem, because the easiest part of the project is to build. Doing a comprehensive analysis and offering a 360 degree project is our differentiating factor. There may be companies who offer these services to the industrial and tourism sectors, but Iredu is the only company that provides this model for offices and retail businesses.</p><h4>How are new trends in management such as teleworking, co-working, or horizontal management changing your client's needs and preferences? </h4><p>Overall, we try to be cutting edge and push the clients to new schemes. An important aspect of working in different modalities is that we must have a space designed for all the different forms. We design spaces that foster collaboration and effective work, therefore, we prioritize open spaces with few closed offices.</p><h4>How do your designs contribute to staff satisfaction, productivity, and talent retention?</h4><p>We must have open spaces, and different spaces for collaboration. Nowadays, objectives and projects are assigned to teams, not to individuals. Having an adequate space for teams develops and boosts collaboration and creativity. We can build several different sizes of meetings rooms with varied furniture, screens, and boards. Moreover, we can build meeting rooms outside, inside, or as mixed spaces, which is an amazing addition for companies.</p><h4>What do consumers expect from retail spaces nowadays?</h4><p>For retail, we receive designs from other firms. Customers nowadays are not buying in malls that have transformed into leisure spaces. Looking closely, the best locations in a mall are occupied by restaurants. Consumers do not want to buy, they want to have an experience. Hence, it is necessary to have restaurants and a movie theater and other leisure spots, such as amusement parks.</p><h4>If you received a new client today, what would be your recommendation as a location in Mexico City, or any other city in Mexico?</h4><p>Basically, any city in Mexico is optimal for business. Mexico is a gold mine for anybody who wants to invest here. Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara are obvious choices, but Puebla, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí­, Aguascalientes, and León are also great options. We work in every city in the main business districts and for retail spaces, we have projects all across Mexico.</p><h4>How has the earthquake affected real estate demand in Mexico City?</h4><p>For large multinational and national companies, there have been no changes or movement. I believe those companies are here for the long term and that earthquake damage are short term. The SMEs, especially those located in the earthquake damage zones such as Condesa, Roma, and Colonia del Valle, have felt the effects on their short-term cash flow. However, I still believe these are short-term issues as the market will self-regulate.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018 and the strategies to achieve them?</h4><p>We have been working for many years to transform Iredu from a family company to an institutional company. To that end, we have been adding experienced staff, including those who have shifted from larger companies in the sector. We are enhancing our expertise in different areas with this knowledgeable staff in order to grow exponentially, a feat we have achieved and sustained over the years. We want to double our growth this year and for the next three to four years, we will focus on becoming one of the most important companies in Mexico's real estate sector.</p><h4>Are you looking for alternate sources of financing from investors or the stock exchange market?</h4><p>Yes, we are using both sources to finance the company. We mostly acquire financing through the banks, which view us favorably; banks are more concerned with housing companies and in comparison, our clients are large and robust companies. In terms of the stock exchange, we are working on a project to list the company on the stock exchange market. We already have a program of corporate governance, and we have reached the revenue to go public. We will enter the third-party audit program soon and are planning to achieve our goal in the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Infrastructure investment rising]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-jean-marc-ricca-managing-director-basf]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have you experienced any uptake in the business environment in Nigeria recently?</h4><p>From our experience as a business, I will like to say it is a mixed bag of positives and the not so positives. We see definite signs of recovery in the economy from the recession, particularly in the construction industry which is a key segment we play in. This indicates that there are further investments and infrastructure projects going on in the country. If Nigeria was to follow normal economic indicators, we should see significantly higher growth, but we are not. This is not yet a reason for concern, but as this is a major driver for our business, we will maintain a close watch, especially considering the forthcoming elections. We still expect our businesses to progress steadily in the coming months. However, we must watch out for a certain number of indicators. However, there are still challenges in many consumer-related markets. It is fair, but not as good as it was a year ago, a lot of which can be attributed to the overall economic situation at the consumer level. From our perspective, despite the progress made, there are huge gaps in the development of infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are all necessary for the ultimate uplifting of the country. The oil and gas sector, upstream agriculture and construction segments are all doing relatively well, but it would not take much to disrupt the system if the oil and gas sector were to experience a major shock.</p><h4>What has led to the current state of the consumer market?</h4><p>The consumer market is heavily dependent on disposable income or the money that people have in their pockets and how it is spent. It does not take much for a market such as ours to slow down once the economy comes under pressure. There is pressure on disposable income due to high unemployment rates, coupled with double digit inflation. Nigeria is one of the few countries in Africa where GDP growth does not necessarily translate into development. That is a major constraint because development will mean more schools, better healthcare, and improved infrastructure, pulling the entire economy forward in the long run. We see this as a core risk to miss the opportunity as a country to create value at a local level.</p><h4>Have those projects that were paused because of the economy resumed?</h4><p>Due to the recession, there was a dearth of infrastructural development in 2017, but there have since been significant investments in that segment by the government in 2018, as we see many projects such as railways, roads, and bridges currently underway.</p><h4>How has the ease of doing business in Nigeria improved?</h4><p>The process of registering a business for a new entrant has been simplified considerably. The situation has undoubtedly improved, but Nigeria remains one of the most complex places to run a business in the world. Looking at it from an investment standpoint, Nigeria is competing against countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, or the Ivory Coast, and Nigeria needs to continue to put in efforts to facilitate managing businesses. We have promising projects in our business development pipeline, but it is still difficult do business in Nigeria, major reference for now being the situation at the ports, which are extremely congested and the poor state of the roads leading there. All these affect our ability to create more value in Nigeria. From a wider perspective, this does not help us in convincing our internal investors to do more business in Nigeria, and I am certain this is the same for many multinationals.</p><h4>Do you import any raw materials?</h4><p>We only import the raw materials which cannot be sourced locally for the manufacture of  our construction chemicals. Challenge is, due to the sophisticated level of the technology required to produce these inputs and the absence of minimum critical mass for higher technology driven manufacturing, we are yet to get local substitutes for them. As we have been doing, we will keep working on developing locally available substitutes, as we know that is the best way to create the value here in Nigeria.  With the Lekki projects coming up within the next few years, we expect an upsurge in the availability of more inputs for our manufacturing plant.</p><h4>In 2017, you had plans to increase the number of BASF global businesses entering Nigeria. How has that progressed?</h4><p>We have doubled what we had in 2017. So far in 2018, we have had six more, two of which were completely unexpected for us, which is a clear indication that some of our internal investors still see the many opportunities available here. Sustainability is fast becoming a major topic for us in Nigeria, and this is a topic that is becoming prominent in our discussions in our business across Africa. Asides education, the topics of food security and waste are critical, to the point where, for us, as a Nigerian company, we try to look at the challenges as possibilities. We have opportunities for circular economy projects and new business models. We will not necessarily do this all by ourselves; but we see ourselves as enablers for several small and large businesses, particularly social entrepreneurs. Some of these social entrepreneurs we have begun engagements with, and as we fine tune our plans, we will share accordingly and bring in more of these stakeholders on board this journey with us.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p>We do not anticipate that the election will disrupt the business environment significantly. Nigeria is more sensitive to a security clash or uncertainties in the oil and gas sectors, which would impact businesses almost immediately. As for BASF, we are out for success and do not expect anything less. We measure success in terms of total value to society; this means not only economic success, but also our contribution socially and environmentally to our society. We are committed to the country, and that will not change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Jumpstarting performance culture]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[husameddin-al-madani-director-general-national-center-performance-measurement]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the primary mandate of Adaa, and how have your operations advanced?</h4><p>Adaa has given a new momentum to Saudi Arabia's march towards a new era of transparency and accountability to achieve Vision 2030 goals to take the Kingdom to a leading position in all fields. As an independent organization, Adaa reports directly to the Prime Minister. The last few years have been a period of continuous development and improvement, during which our operational process has been further streamlined, and Adaa has been equipped with expanded capabilities to achieve its mandate. We are working closely with public entities to measure their progress in implementing the programs and initiatives that help them attain their objectives to create a culture of transparency and accountability in public entities. Adaa is tasked to perform timely and accurate reporting on government performance, and our mandate calls for two primary roles: measuring the performance of public entities in terms of delivering their KPIs and targets, and measuring satisfaction on government services. The second part we have been recently quite active in. After launching our first set of citizen feedback tools this April 2018, under what we call the Beneficiary Experience Program (BEX) where beneficiary stands for citizen, resident, visitor, and investor. We have just launched a beta version for one of our Beneficiary Experience products called Watani application. Watani is an application that empowers beneficiaries to evaluate the services provided to them from most of the public sector. Through the app beneficiaries can evaluate any given service against readiness, speed and quality. Watani's features include offering beneficiaries the access to view the highest rated centers and other beneficiaries' reviews filtered by service center and service. It also offers an open space to share ideas and suggestions for further development. The application's data will feed into the measuring process we have implemented for BEX where beneficiaries' satisfaction reports will be presented to decision makers. Access to this type of data will help us amplify the voice of communities to improve government services and promote the culture of performance measurement that will transform all beneficiaries into contributors towards achieving the Saudi Vision 2030.  </p><h4>What methodologies are you equipped with to measure the performance of public entities?</h4><p>Performance measurement is a challenge around the world, even in OECD countries, as public entities tend to work in silos and do not share data publicly. When we started in 2016, we encountered resistance from our entities to share their data. Today, Adaa measures the performance of approximately 70 organizations, reporting on their progress on Vision 2030 initiatives, as well as measuring over twenty-five ministries for beneficiary satisfaction. In total, we monitor around 480 KPIs and over 1,200 key initiatives. Our methodology has been developed in collaboration with the World Bank, OECD, and Harvard Business School, with the goal of measuring outcome rather than output—one can build more hospitals, but did they shorten and improve patient recovery? Every quarter, we publish performance reports and hold meetings with the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA), and we strive to make our findings public shortly. After six of these three-month cycles, our measurement framework is not only practical and reflective of how our government works but also helps our government to transparently hold officials accountable.</p><h4>How do you envision installing a performance measurement culture among public entities?</h4><p>The true value of performance measurement is derived only when it triggers learning and insight and translates into visible changes in decision-making and citizen wellbeing. Monitoring the performance of public entities and publishing transparent reports on accurately measured data is just one aspect of Adaa's role. What makes our work more meaningful is the support it offers to public entities to empower them to enhance their capabilities, improve their performance, and develop their services. To achieve this, we enable excellence of entity performance through development and standardization of relevant tools, methods, and approaches. We help raise performance measurement capabilities and excellence of public entities by identifying issues through consultation and communication. We further drive excellence of entity performance measurement by supporting public entities to build their capabilities through continuous training based on international best practices. To jumpstart the performance culture, we have already trained over 4,000 government employees in this field. Our mandate is not to train, though we recognized that government organizations have to adapt to performance culture. Every six months, we choose six government employees and send them to Harvard Business School to follow the government performance course. To streamline and widen the scope of our training, we are launching an e-learning platform that reaches 200,000 government employees to learn about strategy development, cascading, performance reviews, data-driven analysis, and data analytics. We invest heavily in enablement and will continue to deliver this training for another year until the Ministry of Civil Services and its Institute of Public Administration take over and direct our focus on e-learning.</p><h4>What is envisioned with the launch of the International Performance Hub (IPH)?</h4><p>We developed this tool with one specific purpose: to learn how the world sees Saudi Arabia, utilizing all available data that we can gather. The IPH is a tangible outcome of the Saudi government's commitment to monitor the progress of Vision 2030 and learn from comparative experiences elsewhere in the world. It serves as a useful platform to track, benchmark, and communicate the performance of the government across a variety of national priorities. An integrated online platform that is built on more than 1 million data points collected from over 25 recognized international sources, IPH features over 700 key performance indicators organized around 12 core pillars, from finance to justice and energy to infrastructure. Data is sourced from 200 countries, making it possible to visualize Saudi Arabia's performance on a considerably broad scale. IPH was released as a beta during the World Economic Forum in order to gain advantage of the wealth and diversity of information Davos offers as a feedback platform, harnessing insights from contributors in politics, NGOs, and subject matter experts. IPH represents Saudi Arabia's keen interest to not only participate fully in the global community, but also to utilize all the resources at the country's disposal to drive progress for everyone. It also highlights the Kingdom's mission to raise development standards and international best practices within Saudi Arabia and globally, and build on the country's reputation as an innovator in data-driven, transparent government. Essentially, we decided to avail this to the world focusing on two key messages: there is nothing to hide—we will acknowledge where we underperform—and we invite anyone to use this pool for good.</p><h4>What should further economic internationalization look like, and what does that mean for your services and consultations to public entities?</h4><p>The future is full of optimism as Vision 2030 aims to expand the size of economy from 19th in the world to the top 15 and increase foreign direct investment from 3.8% to 5.7%. Considering that transparency and accountability in government performance have a direct impact on investment flow into any country, Adaa's role has assumed large significance in making the Kingdom an attractive destination for foreign investments. Through establishing a state of transparency and a culture of accountability in government work, Adaa is an enabler to place the Kingdom on track to create a dynamic economy. With Adaa guiding the transition to transparency and accountability, public entity performance will not just be measurable; it will become the main driver for the successful implementation of the country's development plans to attract investors from all over the world.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set for the coming year?</h4><p>Our priority for the coming year is to expand our capabilities to provide useful actionable insights to our leadership to support the decision-making process using the various data assets we manage. Adaa seeks to work closely with more public entities to cultivate collaborative and mutually beneficial partnerships, and to establish its credentials as the Kingdom's performance measurement center for all public entities. Our citizen-focused approach will actively encourage them to positively contribute to the Kingdom's development and become key stakeholders in driving improvements in the performance of their government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Milk of Life]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-milk-of-life]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the specifics of the Indonesian market in terms of dairy consumption?</h4><p>The dairy market in Indonesia is not yet a powerhouse. Consumption per capita stands at around 12 or 13 liters per year. From a regional perspective, for example in Malaysia or the Philippines, this figure is 30 liters per capita. In the Middle East, consumption is 70 liters while in Europe it is over 100 liters per capita. Solely focusing on the region, Indonesia may catch up in terms of consumption, doubling the market at least. Having said that, a great deal of investment is required to educate consumers on the benefits of milk consumption. Looking at habits, consumption levels are high at the toddler age; however, around school age, levels drop again. Teenagers practically do not consume dairy, with a slight increase for adults. We want to boost demand by educating the public on the health benefits, while on the supply side we want to produce and market products that cater to the Indonesian palates, tastes, and format. Overall, the market has grown in the past six years, with a slight slowdown recently. Aside from education, distribution presents a great challenge in a country, with nearly 17,000 islands and three time zones. The retail landscape has around 2.8 million outlets and dairy is typically available in about 65% of the outlets. As we are benchmarked against, for example, instant noodles, with 80-90% availability, there is still room for growth.</p><h4>How do you tailor your product line to the Indonesian palates and tastes?</h4><p>The fastest growing category is ready-to-drink milk, which is probably the fastest-growing segment within the whole of dairy. There are carton packs and bottles that come in plain dairy and flavors. Indonesians are typically not used to the taste of milk. We launched a new product called Coconut Delight in 2016 designed to mimic more familiar tastes. We also are in flavored and milk powder, as well as the infant and toddler business. That area has been relatively flat because fresh milk has been growing fast. Due to infrastructural challenges, we must distinguish between refrigerated and non-refrigerated product lines. Compared to other markets, Indonesia's refrigerated business is still small due to the difficulties in distribution. This keeps the business of pasteurized milk, yogurt, and drinks small, though sweet and condensed milk is a huge part of our business.   </p><h4>From a sourcing perspective, how is the milk quality in Indonesia?</h4><p>At the moment, Indonesia imports 80% of its milk requirements and local farmers only account for 20%. This means a large dependency on imports from mostly New Zealand and Australia, with additional imports from Europe and the US. The government seeks to double local production to 40% and has issued a new regulation to incentivize local, fresh milk production. We source about 20% of our requirements locally and work closely with dairy farmers in Java through cooperatives to improve the quality and productivity to source locally. The Dutch government also participates in this with support and funds. Our parent company Royal FrieslandCampina is a cooperative owned by 20,000 dairy farmers with whom we work closely. We bring dairy farmers from the Netherlands here to teach local dairy farmers about best dairy farming practices, while also sending Indonesian farmers to the Netherlands. Another challenge we face is encouraging the younger generation to stay with farming. It is hard work, the financial rewards are not highly perceived, and scalability is also an issue. The majority of dairy farmers in Indonesia only have small pieces of land with two or three cows. Currently, working together with a local cooperative, we are trying to pilot a model of a dairy village. Where we secure a plot of land and place cows together to create a colony. This allows us to invest together in milking machines and other necessary equipment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[superior-quality-test-control]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the synergies between the Prodia groups?</h4><p>ENDANG W. HOYARANDA They are all independent. CRO is independent and has its own network, policies, and so on. The culture remains the same, as does the way of doing things, but all companies originate from Prodia Labs. After 35 years of operations, it began creating subsidiaries due to requirements from clients and customers, the first of which was Prodia CRO. The same is true for Prodia Occupational Health, the first company for occupational health, while ProStem is for stem-cell therapy, medicine, and research. ProStem's main activity is now stemcell research and doing clinical trials for major life-threatening diseases. The same applies to Proline, which is an in-vitro diagnostic company that is a partnership between Prodia and a German company called DiaSys. It has great technology and is not far from being the 20th largest diagnostics company in the world. This came about because the market needed local reagents, and before Proline was established, more than 99% of all reagents used in Indonesia were imported. Now with Proline, we can produce it in Indonesia so it is a truly important milestone for the country. The last one is Innodia, the distributer for Proline, which by regulation is an overseas investment company that needs a local distributor.</p><h4>Have insurance regulations changed your industry?</h4><p>EWH The Social Insurance Administration Organization (BPJS) is currently cooperating with us at Prodia Labs, though we do not yet have cooperation with CRO. Prodia Labs is more focused on specialty testings for special diseases. We have labs that are one of a kind in Indonesia for sophisticated testing, so practically every hospital and every other independent lab and clinic refers to us. The largest hospitals, including the largest hospital chains, are our customers and work with BJPS. Public and private hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies all refer their clients to us. </p><h4>What is the portfolio of the Prodia CRO testing services?</h4><p>ERIZAL SUGIONO CRO's clients mostly come from pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industry, and traditional medicine and food supplement companies. If they have a new product whose quality and safety they want to test, they come to us.</p><p>EWH The majority of the work that Prodia CRO does partly supports the pharmaceutical companies in the process of developing new products and want to enter a market with regulations but do not have the facilities to go into detailed research in each country. In this case, they hire contract research organizations (CROs), which is the case all over the world. The large CROs collaborate with local CROs, such as ourselves, to conduct local research. We also work for small biotech companies as we move more into the personal medicine era. Large companies are buying out small biotech companies, though sometimes biotech companies conduct research in countries like Indonesia. Therefore, we also deal with these small biotech companies that come to us from the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia to do their clinical trials in Indonesia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[filling-the-niche]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short introduction to the background of PT Semen Baturaja?</h4><p>PT Semen Baturaja was founded in 1974 as a state-owned company, though today it is a publicly listed company with 24% private ownership and the remainder owned by the Indonesian government. The saying that “life begins at 40" is apt for us because we decided to list on the stock exchange when the company was 39 years old. That same year, the company decided to add additional production capacity, and today we have a total capacity of 3.85 million tons of cement per year. The construction of our second cement plant was the fastest in Indonesian history, taking merely 26 months. PT Semen Baturaja is a niche player compared to others in the cement industry here. We have a production base in the center of South Sumatra province, and our sales cover four provinces of Sumatra: South Sumatra, Lampung, Jambi, and Bengkulu. What makes this market interesting is that production capacity in Sumatra is still lower than demand. To be more specific, total demand in southern Sumatra is 6.5 million tons of cement per year, while our capacity, as the only producer in the region, is only 3.85 million tons per year. This means this particular market is capable of growing, unlike in other parts of the country. In South Sumatra, the growth in demand for cement is steadily increasing, most likely as a result of the government's policy to have a more decentralized fiscal regime and because it is a region rich in oil, palm plantations, copper, and coffee. Thus, this region of Indonesia has been enjoying healthy economic growth.</p><h4>Is PT Semen Baturaja currently producing at full capacity?</h4><p>We have a new plant that came online in September 2017, and are thus ramping up our production. We expect a significant increase in our sales volume in 2018. In 2017, our sales should reach close to USD1.9 million and is set to increase to around USD2.75 million in 2018. This is firstly because of the market's potential. Secondly, one of the largest projects of the government's connectivity infrastructure plan is constructing a trans-Sumatra toll road from the southern to the northern tip, which will require a great deal of cement. Once that toll road is up and running, the economy will start growing along that route. When the economy prospers, basic industries such as cement will also experience a growth in demand. Thus, while there is an excess cement capacity of 40% in Indonesia in 2017, we see potential for healthy growth in our market and are extremely optimistic for 2018.</p><h4>In addition to your strategic location, what differentiates you from competitors?</h4><p>Being at the center of the market is extremely important in a number of ways; close proximity to customers' projects ensures the availability of the product and quicker delivery. Proximity also means it costs our customers less to get their cement delivered. Our setup makes us stand out and gives us great advantage over our competitors. In terms of the industrial cycle, we are entering a consolidation period, which means the market share of the three-largest players will start to decline due to new players coming in. For a player like us, we see an opportunity to enter a market that has been underserved and we will expand and perhaps go beyond South Sumatra. We can see some potential while looking at the current situation of various markets in Indonesia. As a smaller player, we cannot compete with larger regional and international players. However, there are places that larger companies have left open, and those are the places we will concentrate on. We are a niche player in South Sumatra and can play the same game in different areas. We also want to differentiate ourselves from other players by being an environmentally friendly cement producer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your recent acquisition of Hokindo Properti Investama?</h4><p>RIMO was once one of the largest retail department stores in the country back in the 1990s. Fierce competition from other retailers and online shops caused us to suffer big losses. After listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), a change of ownership and management was inevitable. In March 2017, new management changed the business strategy by acquiring PT Hokindo Properti Investama, an integrated property landbanker and developer, by issuing new shares in the public valued at USD300 million. In December 2017, from a loss-suffering company, RIMO made approximately IDR430 billion in total revenue and IDR145 billion in net profit, while our stock price increased by 50% in a mere nine-month period.</p><h4>Would you give us a brief overview of RIMO's current projects?</h4><p>In Jakarta, we have two projects: the first is an apartment building in Kuningan and the second in Gandaria is still in the planning stage. We are preparing the master plan and applying for the development permits at present. We also have one project in Cianjur, West Java, a 200-ha plot of land where we will build villas, a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, and a five-star hotel.</p><h4>Will the golf course development in West Java be your biggest investment?</h4><p>No. Low-cost housing is in fact the largest investment because we will build 30,000 houses for a housing project in West Kalimantan in Pontianak. It is a 800-ha development site for which we will acquire more land to bring it up to 1,000ha. We will build affordable, low-cost housing to support the government's One Million Houses program.</p><h4>Will low-cost housing projects become a major profit center given that this is an ongoing government program?</h4><p>We do want to make a profit; however, we also want to develop the region because once we build in West Kalimantan, the area will become more developed and we can sell higher-priced houses there as well, which will reap greater profits.</p><h4>How does the financing work for the government's One Million Houses program?</h4><p>There are in fact no government loans for the construction of these projects, though there are subsidized loans for consumers who want to buy houses. They receive government-subsidized interest rates on their loans with a down payment of only 1%. Homebuyers only pay around half the usual mortgage interest rate under this scheme.</p><h4>Why did you choose West Kalimantan as the region for this development?</h4><p>West Kalimantan is strategically important for the government because it is close to Singapore and Malaysia. Given its strategic location, the government intends to build many projects there. In fact, the government wants to move the capital to West Kalimantan and build a large port, new bridges, schools, toll roads, railways, and other infrastructure there, not to mention develop new infrastructure to support all the palm oil plantations in the region. When we chose West Kalimantan for this low-cost housing development, it was purely on our own initiative; however, we directed it specifically at the government's housing program. We have to be involved in building this low-cost housing.</p><h4>What is the timeline for building these 30,000 low-cost houses?</h4><p>In December 2017, we started Phase I and built 1,000 houses, and not just for locals in West Kalimantan, but personnel from the army, navy, and police force who also need housing and qualify for government loans. We have a number of other smaller projects around the country as well.</p><h4>How would you compare the real estate opportunities in Jakarta compared to other parts of Indonesia?</h4><p>It is only possible to build apartment buildings in Jakarta because land there is extremely expensive. However, outside Jakarta there are still great opportunities to build houses, especially low-cost homes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Serving both business and leisure travelers, how do you position Hermitage Hotel within the hospitality market?</h4><p>The hotel is located in the heart of Jakarta's most prestigious district. It is minutes away from Sudirman as the CBD area and world-class shopping malls. It is the perfect location for business travelers to conduct their meetings or unwind in a location a short distance away from the chaos of the city. Leisure travelers can still enjoy Jakarta's touristic spots. The hotel is a beautiful colonial style building; however, with hundreds of hotels in Jakarta alone, the amenities of the hotel are not enough to attract guests. It is the service we give as hoteliers that makes our guests' stay memorable; we create an experience that keeps them coming back and sharing with their friends and family. This is what we strive to achieve and more so at the Hermitage.</p><h4>What are your unique offerings, and how can people utilize your premises for special events?</h4><p>On the ninth floor, guests can unwind and relax at the fitness center. They can take a dip in the infinity pool before having a drink at our signature venue, La Vue rooftop bar, with panoramic, 360-degree views of the city skyline. Both the pool deck and the rooftop deck can be used for special events. The hotel presents an ideal venue for sophisticated weddings, business meetings, and social events. Our newest highlight is the transformation of our courtyard. We have recently added a glass ceiling that creates a unique indoor venue with the feel of sitting in a botanical garden, perfect for enchanting and intimate events up to 60 guests.</p><h4>What should be done to unlock the full potential of Jakarta as a leisure and business travel destination?</h4><p>The only unbearable factor about Jakarta is the traffic. The government is doing a great deal to change this, such as adding the mass rapid transit system as well as enforcing bus lanes and the restrictions of cars and motorbikes during peak hours. It has helped, though there is a long way to go. Adding helicopter transportation service, such as the one in Sío Paulo, could assist in offering a solution for high-end customers. Reducing customs tax on imported items, which are not available locally as alternative options, would allow hoteliers to improve our service and offerings to our guests. Waiver or reduction of visa fees or doubling the stay limit could entice more business and leisure travelers to truly discover Indonesia. Jakarta has a lot of unique charms and history to discover hidden in the midst of a busy metropolis. Take away the traffic issues and Jakarta is truly one of the most amazing cities to visit in Indonesia.</p><h4>What were your ambitions when you started, and what is your vision for the Hermitage Hotel Jakarta?<br></h4><p>The goal in the beginning was to put together a winning team, hungry to make a true difference and put the Hermitage on the map in Jakarta. This is what we have now. Since Marriott has taken over, the team has become more driven and excited with the changes and opportunities to be the best. Additionally, our main focus is to drive greater awareness of the hotel. Even though we appear to be an independent hotel, we are a part of Marriott International, which has become the biggest hotel management company in the world after the merger with Starwood and has unmatched customer loyalty programs. We have a fantastic product and great associates who are passionate about providing personalized service to all of our customers. The vision moving forward is to establish the Hermitage as the leading five-star hotel in the boutique segment in Jakarta. In addition, we want to be known as the leading wedding destination for small- to medium-sized weddings and become a favorite destination where the locals meet, eat, and drink. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the company's performance in 2017?</h4><p>The majority of our industry is in the FMCG sector, so a great deal depends on buying power. FMCG represents about 70% of transactions in Indonesia. To overcome this, creativity and innovation in every aspect of the business is important. We are trying to offer the consumer a better, faster, more attractive, and relevant experience and value proposition. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about your production facilities and infrastructure? </h4><p>We have enough capacity at the moment and do not plan to add more, but we certainly have been improving our technology and talents to develop better products and services. We have been working on our organization's infrastructure since the beginning and, over the past two years, have been focusing on our human resource development, in addition to our IT infrastructure.  </p><h4>How is your portfolio of products evolving?</h4><p>There have been many developments lately in the tobacco industry regarding flavor, filter, and product design innovation. There are a few different types of cigarettes in terms of length, filter types, charcoal and non-charcoal with various different flavors, menthol, and the original with different specific flavors. There have also been innovations in packaging, delivery, processing, and consumer engagement. There are at least three categories of cigarettes in Indonesia. The two largest are machine-made and hand-rolled, non-filtered cigarettes. There are also white cigarettes and cigars. People in Indonesia are tobacco fanatics that appreciate heritage and real quality. We now have electronic cigarettes, but the price gap is still high for the market here, and you need to invest USD10-15 to start with for the device, while the purchasing power in this country is only 7-10% of that. Hence, there is a niche market in big cities like Jakarta. Though a new lifestyle trend, future growth in the conventional closed cigarette market is still big.   </p><h4>In which way is Wismilak impacting the lifestyle of Indonesians, and what role can you play in the economic development of the country?</h4><p>Internally, we keep developing our people in terms of training, knowledge, and strategic thinking. Everyone in the organization must have a learning attitude because only a learning organization will survive. Externally, we do three major things, one of which is our Diplomat Success Challenge program. This is the eighth year of our entrepreneurship competition program where we provide funding and mentorship. One winner makes drones, one specifically developed to help the agriculture industry scan the fields and inspect if there are any illness or issues. They can detect issues early on and thus save billions. Another program we have is Passion Ville, a competition in which young people passionate about any particular subject, such as dance, music, comics, or photography can participate. We also offer workshops and invite successful and passionate people like singers or creative industry types. We give them a framework in which to successfully pursue their passion, compete, and offer funding to the winners. This has been going on for six or seven years now. Of course, we also have our regular CSR whereby we plant trees and support communities. In 2018, we will also start to focus on ethical political issues, such as strengthening the ideology of Indonesia's founding fathers. We work with the TNI from the military school, borrow from its curriculum, and provide funding to share its knowledge and ideology in schools and villages.</p><h4>In which way can the government further support this industry?</h4><p>At the moment, there are three tiers in the tobacco industry. We are tier two, and the gap between tiers one and two is considerable, given that the former contributes more money to the government. It makes it harder for us to compete in tier two because of economies of scale. In order for us to get into tier one, we need much bigger profit margins. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[its-a-matter-of-when]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key milestones did the tourism sector reached in the past year, and what has contributed to those victories? </h4><p>From January to May 2017, tourism growth in Indonesia was one of the best in the world, putting us among the top-20 fastest-growing tourist destinations in Asia with growth of 20%. We are lucky to have a president committed to growing the sector, and tourism has been labeled as a leading sector since 2014. As far as foreign exchange earnings in 2016 go, tourism is ranked fourth—after oil and gas, coal, and CPO. Yet oil and gas decreased by 40%, coal by 20%, and CPO as well. Only tourism has increased and is easily the highest foreign exchange earner among service sectors. In 2019, tourism will be number one in foreign exchange received. Compared to our competitors, in terms of inbound tourist arrivals, Malaysia is decreasing by a half percent, while Indonesia and Vietnam are performing the best in Asia. According to the World Economic Forum, as of 2017 our global rank is 42. Price competitiveness for Indonesia is top five, and in cultural and natural resources we are in the top 20. We have a great product and affordable prices. Bali is the best destination, and for halal tourism we are ranked third; Malaysia is still first while the UAE is second. We used to be number six, but have improved our ranking. We have promotions from Australia, Japan, Singapore, Amsterdam, Paris, and the US. When Obama visited Indonesia, we advertised in Time Square twice. We advertised in Saudi Arabia as well prior to King Salman's trip to Indonesia in early 2017. During 2014, 2015, and 2016 tourism was a leading sector. Our competitor has always been Malaysia, which is our spiritual competitor, while Thailand is our professional competitor. We were congratulated by our president for the sharp rise in foreign tourism; it has been growing 20% YoY. </p><h4>What are your key priorities moving forward?</h4><p>We have three top priorities. The first is digital tourism, the second are homestays, and the third is accessibility. Two thirds of customers are using digital devices; even Chinese tourists are sharing using digital media. The traditional travel agent is disappearing. We have 17,000 islands and 75,000 villages in Indonesia, and the solution for village tourism is homestays. We are going to develop 100,000 homestays within three years in rural areas. Currently we have three main destinations here in Indonesia, and Bali is contributing to 40% of Indonesian tourism. Jakarta contributes 30% and Riau Island, next to Singapore, contributes around 20%. These three make up 90% of our international tourist arrivals. We have to develop new destinations, but have already pointed out 10 of them, which we call the 10 new Balis. Our target for incoming visitors has increased from 12 to 15 million, though in terms of air connectivity there is still a shortage of 2 million seats, which we need to fulfill in order to achieve our 2017 target of 15 million international arrivals. By 2019, to achieve 20 million international arrivals, we need an additional 4.8 million in seat capacity.</p><h4>Infrastructure has been a key part of the President's economic agenda. What role is the ministry playing in supporting investment in infrastructure?</h4><p>In Bali, we are planning to build a rapid-exit taxiway at the current Ngurah Rai International Airport to increase and optimize its capacity. For 2019, we are also developing a new Bali airport, a new Kertajati airport in West Java that will finish in 2018, and a new Jogja airport. Toba island is already famous for its lake, the largest volcanic lake in the world. Yet to finance Indonesia's destinations, we cannot depend on the government alone, but have to invite foreign investment. The government will provide deregulation incentives and special economic zones for these top-10 destinations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[rounding-out-and-honing-in]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Indonesia fit into the group's regional portfolio?</h4><p>The idea started when we were in Malaysia and discovered that there was a large patient base from Indonesia coming to Malaysia or Singapore for treatment, which meant enormous potential. We wanted to pursue this opportunity because Columbia Asia has a wide footprint in Malaysia and considered opening a hospital in Penang because many Indonesians go to Penang as tourists. Instead, we decided to serve the Indonesian market from within and open hospitals there. We were one of the first international hospital companies to acquire a property in Indonesia. Around 10 years ago, we acquired a hospital in Medan that we transformed into a Columbia Asia hospital. Today, our hospital is not only the leading private hospital in Medan, but the number-one tertiary referral hospital in North Sumatra. This helped us to further grow our footprint. Rather than expanding rapidly to other locations in Indonesia, we studied the market in Medan for several years to understand its needs. We were more confident because we developed an understanding of the Indonesian market and culture. Our driver is to provide a healthcare system and service within Indonesia at the same level as an international healthcare provider. Three years ago, we felt confident enough to open two further hospitals in Jakarta and Semarang, and plan to grow in Sumatra and acquire and manage more hospitals in Java.</p><h4>Do you offer all-around healthcare services or specialize in certain fields?</h4><p>We have three different hospitals with three different levels of growth in three different regions of Indonesia. We are the most mature in Medan, where we handle a great deal of tertiary care and critical cases. Many critical cases from Banda Aceh all the way to Batam are brought to our hospital because we run one of the best critical care units and surgical centers of excellence in our area. In Jakarta, we handle general cases at the moment because we have not evolved into a tertiary care hospital just yet. All hospitals start at the level of general care and then progress into whatever specialized fields that are actually needed. In order for us to specialize, we need to first understand what an area requires. We then evolve into certain specialized areas by developing centers of excellence. In Medan, we have several centers of excellence in the same hospital that were formed over years of expanding and understanding what the community needs and what our doctors' capabilities are. This is our strategy: to establish hospitals and develop centers of excellence within them.</p><h4>How are the dynamics between the public and private healthcare systems here different?</h4><p>Since President Widodo took power, there has been a strong dedication to providing healthcare to the country. Since then, the government and the Ministry of Health have done remarkably well to provide this health coverage program to facilitate public health. The moment public healthcare awareness and provision increases, it will automatically escalate private healthcare because the bar is being set higher. Indonesia's public healthcare program has helped to raise the overall healthcare bar for the country, which is extremely positive. Now it is a matter of choosing the type of healthcare one needs. It is becoming a buyer's choice because various healthcare systems are available, and this is significantly changing the landscape.</p><h4>What is Columbia Asia Indonesia's approach to sourcing, recruiting, and retaining its staff?</h4><p>There is no shortage of doctors or skilled medical and clinical staff here, but Columbia Asia Indonesia has to be an environment that improves its medical professionals. We have to provide the best environment for our people to strive; if we do that, our staff will automatically deliver a much higher level of commitment and service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the implementation of the national healthcare scheme in Indonesia?</h4><p>Indonesia has taken significant steps toward universal health coverage through the development of an integrated national health scheme. The social health insurance scheme called National Health Insurance (JKN), launched in 2014. The aim of JKN is to provide all citizens with access to quality health services, including prevention, promotion, treatment, and rehabilitation, while also protecting them from health-related financial hardship. The evaluation of the implementation of JKN includes issues such as membership coverage, healthcare providers, managing finances, healthcare utilization, and healthcare quality improvement. Indonesia has committed to achieving universal health coverage in 2019. In November 2017, enrolled members of JKN reached 183,579,086, a phenomenal achievement and some 73% of the population. Of these, 59.9% are from lower-income groups, 16.1% are informal workers or unemployed, and 24% are formal workers. JKN involves public healthcare providers—community clinics and public hospitals—and private healthcare providers—private and specialist clinics, individual physician practices, and private hospitals—as they are contracted by the Healthcare and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan). As of November 2017, BPJS Kesehatan had contracted 21,771 healthcare providers across the country, consisting of 5,900 primary healthcare providers and 2,261 referral healthcare providers. In 2016, there were up to 192.9 million visits using JKN, nearly double the 2014 figures. In 1H2017, BPJS Kesehatan reported that the number of healthcare visits under JKN reached 106.2 million, which demonstrates that JKN has succeeded in improving access to healthcare for citizens. In terms of quality improvement, the Ministry of Health has implemented a healthcare referral system to ensure that all healthcare providers have a national standard. All referral healthcare providers must be accredited by 2019, and all primary healthcare providers—public health centers—must be accredited by 2021. The Ministry of Health also set national clinical practice guidelines for both primary and referral healthcare.</p><h4>How has BPJS Kesehatan contributed to a more inclusive healthcare landscape?</h4><p>JKN is integrating the many fragmented insurance programs and covering the poor and near poor, civil servants, military personnel, police, pensioners, state enterprises, informal workers, and private formal workers. It ensures that the entire population will be covered under a single national health insurance program and brings Indonesia closer to achieving universal healthcare coverage. BPJS Kesehatan is responsible for managing the national health insurance program. It has been operating as a single payer across the country, and its role is recruiting members, collecting premiums, accrediting healthcare providers, making payments to contracted healthcare providers, and handling complaints. The Ministry of Health, as the regulator, is responsible for setting regulations related to the implementation of JKN. In addition, the ministry is also responsible for ensuring healthcare provider availability, including health facilities, health workforce, medical equipment, and medication, by working together with local governments and the private sector.</p><h4>How do you envision the role of the ministry in attracting investment into the medical equipment and pharmaceutical sectors?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health aims for Indonesia to be more self-reliant in the field of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in order to meet healthcare needs at a more affordable price. High levels of imports of pharmaceutical raw materials and medical devices may affect the cost of health services in the event of economic fluctuations at a global level. Indonesia's pharmaceutical industry is promising for both domestic players and foreign investors. The Ministry of Health aims to accelerate these industries' development through its Action Plan for the Development of Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industry established by the Minister of Health in 2017. According to the Presidential Decree No. 44/2016, foreign pharmaceutical industries that produce patented medication or high technology can use up to 85% of FDI while those that produce pharma raw materials as well as high-tech medical devices can use up to 100%. This investment policy is expected to attract more investment to produce pharmaceutical raw materials and high-tech medical devices as well as reduce our dependence on imports. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Freight Expectations]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[freight-expectations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you achieve your strong numbers in 2017?</h4><p>Our achievements in 2017 came from passenger revenues as well as freight. Revenues increased significantly, though the company expended great efforts in the process. The share of passengers and freight revenues were each 50% in 2017, though passengers previously made up a larger percentage. We are keen to evaluate freight transportation because there are excellent opportunities in Indonesia currently. The president supports the transportation of freight by train whenever possible, as it benefits the country. There are also less accidents than on the road and reduced pollution. However, some of the regulations should be applied equally for both trains and trucks, such as the maximum permitted tonnage. We always obey the regulations and have asked the government to ensure they are enforced for trucks.</p><h4>How do you balance the different types of passenger transport?</h4><p>There are three kinds of passenger transportation: local, medium, and long-distance transportation. The commuter line today sees a maximum of 1.076 million passengers a day, and this is critical because it keeps cars and motorcycles off the roads in Jakarta. Now, Indonesian Railway and the Ministry of Transportation have to solve the problem of local, medium, and long-distance trains all sharing the same tracks. In modern countries, local and long-distance trains are on different tracks, which we should be doing. We will separate these two trains in order to maximize train journeys.</p><h4>How will you spend the capital from your recent bond issue?</h4><p>There are two purposes for the money. One is to support the Indonesian Railway Company, our subsidiary that runs the airport train. The second is to renew our wagons that are more than 30 years old. We will purchase new wagons to provide passengers with excellent services. This will bring us up to 880 wagons, though we already purchased 438 wagons.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to issue a subsidiary IPO in 2018, and what would that achieve?</h4><p>We have six subsidiaries, and the commuter company has a great opportunity to list on the stock exchange. However, we still are evaluating if there will be an IPO in the near future.</p><h4>What is the current stage of the Greater Jakarta Light Rail Transit (LRT) project?<br></h4><p>The LRT, which was assigned to Indonesian Railway, is still under construction. We hope it will be commercially viable by mid-2019 and a commercial success. The existing commuter line sees over 1 million passengers a day, and we hope the LRT will help solve the transportation issues in Jakarta. This is a problem not only in Jakarta but also in other large cities, so we are considering developing an LRT in Bandung and Surabaya. </p><h4>What are some of the other large projects close to completion that are important for the company?<br></h4><p>We have projects built by the Ministry of Transportation, such as the Palima LRT, which will be operational by June 2018. In addition, there is the airport railway in West Sumatra, whose infrastructure was built by the government and rolling stock and trains by ourselves. This will help us in terms of revenue.</p><h4>What are your other ambitions for 2018?</h4><p>There is the airport train in Surakarta that will be commercially operational in 2018 as well as a double track in South Sumatra that will allow us to maximize freight transportation. Currently, there are up to seven companies on the waiting list to transport coal from mines. In 2018, we also plan to purchase 15 locomotives. Indonesian Railway provides a public service, so this is not a pure business. We seek to help the government solve logistics costs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[World’s Window into Indonesia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[worlds-window-into-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you cover business and economics across the platforms you operate in, and how do you maintain the central Berita Satu brand?</h4><p>We actually started as a set of brands that did not have a unifying component. Slowly, we began to realize the majority of our brands were strong in one core area: business. Investor Daily began its life covering stock markets and business and economic conditions, and we were one of only two companies that did that. Globe Asia was a business magazine tailored toward young professionals interested in learning about conglomerates in Indonesia. Jakarta Globe had a strong business desk, and we were able to rely on synergies with Globe Asia. Thus, over time, a focus on business became one of our central tenants. Around three years ago, we developed the concept of an integrated newsroom where all nine brands operated from a single newsroom. We also had a strong presence in the business community, and access to many of the top businessmen and up-and-coming companies was already clearly established. We leveraged many of these connections and were able to position ourselves quite well. The transition was organic, and we have maintained this type of growth. We really like the individual identities of all our brands and are careful to ensure that our best offering is labeled under the Berita Satu brand.</p><h4>Is there a strategy for elevating Berita Satus on the international stage?</h4><p>We are constantly trying to improve our circulation. When it comes to our circulation desk, there are two key groups we focus on. The first is the Indonesian diaspora; we have between 7 and 8 million in the Indonesian diaspora around the globe. Of those, around 4-4.5 million are potential readers for the Jakarta Globe. These are the scholars, students, and professionals. We also seek to target a younger audience, and part of this process is making contact with all the institutions that have a large Indonesian population and starting there. Educational institutions, think tanks, and governmental organizations are keen to reach Indonesia's large population. The second major group is everyone with business interests in Indonesia. Due to our strength in business news, we felt that it was time to leverage that national expertise on an international stage. We want to share Indonesia with the world and underscore the potential that the country has for business people all over the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the reporting environment and the media sector in 2018?</h4><p>In terms of the reporting environment, I expect continuity. We are one of Southeast Asia's most stable democracies and one of its most respected governments. With this comes a certain responsibility to maintain an open and free media. For 2018, journalists are in great shape. Many of the veterans of the industry fought for the freedoms we are enjoying now. Issues such as blasphemy and extremism will continue to be a problem; however, that is part and parcel of a growing democracy. They are growing pains that we will have to deal with. In terms of the broad media environment, we are all gearing up for the 2019 election. We are preparing to educate and inform this massive country on the pressing political issues, and it will no doubt prove to be one of the most pivotal elections in recent memory. The media environment will be exciting, and many media companies will try new things. The way the US, for example, reports on its elections is different than how we do it in Indonesia. By creating a similar approach, we will be able to capture and employ data in a whole new way, guiding and informing our customers like never before. We saw the potential this year after the regional elections, and we will continue to improve upon this system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Digitally  Savvy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[digitally-savvy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are core strategies for international firms coming to the Indonesian market?</h4><p>There are 17,000 islands, with easily more than 200 ethnicities and languages. It is impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach. However, if we focus on where the population is centered, it is definitely Java, which has 60% of the population. There is an urban migration of about 5% per year, and more people will move to Java. President Joko Widodo's move to decentralize is great. It lends itself to talk about moving the administrative capital to central Java or even to Kalimantan. It then means we need to have an understanding of the thread that cuts across all these various logistics. The cultural nuances are one. Indonesia is a collectivist society, and people are consensus builders. When a company comes to Indonesia, it has to take stock of these cultural nuances. Otherwise, it would be a challenge to understand how to do business here.</p><h4>What has your experience been with Indonesian companies wanting to reach out to the international arena?</h4><p>Right now, we are working on one of the largest IPOs in Indonesia for 2017. We see that they are keen to expand. That is a sense of confidence now about local companies that can grow. For example, there is GO-JEK, which has hubs in India and is building in San Francisco, or Traveloka, which recently received USD500 million in investment, including from Expedia. Therefore, there is a sense of confidence that Indonesian companies can work on the global scale. In e-commerce technology, there is a great scope for Indonesian companies to push out.</p><h4>How would you describe the e-commerce landscape?</h4><p>Because of the spread of the islands and where people are, logistics is quite expensive. It can be a challenge to open up retail stores. Getting goods from the port to all parts of Indonesia will be tough. The infrastructure is not quite there yet, although the country is building on it currently. The road, port, rail, and air cargo infrastructures could all be improved, and they are being improved. The e-commerce business is the best way to reach Indonesia. With e-commerce and the smartphone service system, more and more businesses realize that in order to capture the 260-million population and maximize consumer spending power, it has to go online. We now see Alibaba and Amazon coming in because the market is so large and digitally savvy.</p><h4>How would you describe the business media landscape of Indonesia?</h4><p>Things have changed; there are more than 13 media groups, some of which are fiercely independent. We now also see the rise of citizen journalism. News as we know it, in terms of traditional media such as broadcast, is doing fine because outside of Java, TV is still key for media. The newspaper reach, however, is dropping. Everyone in terms of the media landscape in Java has converged and consolidated toward digital or online news platforms. The main obstacle for digital currently is the credibility of online platforms. Facebook has about 90 million users here, and almost 80% are active users. Social messaging platforms are huge. That is really how news is spread and shared among people, posing a challenge to traditional news outlets. In that sense as well, the online social space has got certain issues because of false news. People share a story before they have checked it. The traditional media still has a role to play in how social media is harnessed. Brands have a role to play by monitoring what is going on in conversations and reacting quickly. The media has transformed over the last two years. Indonesia is one of the most rapidly digitalizing countries in the sense of consumer social media. That is the news for investors coming here: to get people on their phones. From the brands and reputations side, this is extremely important. Data analysis and real-time insights will be the key differentiating factor for brands in Indonesia moving forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From a policy perspective, what are your strategies to drive a positive and inclusive disruption through digital innovation?</h4><p>We cannot run from technology, which has great potential to solve wealth disparity and empower SMEs. However, it is not technology that is changing the world; people's mindsets are changing the world. People always find new ways and new business processes by maximizing the use of technology. ICT is an enabler of economic growth and social transformation, and now we can focus on maximizing technology to support economic growth. We aim to have a digital economy of USD130 billion by 2020, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's GDP. We would also like to develop our own platforms. China, for example, has found its own way to deal with technology. It does not allow Google; instead, it introduced its own search engine platform. That is why Indonesia is currently in a transition period to position itself within the digital tsunami. Everyone in Indonesia is on Facebook and WhatsApp. We cannot stop those platforms or deny their access in Indonesia; however, the government needs to position itself to protect people from the negative impacts of this technology. We are working hard with foreign investors that want to conduct their business in Indonesia, and we would like to be as competitive as possible in the international landscape.</p><h4>What role can technology play in formalizing the economy?<br></h4><p>The key to technology is broadband. We have the network. This country started to introduce 4G technology at the end of 2015. Currently, 297 regencies and cities out of 512 have 4G coverage, and we aim for all regions to be connected to broadband and 4G by 2019. From an ICT infrastructure perspective, we are number four in Asia after Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. The challenge is great compared to our neighbors because of our geography. The investment to connect all islands by 2019 is USD1.5 billion. We built this with PPPs because we want the private sector participating in this space. By 2H2018, we will make a decision on our own satellite. In Indonesia, we need a high-speed satellite because we have to connect around 220,000 schools at the primary and secondary levels and thousands at the tertiary level. We have to connect 75,000 village offices and 10,000 village hospitals. We have already incorporated this plan into our National Strategic Project signed by the president. We cannot compete with Singapore because it is a small island; however, by 2019 Jakarta will be more competitive. There will not be much difference between Singapore and Jakarta from an ICT point of view.</p><h4>How can you help create a climate that supports entrepreneurship and start-ups?<br></h4><p>We have to provide room for people to innovate as much as possible. That is why in our ministry start-ups do not need to get permits or licenses; they only need to register. We need to give start-ups a chance to develop and see what they can do before we regulate. We have to provide room so that people can come up with something completely out of the box. It is not necessary to create a difficult, complicated process.</p><h4>The decree for the National Cyber and Encryption Agency (BSSN) was ratified in June 2017. How would you assess the establishment of this agency so far?</h4><p>We are working with the government to appoint the chairman of BSSN. This agency deals with cybersecurity and cryptographs. The Executive Director of Alibaba, Jack Ma, is an e-commerce advisor of the government. We are working with Ma to develop Indonesia as the base of talent development for the region. We also want to help universities focus more on technology. With this combination, foreign investors will be able to see Indonesia as not only a market but also the base for conducting business in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be Indorama's main achievements?</h4><p>The group has grown from USD10 million to almost USD10 billion over the last 40 years. We are extremely proud of our history and our origins in Indonesia. The people of this country and company are the ones who make the real difference. We employ over 10,000 people in Indonesia and over 30,000 people worldwide. To produce industrial goods, a company needs great people. Indonesia is where it all began for us. This is a great country and one that supports industry. We are a large producer and exporter of products. We export to almost 80 countries around the world. We are competitive, and a great deal of the competitiveness derives from our relationship with Indonesia. Demand for our products is growing worldwide. It has grown around 5-10% YoY over the last 40 years. Our growth is in line with GDP plus a little extra. The local market is also growing. Our plastics business is growing particularly well as they are used for basic consumer goods. Fibers for textiles are also strong. Fertilizers are doing well, and demand is growing around the world. Many of our Indonesian products are export oriented.</p><h4>What are the strategies that allow foreign companies to succeed in Indonesia?</h4><p>Indonesia is a transparent place, and people welcome foreigners. They want foreigners to come and succeed. We are pleased to have had a great relationship with our Indonesian counterparts for the last 40 years. The quality of the people and the community has truly been one of the secrets to our success. In some places, manpower is an issue; however, in Indonesia it is a strength. The Indonesian workforce is well trained. We recently built a world-class engineering polytechnic principally for the underpriviliged children of our local community as well as our Indonesian employees, which is heavily subsidized by our group as well as our partners. We currently have 240 students and this allows us to give something back to society. We want to improve the skills of these students, create knowledge, and illustrate how grateful we are.</p><h4>What are your investment and development plans?</h4><p>We have a large CAPEX for new projects as well as to upgrade our existing operations. We need to continuously upgrade and replace our plant and machinery. We must have faith in the country and the business and must continue to invest. We always reinvest our earnings in the business, which is why our product is of such high quality and why our people are so pleased. We want to keep costs down while improving production and efficiency.</p><h4>As a businessman, what legacy would you like to leave in Indonesia?</h4><p>Our legacy is demonstrating that those from other countries have succeeded while believing in and supporting local culture and people. This is a free country and anyone can succeed in business. Hard work is the key to success in this country. The national infrastructure and government structure are also key, and they have been supportive. We are a public company; however, our family is the majority shareholder. The most important thing is to run a family company like any other corporation. We must have rapid decision-making, hard workers, and a focus on lowering costs. A company also needs to have a long-term focus. It needs great financial management, and people should trust the company.</p><h4>How do you expect the company and the economy to change over the next year?</h4><p>We hope the Jakarta metro will start operations in 2018. We also hope all the infrastructure projects in the country will be further along, which will put a smile on our faces. Traveling in this country can take a long time, and we hope to see this improving. We have an overburdened system, though this is the price one pays for industrialization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Plenty of Fish in the Sea]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[plenty-of-fish-in-the-sea]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Perinus fit in Indonesia's fishing industry?</h4><p>Indonesia has the second-largest marine industry in the world. In the past, illegal fishing decimated the fisheries industry in Indonesia. The Philippines, Thailand, and China had all been caught illegally fishing in Indonesia. Our fisheries minister has implemented a successful enforcement policy of targeting illegal vessels. That, combined with regulations on nets and gross hauls, has supported catches enormously. In Indonesia, we only have two state-owned fishing companies: Perinus and Perum Perikanan Indonesia. The companies manage different parts of the archipelago, and we manage the east. The diamonds of the nation's fisheries are in the east, close to Timor. The new regulations present a great opportunity for us. In fact, we have grown 200% in revenue in 2017 alone, and profits have grown 109%. This means that we can now invest in new construction projects, ships, and cold storage. In 2017, we prepared the infrastructure for increased stocks and built new cold storage facilities to support further expansion.</p><h4>How do you support local fishermen, who have historically been an important engine of economic growth?</h4><p>We are in cooperation with the fishermen and purchase from them. We also give them gas and ice in return for a commitment that their fish are sold to us. This arrangement is a win-win situation, since we effectively are co-investors and provide the capital for their operations. We cover their expenses and provide them with a steady income based on their catch, which has gone up. We also have our own fleet, which will expand in 2018.</p><h4>What are the local and international markets for Indonesian catch, and how will you expand this?</h4><p>In Thailand, 70% of the fishery industry is sourced from Indonesia. They need Indonesian fish, and the entire region to some degree depends on us. We do not worry about the market as every day many companies contact Perinus with their demands for our product. 2018 is a good opportunity, but the issue with the fishery industry now is small trawlers, which people are still using in Java. In December 2017, this style of fishing was stopped, but fishermen still use small trawlers out of habit. They are bad for the fish population, and we have to change the habits, as there are many alternatives.</p><h4>What are your main focuses and strategy for the company?</h4><p>In 2018, we will focus on catching, of course, and, second, we will focus on how to prepare infrastructure in our branches. We are also developing aquaculture projects in cooperation with a company from Norway. We have already built the aquaculture facility in Sabang, Karmon, and Panandara using Norwegian technology for sea bass. Norwegian salmon is produced using aquaculture, and with new technology, we can look at the fish with cameras, feed them with computers, and ensure the highest levels of productivity. We are still waiting for the first harvest, as these are the first aquaculture projects with the new technology.</p><h4>Will you expand your current fleet in 2018, and what are your growth projections?</h4><p>We will buy new boats, and we will still buy from fishermen. Every month we prepare to buy IDR150 billion from the fishermen for trading purposes, but we are also investing in new boats, infrastructure, cold storage, and processing. In 2017, we have built USD20 million worth of infrastructure to improve our branch. In 2018, we will invest USD30 million but also prepare USD15 million per month only for trading. We received our target from our minister of USD100 million in revenue in 2018. We are currently at USD50 million; hence, we plan to double our growth again this year. As of now, we are still focused on increasing the revenue and size of the company, thus we will remain a state-owned company. After this, we will think about privatization and an IPO. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Big Opportunities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[big-opportunities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the Ministry of Industry's key accomplishments and achievements over the last two years?</h4><p>The Ministry of Industry is in charge of developing the manufacturing sectors in Indonesia. President Joko Widodo's vision for industry is to develop the country's human resources. As part of this, the ministry is transforming middle schools, especially vocational schools, so they become the mainstream of Indonesian education in the future. We would like technical training to be a main part of our human resources development, focused on science, math, engineering, and technologies. Through these vocational schools, we will develop students who can then go on to polytechnic training. We are following industrial countries such as Germany and Switzerland. The objective is to enhance the competitiveness of our labor, talent, and supervisory pools on the manufacturing floor. The second aspect is the inclusiveness of the Indonesian economy. There are large disparities between socioeconomic classes. We need to narrow the gap by introducing new opportunities for SMEs. We will use the digital platform as a way to transform the SME ecosystem to create inclusive growth in the economy.</p><h4>Indonesia has incredible potential to grow its industrial sector on several fronts. What key strategies drive your work today?</h4><p>Our strategy is strengthening the value chain. In Indonesia, we have a few industries that are competitive. One is based on our natural resources and the second is based on our plantations or agriculture. Both are key for Indonesia's manufacturing sector. Another area is based on metals and electronic manufacturing, and we also have chemicals and textiles manufacturing. With these kinds of industries, we can develop a proper base for participating in ASEAN's Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution. The fourth issue is to advance regional development within the country. Outside Java, we have developed 14 special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial estates based on the availability of raw materials in those regions. For example, in the North Sumatra region we have developed an industrial estate in Sei Mangkei for the capital development of crude palm oil (CPO). We have also developed areas in West Kalimantan based on bauxite mining and in East Kalimantan with all the petrochemicals, gas, and palm oil. We have a new hydropower development in North Kalimantan where we are going to install 7,000MW of generation capacity under our master plan, as well as a smelting and refinery complex. In West Papua, we will develop LNG and gas for petrochemicals. In the Southeast of Maluku, there is gas for petrochemicals as well.</p><h4>What work is the ministry doing to promote value-added industries that are less susceptible to price volatility?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, commodity prices have been volatile; however, that is no longer the case with most commodities going down in price. This is an opportunity for Indonesia to move further into manufacturing. We have a roadmap for 10 million tons of carbon steel in Cilegon, for instance. We have also built a ferronickel plant in central Sulawesi. By YE2017, we will have the capacity to produce around 3 million tons of stainless steel per annum. With increases in production in Sulawesi, this capacity will increase to 4 million tons in the next year. This will make Indonesia the second-largest producer of stainless steel after China. This is the value addition from USD60 per metric ton of ferronickel raw material to around USD2,000 per ton of stainless steel. This is a real indicator that Indonesia is enhancing its value-added manufacturing. We have done the same thing with CPO from plantation into chemicals and with other commodities as well, such as bauxite to aluminum and aluminum alloy. Therefore, the commodity price drops are in fact a big opportunity for Indonesia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Drilling Solutions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[drilling-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your drilling expertise at PT Plumpang Raya Anugrah?</h4><p>In the last five years, we have worked on the three largest drilling development geothermal projects with the highest operation and safety standards. One was with Pertamina Geothermal Energy in Lumut Balai, Ulu Belu, and Sungai Penuh field in South Sumatra, and another was with Sarulla Operation Limited (SOL), operating in Northern Sumatra. In March 2017, we also won a new project with Supreme Energy in Muara Laboh. We are experienced in oil and gas; however, our expertise includes the requirements for geothermal, which requires high-horsepower rigs. All our rigs are US-built, and currently two are deployed with Supreme and two with Halliburton. The other three are currently participating in tender processes in Sumatra as well as eastern Indonesia. We are now looking to participate in another project for Supreme Energy Rantau Dadap in South Sumatra, which might start in 1Q2018. Furthermore, we are eying a geothermal project with Medco Power in Central Java, Enel Green Power Optima Way Ratai in South Sumatra, and Simbolon Samosir Energy in North Sumatra. We are also experienced in integrated project management drilling solutions and handled this for Pertamina Geothermal Energy in several fields.</p><h4>How would you assess private-public collaboration in the sector?</h4><p>The problem in geothermal is the cost for exploration, and that includes the necessary infrastructure development. If these investments solely come from private companies, it becomes almost unfeasible, and thus, we need the government to step in. Fortunately, there is willingness on its side to collaborate, both on exploration and energy infrastructure. There is a handicap, however, which is the new pricing mechanism. Following the new governmental regulations, PLN has now issued a maximum price on the production cost, as opposed to the previous feed-in tariff, whereby it would be discussed with PLN after exploration of the potential. The new pricing mechanism impedes potential investment in the sector. It is possible that investments will continue in East Indonesia because of the price differences across the country; however, the price in Sumatra is now USD0.0928 per kilowatt/hour, which is unattractive for investors. A new model, similar to what is being used by another geothermal company, could be developed, and that is to build a small power plant in a location where it drilled three or four wells. Instead of building a large power plant, they built several small plants with capacities of three to 10MW. In this way, operations commenced much faster. This model could be the model for the future, given the current governmental regulations. We see opportunities there.</p><h4>From your perspective, what is the potential for the future of the energy mix in Indonesia?</h4><p>We see enormous prospects for geothermal. Government regulation requires 25% of all energy to come from renewable energy by 2025, of which 20% should be geothermal. In total, there are plans to add 35,000MW to the total power generation capacity. The revolving fund that the government has set up coordinated by PT SMI is a great idea as it could drive more investments in the exploration stage. We are pleased to be involved with these government-backed exploration drillings and will await our deployments.</p><h4>Looking to the future, how is your organization gearing up for the projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>Currently, there is a strong backlog of geothermal projects; not all drilling contractors can work on such projects because of the specifications of the drill. If oil prices remain low, there will be better opportunities for geothermal. We want to be the drilling expert of choice in this country, and in the private sector, we are already the leaders in onshore drilling. With seven rigs, we outnumber our direct competitors. In the next several years, we anticipate more projects, as there is strong public and private drive to develop geothermal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2017 been thus far from a financial point of view?</h4><p>It has been great for the banking system in Kuwait, and excellent for ABK as a bank. We see high single-digit growth overall and double-digit growth in those segments and products that matter to us. We have outperformed the market for the last few years on an operating basis and are generally satisfied.</p><h4>Why did you decide to set up operations in the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC)?</h4><p>This is a good question, as we already have two onshore branches in the UAE. However, an offshore DIFC presence has other complementary benefits for ABK. DIFC has a strong, independent legal framework, and if a bank books an international syndicated loan, or if it finances a complex corporate finance structure, DIFC is the perfect place to house it. It also becomes much easier to buy, sell, and trade assets with other professional, DIFC-based lenders. In Kuwait, a bank only has Kuwaiti participants to sell to. In DIFC, most of the large international banks are present and can trade. Being in DIFC gives banks more international breadth, visibility, and legal comfort. It also allows us to become much more relevant in the regional corporate finance space and in structuring and distribution as well.</p><h4>What is your long-term strategy?</h4><p>Three years ago we developed a strategy that was based on transparency and simplicity to achieve faster top-line growth. We want to make life simpler for our clients, and we want to serve them better and faster than any other bank. It is easier to say than to effectively implement because we need to redesign all our processes and reinvent how we do business. This will have to be a continuous, never-ending process that must be embedded in the bank's DNA. In our case, we also needed to go beyond process re-engineering because our entire IT system needed to be upgraded and modernized to make it easier to use and more efficient. For instance, we always had a great and friendly mobile banking app for smartphones. However, that app did not speak to the system directly; it wasn't “straight-through,“ and we needed to have our back office team re-entering practically every transaction offline. Our migration to the new system took less than two years and was extremely successful; it will give us a significant competitive advantage in terms of anything that has to do with electronic banking or straight-through processing. In terms of efficiency and cost savings, it will significantly simplify our lives internally—and also make future upgrades seamless since we have only allowed minimum customization. A second aspect of our long-term strategy has been to focus on long-term top line growth rather than short-term bottom line results. Our expansion to Egypt is a perfect example of this. Another example, this one organic, is the launch of our wealth management business, which complements our debt capital market and syndication business. We have also become active in leading and structuring project finance transactions within the developmental plan that Kuwait is undertaking. We are currently finalizing our new three-year strategic plan. It will naturally be a continuation of our current “simplicity“ strategy, though we will add some great twists as well.</p><h4>What challenges do you expect to face in the future?</h4><p>The challenge will be to continue to grow faster than the market in operating terms, while at the same time protecting the bank. A bank can reduce risks by simply limiting its exposure to clients, though it will then not deliver growth. We need to come up with a different solution. Global Finance has ranked us among the top-10 safest banks in the Middle East and within the top-30 in Emerging Markets. We want to remain in that elite group, while delivering superior performance, and that will be our challenge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your role in the finance business in Kuwait?</h4><p>We consider ourselves one of the leading asset management investment banks in Kuwait with assets of USD10.4 billion as of December 31, 2016; we are an extremely client-centered business with a focus on enhancing returns from the financial sector. On the asset management front, we manage our clients' wealth in different asset classes and categories such as active, passive, funds, portfolios, and so on. In the investment banking space, this is where we do deals, no matter if they are capital market transactions, including equity capital markets, IPOs, placements, strategic investments, or debt capital markets. We are one of the top lead managers for bond issuance in Kuwait, in addition to being active in other parts of the region. Recognizing our market leading position on this front, we won the prestigious title, “Middle East Sukuk Bookrunner of the Year 2017" by Mergermarket as well as the Best GCC Investment Banking Co. 2016 award from World Finance. The third element in investment banking is advisory services, which are basically focused on M&amp;A, including selling or buying for a client, restructuring, merging, and specific advising for these clients.</p><h4>What are the objectives of your recently opened regional office in Dubai?</h4><p>When we started, the business was centered in Kuwait. However, as the business grew we discovered that our abilities could be exported beyond Kuwait into the region; therefore, we started launching products that are regional and investing on behalf of our clients on a regional basis. We are comfortable enough to establish a regional presence to also introduce investors to the Kuwaiti market and to some of our regional and international products. Therefore, the purpose of the Dubai office is to grow our reach; it will grow our business under the Dubai International Finance Centre.</p><h4>How do you see the market evolving in the near future in the region?</h4><p>We always look at our market as a young market; the ratio of equity market capitalization of Kuwait compared to its GDP is one of the lowest in the region. This is the same case with the debt market ratio, which is also one of the lowest regionally. The region has potential for significant growth in professional asset management and investing banking, and these two come with increased regulation, transparency, requirements for growth, and funding. The job of capital markets is to help companies grow because, as they grow, they need more funding, which comes from internal or external resources, and companies like KAMCO help with the funding of these businesses. We are optimistic about the region with Kuwait being the best-performing market in the GCC, boasting a YtD 2017 return of 14%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I am more optimistic for 2018 than I was for 2017. The changes in our equity capital market will have a positive bearing on investor confidence, and banking should continue to grow along with insurance businesses. Apart from being the best-performing market in the region, corporate profits continue to grow, with 1H2017 profits of Kuwaiti listed companies up by 12%. In addition, the opportunity is also highlighted by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook showing Kuwait as the best performing economy in the GCC in 2018 with an expected GDP growth rate of 4.1%. Government success in executing more projects will be key; there are plans to involve the private sector more, though my only concern is the speed of change. Nevertheless, I expect 2018 to be a positive year, in line with expectations of a stronger GDP growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Briefly, what is Boursa Kuwait's role in Kuwait's finance sector?</h4><p>Boursa Kuwait currently operates as Kuwait's only stock exchange. The company received its official license from the Capital Markets Authority, the government regulating body, on October 5, 2016. Boursa Kuwait has replaced the Kuwait Stock Exchange as part of the government's plan to bolster the economic sector through privatizing the stock market. Boursa Kuwait's key strategic objective is to effectively create and manage an attractive issuer base, broaden the investor base, increase the depth and breadth of products, and upgrade the stock exchange infrastructure and business environment to international standards. Boursa Kuwait aims to enhance the current level of performance, enable the market to compete with regional peers, and build a market reflecting the strength, depth, and flexibility of the Kuwaiti private sector. In addition, Boursa Kuwait aims to develop products that will allow Kuwaiti investors to trade in leading regional and international equities in an easy and efficient manner.</p><h4>It has been a year since you were officially licensed; how are you adapting to the environment?</h4><p>Despite the challenges and obstacles, we have done well in our first year. We have successfully launched a set of initiatives that have enabled us to provide world-class services and products, create an attractive corporate platform, and broaden the investor base. Our upgrade from a frontier market to a secondary emerging market in September 2017 is a testament to our hard work and success throughout this year, which was a joint effort between the Capital Markets Authority, the Kuwait Clearing Company, and Boursa Kuwait.</p><h4>One of your goals, when the firm was created, was to improve transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. How much progress is being made in this regard?</h4><p>Since Boursa Kuwait took on the responsibility of the exchange, it has been transparent with its stakeholders; however, more importantly, it has disclosed and shared information at the appropriate time, ensuring that the amount and type of information are just right for market knowledge. For example, Boursa Kuwait was eager to introduce the Companies Information Portal (CIP), a platform that allows listed companies to upload company-related information independently and on a regular basis. Boursa Kuwait also provides financial data services for all listed companies. Such data includes income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and financial ratios that are updated on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, some financial ratios are updated daily based on the closing price. The data is easily exportable and provided in both Arabic and English. The service is offered in affiliation with Thomson Reuters, an expert in the financial data services field. Boursa Kuwait's transparent approach has led its strategies since the start, and has positively resulted in a higher level of trust in the exchange.</p><h4>The Kuwait 2035 Development plan aims to transform Kuwait into a regional hub for finance. How do you fit into that plan?</h4><p>The new Kuwait strategy is indeed an important step toward supporting the exchange in capital markets; however, it goes both ways. The work being done within the exchange and the intellectual investment being made to ensure a successful transformation of the stock market is a key contribution to the improvement of the capital market's status and the economy as a whole. One of the plan's short- to medium-term objectives includes growing FDI by 300% through the rich portfolio of massive projects set to be rolled out over the coming years. By making such substantial investments, we are creating an attractive investment platform for foreigners and, hence, raising the profile of the nation's exchange market, which is already in the process of equipping the exchange with products, services, and trading systems that will allow it to operate according to world-class standards and based on global best practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the necessity of moving toward digital banking infrastructure?</h4><p>A few years ago, we noticed a change in the dynamics of our consumers. Kuwait has a youthful society, and the average age is falling every year. We cater to the needs of all our customers, though we have to adapt to meet the demands of the new generations. Today, our customers want technology and want to be on the cutting edge of things. We have been improving our technology and digital banking services for some years now. This process is three-fold: to improve our products, provide services online, and give better customer service. The less human interaction there is in a transaction between customers and the executioner, the more efficient and error-free it is. This is what the new generation requires and is the reason why we are currently investing a great deal in technology. We have about 200 services that we can execute online for our clients.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind the automated branches that you are launching?</h4><p>We have launched many digital and innovative technology products, and we have recently launched our first automated branch in Kuwait. The XTM is a machine in a 6-sqm space that allows customers to do several transactions: withdraw cash, deposit money, or open an account without the need of a debit or ATM card but only their national ID. There is an officer at hand that one can converse with. For those who want to conduct more sophisticated transactions, such as opening an account, buying gold, updating an application, or signing or receiving approval on something, they can sign a document and the transaction will be performed for them. This automated branch may well be the future; it is adaptable, and as we go, we can add more services to it. The technology, software, development, and analytics of the XTM were built in-house. Our own IT research team in our subsidiaries in Turkey developed it, and we are rolling it out now to the entire group. In Turkey, we have about 100 automated XTM branches, and in Kuwait, we started with two this year. One is in the Avenues Mall, and the other is at the entrance of our Faiha branch.</p><h4>How will KFH continue to lead the Islamic finance industry, both in Kuwait and globally?</h4><p>We have many strengths at KFH, and one that is core to us is that we are the first Islamic bank. We offer a wide range of sharia-compliant products and services. The core ones are on the asset and liability side, and we take deposits and invest them on our customers' behalf in several structures. We share the profits of these deposits with the customer. We cater to our customers' needs in a unique way that no one has done before. We have 45 women-only branches, as this is what our customers have asked for. There is no other bank in Kuwait with women-only branches. We have a global presence and 484 branches across Kuwait, Turkey, Malaysia, Bahrain, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. Our customers appreciate that when they want to deal internationally in commerce or business, they can utilize our branches. Internationally, Islamic banking is not widely available as is the case in Kuwait, which has five Islamic banks. The markets that are most interesting for us are those with strong Islamic banking demand and short supply of Islamic financial institutions. We serve foreign communities that want to have the option of an Islamic bank, such as in Germany, where there are almost 5 million Muslims. The most important thing is that we stay true and close to our customers. Our core vision is to lead the international development of Islamic financial services, and become the most trusted and sustainably most profitable shariah-compliant bank in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[salem-bin-ashoor-chief-representative-gm-bp-uae]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of BP's partnership with the Abu Dhabi government?</h4><p>Typical oil and gas deals are either production sharing agreements (PSA), concessions, or royalty and tax type deals. Our present agreement, however, goes beyond a normal contract: it is more integrated into the organization of a sovereign fund, allowing it to have a real stake in the future of our organization. This is all built on the relationship and trust BP has earned with Abu Dhabi as a result of a common history and of having worked together for a long time. The success of Abu Dhabi, represented by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, has been and is an important and attractive factor for BP, and now that Abu Dhabi is our shareholder, the relationship is even more special, it has a different reach: now Abu Dhabi wants us to succeed in all of our ventures, not only in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What cutting-edge technology are you able to implement through this partnership?</h4><p>At BP, we apply technology at scale across all of our portfolio: technology is really at the heart of everything we do. This is visible even in our relationship with ADNOC, where we are providing the best technical and business collaboration to help build greater efficiency and more profitability. In doing so, we are benefiting from greater transparency in terms of what we can add value to, and how we can transfer our knowledge. This not only concerns technology itself, but also the application of this technology: providing technology is only half of the game: 50% of success depends on its execution. That being said, technology is a critical enabler in helping us find and recover hydrocarbons. BP is a leader in deploying Enhanced Oil Recovery schemes and has developed several proprietary technologies, such as low salinity water injection (LoSal), to help recover more oil from the reservoir. BP is also a leader in water flood technology, a type of improved oil recovery. Our success is shown by how we are maximizing recovery from some of the world's largest reservoirs and from maturing fields in places such as in Azerbaijan, Iraq, Russia and the US. As for Abu Dhabi, we support ADNOC to meet its production target and in their aspiration to achieve 60-70% recovery factor too. This is through our technical capability which is demonstrated in different ways: through our secondees through our joint research programs that we have had with ADNOC, for example Carbonate Ionic Design, enhanced oil recovery, reservoir modelling; through the Subsurface Centre of Excellence in ADNOC; through our leading position in the Digital Oil Fields work and through our experience in giant water flood oil fields as well as addressing operational challenges. A key enabler, in this sense, is the transfer of senior experts and technology.</p><h4>What have been the most recent developments in the downstream business?</h4><p>All national oil companies (NOC) in the region are looking into downstream as they seek extra value in each drop of oil. This approach is great in terms of diversifying income and reflects the challenges of today's market. In order to be successful, companies will be required to have a competitive edge through a differentiated offer that is then able to grow into a niche market. Each player will be known not only regionally, but also globally for a certain segment of the downstream or petrochemicals business.</p><h4>What are your views on the long-term future of the oil industry?</h4><p>The oil price game has changed with the advent of shale. As of January 2018, oil prices have fallen from USD100 all the way to nearly USD30 at times: that is 70% of our income being cut away. Reaching USD100 again in the foreseeable future is no longer possible, but the market needs stability. As such, the oil cap deal has to stand up despite pressures of the supply and demand equation, which of itself is challenging, and the fact that the deal is between OPEC and non-OPEC countries. This is the first time there has been such a deal, and it will be tough to maintain as there is no structure or institution to do so. USD70 is healthier for more or less the entire GCC, though the question is whether shale will continue to push on this price. This is why a diversification of the industry is crucial in seeing what line we can strike from a barrel of oil. In summary whatever the oil price is, we need to be a profitable organization.</p><h4>What further measures should be taken by the government to achieve the strategy of 2030 and beyond to 2050?</h4><p>Education is key. If we instill the right values, we will reap what we sow. We need to start not only from education in schools, but also education in terms of culture, setting role models for the next generation. We have a program with Abu Dhabi Environment Agency called Sustainable Schools, where we train students who compete in different schools on how to protect the environment and recycling or reducing some of the waste. If the private sector and the government work closely via these initiatives, it will make a huge difference to society.</p><h4>What role does BP play in the UAE and in the overall BP group strategy and what are your expectations for the near future?</h4><p>Starting with the role we can play as an organization in the private sector, we will draw our priority from the 2030 vision of Abu Dhabi and the UAE. We are truly excited to be part of this journey and are pleased to play our role to support this transformation and growth in Abu Dhabi. We hope to show how private sector partnerships with the government can add a positive angle. We would like to do more and add value by bringing in more technology and advancing our participation not only upstream but in the full value-chain. Abu Dhabi is an important strategic shareholder in BP. Abu Dhabi Government holds shares in BP. Our net production from Abu Dhabi is around 180,000 barrels of oil/day from ADNOC Onshore, representing a good contribution to BP's overall portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the opportunities in Indonesia within the field of renewable energy?</h4><p>Indonesia is one of the countries with significant potential in the global geothermal market. Currently, Fuji has almost a 50% market share in Indonesia and is increasing its market share. In 2018, we were awarded a major project of Muara Laboh in Sumatra. The government is planning to increase the production up to 7GW by 2025 from 1.7GW today. The steam produced from the well is transmitted to the power plant, where the main equipment produces electricity by the steam. We started working for a geothermal plant in 1980 at a time when other competitors did not see the potential in Indonesia. Over time, we have supplied one geothermal plant after another, now working as not only a manufacturer but also an EPC company. We would like to grow together with the Republic of Indonesia and sustain the leading position in geothermal power generation.</p><h4>What could be done to attract more investments into geothermal?</h4><p>It would be expected for Indonesia to be more flexible in the regulations to encourage more investors in the area and offer an attractive purchase price of geothermal electricity so as not to have a negative impact on geothermal development with a deep concern for the long-term return on investment. Geothermal independent power producer (IPP) sales price will be compared to other kinds of power plants. Once the period of initial high investment is over, the steam is acquired with much less investment or maintenance expenditures after the operation starts. In the case of oil and gas drilling, even if they fail to drill in the right place, there are still some government compensations. In geothermal, however, such aid has not yet been established. The government declares it would like to increase total power supply by additional 35GW, 25% of which should be renewable energy with plans for geothermal to be the biggest contributor within the renewable energies matrix. We could attract more investors only if the government provides a more favorable purchase price for geothermal power plants.</p><h4>How can Fuji support Indonesia with its sustainability objectives?</h4><p>We have extensive experience in energy saving systems all over the world, and the most outstanding one is our smart city project in Japan. With our know-how, we are ready to serve also Indonesian power plants by providing such technologies. Power plants in Indonesia were not designed with the intent of saving energy but rather reducing costs. For example, the engines consume a large amount of power, and most of all, motors in power plants in Indonesia today do not have inverters for driving the system efficiently. Motors run for 24 hours a day while effective operations only take place for six hours. Fuji Electric has a solution for efficient motor control. New technology requires higher investment; however, energy-efficient plants run for a long time and gain accumulative efficiency, which will generate much greater profits.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your Suryacipta industrial park project?</h4><p>With Japanese government (NEDO) assistance, we provided a high-quality electricity supply system to Suryacipta Industrial Park by utilizing Japanese power infrastructure technology. This project is designed to solve the problem of inconsistent electricity supply common in Indonesia. We have installed a large system with Japanese government funding of around USD50 million there. Together with NEDO and a consortium of Japanese companies, including Sumitomo Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric, NTT, and TEPCO of Japan, Fuji provides the best solution for power stabilization and improves the quality of PLN incoming power. In this project, we installed UPS with the capacity of around 4.5MW for selected tenants in the industrial park. We became the first company to provide such a solution in Indonesia. I hope Fuji Electric Indonesia will grow strongly with the country and contribute to it continuing into the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has been made toward the government's 35GW energy generation plans?</h4><p>This program started in May 2015, and we currently have signed contracts worth around 32GW of the planned 35GW. The remaining 3GW will be done by PLN directly. We are working hard to expand capacity based on our 10-year plan. Every year, this plan is adjusted based on the realities of the market and the conditions of the economy. We remain focused on profitability, sustainability, and financial integrity, which are all paramount to running a successful business.</p><h4>What are the unique attractions of the Komodo bond and do you have plans to issue them as well?</h4><p>The response from the market to the Komodo bond has been extremely enthusiastic, leading to over-subscription. Depending on the market response and pricing, we plan to issue a similar bond in the coming year. It is too soon to speculate how much money we will be able to raise, though we are confident that it will do well. We have already earmarked much of these funds for transmission and distribution, which we must invest in order to attract private capital. Additionally, we are focused on directing some of these funds toward renewable energy. We invite local investors to support these transmission and distribution efforts, and we have had a great deal of support from local banks. Nearly 95% of these programs are aimed at the local level. This will form the backbone of the network that will handle additional generation capacity.</p><h4>How did recent ministerial regulations governing IPPs change your outlook?</h4><p>The new regulations work to reduce the price of electricity and increase access and will have a positive effect on the industry, because it will improve the general population's access to power. It will also stimulate the broader economy by ensuring that the power supply is more reliable and continuous. Industry will be particularly well served by this development. We are working hard to achieve the government's stated renewable energy generation goals. Indonesia has many resources in the geothermal and hydro energy areas, and we will rely heavily on these sources to reach the 2025 targets. Additionally, some intermittent energy will be introduced. Solar and wind energy will be important parts of these plans, and we have almost finished constructing a 75MW wind farm that will be the largest in Southeast Asia and should come online in early 2018. We are extremely pleased to be able to participate in these projects.</p><h4>Will the new regulations hinder renewable energy development?</h4><p>We have signed contracts on 70 projects representing 1.2GW of renewable energy, illustrating that even under the new regulations renewable energies are growing and developing in a dynamic manner. These projects have not closed financing yet, though this is the largest development of renewable ever, which underlines just how strong the market is. The new regulations are not a threat to renewable energy development.</p><h4>Will supply from the plants you are building in the eastern part of the country exceed demand in those areas?</h4><p>There is a great deal of suppressed demand in areas in the east of the country, and we are excited and hopeful about developing these spots. Most of our customers in eastern areas use private diesel for home energy generation. Once we will be able to supply these people with a more permanent supply, they will switch to our energy grid. Development outside of Java has been slow historically; however, we are currently focusing a great deal on expanding our services in these areas. We want the entire country to have access to services similar to those available in Java and Sumatra. Until 2019, a large portion of the installed capacity will come outside of Java and in the eastern areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the latest investments in agriculture in the last few years?</h4><p>Our strategic vision is to feed the nation every day. As the leading food and agro-allied business in the country, our focus has always been to build linkages and to become fully integrated right from the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors across the food value chain. In the agro allied space, we have continued to consolidate on our investments in the five key value chains of starch, sweeteners, protein, oil and fat, and grains. In Kwara State, we have a 3,500 ha Cassava farm, where we are cultivating about 2,500 ha and producing cassava tubers in partnership with smallholder farmers and farmers groups through an outgrower scheme. We have also invested in a processing plant where we convert the Cassava tubers into high-quality cassava flour, and have very recently developed a local content product line, by introducing Golden Penny Garri to the market. Garri is a very popular staple food in Nigeria; and while the product itself is not new, this is perhaps the first attempt to produce Garri at an industrial scale.</p><h4>What crops today are the most relevant in your portfolio?</h4><p>We are directly involved in the cultivation of sugarcane, cassava, maize, palm, and soybean. While a significant percentage of our wheat is still imported, we have over the years invested considerably in developing local capacity. We are active supporters of the Wheat Farmers Association of Nigerian with research and development, provision of high yielding seeds and through other initiatives aimed at promoting Nigeria's vision for self-sufficiency in wheat production. Palm oil, is however, our mainstay. I trust you remember that Nigeria used to be the biggest producer of palm oil in the 1950s and 1960s. While it is no longer news that we have long lost our edge in the global market for palm oil, the government is already working hard to return to the world stage. We must however, boost local production, and become self-sufficient before we can think about exporting again. FMN has over the years invested heavily in the development of the oils and fat value chain in Nigeria. In Edo state we have a 4,500 hectares of oil palm plantation that provides raw materials for our edible oils factory.</p><h4>What crops could Nigeria be self-sufficient?</h4><p>Maize is a common crop across all the states of the federation. Sadly, a significant amount of Maize is still imported, today. While Nigeria produces about 10 million metric tons of Maize annually, her growing population is a clear indication that there is a huge shortfall between what is produced and the increasing mouths that needs to be fed.  With the ever-increasing demand for carbohydrates; it might take some time to build capacity for self-sufficiency in Nigeria. There are however, other crops where we have significant competitive advantage, though there must be a sustained focus and renewed support to increase capacity and attain self-sufficiency and then subsequently export. Although, I must point out that improved levels of exports for certain crops are not necessarily an indicator that we have achieved self-sufficiency for that crop. Soybean is a fitting example in that regard; it is produced locally and is also exported, but we have not attained self-sufficiency. The export of soybean is purely based on import parity and the demand for non-GMO soybean. Nigeria should continue to build its capacity in crops where we have a competitive advantage for not just local consumption but with value addition. With soybean, we can extract the oil and process it as edible vegetable oil, and still be able to export the soybean meal after the extraction of the oil. This provides value addition, which is what we are doing in Flour Mills.</p><h4>How would you assess the current business environment?</h4><p>Things are improving at the macro economy level. Policies are now clearer, more stable and are being properly executed. Newer policies that are introduced are also more inclusive, which is extremely important to encourage invest. The government's initiative for the ease of doing business in Nigeria has been extremely helpful, especially in the areas of the much-needed infrastructural development. We have also observed improved monetary policies. Lending is now better, and rates are cheaper.</p><h4>What is the role of FMN in import substitution?</h4><p>First, we must lay the foundation for agriculture by looking at soft and hard infrastructure. We recently announced a partnership with DowDuPont to develop high yielding hybrid seeds for Nigeria in maize, soybean, cassava, and palm oil. The partnership will also promote modern farming techniques and practices for local production, including crop protection. There is almost no gainsaying that we need to build capacity in that space. We also need to lay the foundation for fertilizers. Already, several companies have started to move into that sector. We also need to take a closer look at proper agronomy methods — to train, and increase capacity in the proper methods of choosing the right seed, chemicals, and other modern agronomic practices. Irrigation is also extremely important as we cannot continue to rely solely on rain-fed agriculture. The government needs to build an efficient irrigation system for agriculture to truly succeed. The government also has to develop crop-processing zones as crops cannot be grown in the north and processed in the south. Agriculture needs to be linked with processes and an ecosystem needs to be established. That is our model, and our vision is to get Nigeria onto the map of developed agriculture states.</p><h4>What do you expect for FMN and the general business environment in 2019?</h4><p>Nigeria has just emerged from what can be easily described as some of the most challenging times for businesses. 2015 and 2016 were particularly challenging years. While we are appreciative of the improving economy, things are still somewhat fragile, although it is important to note that the government is doing everything possible to build the base for stability. 2019 can only be a growth year for us in terms of increasing our market share in the sectors that we operate. Our share price more than doubled over the last year. In the agro-allied space, we are securing our supply chain and ensuring that our core food business continues to get stronger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mubadala Investment Company benefited from its merger thus far?</h4><p>Mubadala Development Company and IPIC were extremely successful companies in their own right, even before they joined forces. This was a merger of equals that has created a global investment powerhouse, providing increased scale and global reach to pursue a bold new strategy. Looking back at the merger, this has been one of the smoothest and most productive processes I have been involved in. Moreover, as the largest corporate merger in the history of the UAE, the synergies we have been able to realize and opportunities we can unlock have been sizable. Take our petroleum and petrochemicals platform, in which we hold world-leading positions across the value chain of the sector. Since the merger, we have set out a clear strategy to pursue investments that help us realize opportunities, especially in the strategically important downstream sector. For example, Nova Chemicals' USD2.1 billion acquisition of one of the largest petrochemical facilities in the US, based in Geismar, Louisiana, will support the company as it embarks on its ambitious growth strategy. Mubadala Investment Company now can benefit from a stronger, more dynamic balance sheet and world-class expertise in industries vital to Abu Dhabi's growth. As a result, we are even better positioned to deliver against our mandate and generate attractive financial returns for our shareholder. In doing so, we can continue to contribute to the ongoing diversification of the economy, in line with the Abu Dhabi Plan and the country's long-term vision.</p><h4>Mubadala Investment Company recently moved into a range of technology-related fields. What are the benefits of investing in industries that are heavily disrupted by innovation?</h4><p>We have been involved in developing innovative technology companies since our inception, and our recent capital deployments in the sector are an extension of our strategy, rather than something new. Take the partnerships we have forged with world-leading tech companies such as our JV in Cognit, a collaboration with IBM's Watson to bring cognitive computing to the MENA region; or Yahsat, our satellite communications technology company that has brought affordable internet access to more than 140 countries. These are just two examples, though when we look at the changes taking place across society and business it is clear that digital disruption, and the technologies that make that possible, enhances the prospects of economies across the world. It has, therefore, been important for us to gain further exposure. Part of our global investment strategy consists of ensuring we are an integral part of these trends and positioned to capitalize on the opportunities they present. Our USD15 billion commitment to the Softbank Vision Fund, which provides exposure to a wide range of highly innovative and disruptive companies in the tech sector, is one example. Furthermore, through our recently announced San Francisco office, we are getting closer to the venture capital community that provides exposure to some of the most exciting and game-changing investment opportunities in the world.</p><h4>What are the major gaps in the country's healthcare sector and how can the public and private sectors cooperate to meet the existing medical needs of the UAE?</h4><p>When we initially looked at the healthcare system in Abu Dhabi, we aimed to identify the most pressing gaps across acute and critical care. Our goal was to deliver against a strategy of filling these gaps and introducing world-class healthcare, which we have largely achieved. We invested heavily to create a healthcare ecosystem in Abu Dhabi designed specifically to meet the needs of the local population. Take our Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC), which advances patient care on one of the most pressing healthcare issues for UAE nationals. It has expanded significantly in recent years with two facilities in Abu Dhabi and one in Al Ain, all of which are at capacity. Our flagship asset, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, has also started to reshape the healthcare model in the Emirates with a series of regional and country-wide firsts, including the nation's first multi-organ harvesting and transplant. This was possible because of the quality of clinical staff we have attracted and the world-class facility we have created to perform these procedures.</p><h4>What are the main challenges and opportunities that Abu Dhabi might encounter in the full adoption of green energy resources to meet the sustainability standards in the next decade?</h4><p>Mubadala is advancing the development, commercialization, and deployment of renewable energy solutions and clean technologies, helping to establish Abu Dhabi as a global center of excellence in the renewable energy and clean technology sector. Take the joint venture between Total and our renewable energy company, Masdar, to build the region's largest concentrated solar power plant, the 100MW Shams 1 project in Abu Dhabi. This USD600-million solar power project is the world's largest financing transaction for renewable energy and in March 2018, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of uninterrupted electricity supply. However, like all countries around the word, there are significant challenges in changing behaviors and improving adoption of green technologies, and while Masdar has led the way in driving the renewable and sustainability agenda, there is also a concerted effort at a policy level as well. The Environment Vision 2030 was developed to drive collaboration across key government entities, covering the environmental, social, and economic impact in areas such as agriculture, water resources, electricity consumption, air quality, and waste. If we get this right, there is also a significant commercial upside to add to the primary social and sustainability outcomes we are driving towards. Our Masdar wind farm projects, such as London Array, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, and Dudgeon offshore wind farm, which will generate the electricity equivalent for more than 410,000 UK homes, are just two examples. These investments not only have a major impact on sustainability but also generate attractive financial returns for our shareholder, the government of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Looking at 2018, where does Mubadala Investment Company see the potential for highest returns on investments?</h4><p>As a diversified global investment company, we are active in over 30 countries, from the large emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and Thailand to many of the world's key developed economies, including the US and Europe. We will continue to explore and maintain our operations in high-growth emerging markets, having invested over time to build market-leading platforms that position us well for future investment opportunities. However, as we evolve, our geographical exposure will also change. In line with our clear mandate to deliver financial returns, we will see the international portfolio increasingly weighted towards more developed markets that enable us to de-risk our investments while securing attractive and stable income streams. Alongside this, with our increased exposure to the technology sector, we expect to deploy capital in high-potential sectors. We will make strategic investments to position ourselves at the leading edge of these sectors</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the reason for the lack of interest in exploration from the private sector? </h4><p>For exploration, the current oil price is lower than 2014, which is the main reason why exploration continues to be slow; many blocks are operated by companies that do not have the funds. The three requirements of companies operating upstream are that they must have the funds, the technology appropriate for oil and gas, and need to be prepared to calculate the risk. If a company has the funds, it is able to pay for the calculation assessment or technology; if not, there is no drilling or exploration. There are several other causes that make exploration slower, such as regulation related to permits and land acquisitions that create certain issues.</p><h4>What have been your experiences in having the new oil blocks on offer in the market?</h4><p>When new blocks are prepared under the chamber of Migas, it does the offering based on competitive valuations. A block will then be assigned to a new investor, and after one is appointed for a certain block, a production contract will be prepared. The new operator will sign an agreement and the chairman of SKK Migas will countersign, after which it will be approved by the Minister of Energy. After this is signed, SKK Migas will start to supervise the operation of the block. When we prepare new guidelines for procurement or related to safety or procedures, before issuing, we discuss this with the operators. Several times these are improved together when drafting; for example, the Centralized and Integrated Vendor Database, which we created together with operators, allows all vendor information to be shared online with operators and allows SKK Migas to check vendors. This allows us to identify problematic vendors as they will result in higher costs, which means an increase in operation costs.</p><h4>Should there be more foreign firm participation in the sector?</h4><p>Indonesia needs more investment, which can come from local or multinational companies as well as state-owned companies. What we want for upstream oil and gas is more investment, which is why SKK Migas would be happy if more large companies invest in upstream oil and gas. If the operations are more efficient, then the cost will be less and profits will be bigger. Based on the production contract, the profits will be divided between SKK Migas and the operator, which is why we want to work together, faster, and more efficiently. We want the share of the cake to be larger for everyone involved.</p><h4>How do you plan to incentivize the increase in oil and gas reserves?</h4><p>Our KPIs consist of several things: increasing reserves, increasing production and lifting, and minimizing costs. Our results will then increase government revenue from oil and gas. After discovery, there are two possibilities: develop or not to develop based on economic factors such as production costs. Therefore, to increase reserves we have to push exploration by making regulations easier and helping companies when they face difficulties. At times, after seismic studies, companies want to drill but the permits take time so we will help them. We seek larger reserves, which we expect to find in the east.</p><h4>What is your core message to the large firms looking to invest in these projects?</h4><p>The ministry seeks to make its operations more efficient, which will result in more profits to be divided. To make them more efficient, we need to find lower costs and quicker processes. The ministry has a policy that a new PSC should be a cross split production-sharing contract. The previous one was the cost recovery production-sharing contract, and the new objective is how to make operations quicker. If there is a policy that offers opportunity for the private sector to invest in oil and gas quickly without too many approvals for procurement, then this efficiency will hopefully make them more interested in investing in upstream oil and gas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main issues in the Indonesian energy sector, and how would you summarize your approach to those issues?</h4><p>We cover electricity, oil, and gas from upstream to downstream through retail and also mineral resources through mining. The sector is one of the sources of the future growth of the country. We have to be a pioneer in many areas to increase opportunities for the expansion of the economy. One of the key issues is infrastructure. In many areas of Indonesia, we see that there is still a lack of infrastructure availability. The infrastructure must come first. Secondly, the reality of the lowest cost energy is important. My attitude toward the sector is that the lowest cost of energy is essential, which is a key competitiveness of the country. For example, if the electricity tariff is much higher than many exporting countries, then our industrial product will be less competitive comparing to them. We try to make the electricity tariff as reasonable and affordable as possible. </p><h4>What are the ministry's intentions with its new power purchasing regulations and the recent ministerial decrees that have modified those regulations?</h4><p>The only goal for ministerial decrees is to clarify and speed up the process of electricity investment, such as an independent power producer. I understand some of the input that the ministerial regulations will limit the bankability of any independent power producer projects; however, we have explained that the business risk itself cannot be borne by the government. The business risk has to be borne by the power plant company, but the political risk and the government commitment risk are with the government.</p><h4>How would you address the concerns regarding the ability for investors to invest in renewable energy projects?</h4><p>Over the past 40 years, we have installed almost 5,000MW of renewable capacity. I have been in this office since October 2016, and we have committed and signed transactions for almost 500MW in this period alone. Therefore, people who complain about the tariff in my opinion are the people who are not able to compete. The national electricity company recently signed around 46 transactions for close to 300MW of renewable energy, so 11 of the investors may have backed off, but 53 have already signed. As long as companies match the technical requirements, then we have to compete with the price; Japan, China, Europe, or the US, it does not matter where it is made.</p><h4>What is your strategy for making exploration and production more attractive for oil majors and smaller firms? </h4><p>There has been no cancellation of exploration. As long as the oil price is around USD50, then it is difficult to increase exploration and production unless the government wants to give up much more. If it wants 10% of the split to go to the government, then many of the big players are interested, even the smaller operators. However, that is not the goal. At the USD50 oil price, I do not think the encouragement for increased exploration is significant except for shale oil and gas in US since the production costs are getting lower. For the traditional methods, especially offshore, I do not think it has the courage to increase production at USD50. </p><h4>What do you see as the ideal role for the state in developing further electrical generation and distribution?</h4><p>The government has a great deal to do in regard to helping reduce the generation imbalance and the price of electricity in the country, as the disparity between what people can afford and the cost is still significantly wide. For that issue, the President has suggested that as long as the private sector can afford to do the investment, then we will let the private sector do it so that we can subsidize the people who earn much less. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Record Highs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[record-highs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is driving the record highs reached by the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) in recent months?</h4><p>The recent capital market surge was strongly influenced by global economic growth of 3.2% in 2016 and 3.7% in 2017. Stable domestic economic growth—5.01% in 2016 and 5.07% in 2017—also played a role. A credit rating upgrade to investment grade from all respectable global rating agencies was important, while a clean and focused government with a stable monetary policy and inflation also played a significant role. In addition, key was the strong growth of listed companies. For example, total net income grew 23% from 2016 to 2017. Strong domestic investors have aided this. Although there was foreign net sell as much as IDR40 trillion (USD2.83 billion), the JCI still grew reaching an all-time high.</p><h4>What strategies do you employ to increase the number of companies listed on the IDX?</h4><p>There are still many large companies not listed on the IDX yet. We have been promoting to the public that IPO is not only a way to raise funds for companies but is also a means to distribute wealth for its employees and the public through ownership of its stocks. The potential for companies to be listed is high. There are 52 companies that grew in Indonesia but are listed on foreign stock exchanges, more than 800 state-owned enterprises including their subsidiaries, 20 local conglomerates, and 124 companies with more than IDR1 trillion (USD70.6 million) debt that should be listed. Increasing the number of listed companies is one of our strategic objectives in our “Sailing North" strategic plan. We have a saying, “No day goes by without meeting prospective companies"—every day we promote fundraising through capital market. These successes are achieved through business meetings and one-to-one meetings. Since we began our campaign in 2015, we have held around 20 workshops for prospective companies each year in collaboration with various associations that oversee them. Moreover, we have around 200 individual meetings with companies every year.</p><h4>How should the regulatory framework be amended to provide a more appealing capital market?<br></h4><p>Since 2016, we have been working closely with Financial Services Authority (OJK) to simplify the listing process, reduce paperwork, and eliminate with duplication, which in turn shortens the IPO and listing process. In December 2017, OJK published new regulation about e-Registration for a new, simplified listing process utilizing information technology. Moreover, this e-Registration process will be integrated to OJK's Integrated Licensing and Registration System (SPRINT).</p><h4>In June 2017, the number of capital market investors in Indonesia exceeded 1 million. What does this figure say about the size and scaling of the capital market?<br></h4><p>Reaching 1 million investors is an achievement, and we are determined to keep pursuing our goal to make Indonesia's capital market an attractive investment for the long term. However, from 1 million investors, there are only 650,000 stock investors. To attract more investors, in November 2015, IDX started the Yuk Nabung Saham nation-wide campaign to shift the Indonesian mindset from savings to investing. Since then, there has been a double-digit increase of investors annually. According to a survey conducted by Nielsen in 2015 and 2017 and OJK's report in 2016, there has been a significant increase in capital market literacy for Indonesian, from 3.79% in 2016 to 15% in 2017. In terms of the size of Indonesia capital market among ASEAN countries, we are still growing. Our ratio of market cap to GDP in 2017 is at 52%; therefore, there is, room to grow in the coming years.</p><h4>How has the digital innovation in finance become central to the trading floor of IDX?</h4><p>IDX has been utilizing technology since 1995 by implementing a computerized trading system called Jakarta Automated Trading System. Since then, we have revolutionized the system and its supporting system to support the growing number of trading, investors, and products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[winning-formula]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made Indonesia such an attractive market, and what was it like building a presence in the country?</h4><p>Indonesia is a great opportunity for the consumer finance business. Home Credit Group was founded 25 years ago in the Czech Republic, and we have been expanding internationally ever since. We want to bring in organized lending services for groups that are underrepresented. Our efforts began in Russia, and we subsequently expanded into Kazakhstan, Vietnam, and China. In 2012, we entered India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, providing huge jobs opportunity here and supporting the economy by creating multiplier effects. We sought to get a feel for how business is done in Indonesia and wanted to develop a winning formula for this opportunity-rich environment. We partner with retailers across the country, placing our own employees in their stores and offering financing for major purchases. Once we develop a large-enough customer base, we begin cross selling other products based on our services and customers' needs. We have a suite of products that we can offer through our license. This is our point-of-sale (POS) distribution model. We are the largest POS player in the world and have nearly 400,000 locations across the 10 countries in which we operate. In Indonesia, we had about 800 POS in January 2015 and today we have grown to almost 13,000 POS.</p><h4>What are your screening practices, and how do you maintain credit repayment?</h4><p>Our system relies heavily on the tools that we have developed over the last 25 years in various countries. We take the strategies we learned and localize them. In Indonesia, around 40% of our core customer base had no experience with the formal lending sector. Consumer finance existed previously, though we bring to the market a different way of operating. A large portion of our decision and assessment procedures are automated, and we currently make lending decisions within three minutes of receiving an application. We rely on the information provided by customers as well as a credit report provided by the government and other data sources.</p><h4>Will growing consumer confidence in 2018 change the makeup of your lending?</h4><p>We introduced a mobile app in 2017 that will become a centerpiece of interaction between the company and our customers. We are currently building and introducing new features for our customers. In 2017, our volume tripled, though our productivity per shop improved only marginally. This means our growth came largely from increased distribution—we now have 24 offices covering 85 cities. We are changing some of our processes to improve our productivity and introducing a number of new strategies into our portfolio. We expect to more than double growth in 2018. We plan to cover an additional 46 cities that are mostly tier-2 and tier-3. By the end of 2018, we should cover 130 cities.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve in 2018?</h4><p>We are mainly focused on profitability. We need to ensure that we have a business model that is flexible enough to compete with traditional players and emerging fintech. I welcome competition, though I worry about unregulated fintech because not all firms operating in that space are equal. Established players have an obligation to report to the debtors' databank, while unregulated players do not. For us, it is critical to ensure that we do not over debt the customers. We want to ensure we have excellent data about exactly how much money people have borrowed, so we can ensure that our operations remain stable. We also expect to double our lending levels and expand our partnerships with local banks. Our growth will come from cross-selling products to customers who have established excellent credit histories. These loans typically grow to four or five times the original loan amount, increasing our volume and extending the repayment period. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has contributed to the stable economic growth in the last year?</h4><p>In West Sumatra, the economy is primarily based on agriculture. More than 60% of the workers are in the agriculture sector and agriculture right now is the dominant gross regional domestic product (GRDP) economic growth indicator at 23.8%. The economy in West Sumatra is based around palm oil, rubber, and many other forms of agriculture, and therefore, the growth of the economy is relatively stable YoY. In West Sumatra, economic growth is slightly higher, at 5%, than the national 4.9%, according to the latest figures. There is some impact from the global and regional situation here on our economy in West Sumatra; however, it is not that big since we rely on agriculture. Besides agriculture, the budget from the central and local government is relatively stable, and this is one of the impacts on the growth of the economy. Exports and imports are stable because of the commodities we export.</p><h4>What are your plans for the upgrade of infrastructure?</h4><p>The west side of Sumatra island has limited traffic for international trade compared to the eastern side of the island, which has traffic to Malaysia and Singapore. If we open the district from the west of Sumatra island to the east with a road corridor, then commodities from the west can be moved throughout the region. We have the best seaport on the coast of Sumatra; therefore, if the commodities from the other province can move to ours, then they go directly to Europe, the Middle East, and India. The Straits of Malacca are already crowded, so this is a great opportunity. In addition, the commodities from West Sumatra can go to the seaport in the east to go to Singapore and Malaysia. If there is a toll, then we have an opportunity for further revenue generation and economic growth. The president prioritized building the toll road from the west to east, and the central government is spending money to invest in the road, which is currently being planned and undergoing a feasibility study. We are now studying how to prepare the land for the toll road with the money from the central government. In 2018, work on the toll road will start, though we are also open to investment by industry leaders in West Sumatra. In the other provinces, like Bali, there are toll roads that are joint ventures between the private sector and the government, and we invite investment. This is an opportunity for us to also work this way together through government budget and private sector investment. If the budget is the private and public sectors together, then the private sector will get a feasible benefit.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for your current five-year term as governor?</h4><p>West Sumatra has many characteristics, including geography, demography, and the character of the ethnic culture. If we have the ambition to make West Sumatra a developed province, then we have to consider these characteristics. For example, we cannot build or develop industry in West Sumatra because it is not suitable or feasible for some commodities since industries require many workers, which is a problem in the province. The majority ethnic group in West Sumatra is the Minangkabau people who do not want to work in industry as laborers as they are traditionally entrepreneurs and traders. For the infrastructure projects, you will find that the workers are from Java, not West Sumatra. Rather, high-tech industries and manufacturing can be developed as the work is specialized and will be attractive to the Minang ethnic people, who are able to work in expert roles that command a higher salary. The infrastructure of the toll road is our ambition as this will open the economy to manufacturing, not only in agriculture but also in high-value and high-tech industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fueling-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will AKR's business change with your tender to import fuel for the coming five years?</h4><p>AKR's business in petroleum today is primarily selling high-speed diesel, which is used in industrial applications. Growth has been great in that segment over the last decade. We now see great potential growth areas, with coal prices increasing as well as the metal industry picking up. There is also the bigger part of petroleum downstream, more specifically retail, where there is now an opportunity to grow. Our government contract is mostly for diesel, with a small part comprising gasoline. Since 2010, AKR has been the only private company receiving the allocation of subsidized fuel, along with Pertamina. In 2018, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan made the move to provide a longer-term contract for the next five years. AKR was selected, along with Pertamina, to develop this business. The extension of subsidized fuel contracts to five years is a welcomed move. Now, AKR can grow its current figure of 135 petrol stations. Going forward, with the JV with BP, we will move on to non-subsidized gasoline. Over the next 10 years, we want to open 337 outlets under the BP brand. That will also bring in the superior quality fuels, lubricants, and retail stores. This is a 50.1% AKR-49.9% BP Global split, whereby AKR will support the joint venture in terms of equity and logistics. We will also jointly develop the outlets, taking care of land and construction.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE) project?</h4><p>JIIPE is a large industrial estate with an attached seaport that seeks to attract industrial clients. We are developing 3,000ha of land in total, of which 400ha will be the seaport, 1,760ha will be the industrial estate, and 800ha will be residential. We have been developing JIIPE since 2012, and it will have port access, toll roads, and railway access, which will improve the ease of bringing in goods as well as exporting. Here, the emphasis is on developing utilities, such as power plants, wastewater management, logistics, office utilities, railway depots, and so on. The development is massive, and we have divided it into three phases. The first will be from 2014 to 2019 and will encompass 800ha of industrial land and road access from highways to our location, as well as interior roads. We are developing three power plants to service customers. The first will be a 23MW multi-fueled plant, which was commissioned in 2017. The second is a 500MW gas-fired plant, while the third will be a 660MW coal-fired plant. Heavy industry requires a huge amount of power. We will develop power here to supply directly to the fertilizers, the smelters, and other heavy industry clients.</p><h4>What are the benefits of such a project?</h4><p>We currently have more than seven clients, including Swiss Clariant, a specialty chemical manufacturer, Unichem, and Hextar from Malaysia. We also have Djarum Group, which will develop a castor oil refinery. This becomes an efficient proposition if companies seek to import and export, as well as distribute inland. The government supports this project because our partner is state-owned enterprise Pelindo III, which owns 40% of the industrial estate and 60% of the port. Pelindo III will dredge the channel so the port can accommodate Post-Panamax vessels up to 150,000 tons, making the port one of the largest and deepest in the country. The government and others are extremely supportive because they see the need for such an industrial estate to bring in foreign and domestic investors and improve efficiencies.</p><h4>What are your immediate plans and ambitions?</h4><p>We expect to grow in the double digits in 2018 in terms of profit. There is new growth in retail, aviation, and utilities that will see the company growing much bigger and more balanced over the next few years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key areas might speed up the implementation of private-public partnerships (PPPs) and bolster their appeal to private investors?</h4><p>After three years of hard work on economic reforms, we are finally seeing the results of those reforms. However, Indonesia needs private investors to involve in hundreds of billions of dollars projects to develop infrastructure and natural resources. As President Widodo said, all major projects will be offered to the private sector. State-owned enterprises would partner with private investors only if there wasn't enough interest among such players, with funding from the national budget as the last resort. Tourism is one of the top industries for private sector participation, as it requires consumer-oriented thinking to make leisure destinations attractive. Moreover, privately owned projects are led by investors that ensure they are realistic and bankable. Private investment is needed to create prosperous tourism destinations.</p><h4>What would be your message to foreign investors on the issue of stability and predictability in the legislative framework?</h4><p>One of the main obstacles to investment is related to regulations: excessive regulation and lengthy licensing procedures are compounded by constantly changing regulations, which are often poorly conceived and misguided. This is the biggest issue for investment by far. We need to tackle our policymaking process. Today, ministers tend to sign regulations that come as a surprise, and as a result these are often revised and then canceled. President Widodo is pushing for regulations to be promulgated through many public consultations and a transparent process, so that when laws are implemented they do not come as a shock. Additionally, the quality of regulations will be higher and will incorporate broader input from all stakeholders. Public consultation is merely a formality at the moment. An overhaul of the policymaking process could be quite revolutionary, and it should address the issue of unstable and constantly changing regulations.</p><h4>How can BKPM help to nurture greater entrepreneurship to drive economic development?</h4><p>We have to create a great deal of policy space for experimentation. As President Widodo has mentioned several times, innovation requires experimentations. Innovation comes naturally by people trying many new things of most things failed. In e-commerce and digital start-up, the failure rate will be 70-90%. Google, Amazon, and Facebook are the 10% that have succeeded. Imagine if the American government had not given innovators the freedom to experiment and to fail safely. The bureaucracy still has the mindset that our job is to regulate. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth; regulation is a necessary evil. We need to set forth some basic rules of engagement; however, beyond that, we should not seek to regulate everything.</p><h4>Does BKPM see a role for itself in the growth in the IT sector?</h4><p>In regards to the development of digital economy, first, we should start by not assuming that wireless data, 3G, 4G, and soon 5G networks will naturally blanket the entire country. We have a fairly unhealthy telecom sector at the moment; just one company captures more than 90% of the entire industry profits. This will not lead to evenly spread high-quality wireless data networks. That is the first prerequisite for the digital revolution or industrial revolution 4.0. There are also plenty bad policies we have to fix at the moment. Fintech is a perfect example to point out that unless we take a deregulation-oriented and freedom-oriented approach to e-commerce and the digital economy, our own people will leave the government behind. Services are the most easily transferred to the internet and once on the internet, we will not be able to regulate them. People will find all kind of services, the best services available, anywhere in the world. Not only will we not able to regulate them, we will not even know it is happening, nor can we stop it. It will all take place overseas and offshore because we killed it onshore with regulation, with bad policy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a member of the group of Pacific Islands, what do you hope to see Indonesia do in terms of leading the way on the renewables front?</h4><p>I hope Indonesia does more on renewable energy because we are from the South Pacific Islands, and Tonga is ranked number two in terms of the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change after Vanuatu. Therefore, we take the issue of climate change seriously because it will affect our future. If no hard action is taken by the world to control climate change, we will be under the sea in a few years. The lives of our people are dependent on this.</p><h4>Tonga has made recent policy changes to combat inequality, which is a major issue in the Indonesian economy as well. What can Indonesia learn from Tonga in this regard?</h4><p>The percentage of income tax to GDP in Indonesia is low. Having a huge population means there is room to collect more tax from the private sector and the public as well. Then, the country can plow that money into developing other areas if they wish, such as telecommunications and infrastructure. Tonga's revenue is 25-35% of our GDP, and there is always room to increase that. Post financial crisis, part of our budget is now funded through budget support from development partners, such as ADP World Bank. Thus, unless Tonga improves its capacity to collect more revenue to take care of its own destination, we will still rely on them. Of that funding, 50% is a grant while the other 50% is a sub-loan from those development partners to finance our domestic affairs.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for further cooperation between Tonga and Indonesia?</h4><p>We have been promoting some forms of cooperation, and it has been extremely encouraging, although there is nothing on the ground yet. I had bilateral talks with Indonesia's Minister of Finance, and the government of Indonesia will set up a separate fund to start momentum in this direction. This is my second visit to Indonesia; I was here about two years ago and on that occasion I had to go through New Zealand and apply for a visa. On this visit, Indonesia issued me a visa on arrival, which is a positive move, and I will propose that our government does the same. For visitors from China, we currently allow visas to be issued on arrival. We, thus, need to continue to open our doors to neighboring countries to facilitate movement and trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are member states progressing in achieving the targets of becoming an economically integrated organization?</h4><p>During the first year of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the focus was on putting in place the fundamentals for effective operationalization of the AEC Blueprint 2025 through the adoption of most of the AEC sectoral work plans and the endorsement of the AEC 2025 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that would support effective implementation of the blueprint. The framework enhances the previous mechanism by not only tracking implementation progress but also the outcomes and impact of regional economic integration. ASEAN has also successfully achieved priority deliverables under the Chairmanship of Laos in the strategic areas of trade facilitation, food safety, MSME development, and tourism. Other notable achievements are the launch of the ASEAN Tariff Finder, a cost-free search engine for tariff-related information under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and other ASEAN +1 free trade agreements, as well as the full operationalization of the ASEAN Solutions for Investments, Services and Trade (ASSIST), a fully internet-based and free, non-binding consultative mechanism for the expedited and effective solution of operational problems encountered by ASEAN-based enterprises on cross-border issues related to the implementation of ASEAN economic agreements.</p><h4>What sectors are being prioritized in the bid to increase cooperation between member states and their trade relationships with the wider region?</h4><p>In parallel with initiatives of regional economic integration such as liberalization and facilitation of trade in goods, services, and investment, close cooperation in various other sectors has been one of the important factors leading to the successful establishment of the AEC. Entering into the next decade, ASEAN will continue to pursue vigorous sectoral cooperation in all those sectors as set out in the AEC Blueprint 2025. Each sector has already identified the priority deliverables for 2017. In transport, building further on the successful realization of ASEAN Open Skies, ASEAN member states will continue implementation of the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM) with focus on strengthening air traffic management and aviation safety and security. In ICT, the priorities are placed on expanding broadband to under-served areas, reducing international roaming charges, and strengthening cooperation in cybersecurity. Work has also been started on studying the feasibility of an ASEAN Single Telecommunication Market. In energy, cooperation in 2017 is focused on institutional strengthening for the implementation of the two energy connectivity flagship projects. In the area of food, agriculture, and forestry, member states are working on a number of initiatives to pursue sustainable agricultural production, enhance product competitiveness, and ensure food safety. In tourism, the Visit ASEAN@50 campaign is the main initiative with which ASEAN member states join efforts in offering the best tourism products and services to international visitors to celebrate the 50th anniversary of ASEAN.</p><h4>Over its 50 years, how has the organization stayed relevant and dynamic?</h4><p>Five decades of cooperation and integration have made ASEAN one of the most successful regional organizations in the world. ASEAN works together through fostering deeper understanding, building trust, and cooperating to pursue common interest in the context of diversity in full recognition of its varied but shared interests and aspirations that demonstrates its unique strength. ASEAN maintains its unity on the basis of shared commitments and collective responsibility for regional peace and prosperity, the principles of respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in the internal affairs of its member states. Decisions in ASEAN are made by consensus. This “ASEAN Way" is to ensure that no member is left out of the solutions on issues of shared concerns or interests. ASEAN's strength lies in the fact that it has been able to manage and turn a disadvantage into an advantage. To keep itself relevant and maintain it centrality in the evolving regional architecture and enhance its capability to respond effectively to unfolding complicated regional and global developments, ASEAN is implementing measures to streamline its processes and improving its working methods, including updating the ASEAN Charter. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Canada's commitments to South America? </h4><p>Our government is committed to broadening Canada's global trade ties around the world, including those in South America. Indeed, our standard of living depends on robust international trade as a key driver of economic growth. To that end, the government of Canada has embarked on a progressive trade and diversification strategy that aims to expand markets for more Canadians while contributing meaningfully to overall economic, social, and environmental policy priorities. Too many groups, particularly women, indigenous peoples, youth, and newcomers have not shared in the benefits that have come from free trade.</p><h4>What are the main areas of collaboration that Canada will seek with Colombia in 2018? </h4><p>We have many plans for collaboration this year, from peacebuilding to progressive trade. Canada is looking forward to pursuing more engagement with the Pacific Alliance trade bloc of Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. This includes helping small and medium-sized businesses export, strengthening education and professional technical training, and addressing climate change and creating a cleaner environment. Our investors are also keen to add to the over 100 Canadian companies already working in infrastructure, energy, mining, oil and gas, agri-food, education, and services in Colombia. In June 2017, I signed a MoU with Colombia's Vice Minister of Mines, Carlos Cante Puentes. Canada is providing development assistance of USD18.9 million over five years focused on community consultations and participation, engaging local suppliers, reducing the use of mercury, and promoting economic empowerment. </p><h4>What Canadian industries will see major commercial growth with Colombia in 2018?</h4><p>First, there is optimism for the infrastructure sector, with numerous construction projects in transportation, energy, health, and education expected to start in 2018. One project with Canadian involvement is the development of the Atrio complex in Bogotá, which will consist of two towers, one with 42 floors to be completed in 2019 and another with 62, potentially becoming the tallest building in Colombia. We are also closely following developments related to the Metro de Bogotá project. Second, we are seeing growth in the financial services sector. For example, in January 2018 Scotiabank announced that its Colombian subsidiary, Banco Colpatria, had reached an agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to acquire the consumer and small and medium enterprise operations of Citibank in Colombia. Third, Colombia is developing long-term contracting projects with renewable resources and plans to launch renewable energy auctions in 2018, a sector in which Canada is a world leader. Fourth is the extractive sector, where we see huge opportunities in offshore exploration stage and EOR. </p><h4>What opportunities are Canadian businesses strengthening with Colombian counterparts?</h4><p>In agriculture, for example, Canadian suppliers can share their experience with Colombia by offering cutting-edge solutions for sanitary compliance, food processing, packaging, and other areas of interest for the local industry. Canada is a world leader, not only in renewable energy, but more broadly in cleantech. This includes water and wastewater treatment for industrial and domestic uses and solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also have a particularly strong cleantech Green Mining umbrella that makes mining more sustainable. Canadian exporters of state-of-the-art technologies for next generation mobile networks, big data analytics, business intelligence, and cybersecurity are also looking at Colombia. While an increasing number of Colombia students are studying in Canada, we have also welcomed close to 400 Colombian scholarship recipients of Canada's Emerging Leaders of the Americas Program (ELAP). </p><h4>What will Canada's Associate membership of the Pacific Alliance mean for Canadian businesses? </h4><p>We were the first non-Latin American observer country in 2012 and the first observer to sign a Joint Declaration of Partnership with the bloc in 2016. The invitation to become an Associated State of the Pacific Alliance is the logical next step for our longstanding partnership in prosperity. We already enjoy a strong economic relationship with the trade bloc, which is supported by comprehensive bilateral free trade agreements with each of its four member countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[peace-in-our-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>My mission is one of solidarity at a historic moment of enormous importance for the country, for Latin America, and the world.</p><p>Solidarity and commitment are in place to support the work of the government and to assure a long transitional peace. The fundamental aim in today's world is to achieve peace. However, nowadays, we are witnessing that peace is no longer guaranteed. We even face a new nuclear threat that we have not faced since the cold war. And when we look at the Middle East, Africa, and so many other parts of the world, we see an increase in new conflicts. Colombia represents a symbolic and fundamental example for the world that peace is possible.<br>I believe that it is a duty of the citizens of the world to fully support the peace building process in Colombia for the Colombian people.</p><p>We are keenly aware that this is a complex process. My experience with Colombia goes back 10 years to when I was United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and I can attest that Colombia was the most generous country in defining a legal institutional framework that firmly recognized the rights of and the support to internally displaced people worldwide, despite all the difficulties and internal challenges involved.<br>I had the opportunity, also, to witness the courage with which laws were approved with regard to victims, land restitution, riddled, as they were the difficulties and complexities of the process. For all these reasons, I feel great admiration for the determination with which the Colombian people, as well as former President Santos, have always faced the difficult challenges of the county's conflict.<br>During past visits, when I went to several areas of the country, I saw the duality of the country. On the one hand, a developed Colombia as we see here in Bogotá could be compared to New York, London, or Paris. You see a developed country with a vibrant economy and an active civil society. On the other hand, I recall visiting Chocó, where I saw an entirely different Colombia, where the state is nowhere to be seen. Therefore, we must recognize that this is not only a peace-building process.<br>Moreover, I was deeply impressed with the commitment of the government to underline that this is effort is not only to bring peace, but also to guarantee the presence of the state throughout Colombia, including administration, but also security and social services such as education and health, and support for the development of civil society and the private sector, which are huge challenges.<br>Indeed, the United Nations is strongly supporting the Colombian government in this process of peace building and democracy, bringing development to all corners of the country. It is a huge challenge, but one that has our full support and commitment.</p><p>Nevertheless, Colombia is also at the forefront of another huge challenge caused by the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Venezuela. I would like to express all the support to the government and the people of Colombia in their humanitarian effort to welcome all these people. Moreover, I must also mention the commitment of Colombia to multilateral peacekeeping processes. However, I would like to mention what I believe is Colombia's pioneering role with regard to the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, and climate change efforts.</p><p>The UN is strongly committed to peace in Colombia. There are no justifications for armed violence. Peace is the only answer to today's challenges, including poverty and inequality, as well as to our objectives such as development and democracy. We are fully at Colombia's disposal to support what constitutes the most meaningful experience in the world, demonstrating that fortunately not all the challenges that we face in the world go unanswered. Here we have a solution, a strong solution, and it has all our support.* </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will PPPs be utilized in the infrastructure sector moving forward?</h4><p>Our main duty is to support the government in accelerating infrastructure development and the source of financing for the development could be from the budget, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), or the private sector. In our five-year plan through 2019, we have laid out that the budget might contribute a maximum of 40%. In our estimation, SOEs will contribute around 23%, which means there is still 37% left that has to be fulfilled by the private sector. Our role is to select the infrastructure projects that are eligible for one of these schemes of financing, with the objective to involve the private sector more. We have two schemes to do so: PPPs and equity financing. For both, our task is to promote these projects domestically and internationally, and we actively go on roadshows to meet with potential investors. In the past, FDI in Indonesia was mostly in manufacturing; however, we now have infrastructure as a real opportunity. For PPPs, we have a strong backlog of 90 projects, including social infrastructure such as hospitals, correction facilities, and educational institutions. For equity financing, which is pure private sector, we promote projects such as toll roads, power plants, airports, seaports, and oil and gas infrastructure.</p><h4>How can you make private sector involvement more attractive?</h4><p>For equity financing and PPPs, we have concessions for the private sector. For PPPs, the idea is that this is private sector money; it has a certain period of concessions depending on the project type, and if the project is not that viable for the private sector, then the government can step in with a guarantee or a viability care fund. For equity financing, it is even more attractive as the private sector does not participate as an active developer but rather a shareholder. We can support project recycling so it does not have to be on a greenfield site but can be brownfield or operating site. We target long-term fund managers such as pension funds, welfare funds, and life insurance, offering better returns than bank deposits at least 13%.</p><h4>What unique opportunities for growth are in the SME sector, and how can you capitalize on entrepreneurship?</h4><p>As an emerging country and member of the G20, we have aspirations to be a developed country, not just with a large GDP but also with a sizable GDP per capita. One critical oversight of our development strategy is the lack of entrepreneurship, both in terms of quality and quantity. Without significant entrepreneurship, we cannot be a developed country. The problem in Indonesia is that we are targeting the number of SMEs without checking if they are active in productive or value-added sectors, or mostly working as traders or retail. These professions are harder to scale into larger business models, and our challenge is to have our micro-entrepreneurs be more productive, either in agriculture, manufacturing, or services. We have always treated farmers and fishermen as though they are not entrepreneurs though they hold the greatest potential, and one strategy is to empower them more. Another strategy is to improve and promote vocational schooling. For this, we need to shift the mindset by promoting the importance and the prospects of these skills, especially to graduates that have the potential to become new entrepreneurs, applying their skills directly.</p><h4>How do you follow trends and strategize on the development of the economy?</h4><p>Our economy has to be adaptive to any new innovation, while also monitoring closely the impact of the digital economy for job creation. We still have around 5% unemployment, equivalent to 8 million people. With a more dominant digital economy, we need to be more creative in finding these opportunities. For future innovation, we would like to have job opportunities rather than just sophistication of IT. We should adapt the digital economy while absorbing unemployment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I have always reiterated that we are a big nation. Indonesia is big not only because of its population of more than 250 million people, around 17,000 islands, or its abundant resources. We achieved our grandeur because our nation has stood the test of time and because we have been able to remain united until the 72nd anniversary of our independence. While other countries are plagued by violent conflicts among ethnicities, with divisions among religions, and disputes among groups, we are grateful that we remain united within the framework of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia with its Bhinneka Tunggal Ika motto. We have even become a role model for many countries in terms of managing diversity and building unity.</p><p>We have to believe in the strength of our own people. Evidence proved that we have been able to make great achievements. In the past, we were worried about the presence of foreign banks in our country. Now we are witnessing that our national banks are able to compete with those banks and have become major and modern banks. We have huge potential, namely our young generations. Many of our young generations have become math, physics, and biology Olympic champions. Our young generations have showcased their accomplishments, such as becoming champions of the Qur'an memorization competition, emerging triumphant in robotic works, making innovation in start-ups businesses, and being creative in arts in world stages. Many creative industries and national movie productions are driven by our young generation. These young people are getting more popular, and their products are enjoyed by many.<br>However, we must not develop a dangerously complacent attitude or be carried away by all these achievements. We still have much to accomplish; we still have promises to deliver. We have to admit that it would be impossible for Indonesia to become an advanced nation if the homes of our people all over the country do not enjoy electricity. It would be impossible for us to become a competitive nation if our logistics costs are high. It would be impossible for us to become a global maritime fulcrum if we do not have seaports where large vessels that transport our products are berthed. It would be impossible for us to become a sovereign state in food commodities if the number of dams and irrigation channels that irrigate our agricultural fields all over the country are limited.<br>We are also facing challenges to free ourselves from the trap that shackles natural resources. After the era of oil and natural gas booming in 1970s was over and after the collapse of wood booming in 1900s, the era of mineral booming also came to an end. Even prices of several other commodities sharply fell. Therefore, we have to make a change.<br>In the past three years, the government has been focused on alleviating poverty, reducing gaps, and lowering unemployment rate. As a result, poverty level in Indonesia dropped from 28.59 million people in March 2015 to 27.77 million in March 2017. Our Gini coefficient continues to improve and reached 0.393 in March 2017, as opposed to 0.414 in September 2014. Our inflation had also been kept in check at 2.6% from January to July 2017. We also continue to maintain just and equitable economic growth. We have to ensure that our economic growth, which is 5% every year on average from 2014-2016, is not only enjoyed by certain people but by all Indonesians. Therefore, the development that we are undertaking is not only for those in big cities but for all Indonesians in villages, marginal areas, outermost islands, and border areas.<br>We want all Indonesians to be able to feel the benefits of development evenly. We want farmers, fishermen, laborers, clerics, traditional market traders, religious figures, civil servants, members of the Indonesian National Defence Forces (TNI), members of the Indonesian National Police (POLRI), journalists, cultural activists, university students, and many others to join hands to move forward, make progress, and bring prosperity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights of the on-going negotiations for Australia's free trade agreement (FTA) with the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>I launched negotiations with my counterparts from Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru at the Pacific Alliance Summit in Cali in June 2017, and we have made good progress in the five negotiating rounds to date, the latest in Mexico in July 2018. All parties share a commitment to concluding a high-quality agreement by the end of the year.</p><h4>What does an FTA with the Pacific Alliance mean for Australian businesses?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance presents a growing opportunity for Australian export businesses. Equivalent to the eighth-largest economy in the world, the Pacific Alliance countries have strong economic growth, stability, and a commitment to global integration in recent years. For starters, an FTA will ensure that Australian businesses have the opportunity to access this market on a level playing field. We see increased opportunities in agriculture, tourism, health, mining and mining equipment, technology and services. Likewise, an FTA also presents exciting opportunities for Colombian businesses to increase exports of goods and services to Australia, the 12th largest economy in the world. Colombia is already benefiting more from two-way trade with Australia, and these benefits will only grow as tariffs go down and we develop closer economic integration through the FTA process. Colombia's agriculture sector will see benefits from an FTA with Australia, including products such as cut flowers and coffee that are already being effectively exported to Australia, demonstrating that Colombia can meet Australia's strict biosecurity measures. Further benefits will be derived from Australia's agricultural services and technology exports, as they will accelerate the modernization of Colombia's agricultural sector. </p><h4>Where in Colombia will Australian businesses see increasing opportunities in 2018?</h4><p>There has been an increase in Australian businesses interested in investing in Colombia, boosted by improvements in security, improving macroeconomic fundamentals, and growing diplomatic relations between both nations. Since 2017, the number of Australian companies based in Colombia grew from 24 to more than 50 in areas such as mining, software, infrastructure, health, and agriculture.</p><h4>What is Australia's trade strategy towards Latin America and Colombia?</h4><p>In December 2017, Australia released its Foreign Policy White Paper, setting out a comprehensive framework for Australia's engagement on a global scale. As outlined in the paper, the government's trade agenda is pragmatic, given the obstacles to progress at the multilateral level. Economic reforms in Latin America offer new possibilities for trade and investment. As a result, Australia has been strengthening its economic partnerships with Latin American countries, and we aim to deepen our trade and investment dialog with the Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In March, I signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11) in Santiago on behalf of Australia, which draws in 11 Asia Pacific countries, including Mexico, Chile, and Peru. In February, I signed the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA) in Canberra. Indeed, an FTA with the Pacific Alliance will complement and build on the TPP-11 and PAFTA to bring more opportunities for Australian exporters. Once implemented, these three agreements, in combination with our existing FTA with Chile, will open the gateway to Latin America for Australian businesses, and likewise to Asia for Latin American businesses. I am excited Australia is negotiating an FTA with Colombia through the ongoing Pacific Alliance FTA discussions. We see a trade deal as an important next step to deepening our relationship with Colombia and developing new links between our people, businesses, and governments. There is already a good deal of interaction between our countries, but there is vast potential to do more, which is why we are looking forward to concluding a comprehensive and ambitious agreement by the end of the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[true-to-purpose]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>With humility and honor, I want to tell the Colombian people that I am going to put all, absolutely all my energy into unifying our country—no more divisions; let us think of Colombia as a country for all of us. This is an opportunity for us to be united against all those things that have harmed Colombia throughout history, such as corruption, politicking, and cronyism. We must have a united Colombia that brings corruption to a total and resounding defeat that can be felt throughout the country.</p><p>We are going to govern with transparency and efficiency, and we are going to give citizens back their hope so they can believe again in the institutions. We will be a united country for that purpose. Today, as we talk about these lawful challenges, we should also focus on security along with justice. This will lead us to a society both free from fear and at peace. Our goal is to create a consensus so that Colombia has credible justice that is more effective and closer to the citizen. We are going to promote this broad consensus that the country is demanding so justice will be closer to all citizens, all over the country.<br>When we talk about that longed-for legality, we must understand that peace in Colombia is a desire of all of us and we need to turn the page, no longer divided between friends and enemies of peace. Today, we are all in favor of building that peace and, above all, it must be the type of peace that allows guerrilla groups to cultivate the desire of demobilizing, disarming, and reintegrating. A peace that enables public investment to come to those places hit by violence, in order to have sustainable productive projects and for victims to be the center of the process so we can guarantee justice, reparation, truth, and no repetition.<br>The peace we yearn for is the one that has to lead us to a healthy debate of ideas where protection of life, honor, and the goods of Colombian people prevail. This rule of law is also inviting us to send a message to all Colombian heroes, police force members, and their families. I want to be the president who restores their faith and their trust and who can carry the desired “veteran law" forward so that Colombian society can thank them for their services provided.<br>This government we are about to build, along with the first female vice president in Colombian's history, Marta Lucí­a Ramí­rez, will be the government that will take the entire of Colombia to entrepreneurship, since we want to make our country the land of micro, small, medium, and large enterprises that generate jobs, defeat poverty, and allow the middle class to expand. For that purpose, we are going to make the tax system simpler so that the nation allows all those who want to start a business be successful. We will do it with full respect for the fiscal responsibility and free entrepreneurship to build a country of opportunities. We will work on extensive rural reform in order to bring public services, quality of housing, education, and healthcare to a rural population that has felt excluded for so many years. This will be the country that generates fraternity between employers and farm workers, as well as a strong harmony between agroindustry and the small producer, so that Colombian products are known around the world and drive our economy. That is the same Colombia that I want to share with young people that yearn for science, technology, and innovation; the Orange Economy, the power of culture, and the force of innovative transformation. This is the country we are going to build.<br>Our country must be the country of environmental sustainability. We are going to protect our páramos, rivers, our variety of ecosystems, flora, and fauna. We will promote electric vehicles. We will be the country of waste reduction, reuse, and recycling—a 21st century ethical country that protects nature and generates entrepreneurship while producing and preserving. Likewise, we are working on a program that includes culture and sports activities because we consider that the talents of Colombian people are the best heritage we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[5 million suffer from chronic disease]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[reem-fahd-al-bunyan-ceo-king-fahad-specialist-hospital]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the position of the hospital in the broader health system?</h4><p>KFSH is a tertiary quaternary care center and is the only one in the eastern region of the country. It is considered one of medical cities and specialized health care centers that are part of the Ministry of Health (MOH). It comes second in sequence historically after King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh. We have four centers of excellence: a large oncology center that is number one nationwide in terms of number of patients with breast cancer and number two in overall number of patients, a reputable multi-organ transplant center that is the second largest in the country and largest within MOH, a neurosciences center with a number of highly specialized programs, and a cardiac center. In addition, we have a number of signature programs under various departments. KFSH is also part of the first cluster developing in the country; an integrated healthcare system that would be part of a corporate entity. We now have an advisory board that is tasked with the first phase of the E1 cluster, and eventually it will become a fully-enabled board of directors with autonomy and financial authorities.</p><h4>What is behind the health transformation initiative currently taking place in the country?</h4><p>The current transformation is the first ever in healthcare in our country and is the largest among all transformations in all ministries in terms of the manpower and budget that is involved. The transformation initiative is driven by an urgency that relates to the growing number of people suffering from chronic diseases. At present, we have about 5 million people with chronic diseases and if we do nothing about it, this number will double by 2030. The cost of healthcare will increase exponentially as we go forward, and the healthcare system in its current state is not sustainable. We need a new system that revolves around a new care delivery model, where the individual is central. This new model is driven by the recipient, the individual, and the family, with the objective to improve their physical, social, and emotional well-being. From the individual's perspective, delivery is divided into six systems of care: keep them well, help them with their chronic disease, help them with their urgent care condition, help them have a safe pregnancy and childbirth, help them with their planned surgery, and finally help them with the last phase of their lives. Thus, the delivery takes into account the entire spectrum of where the activities take place, and in order to be engaged, they need to be educated, aware, and involved. They need a healthy community surrounding them, virtual tools, excellent primary care setup, and great hospital care. My personal involvement in this story is as a national leader for the chronic disease system of care and I am privileged to be involved in this initiative knowing that this is the largest slice of the pie; 80% of the activities in healthcare are related to chronic disease management.</p><h4>What role does IT play in the entire integration process?</h4><p>Digital solutions are key to enabling transformation in health and healthcare. The decisions on what we need to do from a digital perspective are driven by the care delivery, and integration of these care facilities, including engagement of the individual and giving them access to their data, will be solved by digital solutions. At the level of developing clusters, there will need to be a digital platform with all the necessary data on the patient as he or she flows through the system. Another dimension of the digital aspect is what the service center will have, including receiving calls aligned with the recent initiatives by the MOH to provide telehealth. An integrated model will enhance our ability to provide this highly specialized care for patients at the right time by the right provider. A patient who needs a sophisticated procedure would have the procedure, be transferred out, and create room for easy access for the next patient.</p><h4>What are your goals and ambitions for the hospital in 2018?</h4><p>I look forward to KFSH being a leader in this new transformed healthcare system, nationwide, region-wide, and worldwide. We are in a unique situation currently with the opportunity to transfer knowledge to the rest of the nation and region at-large. I look forward to seeing the fruit of all of this work and seeing the population benefit from the new system. National and international partnerships have also been part of our mission. We have a national and international collaboration office that is extremely active. We have a number of collaborations with regional countries and governments. We also have a large executive administration for academic affairs and training and a number of accredited training programs for residencies and fellowships. We envision this administration being the one to take care of the entire cluster.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current business environment in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is definitely better in 2018, though it took longer to turn around from 2017 than we had hoped. We now see some real activity with stability in the foreign exchange market, higher oil prices, and the government understanding the challenges better. It took the new administration a bit of time to assess the situation and put its policies in place. The end of 2017 through to 1H2018 has definitely been much better thus far.</p><h4>Has the government's policy to promote local companies, industry, and the Made in Nigeria brand worked?</h4><p>The Made in Nigeria campaign resulted not only from policy, but also from circumstance. It was expensive to import anything, and we realized the country did not need to do this. There was a shift to businesses operating at a commercial level that made sense. Firstly, because people could not access the dollar and secondly, it was difficult to price one's goods in naira when businesses materials were  imported in dollars. The focus turned inward to determine what could be produced in country. People also started focusing more on trying to export. This showed it is possible to operate here despite the transportation infrastructure challenges. People started realizing it is possible to use made-in-Nigeria raw materials for their finished products. Many international companies moved out of the country as well because the unfavorable forex situation meant it did not make economic sense for them to stay here.</p><h4>How did the international companies leaving Nigeria impact your client base and business?</h4><p>Many of our clients were in the oil and gas service sector; hence, there was a significant impact. We had to shift our focus from predominantly oil and gas clients; now, we have many commercial clients in Nigeria as well. This forced us to look at a different model, particularly partnering with other companies to have backward integration of our services. We are also considering doing things directly ourselves because the more of the chain we can manage and control, the better the solution we can provide to clients. Especially in logistics, it is about finding solutions for our clients to create a better platform, and that way we can grow our business.</p><h4>Would you tell us about your talks with the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA)?</h4><p>The OGFZA has moved on from its initial regulations; for example, it is now self-funded rather than being funded through the Ministry of Trade and Investments. OGFZA is now more autonomous today and seeks to promote the free zone. It is currently helping us to increase Eko Support Services' footprint beyond the port. Any area we have outside the port needs to be annexed to the free zone so we can still manage the logistics as free zone-to-free zone movements without customs clearance and so forth. Clients may also want to set up small assembly plants to add value to their goods and services, though we do not have room for this within the port area, hence the need to expand the zone. The current free zone administration has engaged with other government agencies, such as customs, better. They are all on the same page so the system is more efficient, which creates an ease of doing business. This has been a big focus, especially in the ports.</p><h4>What are the challenges for businesses like Eko Support Services, despite the progress made to date?</h4><p>The biggest challenge remains the traffic congestion on Apapa Road. Many people use water transportation as an alternative, though this solution cannot be used for cargo in most cases. The turnaround time for trucks significantly delays matters for us. The time taken has increased by around 150%. A truck that used to take three days to deliver to Lekki and come back to Lagos Port can take up to nine days now. The government's security agencies seek to control the chaos where trucks queue up outside the port, and this helps slightly. The delays have huge economic impacts, especially for cargo coming into the port to support the offshore oil and gas industry. The authority is looking into the option of removing containers from the port by barge. The problem is that this adds to the cost in terms of chartering barges, having cranes in place to load and unload at each end, and renting a jetty to use. In addition, consumers here are sensitive to any price increase that manufacturers would have to impose to cover these additional transportation costs. There is no incentive to manufacture if one cannot even break, even due to the logistics costs.</p><h4>Do you see the road logistics situation improving in the near future?</h4><p>We are still nine or 10 months away from the road network improving. The new road is being done; however, trailer parks need to be built where trucks can wait, off the road. There are many truck breakdowns, though another big problem was trucks blocking the roads. If there is somewhere for them to wait to come into the port, this will make a big difference. The congestion and waiting times will improve once both these solutions are up and running properly. Another solution the port authorities are looking at is other ports, such as Lekki Port and Badagry. However, these options are not on the horizon for another two or three years.</p><h4>What are your expectations from 2019?</h4><p>We hope 2019 will not be a volatile year due to the elections. We hope none of the results are challenged such that whichever administration comes in will be able to set up its team relatively quickly. As the business environment picks up, 2019 will see an improvement on 2018 in terms of activity levels and some of the policies will come to fruition. Hopefully 2019 will be a better year, as long as we do not have any issues with the elections. For Eko Support Services as a company, we want to get the technology and software we require, which will have to be custom-made for us. We are in talks with bright young programmers here, as well as with a company in the US about designing and assisting us with exactly what we need. If we manage to do this and increase Eko Support Services' footprint, we will be able to provide a better and complete logistics solution, not only to the oil and gas sector, but to other sectors as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the focus on the downstream segment and budget reallocation toward gas mean for the industry and how do EPC contractors position themselves?</h4><p>The energy sector today is in a state of flux: current trends will have a far-reaching impact on oil and gas prices and projected investments. In recent years, the energy sector has witnessed a transition from a traditional business model driven by supply, demand, and price fluctuations to a far more complex and multi-dimensional business model impacted by new technologies, climate change, and sustainability. Change in the oil and gas sector is certain; it is risky to assume business as usual, do nothing and only react to market changes. Many oil companies are slowly reallocating their emphasis from oil to gas: this move is not only driven by gas prices versus oil but by government policies and the push for renewable and clean energy. Our strategy has been to anticipate market change and to plan ahead and quickly adapt to new market realities. For example, the construction of a state-of-the art fabrication facility in the UAE was in anticipation of local market changes. At the local GCC level, more recently, we have witnessed the implementation of a more focused approach driven by the impacts of In-Country Value (ICV) systems being implanted across the region in countries like Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.</p><h4>How can an EPC contractor such as Arabian Industries navigate the current wave of changes affecting the oil and gas industry and remain ahead of the competition?</h4><p>In order to remain competitive, Arabian Industries is continuously reevaluating its business model. Four years ago, Arabian Industries took the necessary steps to restructure its operations into four distinct companies each focused on a specific services delivery including maintenance (AITS), Engineering Technology (AIES), manufacturing (AIM), and EPC (AIP). The AIES segment in particular, specializing in the design and supply of process engineering solutions covering the four main upstream areas of Oil Separation, Gas Treatment, Produced Water Treatment and Sand Management, will enable us to deliver complete turn-key process packages to the Oil &amp; Gas market across the globe and meet the ever-increasing requirement for contractors to supply fully integrated solutions for clients. Along with the restructuring, the company took further steps to decentralize its operations by creating standalone organizations focused on local markets in Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the UAE, we have had a continuous presence since 2010 and have completed a number of key EPC projects. In December 2017, Arabian Industries inaugurated its fifth manufacturing facility, located in ICAD-II, Abu Dhabi, UAE. The new facility, built to support our EPC Division and to serve steel fabrication needs of our UAE clients, is state-of-the art and encompasses an area of 44,000sqm, bringing our combined fabrication area to 250,000sqm. Last but not least, we seek to diversify our portfolio to focus on innovative and new technologies, such as our recent involvement in the construction of the world's largest solar enhanced oil recovery project delivering 1,021MW of peak thermal energy, and our recent addition of a state-of-the-art Corrosion Resistant Alloy (CRA) cladding facility for manufacturing of cladded piping bulk components.</p><h4>What is your assessment of ADNOC's restructuring and the introduction of the In-Country Value (ICV) program for its suppliers?</h4><p>ADNOC's recent reorganization followed by the launch of an ICV program has had a profound impact on our UAE business. The ADNOC ICV program was launched to grow and diversify the UAE economy and to create opportunities for UAE nationals in the private sector. As a Tier I ADNOC Supplier and a local company, we believe this initiative reinforces our commitment to support local businesses in driving economic diversification and growth. However, as the system is taking its hold, we have witnessed some teething problems, which will undoubtedly be corrected through further development. Our ICV strategy will include an approach focused on long-term collaboration with suppliers abiding by the ICV requirements. Hopefully, given the new licensing strategy of opening up six new onshore and offshore blocks in Abu Dhabi, with the ICV system in place, work will filter down to local companies. Existing studies suggest these new blocks hold billions of barrels of oil and trillions cubic feet of natural gas; therefore, it is natural to assume it will bring both new opportunities for EPC contractors in the oil and gas industry and new jobs.</p><h4>What does ADNOC's Downstream Strategy mean for the local EPC industry?</h4><p>ADNOC is moving forward to increase its upstream capacity, it is also moving forward with downstream and taking full advantage of the rising demand for higher-value refined and petrochemical products. By creating the world's largest integrated refining and chemical site in the world, located in Ruwais, the UAE aims to increase annual production to 14.4 million tons by 2025. On the back of this fast-tracked strategy to implement its vision, the UAE energy sector will experience unparalleled growth. The shift to downstream will create an added revenue source to mitigate fluctuations in the oil prices. In the short term, this will create new opportunities for EPC contractors such as the construction of new gas pipelines. Local EPC and manufacturing companies will experience a significant increase in workload and will invest not only to increase execution or production capacity but also to increase efficiency and bring in new technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdulaziz-ibrahim-alissa-chairman-batic]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was envisioned with the rebranding into BATIC, and how has your service portfolio expanded since then?</h4><p>The rebranding of Mubarrad to BATIC was orchestrated to correctly reflect the expansion of the core assets of the company that now reach beyond logistics and delve into security while also highlighting the newly found focus of BATIC on investments and acquisitions. Within the logistics domain, BATIC has expanded its offering and in 2018 the firm closed a transaction pending regulatory approval for two sets of assets. The first set includes warehouses in Dammam and Riyadh and a trucking fleet from Muhaidib Group and the second set is one of the largest cold chain warehousing networks in the Kingdom from Dar Al Abbar. Combined with the recent minority investment into Trukkin, an innovative trucking platform, BATIC's services will now include 3PL, cold storage, cold transport, warehousing and trucking marketplaces. In security, the firm is primarily focused on private security for banks, like cash in transit and ATM management. However, AMNCO has explored accelerating their entry into facilities management as well as electronic payments. For AMNCO, BATIC has now acquired full ownership.</p><h4>A global trend in logistics is the implementation of smart logistics, using data analytics and IoT technology to advance services. Could you tell us more about your vision on using advanced technology in your sector?</h4><p>Mubarrad already uses GPS technology and fleet management systems on all of its trucks. BATIC will also capitalize on our stake in Trukkin which operates a B2B ground transport platform similar to Uber for the trucking industry that matches available truck capacity and drivers with demand from operators.</p><h4>Vision 2030 envisions to capitalize on the Kingdom's strategic location between Europe, Asia and Africa and to develop the country more into a logistic hub. As one of the leading Saudi logistics firms, what are your expectations here? </h4><p>Batic is actively exploring logistics hubs on the Red Sea to support Vision 2030 and to interact with countries on the eastern seaboard of Africa. Iraq, which is accessible via ground transport, presents a growing opportunity for Saudi Arabia and BATIC is currently pursuing several options focused on this new geographic opportunity.</p><h4>How are you looking to expand your Kingdom-wide network and your activities in the GCC region?</h4><p>Through the acquisition of Dar Al Abbar, BATIC will gain warehousing capabilities in every major city in Saudi Arabia. Combined with the premium warehousing assets of Al Himmah logistics, which are owned by Muhaidib Group in Riyadh and Dammam, this transaction will leave BATIC well positioned to gain market share on existing ground transport services and cold chain storage in the coming years.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>BATIC's primary initiative is to become the leading logistics consolidator in Saudi Arabia. After closing nearly SAR500 million worth of transactions this year, the current focal point is to successfully integrate all of the recent acquisitions in a cohesive manner while sustaining the drive for expansion in both cold storage and the offerings of AMNCO in cash logistics. The firm's comprehensive approach looks to keep ahead of the prevailing technological trends in logistics and security by identifying long term growth potential in specialized segments that grow faster than the overall market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dietmar-siersdorfer-ceo-siemens-middle-east-siemens-uae]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Siemens' strategic goals for 2018, and how do they align with the country's preparation for the World Expo 2020 and UAE Vision 2021? </h4><p>We have recently announced plans to expand our digital presence in the Middle East with a USD500 million investment over the next three years, which includes the opening of two MindSphere Application Centers in the UAE.  MindSphere is a cloud-based, open IoT operating system that connects products, plants, systems, and machines, enabling organizations to harness the wealth of data generated by IoT with advanced analytics and granting them an edge to cloud connectivity. In this context, the Dubai center will handle airports, logistics, and cargo, in addition to co-developing innovative approaches that improve the movement of people and goods. This will allow us to work closely with our customers and partners to come up with digital solutions specifically aimed at solving their challenges. The MindSphere Application Center in Abu Dhabi will cater to process industries, mainly focusing on oil, gas, water and waste. It is aimed at enabling customers to improve operational efficiency and reduce their costs across the entire value chain. We are also heavily investing in software grants across the region, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. These grants are aimed at boosting digital skills among youth in the region by providing them with our Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software. Developing local skills is the key to driving the countries' digital transformation. Moreover, Expo 2020 Dubai selected Siemens as the Premier Partner for Intelligent Infrastructure &amp; Operations, enabled and digitalized by our IoT operating system MindSphere. With MindSphere at the heart of our partnership, we are working closely with our partners to create a digitally connected Expo unlike any other previous one. This means we are looking at providing crucial products, services, and solutions that will maximize and optimize Expo 2020 Dubai for visitors and operators.</p><h4>What are the key priorities in applying cybersecurity measures for industrial and energy automation systems in the UAE and what are the major challenges in this regard? </h4><p>Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges facing industries today. While companies have improved protection for their IT environment, they have yet to do the same for their Operational Technology (OT). This means implementing technology solutions suitable for OT to protect the operational assets. We recently conducted a study on the state of readiness of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East to tackle cyberattacks, which revealed how oil and gas OT environments face significant and mounting cybersecurity risk. Moreover, around 60% of respondents surveyed for the study said they face a greater risk in the OT than in the IT environment, and 67% believe the risk level to industrial control systems over the past few years has substantially increased because of cyber threats. The results also showed that while digitalization is improving efficiencies and operational insights for oil and gas companies, it is also generating significantly increased cyber risks. In order for organizations to capture the full benefits of digitalization, it is essential that they rigorously address the OT cyber risk.</p><h4>What sectors, so far, have shown the greatest flexibility in adapting to digitalization and why do you think this has been the case? On the other hand, where do you think there is still a lot of potential for disruption? </h4><p>It is not about adapting to digitalization; it's about embracing it. Different sectors are at various stages of embracing digitalization with different imperatives. When it comes to building infrastructure, for example, digital technologies have been implemented on a wider scale given the availability of data and the speed at which digitalization can realize gains in energy efficiency, cost reduction, and security. We have also seen some of the more nascent manufacturing companies in the UAE adopting digital technologies such as 3D printing. In 2017, Siemens successfully completed a pilot project for the first certified aircraft interior part that was 3D printed with STRATA and Etihad. This was a first for the Middle East and North Africa region, and we expect this technology to be used more widely. The across the board implementation of other digital technologies such as AI and blockchain is only set to increase over time. For example, companies such as LO3 are already using blockchain in the energy sector to achieve greater efficiencies.</p><h4>Looking at the current power generation scenario, how does the UAE compare to other MENA countries in terms of driving sustainability efforts and what have been the major developments since we last met? </h4><p>The UAE has ambitious targets to achieve a healthy energy mix that includes using conventional fuels as well as renewable sources of power generation. This is tremendous forward thinking, especially when you consider our outlook for the energy sector, which forecasts that the share of renewables in the Middle East's energy mix will triple by 2035. In the UAE, we have also seen bold moves to experiment with new and green technologies such as hydrogen, which is dubbed as one of the fuels of the future. In fact, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Expo 2020 Dubai, and Siemens recently signed an agreement for a pilot project to kick off the region's first solar-driven hydrogen electrolysis facility to be located at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. The pilot would look at testing and showcasing an integrated MW-scale plant to produce hydrogen using renewable energy from solar panels at the Solar Park, store the gas, and then deploy it for either re-electrification, transportation or other industrial uses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[35 Industrial Cities in KSA]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[khalid-mohammed-al-salem-director-general-saudi-industrial-property-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year, the total investment in MODON's 35 industrial cities across the Kingdom exceeded SAR500 billion — totaling more than 6,000 contracts included 3,600 factories and 2,400 entities and more than half a million employed. How have your operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p>MODON is going through a transformation of the approach of supporting the industry here. In the earlier stage, our focus was on covering the country with industrial cities and using the fund to develop as much as we can. This reflected how the government strived for inclusive development. We are now moving to more innovative and advanced services in our existing industrial cities, towards smart cities. With the global economic slowdown, the industrial sector faces big challenges and hence we need to innovate. Following the new government direction, we are now partnering with the private sector to boost the economy. MODON is not just a developer of industrial infrastructure; rather, we are an all-round service provider and industry enabler to empower the clean industries by innovate new ideas for the industrial investors. We are constructing ready-built factories since 2012 and have launched programs to attract entrepreneurs, SMEs and more women to develop their businesses in our cities. SMEs require different services and we develop the desired ecosystem in dialog with them. For women, we are encouraging investees to develop with the necessary amenities, which includes daycare facilities for children to be more attractive and comfort environment for women. Currently, there are more than 7,000 women working in the industrial cities. Furthermore, we are working on the productivity improvement of our industry partners with programs sponsored by the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.</p><h4>How do you utilize technology and digitalization to attract companies to your industrial cities?</h4><p>We are now streamlining and automating the processes within our organization to provide more efficient services to ease the business for our partners in order to enhance their contribution to achieve the vision 2030 goals in terms of enabling and developing the industry in Saudi Arabia. Currently, operational licenses for companies that want to settle in our cities can be provided within 24 hours. For land allocation licensing, we have established a 10-day timeframe, which reflects our ambition to target a new type of investments—SMEs cannot wait for months to start their businesses. As part of this transformation, we are empowering the management of the industrial cities allowing them to deal with most issues on their own. Once our transformation is done, all licensing, land allocation, and environmental certification can be done in one electronic platform with easy access for investors.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about incentives, packages, and infrastructural development for activities in the more remotely located cities?</h4><p>Every region has its own potential for economic development and employment opportunities, and we want to convey that message. We are currently reviewing our pricing policy to make it more promising and attractive for investors. For example, interested parties with an add value business can contact us with their wishes and requirements for their production facilities and we will build accordingly based on our “Built To Suit“ program. For the regions, we want to encourage particularly start-ups and SMEs and are working in collaboration with the SME Authority to built incubator centers. We have already constructed one in Dammam, under the Prince Sultan Fund. For other regions, we are coordinating with Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) for the provision of loans that can be up to 75%. There is now better alignment between the different government authorities as there is one vision and one objective, and an understanding we need to work together. Also, we are studying the unique value propositions of the regions to tailor our approach to its path of industrial development, and we do this in partnership with industrial committees via the chamber of commerce. Our cities in the south and north, for example, have a strong agricultural environment  and we can accelerate food-processing industries there. It makes more sense to encourage industries that are close to the hearts of the local populations, and we can help them add value. Another example is logistics, which will work well in our coastal areas, and we are working in closer coordination with the Ministry of Transport to execute our master plan. Also in logistics, we see a large role for the private sector, and we strive for partnerships with them. We already have such projects in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam, and we want to now extend these areas to closer to the country's borders, for example ARAR city. As trade has resumed with Iraq, there are many opportunities ahead.</p><h4>What is the role of partnerships with multinationals for technology transfer and expansion of value-adding industrial developments?</h4><p>MODON is working in closer collaboration with the National Industrial Cluster to utilize the access of industrial clusters to international investors. The Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources has formulated its ambition to attract more advanced industries and to commit them to localization inside of the Kingdom. This will not happen without a state-of-the-art technology infrastructure, and that is therefore what we are working on, in addition to the incentives packages and enablers that we provide to foreign companies. The ministry is working on the implementation of the National Industrial Strategy, which will further identify the sectors and value chains that we want to target as a country, and how we can do that.</p><h4>What is your outlook and ambitions for MODON for the coming two to three years?</h4><p>We are working to make our organization more fit and efficient and to optimize our organizational structure. With our ambition to serve industries better and to work with new industries, we need to first build our internal capacity. Furthermore, digitalization is high on our agenda and we want to make our cities smart enough in terms of security, environment, digital infrastructure, and logistics. Our plants will all have the necessary upgrades for this, as well as an application to monitor cities tracks and trucks around the cities. We are open to suggestions of our industry partners for further enhancement of the work environment. The MODON cities of the future will all have zones for e-commerce, social activities, and accommodation in the form of business hotels. The cities will become ecosystems for work and leisure and we want to attract private investors from a broad range of sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Strategy for 2022]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sheikh-abdulla-bin-saoud-al-thani-governor-qatar-central-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be your priorities for your new five-year term?</h4><p>The global economic and financial front has raised new challenges and opportunities that have influenced central banks all over the world. In fact, they have changed the future of central banks. Two priorities lead our five-year agenda: strengthening monetary policy framework as well as financial stability and fostering the advancement of the financial and banking infrastructure. Henceforth, aiming to achieve Qatar's ambition to be a leading financial hub in the region, three main strategies have been designed considering new policies, regulations, and tools. Strategy wise, from the sectorial level, the Financial Sector Regulatory Strategy for 2017-2022 was released after the economic blockade in June 2017. The strategy focuses on guiding Qatar in its future endeavors toward building a sound and resilient financial sector to ensure sustainable economic growth in alignment with Qatar National Vision 2030 objectives. The strategy also takes into consideration the requirements from the banking and financial sector to support the country in preparing to host the 2022 World Cup and contribute to the successful execution of the event, for example furtherance of the payment system platform. Considering the globalization of financial technology and innovation and the rapid digital elevation, which implies certain challenges making the process of financial intermediation more complex, and higher risks of cyberattack, we have designed a strategy in cooperation with Qatar Development Bank (QDB) to create a fintech hub in the country, which is critical for future success. Awareness that the ecosystem will be more important than ever leads to the necessity of creating a financial inclusion and literacy strategy, which will seek to broad-base the financial sector through both supply and demand-side measures linking banks' service development to customs awareness and protection. A key element of this strategy is to promote the SME sector, which will also be consistent with the Qatar National Development Strategy (QNDS 2) objective of economic diversification and promoting greater private participation. In addition, we have been continuously strengthening our regulatory and supervisory systems to ensure that the financial system remains safe, stable, and solid and is resilient enough to address unforeseen challenges. We are committed to implementing latest global standards such as Basel 4, issued from time-to-time by global standard setting bodies. We also focus on developing more young, bright Qataris and professionals to contribute to the success of the financial sector through our Human Capital Development goal.</p><h4>In terms of promotion of the green economy, what are some of the plans of the Qatar Central Bank?</h4><p>The focus on green financing has spread rapidly throughout the world. Leading central banks are taking significant initiatives to address issues related to such financing. In Qatar, we have also taken initiatives to support green financing initiatives. Commercial banks have launched innovative credit products like 'green mortgage,' which rewards environmentally conscious new home loan-takers with concessional financing terms. Relatedly, Qatar Development Bank (QDB) is also proactive in funding SMEs in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries with the twin objectives of empowering local businesses and achieving self-sufficiency. The Second Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation provides a well-defined roadmap to promote sustainable investment and green finance. This includes, among others, devising incentives for firms to promote green financing, enhancing cooperation with QDB to foster economic diversification, and exploring the possibility of issuing green bonds.</p><h4>With the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 9), what improvements do you see in the Qatari financial sector?</h4><p>IFRS 9 is designed to bring more transparency, accountability, and efficiency to financial institutions across the world through high-quality accounting criteria. Given the forward-looking nature of this regulation, this will make banks proactive in establishing and building up their allowance for possible future credit losses. Not only will this further improve their credit risk assessment skills, it will also improve data quality and ensure better pricing of loans. This will enable them to better manage their profitability, as identification and corrective measures can be taken well in advance. IFRS 9 reporting will enhance the overall health and resilience of the banking sector and better equip them to address sharp and sudden downturns in economic cycles.</p><h4>How would you assess the stability of the public financial accounts in Qatar?</h4><p>The downturn in energy prices had led to budget deficits in the last few years. However, with better expenditure management and cost rationalization, we were able to successfully tide over the difficult period. In the last few years, we have initiated fiscal reform measures that seek to promote growth-friendly expenditures to help support the macro-financial outlook. Thankfully, the upturn in energy prices coupled with the low fiscal breakeven oil prices provides us the headroom to close the fiscal gap, while pursuing gradual fiscal consolidation.</p><h4>How well is Qatar financially protected against the enduring regional situation?</h4><p>We have been living with the economic blockade for well over a year and have returned to 'business as usual.' Most of the volatile non-resident deposits have moved out of the system, and as a result, banks now have more stable deposit base. Besides, their capitalization levels are significantly above the regulatory minimum levels and the levels of non-performing loans are fairly low. Besides, these non-performing loans are adequately provisioned for. We regularly undertake stress tests of various risks to ascertain banking system resilience. In addition, we also undertake regular onsite inspection of banks coupled with off-site surveillance. The balance of evidence points to strong resilience of the banking sector.</p><h4>How do you expect the private finance and banking sector to develop in the coming years?</h4><p>Moving forward, I see space for the banking sector to grow and prosper. The significant financing opportunities in the run-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup provides them with adequate room to expand their loan books. Having learnt important lessons from the economic blockade, they have also been improving their funding structure with focus on more stable and long-term sources. Banks also offer shareholders and clients a wide range of products and services to grow, manage, and protect their wealth and assets. The firming up of oil prices over the last few years has significantly boosted banking sector liquidity and keep lending rates at competitive levels. On our part, we are continuously evaluating and suitably implementing regulatory standards to ensure that the system remains safe, sound, and solid.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Given the outlook for oil prices this year and next, we expect to see significant improvements in both the domestic and external balances. In 2017, our fiscal deficit turned out to be lower than initially projected, and the current account registered a healthy surplus. The various high-frequency financial indicators also point to a return to normalcy. The initiatives taken by the authorities in various sectors after the blockade were aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency, and we are gradually witnessing the benefits of these initiatives in our daily lives. Having successfully demonstrated their resilience to the economic blockade, the banking sector has regained the confidence of international investors. The return of confidence will further boost the economic and financial sectors and provide the required momentum for the sector to grow and prosper.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove Abeer Group to enter the UAE market?</h4><p>Abeer is establishing trust and goodwill with the people of the UAE by providing quality and affordable healthcare. The plan was to expand and achieve a globally trusted partnership through which we redefine healthcare innovations across borders. We already have a presence in most GCC countries and India and plan to expand into the Far East in the near future, starting mostly with Malaysia. As for the UAE, Emiratis still go abroad to Europe, India, and Thailand for medical care. Therefore, there are still important gaps, especially in intensive care, critical care, and certain sub-specialties such as neonatology, oncology, psychiatry, and psycho-social services. Others such as cardiothoracic surgery and surgical oncology also need to be improved. Considering the population growth in Abu Dhabi, establishing centers of excellence, possibly through partnerships, must be a priority, especially in maternity and childcare and oncology centers. This also applies to the other Emirates, where we are planning to expand in the near future.</p><h4>In terms of preventative healthcare, what is the best way to approach the risk management of healthcare?</h4><p>One of the most troublesome factors about healthcare is lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, high-blood pressure, and heart and kidney-related problems. Since prevention is better than curing, doctors should keep counseling patients on how to change their lifestyles if they have these types of diseases. We also do a lot of health check-ups, which are requested annually by some companies and have really helped preventative medicine efforts.</p><h4>What role will technology play in the medical field?</h4><p>There is a need to understand how technological gadgets can help us learn more about the patient even before the symptoms arrive. There is a lot of technological expansion in the UAE, and the government is very keen on creating an electronic environment. For example, Dubai recently announced that by 2020 the entire healthcare system will be paperless. Before long, other agencies and Emirates will follow. Using AI to manage hospitals is another area in which the UAE is advancing. What we do is get the patient's information and evaluate their individual risk stratification of a particular disease. If they are at risk, we give educate them with preventive measures before the actual disease starts. These technological advances are progressing rapidly.</p><h4>How are you attracting talent, and how do you balance it with technology?</h4><p>Healthcare is not an industry that can go totally man-less (as of now/within the near future), we need people such as nurses and doctors, but technology will make our lives easier and our work more productive. We believe in equal opportunities and Emiratization. We certainly appreciate the efforts of the government in training new UAE doctors, which is going to add to our pool of health care personnel. Having local doctors would also be a plus point since they understand the social and cultural aspects of the population apart from language.</p><h4>What are your key priorities and how do they align with Vision 2021?</h4><p>Vision 2021 is a great initiative. As a part of it, the government and healthcare sector have come up with a 10-point plan to improve the overall quality of the healthcare system and reduce lifestyle-related diseases, such as child obesity. It also talks about increasing the life expectancy in the UAE and achieve universal healthcare. In a nutshell, it is a great health initiative by the government that Abeer and Al Raha are completely aligned with.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the evolution of your portfolio reflect the trends you see today in Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>Looking at the future of the Emirate, it is obvious we are trying to implement a more seamless business environment. There will be many technological changes, such as 3D construction, but it still to be seen how far it will go. The construction industry for example has gone through many trials and errors which is why, in terms of technology, we are expecting long term UAE plans, investments and strategies in the same. As a family business, we like to get our feet in the water before we jump in. In this sense, we are looking for trends in the Fintech market that will add value to our existing business units and improve our future plans for the company as a whole. One of the challenges posed by the growing economy is the need to become more streamlined and focused as a company. As we move forward, we want to continue with some businesses, but we might need to divest from the ones that do not align with our strategy. Our core business is our motor business as well as our construction and oil field supply businesses. We plan on growing in the medical sector and we are continuing with other retail businesses, such as our jewelry, seeking to getting closer to the customer every day riding the wave of online shopping.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the oil and gas industry in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi has played a significant role in finding different ways to approach this changing industry. No one knows what the future price of oil will be. That means the industry needs to find alternative customers who will be there regardless of the oil and gas price. The change needs to happen from within the industry. We will still produce both oil and gas, the latter of which is surely important for the country to maintain a sustainable and reliable source of electricity. Investing in the downstream industry and other industries that need oil and gas supports the country and pushes the boundaries of the oil price. Increasing the price marginally today by AED1 may not seem making a huge impact, but down the road it will result in a great deal of disposable income for individuals. What can be also be addressed is supporting other industries. We have many international customers, and if we can increase the number of customers we have locally, that will greatly help the UAE. The different ways of making money will continue to grow, create different industries, and have a multiplier effect on the economy.</p><h4>What do you expect from the government in order to diversify while protecting local industries?</h4><p>There needs to be a discussion about a lead partnership through a platform. We have to realize there is a challenge and start talking about combined efforts to find solutions. For example, fees that are charged by various entities are an issue: the government wants to cover its costs, but so do we. We have to find the solution where they can provide the best public service and support us while still making profits, and we can still make a profit as well. The market is changing, and margins are falling, especially for the industrial sector. The economy needs a base to spur a multiplying effect that doesn't start from the oil and gas sector, which still is the main revenue stream for Abu Dhabi. The reality of Abu Dhabi is that it is an industrial city. Though tourism is increasing, we need everyone to support the industrial sector.</p><h4>What role does sustainability play in the industrial sector?</h4><p>We cannot deny that sustainability is an important ingredient for long-term planning. Energy savings of 5-10% helps someone else acquire that energy and use it, as well as reduce capital expenditure. It is also important to find other ways of generating energy. There are many ideas; however, can these ideas be practically implemented to create immediate savings? How much would these savings change the books? It is limited and cannot happen overnight. It takes planning and implementing the proper laws and initiatives. Still, there are mass needs for mass industries. It is not practical for one factory to implement sustainable practices overnight. It would create some savings, though it would not be something that would revolutionize matters.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Saudi participation in Cannes 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmad-f-al-maziad-ceo-general-culture-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What ideas did you present at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 and what are your ambitions for the film industry in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The 2018 Cannes Film Festival was an historic moment because it was Saudi Arabia's first-ever official participation, and an opportunity for us to open the door and highlight our creative and filmmaking talent, while at the same time letting the global film industry know that we are open for business. Some of the media dubbed Saudi as the star of this year's Festival and our press conference was attended by 73 media outlets from all over the world. We showcased nine short film in the Cannes Short Film Corner, and held workshops on a broad range of topics, including Arab women filmmakers and production capabilities in Saudi, as well as hosting a Saudi band at our pavilion. We look at our ambitions for the film industry in Saudi Arabia in two ways—in Saudi for Saudi and in Saudi for the world. To support Saudi nationals, in Cannes we announced a National Fund to support young Saudi filmmakers, especially for short films, and a grant program for training for Saudi nationals, for both men and women, to study abroad at globally-recognized educational institutions like the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, La Fémis in Paris, and others. By offering these incentives, and by training our local people, we are putting the pieces of the Saudi film industry together. There are already well-known filmmakers and production companies in Saudi. This demonstrates the potential, and we need to ensure that we unlock that full potential. To show what we offer to the global film community, we announced our incentive program, which is probably one of the most generous available in the world today international. Filmmakers will get 35% cash back on all spend used and consumed in the Kingdom, and when they employ Saudi talent, we will reimburse 50% of those costs. Our objective is to create a sustainable industry, and by enabling and encouraging Saudis to be employed on film sets we help elevate their skills to the level found in other countries with strong film industry ecosystems. In addition, we expect our incentives will lead to further creative and job creation opportunities in all aspects of film and production, like lighting and sound engineers, and the industries that grow up to support them including accommodation, transportation and catering. Cannes 2018 gave us the opportunity to deliver our message that Saudi is open for business in the film and content industry.</p><h4>The GCA has also announced its plans to hold 300 events per year across a broad cultural spectrum. What are the ambitions here?</h4><p>We have two types of cultural events—within and outside Saudi. During the international visits of the Crown Prince in March and April, we organized Saudi Cultural Days, with custom-made cultural events for all the countries we visited. We showcased Saudi contemporary art, film, music and heritage in London, New York and Paris. The objective of these international events is to introduce the world to the incredible creative talent and cultural history we have in the Kingdom and start to move perceptions away from the stereotype of oil, desert, and camels. For our internal cultural events, the objective is to encourage the development of a local industry and support local artists. We want Saudis to know and learn more about their own culture. The Kingdom is large and diverse, and many people might not know of the unique cultural aspects of other parts of the country. We also aim to encourage people to appreciate art, whether in the form of dance, music, painting, visual arts, or others.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your role in the Quality of Life Program 2030?</h4><p>Everything we do at GCA is in line with Vision 2030, which has 12 programs, one of which is the Quality of Life program. The program is targeted at moving our cities up in the global rankings of livability, and not just the three major cities. There are a number of requirements to achieve this, including having excellent infrastructure such as the availability of theaters, cinemas, galleries and other cultural centers. In Saudi, this is relatively new territory, and there are increasingly more options for people to enjoy these cultural facets of life and to experience local and international music, plays, opera, and dance. These activities not only raise one's appreciation of the arts, but also allow them to enjoy life. They give people a chance to step out and see what is happening and be exposed to other cultures. It also helps parents introduce their children to these experiences and opens up opportunities for them. A city has to have both these hard and soft elements to be livable. In the past, Saudis used to drive across the bridge to Bahrain or fly to Dubai to watch a movie or visit a music concert. Now, we want to have these events take place in our cities.</p><h4>What is the GCA's vision for capitalizing on Saudi's cultural heritage?</h4><p>There are two elements when it comes to cultural heritage: tangible and intangible. The tangible heritage, the physical structure, is under the supervision of the Saudi Tourism Commission. The other element is the intangible heritage, like music, calligraphy, dialectics, recipes, and traditional dances and games. GCA is launching a program to capture, celebrate, and preserve Saudi Arabia's intangible heritage. This is a big program that will cut across the entire country to ensure we preserve and promote our entire intangible heritage.</p><h4>What is your message to the business community in Saudi and abroad to participate in the cultural sector?</h4><p>Culture and entertainment are amongst the main programs under Vision 2030, which speaks of the government's commitment to culture and the sizable budget allocated to it. At the end of the day, this cannot be done without the private sector. To be sustainable in the long run, the private sector needs to develop a sustainable sector where young Saudi can thrive. The earlier the private sector gets involved, the better. There is an opportunity to pioneer in this field now. The Saudi filmmaking industry is nascent, and starting today is relatively easy. Films require an infrastructure to be produced, and the private sector can develop these studios. This industry has the opportunity to become a multi-billion-riyal industry, starting from almost zero. Investors will reap the benefits as the industry matures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its inception in 2006, what have been some of the major contributions of Qatar Tribune to the media sector?</h4><p>Qatar Tribune has been a significant player in advancing the role of free media in Qatar and the region with its sharp, balanced, and objective reporting. Since its inception, Qatar Tribune has focused on providing edge to reporting and writing about issues that concern the communities and the nation. Effectively, it has played its desired mediating role in strengthening the key institutions for a free and vibrant society. Qatar is on the right track to becoming a knowledge-based society and Qatar Tribune is committed to playing a positive role in contributing to help achieve the goal of Qatar National Vision 2030. Qatar Tribune adheres to the time-tested norms, laws, and media ethics of journalism. Objectivity and accuracy are sine qua non of journalism and it is in our DNA to follow all the established canons of journalism. On the micro level, Qatar Tribune has contributed to refine the genres of print journalism. For instance, Qatar Tribune was the first newspaper in the country to have brought out separate sections on national affairs, sports, business, and entertainment. It was a strategy that helped the readers to focus on the subject of their choice and begin their day with what they loved the most. Second, Qatar Tribune was the first media outlet to have started bringing special pages focused on different communities. On each day of the week, a full-page is devoted to one specific expat community. For example, an entire page is reserved for highlighting the Qatari tradition, culture, and way of life. This has undoubtedly brought the communities together.</p><h4>What is Qatar Tribune's strategy to capitalize on the increasing level of online penetration in Qatar?</h4><p>Consumption of news and information from online sources has increased in the last couple of years. Qatar has one of the highest penetrations level of internet in the world. Accordingly, Qatar Tribune has a strategy in place to adapt to this environment. At the same time, the traditional sources of news such as print are still viable and will remain so for a long time. We have substantial online presence and we are keen to press ahead with ideal and desirable convergence of print and digital. We are the first Qatari newspaper to have native mobile apps and e-paper to promote our digital presence. We are also present on all social media platforms and always looking for ways to improve and engage with users. Qatar's media sector is dynamic and evolving. It functions in a free environment that is conducive to the development of media and journalism. As far as the pattern of news consumption is concerned, Qatari media has adapted well to the digital trend and it will continue to grow.</p><h4>With the economic dynamism of Qatar, information on business and economy has become a  valuable resource for the business community. What is Qatar Tribune's approach when it comes to keeping this segment well informed?</h4><p>We have a strong business team working to keep readers informed about developments in the economy and business. Qatari economy has been firing on all cylinders since the blockade was imposed and we report in minutest of details on both the micro and macro-economic developments taking place in various sectors of the economy.</p><h4>With the blockade, Qatari newspapers were blocked in the UAE. How did you cope with this situation, and how would you assess the response on the Qatari side to this action?</h4><p>The media sector in Qatar has not been affected by what neighboring countries have done or how the media in those countries have reported the issue. We have maintained the utmost professionalism in the face of all manners of provocation. We have exposed the blockading countries' duplicity and hypocrisy while maintaining decorum and dignity. The entire world is witness to the fact that the Qatari leadership, the people, and the media have maintained equanimity and calm in response to extreme provocation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are positive and confident about the year ahead and about the future in general. The international media has acknowledged that Qatar has not only weathered the siege but has come out stronger than before. There is total unanimity within the global community that the neighboring countries shot themselves in their foot by declaring a blockade on Qatar. Global institution such as the IMF has paid compliments to Qatari leadership for managing the economy prudently and imaginatively to beat the siege and embark on a robust phase of economic development. The IMF and the international ratings agencies have forecasted a positive outlook for the Qatari economy. One of the most positive outcomes of the siege has been Qatari government's determination to achieve self-sufficiency in various sectors of the economy. In a short period of time, Qatar has become near self-reliant in food and daily products. The drive to diversify the economy and empower the private sector has gathered pace. Qatar is determined to become self-reliant in manufacturing and pharmaceuticals to meet the objectives and allow 100% foreign investment in various sectors. The other significant outcome of the blockade is the resurgence in Qatari nationalism and pride. People have rallied behind the leadership in an unprecedented manner and they are determined to make Qatar an even more prosperous nation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Alfardan Group's products target a discerning clientele for some of its business lines such as jewellery. How would you assess your positioning toward this kind of clients and what are your plans to strengthen it?</h4><p>Alfardan Group is known for conducting business in a way that sets exacting standards, which is quite visible through the excellence, leadership, and quality of our products and services. It is this shared value with clients that allows us to meet their needs and the types of products and services that they expect from us. We deliver state-of-the-art products and services by investing heavily in the latest technologies and innovation while ensuring these investments are met with superiority, luxury, and transparency. The core is trust and reliability. Our broad expansion to other industries from jewellery and luxury watches to currency exchange, property development, hospitality, automotive and industrial equipment, investments, and maritime services are consistently followed and supported by our high-profile clients because of their continued trust in us. They experience the consistency in our services across all sectors, and we continue to maintain these established standards with a firm commitment that we will only provide the ever-evolving market needs with the highest international benchmarks. This is how we have attained our leading position locally and regionally.</p><h4>The company works with some of the most distinguished brands in the automotive sector like Jaguar or Land Rover. What is the competitive advantage that Alfardan Group can bring to such brands to increase their distribution in Qatar?</h4><p>We have successfully established ventures in a wide range of industries, with a special focus on luxury and high-end markets. We maintain a high level of qualifications for our teams, ensuring they are widely-experienced and we continue to train them to keep them on par with international practices; all the while remaining true to our commitment to family values, quality, excellence, integrity, social responsibility, and professionalism. At the core of all our efforts is our uncompromising commitment to always honor the values of the company's founding father Ibrahim Alfardan, whose vision and character have guided our business interests. We have earned the trust not only of our customers, but also of leading global brands seeking to expand into Qatar and the region.</p><h4>Alfardan Group announced the launch of the Marsa Arabia Resort luxury development project. What will be different about this new resort? What is the role that tourism will play in future operations?</h4><p>Marsa Arabia Resort is Alfardan's latest major venture in integrated luxury lifestyle development as part of our initiative to boost our international hospitality offerings and our commitment to support Qatar's progress in diversifying the economy through tourism. As Qatar is positioned to become the preferred luxury destination in the Middle East, we are bringing into the market an exclusive masterplan development that transcends the boundaries between residential living and hotel experiences. The landmark project is strategically located within Porto Arabia along The Pearl Qatar's waterfront, featuring an architectural design that reflects both the Arabian and Andalusian cultures. Our aim for it is to showcase an entirely new way of living, with world-class facilities and amenities under the management of The St. Regis brand. The tourism sector is at the heart of our core offerings since we have established Alfardan Hospitality and we are always guided by the vision of Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, to build a highly-developed and sustainable nation. We will continue to build our offerings following this agenda in line with the Qatar Vision 2030 and take advantage of the strong momentum in Qatar's tourism and hospitality sector. The current developments in the sector, including infrastructure investments, are massive with up to USD200 billion for new projects. The generous support of the Qatari government to sustainable development further reinforces our confidence to significantly contribute and tap our business capabilities and ingenuity to strengthen Qatar's presence on the global tourism map.</p><h4>In terms of business diversification, which sectors are becoming more promising for your business expansion? Are there plans to further expand to other countries?</h4><p>There is continuous expansion and innovation in key sectors in which we operate, as well as in terms of geographic reach. We have been exploring key markets following on our interests in a broad range of industries, particularly in rapidly growing economies such as Oman and Turkey. The Finaa Alazaibah in Oman, our first project outside of Qatar, stands out as one of Oman's largest and most attractive mixed-used development. Amidst these efforts, we remain active to keep our local market position even stronger. With Qatar's winning bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, we are striving to ensure that our brands and key offerings are in line with the high-profile event's demands.</p><h4>How is the ongoing embargo affecting Alfardan Group's operations in the region? Are some of your operations being readdressed to other regions?</h4><p>Prior to the blockade, we had already been proactive in expanding our focus and deeply capitalizing on the opportunities available to us as part our ongoing diversification efforts. As a result, we are able to maintain a strong position as a key player in strengthening and boosting the Qatari economy through our leading hospitality, real estate, automotive, and other initiatives. These challenges served to test our market resilience and the country's ability to further push for growth while maintaining our level of quality, excellence, and refined ways in transforming challenges into opportunities. We have become creative and innovative in finding solutions, from identifying alternative supply chains for our vehicles and spare parts to adopting an import-based strategy that directly seeks manufacturers rather than relying on regional centers. It was our keenness and determination to keep our relations strong with our strategic partners to continue developing high quality projects and provide an exclusive range of products and services that are an important addition to the economic and social growth of the country.<br></p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are looking forward to develop more premium quality products and services for our rapidly expanding markets. We are keen to maintain the spirit of innovation in all areas of business, which has been bringing us phenomenal success and we are working on new markets to engage customers in varying demographics. Another significant part of our agenda is to create new products that meet the country's sustainable and environmental focus as part of the government's long-term socioeconomic programs. Alfardan is known for its excellence and unparalleled service. We will continue to uphold these values and maintain high standards that we have established in all areas of business and promote our best practices in the local, regional, and global landscapes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[12 million sqm of land]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[prof-abdullah-m-althiabi-rector-university-tabuk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the university's main strengths, and how have they evolved over the years?</h4><p>One of our major strengths is our location. Tabuk is in the northwest of Saudi Arabia and it is so close to the new tourism and business hub NEOM. It has a population of 910,000 people. We offer students a chance to get a first-class university education locally. The university currently has 29,000 students and 3,000 staff. We have students from Europe, Asia, America, and Africa, and expanding our international student exchange programs is part of our strategy. We have grown and have been able to build up our structures and programs in various disciplines, including economics. From the outset, we insisted on applying certain local and international benchmarks when building our programs. We have international cooperation contracts with several universities such as University of Louisiana and New York State University. From our inception in 2006, the university's vision has been to develop our own resources and then increase them. The university has 12 million sqm of land at its disposal. We have investment plans and a special unit run by experienced financial experts dedicated to build up our resources. We also have an Institute of Research and Consultation, which is the connection between our colleges and staff on one hand, and the private sector on the other. Any company looking for consultation services or research regarding specific issues can use our services. The University comprises 11 colleges, 12 deanships, 6 units, and two centers as well as five university colleges across five satellite campuses. This is in addition to newly establishing yet another college, two centers, and a unit in order to be in accord with the kingdom's 2030 vision. It is worth mentioning here that 850 scholars have been sent to study abroad covering many fields of sciences as well as gaining five patents in scientific research.</p><h4>How do you assess which skills are in demand in the private sector?</h4><p>From the outset, we have worked to establish strong connections with local authorities and companies over time. We also have a good relationship with the local Trade Chamber and the Ministry of Labor, which help us to understand the labor needs in this rapidly changing economy. Each college within the university has its own council with representatives from businesses and local government. We have prepared our latest strategic plan based on Saudi's economic needs and the new projects that are currently on-going in Tabuk; for example, NEOM and other Red Sea projects. Hence, we have established two new centers and a unit: Center for Research in Renewable Energy, Center for Industrial Innovations and Robotics, and the Entrepreneurship Unit. They will all help the university be part of what is going on in terms of new projects. We have also established a College of Tourism, since the university is right in the middle between the ancient city of Mada'in Saleh and the new tourism and business hub NEOM.</p><h4>What other aspects of Vision 2030 are impacting your operations?</h4><p>IT integration is a vital component of the Vision. We are heavily investing in e-learning and distance learning facilities. Most of our resources are available online and most functions are automated now. All of our academic registration procedures are online. We have started to run distance-learning courses where the students do not have to come to the campus at all. Another element is female participation in the labor force. At the University of Tabuk, we are among the first local universities to assign a female vice-rector for our female students and try to encourage the colleges to increase female participation. We have females on the University and College Councils as well as committees. These are forums whereby women can deliver their ideas and concerns about education. Another important element is accreditation, the university encourages its colleges to gain accreditation for their programs. Thus, the Mathematics Department gained accreditation from ASIIN, the CEA accredited the English Department, and the ABET gave its accreditation for both the Mechanical Engineering and Computing Departments.</p><h4>What are some of your goals and ambitions for 2018?</h4><p>One of our main goals is to help our students find jobs within six months of graduating. We conduct training courses within our curriculum because students need more training and practice. We offer specialized training courses to help our students find jobs in the private sector and we try to provide them with the tools they need for the workplace. We are working to ensure that all our students can pass their relevant international professional standards tests. We want our graduates to gain both academic and professional certification.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2017: Unemployment down to 8.9%]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[carlos-da-silva-costa-governor-bank-of-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Portuguese economy has rebounded strongly from the adverse impact of the global financial crisis that began in 2008. What is your perspective regarding Portugal´s transition from recession, austerity, early exit from the EU/IMF bailout, and return to growth?</h4><p>The Portuguese economy started recovering during 2013, reflecting a gradual recovery of domestic demand and strong export growth, on the back of an improving external and financial environment. The composition of growth has contributed to a correction of fundamental macroeconomic imbalances, including an improvement in the external and fiscal accounts. One remarkable characteristic during the adjustment period and the ongoing recovery has been the behavior of exports. Portuguese exporters have been gaining market share in external markets since 2008. A notable dimension of the Portuguese export performance has been the services sector, especially tourism. Exports' share of GDP increased from around 30% in 2008 to close to 45% in 2017, which signals an important restructuring of the economy. The economic recovery has also been supported by strong investment growth, in particular business investment. On the contrary, public and housing investment has lagged behind. The dynamism of business investment has been driven by favorable developments in overall demand, the need to rebuild capital stock after the strong reduction in investment during the crisis years, and favorable financing conditions. Increasing investment will strengthen growth in productivity and output. The capital per worker ratio in the Portuguese economy was severely affected during the recessive period and remains at low levels, limiting the incorporation of new technologies into the productive process and thus inhibiting productivity gains. The recovery in the labor market in recent years has been job-rich. Nonetheless, employment levels have not recovered to those observed prior to the international financial crisis. The unemployment rate initiated a downward trend in 2014 and reached 8.9% in 2017 (from 16.2% in 2013). Another key feature of the recovery is that the economy has been able to maintain a surplus in the current and capital account and also in the goods and services account. These developments have contributed to a gradual improvement in the international investment position, which is still negative. The Portuguese economy underwent a strong and unprecedented fiscal consolidation process. The general government deficit stands currently at a historically low level. Public debt as a percentage of GDP has also initiated a downward trajectory but remains high and considerably above the euro area average. This reinforces the importance of meeting the commitments under European fiscal rules. Moreover, the reduction in the indebtedness ratios of firms and households, together with positive developments in the banking system, have made the Portuguese economy more resilient to shocks.</p><h4>In recent years the Portuguese banking sector overcame a number of challenges. What are some of the most important measures the Bank of Portugal took to help the country return to greater macroeconomic stability?</h4><p>In 2010, the bank initiated a comprehensive strategy to address the challenges faced by the banking sector. This strategy was broadened in the context of the 2011-14 EU/IMF Economic Adjustment Program. Our most immediate concerns were to ensure banks' access to liquidity and the reinforcement of their capital ratios. At the same time, banking supervision became much more intrusive and forward-looking and the regulatory environment was significantly strengthened. The country's full participation in the banking union, and particularly in the Single Supervisory and Resolution Mechanisms, can be seen as a natural corollary of this much more demanding strategy that we have consistently been following since mid-2010. Major progress has been achieved over the past eight years. Portuguese banks are now increasingly robust, as evident by stronger liquidity and capital positions, reinforced shareholder structures in major banks, and improvements in asset quality. The banking system recognized over EUR33 billion of credit impairments while the biggest banks raised over EUR20 billion of equity. Regarding asset quality, while economic growth has certainly been beneficial, the ongoing comprehensive strategy to reduce NPLs is also bearing fruit. NPLs have decreased more than EUR13 billion since the peak in June 2016. Equally important, deposits have been quite resilient, showing that depositor confidence has been preserved. Also, banks have continued to fulfil their role in financing the economy.</p><h4>What is the Bank of Portugal doing to encourage banks to further strengthen their balance sheets, improve overall asset quality and liquidity, and reduce the level of non-performing loans?</h4><p>While developments in the banking sector have been encouraging, banks' adjustment efforts will have to continue. The ongoing challenges are four-fold: improve profitability, review the existing business models, reinforce governance models, and embed technological advances in retail banking. Improving profitability is a priority. Amid still-low interest rates, further progress on cost reduction is needed. This is even more pressing in view of the stricter regulatory requirements and the digitization trend. Moreover, banks need to continue to deliver on the targets agreed in their NPL reduction plans. The sustainability of banks' business models, risk management controls, and internal governance processes are key to guarantee the soundness of the banking system. These elements are closely monitored and challenged by the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Bank of Portugal.</p><h4>What steps is the Bank of Portugal taking in order to help offset the eventual phasing out of the European Central Bank´s asset purchasing program?</h4><p>The Portuguese economy is better prepared than before to withstand external shocks, reflecting considerable progress in the deleveraging process. There has been a steady decline in households' and corporations' indebtedness ratios in recent years. In case of households, debt as a percentage of disposable income reached 105% in 2017, down from 130% on average between period 2008 and 2012. In case of corporations, the debt ratio stood at around 100 % of GDP in 2017 (compared to a maximum of 127% in 2012). The public debt ratio also declined in 2017, to 125.7% of GDP. The international investment position has also been improving, but still amounted to a net debtor position of 106% of GDP in 2017. In spite of the progress made, the indebtedness levels of the different institutional sectors remain high, continuing to represent a vulnerability of the Portuguese economy, in particular, regarding interest rate developments. Thus, the need to continue reducing the leverage ratios of the Portuguese economy remains a priority.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the performance of the Portuguese economy during 2019 and some of the top priorities during the next two years?</h4><p>The Portuguese economy is expected to continue on an expansionary path over the 2018-2020 period, although at a decelerating pace, mirroring a deceleration in external demand- and supply-side constraints, associated with structural obstacles to higher potential growth. The progressive maturing of the expansion process is also expected in the euro area. After an increase of 2.7% in 2017, Portuguese GDP is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020. These developments reflect the solid performance of exports, robust gross fixed capital formation, and moderate private consumption growth, which should be similar to GDP growth. Compared to 2008, real output is estimated to be 5% higher in 2020. The current cyclical phase should be used to make progress in addressing remaining macroeconomic imbalances and structural obstacles, helping increase the long-term growth of the Portuguese economy, and the convergence to European income levels. The temporary nature of the current broad set of unconventional monetary policy measures in the euro area and the persistence of downside risks to medium-term growth projections—in particular, those related to increased protectionism tensions and political uncertainty at world level—highlight the importance and urgency of structural progress in these various dimensions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the performance of Jotun UAE in the past year?</h4><p><span></span>Our main accomplishment in the past year was our success to maintain our number one position in the market. We are also proud to have achieved this through growth in all the business segments where we are operating within, which includes decorative retail and projects, protective coatings, and marine. We have had a good year with several significant developments and achievements. Firstly, we have had a safe year without any fatalities or major incidents in our operations. On the environmental front, we have certified many of our coating systems into the new international green LEED standards. We have shown major strength both in decorative paints and marine products. Our breadth of operations ranges from painting individuals' beautiful homes to iconic and distinguished landmarks in the UAE including Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab. We also produce for deep sea vessels that pass-through Dubai and operate all over the world, as well as for the local smaller-sized vessels. So, we can also say that our marine products cater to the need s of the private elite yachts as well as to the needs of the large oil tankers. Moreover, Jotun protects numerous steel structures from fire and corrosion though its state of the art protective assortment. This defines the quality of our paint and coatings and further exemplifies our capability to supply projects of such a size and scale. It is not only about the paint, but the whole team involved; right from the technical department, to sales, aftersales, customer service and efficient production. </p><h4>What is the relevance of Dubai for Jotun's operations internationally?</h4><p><span></span>Although geographically the size that we cover is not that large, Dubai is a vital location in our global operations. In Dubai, if we rely on the data and contracts signed and awarded at present, we see a positive future for at least the next two and a half years. When we look at our business in the UAE's construction and residential segments; we see both iconic, large, remarkable projects that achieve great volume as well as very strong brand awareness among individuals and home owners. For the operations, Dubai is the biggest production hub that supplies to merging countries in MEIA. That's because of not only the production capacity of our plant in Dubai, but also because of the advanced logistics in Dubai that make our operations smooth and efficient. Another driver for growth in Jotun in general is to be a leader in innovation. This goes along Dubai vision towards being the most innovative cist in the world. This vision reflects a lot on our boldness in launching innovative products, global and regional concepts and processes. Innovation has sustained our growth and position for the last 25 years. For example, we have a full training and development concept for the retail segment which ensures an excellent shopping experience for end users at our stores. When it comes to products, one year ago we launched Fenomastic Wonderwall, a long lasting, high-quality paint that gives a smooth surface and is easy to apply that generated 1 million liters in first year of launch. In May, we launched ColourDesign; a mobile application that simplifies the process of colour matching for interior, as well as exterior walls. Jotun has three R&amp;D hubs; Norway, Malaysia, and Dubai. Considering the unique climate trends in Dubai, we have a full R&amp;D setup here to develop concepts and products adapted to this region. Dubai is more than a sales office located in a country; it is a regional hub for Jotun.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p><span></span>Our main objectives are to keep growing our business profitably, assure the best purchase experience for our customers, keeping up with innovations and make our operations greener and safer for our employees and stakeholders. So, my expectations are very positive for Jotun performance in the UAE. To conclude, one of our key strengths is that we have been established in the UAE for 41 years. Being in Dubai for this length of time has proven to be a great success for Jotun and has given us a competitive edge among our customers and over our competitors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Aiming for 50% market share]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[lekan-asuni-ceo-lefas-pharmaceuticals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You worked at GSK for many years. What drove you to establish your own company?</h4><p><span></span>I decided to operate outside of the multinationals space as I saw a number of opportunities beyond what multinationals consider priority in this clime at this moment. My partner and I decided to come together to fill some of those gaps. There are massive gaps in the pharmaceutical industry in capacity, local manufacturing capabilities, the types of products being locally manufactured, and even in the human capability. It was time to try to put my expertise beyond multinational companies to see how it could benefit the entire industry. We are currently looking at pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and vaccines. These are the three categories that we are playing in, and we are looking into how we can enter those areas.</p><h4>What ambitions do you have about expanding beyond the Nigerian borders?</h4><p><span></span>We are into cardio metabolic, which is related to things like diabetes. We have positioned it to go beyond the shores of Nigeria. Nigeria today accounts for close to 25% of the population in Sub Saharan Africa. Therefore, if we have a business proposition that can be successful in Nigeria, it is easier to increase our capacity and serve other African countries. For some of these projects Nigeria will serve as a hub for Africa.</p><h4>What contribution do you want to play in the sector in Nigeria?</h4><p><span></span>We want to significantly improve the country's health through a culture of self monitoring. Less than 20% of those with chronic conditions today are embedded in the culture of personally monitoring their situations. We intend to raise significant awareness about people taking control, so it is not only about the manufacturing of the products but also about ensuring that there is awareness to drive patients to take control. We want to ensure they have access because we will bring affordable access to these quality  products. We want to ensure that we increase the pool of professionals who are knowledgeable enough to manage those conditions because if we only leave it to the specialists, the situation will be worse. The ratio of specialists to those with chronic conditions is extremely large, and we need to increase the pool of those who are not specialists but general practitioners and so on who will be involved in the management of those chronic conditions and are able to take decisions so that patients can get better care.</p><h4>How does a local pharmaceutical company compete with the multinational drug providers in Nigeria?</h4><p><span></span>One thing that is clear that we want to drive access but not compromise on quality. What we are trying to do with that space is ensure that we go for the highest GMP standards from the onset so that everything is done from a civil point of view and equipment, as we are here to achieve the highest possible GMP certification. The highest is US FDA, and we ensure we reach US FDA certification. However, beyond that, pricing is based on volume; therefore, we intend to use the model that we have done thus far to target volume that will enable us to have a great marginal cost. This will translate to affordable prices for patients. We will leverage the scale based on our forecast to ensure that these quality products are affordable to consumers.</p><h4>Are you already producing within Nigeria?</h4><p><span></span>We have not started production so far. The groundbreaking ceremony will take place later in 2018, and the entire construction will take roughly 10 months. Currently, one of the investors in the business is a market leader in the distribution of products, so we have existing commercial infrastructure to leverage and data to allow the scale that we seek to achieve when manufacturing goes live. We currently have 10% market share and aim aiming to move it to 45-50%.</p><h4>What are the peculiarities of Nigeria when it comes to R&amp;D, pharmaceutical products, and consumer trends?</h4><p><span></span>On the R&amp;D side, the big multinationals are focused on problems that affect developed countries, where affordability is not an issue. Therefore, for R&amp;D, what is peculiar here is not the problem; in the case of Ebola, for instance, if it were not for the previous Ebola outbreak, we would not have been able to develop testing cases or vaccines, though this was small compared to international agencies that funded some of those companies. If we want to address local problems, then it is first necessary to ensure that our technical partner understands some of the local problems or local diseases that may be referred to as rare diseases and motivate them to see that there are big opportunities in that area. This has been weak in the past, because most players in Nigeria play in the distribution space and are just marketing companies; however, if a manufacturer has a long-term view of how to address the local peculiarities, then it is able to set aside part of its profit for R&amp;D. There is no local R&amp;D culture in Nigeria, and if we are able to seize the opportunity and get the right partners, the returns can be enormous. Second, in Nigeria there is not enough data that is crucial to making investment decisions. What we see in Lagos is completely different from what we see in the other cities and in the north, based on the quality of healthcare system and intricate differences as it is easier for people working in the environment to fully connect those dots and make things happen quickly. Third, in Nigeria one has to adapt as it can be difficult to operate, so a strong strategic plan and an almost weekly and daily scenario are needed as one goes into execution. Almost every day things tend not to go as planned if one does not address and mitigate issues with the strategic plan it has in place. To be successful, one needs to be strong strategically and operationally.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p><span></span>2019 will be a year when big things can happen. This will be through our special purpose investment vehicles, which we will ensure become a reality. For us, the motivation is not the return on investment; we want to prove the point that some things can be done differently within the healthcare and pharmaceutical space within Nigeria and Africa. Three production projects will come to effect. If we want to travel 1,000 miles we need to start with the first three steps with the end goal in mind. We want to ensure that we tie into the government's vision of making Nigeria self-sufficient, which we will do in terms of medicine production, and we have a clear roadmap toward this goal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important source markets for Frasers Hospitality?</h4><p>Our properties in the Middle East see a significant amount of business come from within the region, but with Dubai becoming a key destination for visitors from India and China, we are starting to see more guests from these source markets. Our growing presence in China has also resulted in increased interest from Chinese travelers who want to stay at our properties when they come to the Middle East. Aside from guests from these countries, our Middle East properties have a loyal base of customers from source markets such as Great Britain and the United States, demonstrating that our accommodation is recognized globally and meets the needs of travelers from across the globe. This has contributed to the success of our current properties in Bahrain, Doha and Dubai, which are enjoying average occupancy of over 85%. In fact, our presence in the region has boosted business from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to our properties in continental Europe and United Kingdom as well.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what will be your main objectives?</h4><p>Fraser Suites Dubai continues to be a strong performer not only within the brand but also among its competitive set. We are greatly encouraged by Dubai's achievements and we want to be a part of Dubai's growth story. It is also timely for us to scale up in the Middle East as the region has been a key contributor to our overall growth. The recent opening of Fraser Suites Riyadh and soon-to-open Fraser Suites Muscat (August 2018) join existing properties Fraser Suites Seef, Bahrain, Fraser Suites Diplomatic Area Bahrain, Fraser Suites Doha, Fraser Suites West Bay, Doha and Fraser Suites Dubai. We are planning to double the number of properties we have in the Middle East over the next few years, with openings in Dubai, Kuwait, Al Khobar and Jeddah. These will be great additions to our Middle East portfolio and give us an opportunity to introduce some of our other brands to the region. Our objective will be to continue to fulfil the needs of guests and create memorable experiences through providing the intuitive service that Frasers Hospitality is renowned for. We are also committed to maximizing returns for our owners and partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[20 million visitors by 2020]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[issam-kazim-ceo-dubai-corporation-tourism-commerce-marketing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well is Dubai on track to reach the target of 20 million visitors by 2020?</h4><p>Despite a challenging year for the global travel industry, Dubai has seen significant growth. In fact, in 2017 our growth rate was 6.2%, reaching 15.8 million visitors, and we welcomed 4.7 million tourists in the first quarter of 2018 with a 2% increase in traffic, so we are well on our way to achieving our target of 20 million visitors annually by 2020. We are now present in 41 countries and are actively interacting with people who engage with Dubai content, especially since we own and manage over 100 social media channels and drive engagement in over 20 languages. Our target is to not only increase the number of visitors, but also the length of their stays. People might perceive Dubai as a two or three-day destination because they are only aware of a small layer of what Dubai has to offer. Lately, we have been focusing on making sure people realize the depth of the options and opportunities to explore the city — looking beyond landmarks that most people are familiar with by highlighting new attractions and experiences across diverse areas including history and heritage, and cultural spots related to arts and fashion. Dubai has always been a trendsetter in the region when it comes to fashion and retail, and we have amplified that in our marketing communications. Another key factor that we are taking advantage of, is the easing of visa regulations. Dubai currently offers visas on arrival for citizens of 50 different nationalities including nationals of Russia and China, two of our main source markets. Further, the UAE has extended visas-on-arrival to Indian nationals with a valid American visa or Green Card, which should encourage even more visitors from India to choose Dubai. For the effective implementation of our tourism strategy we work hand in hand with our private and public sector partners. New route launches by our home-grown airlines, Emirates and flydubai are leading the way to help boost visitor numbers while we are also continuing to work closely with our public and private sector stakeholders, specifically in the hotel, retail and events sectors to further enhance Dubai's value offerings to encourage more people to visit the emirate.</p><h4>What are the main source markets for visitors to Dubai?</h4><p>Our top source markets for the first few months of 2018 are India, Saudi Arabia, the UK, China, Russia, Oman, Germany and the USA. In 2017, India was our top source market, breaking the two million mark, whilst China was our fifth source market, though it was barely in the top 10 when our strategy was set out. Other GCC countries and the US and Germany are equally important, as well as Russia, a new source market that continues to show impressive growth and the UK has remained consistently in our top three markets for several years. We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to keep up the momentum and ensure an increase in tourist arrivals to achieve our strategic goal by 2020. We have continued to look beyond our six or seven traditional key source markets, to ensure we are always present in multiple markets, both traditional and emerging where we see significant growth potential, in this way we are able to protect ourselves from socio-economic factors that may impact visitor numbers from any particular market by making up the numbers elsewhere.</p><h4>What are the key trends that Dubai's tourism and hospitality sector needs to address to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>The quality of hotels, rooms, and facilities in Dubai are second to none. The same goes for the level of service and staff friendliness. The next level would be to have them even more thoroughly trained about what the city has to offer. The personalized approach to help tourists discover Dubai is the best and easiest way to keep visitors engaged and interested in the destination. This goes not only for the hotel space, but also for retail. If tourists receive a sincere and personalized experience, this will reflect across the city and will result in repeated visitation. Dubai Tourism has taken the lead in empowering staff with such knowledge with the 'Dubai Way' initiative launched by our Dubai College of Tourism. This is a training program designed to give tourist-facing staff such as those employed at hotels, airlines, airports, malls, transportation systems and theme parks the opportunity to expand their knowledge of the emirate and its tourism industry as well as improving their guest relations and service skills. However, the entire city of Dubai has a role to play in this regard. We would like everyone who choses Dubai to be home to be advocates of the city.</p><h4>How do you forecast the impact of Expo 2020 on tourism in Dubai?    </h4><p>Expo 2020 is a landmark event for Dubai, and especially for our tourism industry as it opens up many opportunities, both in terms of investment and infrastructure development and promoting the city to thousands of new visitors. The fact that Dubai was awarded Expo 2020 is also a reflection of Dubai's capability to host mega events. From a tourism perspective it shows that Dubai has all the basic necessities and world-class infrastructure that are so crucial to ensuring the success of a tourism destination. When we talk about the Expo, people will start to focus on what Dubai has to offer, and then we can start checking all the boxes: Dubai has earned itself an international reputation as a 'must-visit' tourist destination for the diversity of value offerings and experiences that tourists are able to enjoy; the emirate's strategic geographic location on the crossroads of East and West, providing accessibility to two-thirds of the world's population within a flight time of eight hours; excellent air connectivity from Dubai International Airport, the world's No. 1 airport for international passengers, and simplified immigration procedures;  Dubai International Airport, which is the home base of Dubai's international airlines, Emirates and flydubai, facilitates a vast network of airlines that together operate flights to over 240 international destinations. Further, as the fourth most popular destination in the world on the MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index, Expo 2020 also helps us highlight Dubai's quality facilities and amenities. Tourists have a variety of accommodation choices in over 680 hotels that are equipped with over 100,000 rooms, from budget hotels to luxury resorts, as well as the opportunity to go on a unique shopping journey at the many malls and souks and select from a multitude of dining, leisure, and entertainment options for families and children.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[4-5% growth expected in 2018]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[syed-mohammed-asad-zaidi-general-manager-ramada-chelsea-hotel-al-barsha]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the last year been for the Ramada Chelsea?</h4><p>In 2016-2017 we have increased occupancy by 4%, which is a remarkable achievement. Our market share has also increased despite many new hotels opening in the locality. We saw great growth in 2017 and expect to grow by 4-5% again in 2018. There is a big rise in tourism in general due to certain decisions by the government and Dubai tourism, such as visas on arrival for Russian and Chinese visitors. The Dubai brand is doing extremely well and the government has been focused on tourism, which is the backbone of Dubai. It arranges platforms for all hoteliers to come together and discuss how we can promote Dubai all over the world. The Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) plays a vital role in promoting the Dubai brand and brings us around the world where we promote Dubai and our hotels as a brand. We invite people to come to Dubai and experience and explore Dubai.</p><h4>What are your current guest demographics?</h4><p>Our main demographics are tourists from Europe, especially Germany, Austria, and France, as well as the GCC and China. In the last few years, the number of Chinese guests has been growing, which is beneficial to our business. They are attracted to the budget rates that we provide in summer. In the long term, eastern Asia will likely stay the same, though other markets like Vietnam and Indonesia are developing. There is a great deal of activity in Malaysia as well. Expo 2020 is the big event that we are waiting for and looking forward to. 65-70% of our guests come to explore Dubai as a tourist, 20-25% are business travelers, while 5% are from walk-ins or retail from the market. Being close to the Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City helps us with corporate travelers.</p><h4>Is there a gap in middle-income tourism?</h4><p>In recent years Dubai has been a different market. In winter we see a larger number of travelers from Europe and the US. Middle-income travelers typically come in the summer because the rates go down 25-30%, which is when there is a great deal of activity from Asia and the Far East. In August and September 2017 we were able to retain 90-92% occupancy. This is why Dubai maintains great occupancy rates all-year round. The business is there but hotels have to put the right strategy in place at the right time to meet its targets. Dubai is a cutthroat market that is extremely competitive.</p><h4>How does your location benefit tourists?</h4><p>Our biggest advantage is the Mall of Emirates, which is just a 10-minute walk from the hotel. When we started, we were the fifth hotel to open in the Al Barsha area, while now there are over 70 hotels. This is a shopping hub, which helps significantly. We have 299 rooms in the hotel and our food and beverage options are exemplary. We have different outlets that cater to Chinese food, Arab food, a European pub, and an Indian restaurant. All these are also an attraction in getting tourists to come to our hotel. Wyndham as a brand is one of the largest chains in the world with around 9,000 hotels. The brand image plays a major role and brings people into our rooms.</p><h4>Is there a move toward Emiratization and local branches?</h4><p>There are many local companies that have started; however, a local brand does not give guests the standards that a global brand does. The DTCM has set up certain standards that we must have been audited for every year before we get our license renewed. All those standards maintain the particular standard. Dubai is extremely particular and this helps significantly in making sure people come to Dubai, have a wonderful experience, and act as ambassadors for the Emirate.</p><h4>What trends in the hospitality sector will define the coming period?</h4><p>Competition will grow significantly in the future. We expect many hotels to open in the run up to Expo 2020. Competition is always great; it makes you realize where you stand and what you need to do to stay relevant. Demand will change in the coming future and the strategies will have to change accordingly. It will definitely be a challenge. Dubai is growing and expanding rapidly and there will be many new things to see and experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In operation since 1998]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mario-jorge-silva-ceo-ricardo-silva-head-of-operations-of-tintex-textiles]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the competitive advantages that Tintex leverages in order to succeed?</h4><p>RICARDO SILVA: In 1998, TINTEX began its journey as a respected expert in the highest quality levels of dyeing and finishing techniques, which became the key asset and differentiating factor when these skills were blended into making smart, high quality and natural based, responsible jersey fabrics. With ecology and sustainability concerns front and centre of the TINTEX strategy, the company grew to become an industry leader and true master of all aspects of its textile heritage. By using the latest and best, sustainable hi-tech processes and inventing extraordinary new approaches for dyeing and finishing, TINTEX has reinforced its advanced vision to better supply the contemporary fashion, sports and lingerie markets. We create platforms that brands and our customers can utilize in the best way to transfer the message to the modern consumer.</p><h4>How do you ensure the transfer of latest skills in the textile industry?</h4><p>RS: To keep up with the latest technologies we always need to be at the forefront around the world and not just in Portugal. We source knowledge globally, looking for new technologies, processes and materials to learn what is new and to promote partnerships with other companies. That is our best strength currently because these companies believe in what we do, and together we create a better response for the market. With the knowledge from our partners we can transfer this expertise internally to our different teams in sales, production, and R&amp;D. Tintex is committed to a continuous program of sustainable innovations and refinements throughout the processing, production and supply of better-made, nature based textiles. All this brought a 70% improvement in terms of environmental impact for all its resources, production, and processing.</p><h4>What impact do your R&amp;D investments have on being a best-in-class manufacturer of high-end jersey fabrics to climb up the value chain?</h4><p>RS: Since the beginning, we have invested EUR26 million in total, with EUR7 million invested in the last three years alone. We are investing increasingly in the latest technologies. Our marketing activities focus on creating new materials and platforms to convey the message. We need to invest in all sectors in order to remain at the forefront of creating new trends. We do not follow trends, nor do we manufacture; rather, we create and innovate in Portugal. Unless we continue to invest steadily, there will come a time when our growth will stall. However, we have been innovating and developing since the very beginning and will continue to do so.</p><p>MÁRIO JORGE SILVA: We started innovating with Tencel and are the leaders in developing Tencel fabrics since 2002. Later, we evolved to polylactide (PLA) and other sustainable fabrics. Recently it was created a Textile Cluster in Portugal with several special interest groups (SIG), and we are proud to say that our sustainability manager, Ana Silva, is responsible for the coordination of the Sustainability Area. Last season we proudly announced our complete switch from the use of conventional cotton and the concomitant launch of a new fabric range that is the highest expression of the new generation of cotton: Naturally Advanced Cotton by TINTEX. This new amazing range is able to offer an advanced smart choice of three different premium and responsible advanced cotton solutions such as ECOTEC® by Marchi &amp; Fildi, GOTS certified organic cotton and Supima. In addition to this, we announced the membership with Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) a not-for-profit organisation that exists to make global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in and better for the sector's future.</p><h4>How does Tintex guarantee environmentally sustainable textile production to match contemporary consumers' needs and cooperate with institutions in the textile cluster?</h4><p>RS: Millennials, new consumers, and the next generations want to have the most information possible on the products they are buying. They no longer buy just on price, but on the story. For that, we need to be fully traceable and transparent, which is one of the key aspects of sustainability. In addition, the environmental impact needs to be as low as possible, and we need to communicate this. That is why sustainability combines traceability with low environmental impact. Tintex has a sustainability manager, and we form partnerships with trusted suppliers. We can ensure the traceability back to the fibers throughout the supply chain to have full traceability. Trust is the most important thing, and we have earned the trust of our partners and customers. This way, we can have sustainable growth boosting our reputation and corporate identity. The growth in the business is always increasing. We no longer just sell more; we create base layers for sustainable growth using excellent aesthetics and low environmental impact.</p><h4>How do you see companies like Tintex contributing to moving the sector forward?</h4><p>RS: Two decades ago, Portugal was just a manufacturing country and, when the global industry moved into Asia and other areas, Portugal needed to evolve to differentiate from the market in order to adapt quickly. We understood that we needed to innovate to create different approaches to not only the product, but also the strategy and the service side. Today Portugal is an innovative country not just on the product side but on the service side as well. Our flexibility enables us to create innovative materials and technologies that suits contemporary consumers' needs. It is not easy to do; however, we adapt quickly and can be flexible with new products and business models as well. That is why the digitalization allows us to reduce lead times by 15-30% and why general and modern fashion is coming back to Europe, especially to Portugal. In the last year that is the big change we have seen in our customers around the world. They want to do everything in Portugal, including materials and manufacturing because of our great flexibility. They trust us and the quality of what we manufacture, resulting in our partners delivering the best garments at a competitive price.</p><p>MS: There is also a new generation of young people with excellent education. In a company like ours, we mix 10-12 different areas to bring new approaches and fresh ideas to help develop the concepts because it is always about differentiation. Moreover TINTEX Textiles is proud to activate change industry wide by taking part in the Make Fashion Circular initiative by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This initiative aims to collaborate and innovate towards a new textiles economy, based on the principles of a circular economy. Ellen MacArthur Foundation core partners, Burberry; Gap Inc.; H&amp;M; HSBC, NIKE, Inc.; and Stella McCartney will work with the foundation to radically redesign the fashion industry. The initiative is made possible with the support of C&amp;A Foundation and Walmart Foundation.</p><h4>What are some of the markets or subsectors within the textile industry internationally that represent the best prospects for growth for Tintex going forward?</h4><p>RS: Today labels look for high quality at 360°, meaning contemporary design, innovation and sustainability. We are the right partner for them to offer the above values both through basic and seasonal articles. In addition to this, we do not see ourselves just as suppliers but really as partners. We create a direct conversation with brands in order to offer articles that fits their needs within our collection. A clear example is Filipppa K, a leading Nordic fashion brand with a modern, smart approach to the responsible development of their lines, with whom we create also a joint communication in 2017. Indeed, some of their emblematic pieces: the Flowy Jersey Dress Spice and the Flowy Maxi Skirt Spice were both mindfully made from sustainable Lyocell by Tintex. Now, we need to adapt and be ready for the next five to 10 years without neglecting any segment. We had pure fashion, pure sport, and pure lingerie, and today we see a blend of the three. It is amazing to see this blend creating together different materials, diverse approaches to the market, and different brands growing in such a short time. The textile industry is amazing because of the way it constantly changes.</p><h4>What would you say to people looking to do business with Tintex in Portugal's textile sector?</h4><p>RS: Tintex is on its journey to be the leading company in terms of responsible innovation. This is a broad message that can be translated into the pillars of traceability and trust. We need to innovate on the materials side and always be visible to everyone. That is why we invite everyone to come and see with their own eyes our work. Fashion and textiles are about colors, image, perception, and feeling. The feeling is one of our top criteria when creating materials. We always create the best hand feel for everyone, and that is what we are acknowledged for today.</p><p>MS: We have exceeded all the expectations of our customers with our potential and our ability to develop together and surprise customers with our technology and our creativity. The TINTEX vision is to build a new generation textile business that truly delivers an eco-sustainable strategy for all its production and fabric innovations through dedicated investments in technology, assets and skilled teams of specialist staff.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yesser has been in existence for some time, though it has received a reformed mandate and new leadership. What are your ambitions for change?</h4><p>Yesser has an important mandate in the digital transformation. One of the pillars of the digital transformation is digital government, and we are currently moving from e-government to digital government. We are building an entire digital ecosystem that goes beyond the simple electronic access of past years. We will focus on three things: increasing the number of digital services delivered by the government to citizens and their integration; pushing, motivating, and enabling government agencies to use shared IT platforms such as data centers of financial platforms; and building standards, measurements, practices, and architecture to deploy IT in the government within the enterprise architecture office. We will set up a national office that governs IT deployment in government entities and also provides standards, measurements, practices, and architecture. The value of this is to align each agency with a strategy. In the past IT spending was led by technology, which caused a great deal of waste in spending and parallel implementations since it was not in line with a strategy. For this last goal, we have three important KPIs. Number one is the UN's e-government ranking where we scored number 44 in 2016; by 2020, we should be ranked no lower than 30. Number two is open data, which we will focus on significantly. We have a second version of our open data platform coming in 2018 that will be extremely smart and intelligent. We are working with the government to publish no less than 200 data sets on the platform in 2018 to improve our ranking from 74 to 69 in the open data parameter. The third KPI is making wise spending in the IT deployment in the government; by 2020 we seek to save no less than 20% on IT spending.</p><h4>What approach will Yesser take and what authority does it have within the government to impose comprehensive strategies?</h4><p>To be successful, digital government needs to be led by all, and in the past there was no central authority for this effort. Our strategy has been to work with the entire government. We will sit down with all of the ministries and create digital strategies. Additionally, Yesser now reports directly to the National Digitization Committee, this committee is headed by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and has members from all major ministries. This change and new structure will drive transformation within 2018 and beyond.</p><h4>How does your focus on citizens influence how you carry out operations?</h4><p>Ten years ago, we used to do e-government as electronic transactions, which are limited in scope. Digital government is about human touch and caring about the 360 values around it. It is about talent, development, user experience, and digital experience. Our target, for example, is not to go to a paperless government but complete digital experience that can truly satisfy citizens' needs. We have an ecosystem called e-Murasalat that is an e-correspondence system. We seek to eliminate paper communication within and between government bodies. The new system is a highly secured, automated, and electronic system that will serve government agencies as well external communication. Our target by 2020 is to have more than 160 agencies using it, leaving us with 85% paperless government. Citizens do not care about letters being sent from ministry to ministry; however, they care about all the ministries working together because this means faster, better service. The e-services that help citizens today are because of the backend system, and whatever we do has to touch the citizen.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve within the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are focusing on the KPIs of the UN ranking, open data, and wise spending in IT. In terms of our initiatives in 2018 that will help us move up the ranking, number one is the unified portal saudi.gov, which is one of our most important initiatives in the program. We currently have dozens of platforms, which are not citizen centric because they are lost among all these platforms and do not know which one to go to. Saudi.gov is the national platform, when all citizen transaction with government will start and end in one consolidate view that guarantees seamless and remarkable experience to the citizen. Our target this year is to revamp Saudi.gov.sa and implement the first waves of the 100 most needed government services. Number two is the e-Murasalat ecosystem. Our target this year is to have 50 agencies participating and using the platform, which is monitored by the National Digitization Committee. Number three is the national government resource planning (GRP), the national enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for the government that is its backbone and will manage HR practices, finance, procurement, and supply chain. In 2018, our mandate is to fix the national GRP HR system module for more than 25 agencies. The value of this is that it is a single place for records, information, employees, and finance. Every entity currently has its own ERP systems that need to be connected centrally so that the duplications and accuracy are controlled according to the regulations and reports.</p><h4>Recently, you have signed a number of agreements both nationally and internationally, could you share with us the nature of these agreements? </h4><p>The E-Government Program (Yesser) and the National Information Society Agency (NIA) of South Korea have signed a cooperation agreement that aims for full cooperation between the two sides and for providing support for Yesser Program in all the fields of National Enterprise Architecture and ICT investment governance. In addition, it aims at sharing research findings and studies and exchanging expertise in the field of digital government. This agreement also includes cooperation in building and enhancing the national capacities via customized training programs that will be held in the National Academy of South Korea, seconding experts and specialists in the relevant areas, and transferring knowledge to support the operation of National Enterprise Architecture Platform. This agreement was followed by another agreement with the Government Digital Service in the United Kingdom. It aims to enhance the digital transformation journey in Saudi Arabia by increasing the efficiency of government services, building leadership capacity in the field of digital government, cooperating in a number of areas to develop the digital skills and capability in government, utilizing global expertise in the development of digital government services.  Moreover, it supports Yesser Program's orientations to build a digital academy and a government marketplace at Yesser. As for the national agreements of Yesser Program, they are the agreements that Yesser aims through them to provide its services to the government agencies. Recently, we signed an agreement with the Saudi Industrial Property Authority (Modon) to join and benefit from the Government Service Bus (GSB) and the E-Correspondence System (Murasalat), in addition to that we signed another agreement with Council of Saudi Chambers to provide its services on the Government Service Bus (GSB).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[67 Stores in Total]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmad-ar-bindawood-ceo-danubeco-ltd-bindawood-stores]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will you be expanding the number of BinDawood Group branches in the coming year?</h4><p>BinDawood Group expanded significantly in 2018. We have a total of 67 stores, and in the first five months of 2018, we have opened four stores with six more stores in the pipeline for the year. We will open an additional 10 stores in 2019 and eight are currently being planned for 2020. We have an aggressive growth plan, set three years ago. For three consecutive years, we have opened an average of 10 stores per year, and thus far, we are on target. All these are within the territory of Saudi Arabia, though we have explored opportunities in other regions, specifically, the UAE and Egypt.</p><h4>How do you collaborate with some of the world's largest brands in terms of knowing what to offer in your stores?</h4><p>Our approach with international markets in terms of sourcing items is based on the premise of seeking out long-term relationships with manufacturers. Quality is number one for us. In any country, we want to see the best it can produce. Each country or region specializes in certain items. We source from all over the world and have products from the US, Canada, different countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and even Australia. Most of our products are highly recognizable in their local markets. In terms of non-food products, the majority of what we sell is sourced from China, India, and Pakistan, especially textile. Again, we always work to control quality to ensure customer satisfaction.</p><h4>How is consumer behavior changing in Saudi Arabia and how are you adapting to that?</h4><p>In addition to changes brought about by Vision 2030, the country is going through socioeconomic changes as well. Shopping is changing, the demographics of the population is changing, and when it comes to imposing taxes or depending more on the local workforce and providing opportunities for youth, many of various factors of the sector are changing. One of the major changes we have seen recently is customers with more access to information. That has led us to change the way we do things in supermarkets in terms of sourcing and showing consumers exactly what they may be looking for. We recently launched a department selling food items for those with allergies. In addition, we are the largest seller of organic products in Saudi Arabia. We are also the first organic bakery in Saudi Arabia, with our license depicting that we are number one. We also recently added a superfood section that features products such as quinoa and chia seeds as well as all kinds of foods high in protein. We are heading toward a major transformation in terms of online shopping as well.</p><h4>In what ways are you implementing e-commerce strategies?</h4><p>We decided to go online around 2015. However, it took around one year of planning to build our platform in terms of data warehousing and the application itself. It started as a website, though it has since evolved into an app. Now, a major portion of our transactions take place on the Danube app. That is why we have a separate entity to bring our brands online that focuses; that company deals only with the online side of our business, and the team that works there is completely separate from the supermarket. It makes decisions on an analytical basis. We also use different tools to approach our customers. It's been an extremely successful strategy so far. Today,  after one and a half years of online operations, the Danube app is the largest e-commerce grocery platform in the Middle East.</p><h4>How has the implementation of VAT changes impacted your business?</h4><p>VAT is one of the major changes the country is going through currently. However, we have been blessed with government support before and during its implementation. The timeframe was lenient and the support we received was extremely helpful. The government held seminars and other activities to help companies transition. Historically, even accounting classes here skipped the coursework involving taxes; therefore, all companies come from a starting point of little knowledge. Helping the country's businesses implement VAT was not an easy task. In fact, it was a very challenging at the beginning. The first impact was on businesses, where VAT forced us to change our accounting systems when working with suppliers. The second impact was on consumers; everyone expected prices to climb, and the perception was generally that they would pay more. Of course, that was not the case. In the first and second month, it was difficult for customers to absorb it, though now consumers are back on track and used to the VAT.</p><h4>What makes BinDawood different from other retail outlets in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Since we established our business, we have always focused on quality. BinDawood Group started as BinDawood, which acquired Danube over 17 years ago. Over the past 18 years, we grew the number of stores from four to 41, with an aggressive growth plan. BinDawood Group and the Danube name are synonymous with quality and providing the best service. Consumers who seek the best selection of products in terms of hygiene and storage standards need look no further. When we talk about sourcing the world for the best quality products, they can find that here as well. The biggest difference between BinDawood and our competitors is the shopping experience. We are completely different. Typically, stores have boxes, shelves, and normal products. We take it to the next level to give shoppers a unique experience. We make sure the experience is exceptional for every consumer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[khalid-al-muawad-ceo-midwam]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY: What was behind the creation of Midwam and what gap in the market were you filling? </p><p>When we started in 2012 we saw an excellent opportunity for people being capable of interacting with their digital content. In the earlier times, people were more passive; they gave their attention to the shared information whether it interests them or not. However, this changed when new technologies like smartphones came along; people lost interest in passive and static data, they lost their attention to them. Today, if you visited a museum, for example, there is often something to manipulate and interact with. That's when we decided to use this opportunity to introduce interactive technologies to the market such as virtual reality, holograms and augmented reality, which are advanced technologies that are all about interactivity and engaging users with different sectors to gain the attention of their target users. These interactive and immersive tools are used in the education sector to increase the attention levels of students, the industrial sector to obtain the focus of trainees, the marketing purposes to visualize content, or in the entertainment industry to intensify the experience. We saw the world move into the interactive era while things in Saudi Arabia were still idle. Midwam was one of the few companies that were lucky to have the support of several government entities that believe in this approach and this method of interactivity. We grabbed that opportunity to increase knowledge transfer and visualization communications by having individuals interact with things, and we have been leading the market since. </p><h4>Could you tell us some more about your training program?  </h4><p>Midwam is offering a learning program called Certified Interactive Application Development "CIAD" where we educate trainees how to develop AR, VR, and other interactive applications. And to accomplish this, we partnered with different companies such as; Eon Reality and Unity, to use their connections and expertise to perfect this program. We do not reinvent the wheel, we just take an approved curriculum worldwide, we practice it here, and then we take the pre-qualification to screen candidates and get the right ones into the program. We have instructors coming from US, UK, and other countries to deliver the program. And by the end of the day, the trainees want some recognition when they are done; this is where Dar Al Hekma University comes in as they certify this program for the trainees from their "Continuous Education Programs" by having a certificate on applying or creating interactive applications. Of course, we also provide them an international certificate from our international partners; meaning, they hold two certificates.<br></p><h4>How would you assess the maturity of the Saudi digital economy? </h4><p>The expenditure on IT is increasing because the government is taking a direction of digital transformation. When the government says that by 2030 we need to go into digital transformation and it will be in phases over five years, companies have to start digitizing their own entities and services. You can see this clearly in the digital transformation that was done in government sectors. In the past, you used to go to government sectors to issue an ID, a driving license, or a passport. But today, all of these requests are happening digitally. When the private sector sees this transformation of the way the government is providing their services, they will get encouraged to spend more on digitize their own business. Also, a big chunk of the IT investments that are going in is cybersecurity, and that's because they need to catch up with all of the cybersecurity that is happening around the world.</p><h4>What opportunities does the opening up of the entertainment sector create for you? </h4><p>Midwam creates infinite interactive experiences, meaning, the experience we provide is not limited to one sector; it is limited by your imagination. If you imagine that you would like to develop an experience within the entertainment sector, we can design something where your target audience can have fun and get excited using tools from the market like VR and AR who are playing a significant role in entertainment nowadays. We have created fascinating entertainment concepts; we have entertainment clients that are interested in activating and building those concepts. What differentiates us from others, is that we take under consideration the entire entertainment experience, and we don't limit ourselves to one specific game or idea, we help the visitor getting into that atmosphere and feel that they are in an interactive gaming environment. Disney Land, for example, manipulate your mind by the environment they create that you feel as if you were in a different world. All of that is done by the experience they have designed for you, and that is what we do too; we design experiences from the time you enter a space until the time you leave. Saudi Arabia announced the most advanced city in the world to be built so there is a lot of ambition that you can clearly see and sense in this country. Midwam would definitely like to take a leading role into all of that by supporting, visualizing and showcasing locally developed <br>interactive experiences and exporting them abroad.</p><h4>How important is the young generation for your operations?</h4><p>Saudi youth is paramount to our operations. We count on their creativity and the ambitions to create things. The level of Saudization in Midwam is about 80%, of which about 40% are female. We often hire the top graduates from our CIAD program ourselves. We are giving opportunities also to the Saudis and youth to enter the business world, and we are also teaching them how to be entrepreneurs in case they do not want to work for us and want to work for themselves. All of these factors are being supported by the 2030 Vision, and there are elements of the vision that are making all of this advancement happen. When you look at all government sectors right now compared to only five years ago, you will see that there is a massive difference between the individuals working there. The government believes 100% that the future is with our youth and this is what makes a substantial difference; the human capital within the entire operation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[320 employees in Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[junji-nagasaka-managing-director-chiyoda-almana]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major highlights of Chiyoda Almana during its 10-year history in Qatar?</h4><p>In 2009, we started the RasGas contract, our largest project in Qatar. We had a great deal of experience in terms of design work, and our experience led clients to choose us as their preferred partner. We perform maintenance and design services, as well as solving engineering issues. This is one of the most important highlights to date, though we also try to expand our project portfolio with engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) works. We try to focus on small projects because this is where we can add the most value and gain experience. Our office in the country has 320 employees, and if the market expands we plan to increase our footprint.</p><h4>Chiyoda was recently awarded the front-end engineering and design of the onshore facilities of the North Field Expansion (NFE) project; what does this mean for the company's operations in Qatar?</h4><p>We have strong expertise in engineering projects that will be needed for the development of the North Field, which is one of the reasons we were awarded the contract. At the moment, we are in the early engineering stages, and most of the items are being done directly by our parent company Chiyoda Corporation, and we provide support services. We have strong experience in site survey for the oil and gas industry. This will help Chiyoda Corporation to organize its engineering projects as effectively as possible. The most important factor behind our bid's success was our extensive experience in designing and executing on complex projects. We know how to organize and manage projects of this size and scale, and that positioned us perfectly in terms of winning the bid.</p><h4>What other projects is Chiyoda Almana currently working on?</h4><p>There are two major projects that are currently ongoing. One is the Helium 3 project, while the other is the Flare Reduction Project. These are the two major business lines for us in the country at the moment. The projects are currently in the construction phase, and the engineering is all completed.</p><h4>How does Chiyoda Almana help the local energy sector expand its business despite the blockade?</h4><p>The Helium 3 and Flare Reduction Project started before the blockade, and some of the materials such as steel, cable, and pipe can no longer be purchased from Saudi Arabia. However, we have many relationships with global suppliers in Asia, Europe, and the US and have been able to access many of the materials we need. Overall, there has not been a huge impact, and we are not greatly concerned about the blockade as a result of our alternative supply channels and relationships. We also have good communication with Asian suppliers because of our relationship with the Chiyoda head office in Yokohama.</p><h4>Competition in the Qatari contractor market is fierce. What values that set Chiyoda Almana apart?</h4><p>We have a sufficiently strong relationship as a result of our reputation as excellent engineers. Client satisfaction is important. Sometimes, clients prefer high-end engineering. That is why our global reach and extensive engineering allow us to cater to all the needs and wishes of clients. If the market is focused on engineering an issue, that is perfect for us because we are confident of our capability, we have a track record of more than 300 successful projects only in Qatar, and when clients make partnership decisions, it helps to see a demonstrated ability to execute projects.</p><h4>What is Chiyoda Almana's role in promoting the development of Qatar, especially taking into account the shift towards environmental sustainability?</h4><p>Chiyoda follows and supports all Qatari regulations as well as the country's vision for the future. We support clients in their efforts to assess and mitigate environmental impacts. We are interested in reducing our negative impact through projects that emphasize wastewater treatment. We have a well-established management system for safety, environment, and quality. Additionally, our internal quality team supports the company through extensive knowledge of ISO certificates and the country's various regulations. Most of our environmental assessments are conducted by our team in the country.</p><h4>Where will Chiyoda focus its efforts in the next 12 months?</h4><p>Over the next 12 months, the market will still be fairly tough. There are many markets in the country, and we are interested in expanding our activities to have an active presence in the market at different levels. We have organized a new business department that is currently trying find and develop new markets and businesses. We also try to support our mother company's technologies, because it has many technological applications across a number of areas. This is particularly important given the focus the Qatari government places on economic diversification across the country. We are also well known in Qatar for our extensive human resources development. We work in cooperation with our clients to provide technical training for Qatari engineers in our head office in Japan. We are extremely proud of these long-term programs as part of our business is dedicated to supporting the Qatari government's vision to expand its human resources via such programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[humaid-al-qatami-chairman-of-the-board-and-director-general-of-dubai-health-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will innovation and technological developments such as artificial intelligence play in the development of Dubai's healthcare sector? </h4><p>Innovation and technological developments will increasingly play a significant role to create a patient-centered health system. If we look at the role of 3D printing in healthcare, it has revolutionized the health industry. Today, thanks to 3D printed prosthetics, patients who are amputees have their lives transformed for the better as the prosthetics provide them with the maximum feeling of anatomical function. Similarly, doctors can perform complex surgeries with utmost precision using 3D printed models. Moreover, the technology is cost-effective, which makes it affordable across a wide spectrum of patients who need it. We, at the DHA, have seen these developments first-hand since we began using this technology nearly two years ago. We are working closely with the Dubai Future Foundation to bring to life the emirate's vision of harnessing modern technology to improve lives. In Artificial Intelligence (AI), we are working closely with world-class companies that are implementing AI in various fields to see how we can utilize these services in the healthcare landscape of Dubai. We are in the process of building an innovation center and we are working with the private sector to establish the most suitable model. Innovation cannot take place in isolation and thrives on collaboration; we are keen to work with innovators, healthcare entities, scientists, and researchers to improve healthcare outcomes and patient experience. </p><h4>What other healthcare trends do you foresee in the upcoming years?</h4><p>I foresee a rise in the UAE's population and a higher percentage of geriatric population, which means we need to create holistic services for the elderly and ensure sound capacity planning to meet the needs of an increasing population. I reckon there will be automated care at hospital set-ups due to emerging technologies, which will improve efficiency. At the same time, we can already see the emergence of precision medicine and personalized care especially as technology such as genetic testing becomes cost-effective. Improvements in healthcare fueled by technology will allow more accurate diagnostics, better data collection and integrated care. Patients will be empowered with knowledge due to smart technologies such as wearable devices that can track their fitness. They will be more engaged and knowledgeable in the management of their own health, enhancing preventive care measures. Employers will focus on wellness programs as health and wellness begins to take center stage. In the coming years, I anticipate a greater focus on outpatient care, preventive care, and precision medicine. A lot of care and follow-up currently done in hospitals and healthcare settings will move to home-care settings thanks to the emergence of telehealth. There will also be greater investment in the health sector in the coming years.</p><h4>What big projects are you working on in the immediate future?</h4><p>Some of the projects we are working on are focused on developing an oncology and cardiovascular center of excellence and establishing an innovation center.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the investment strategy that DHA recently launched? </h4><p>Our aim is to foster and promote investment in areas that lack services or in medical fields where there are opportunities for growth. Several countries have dedicated healthcare investment promotion agencies and it is a better and more efficient way to operate. An investment strategy helps prevent oversupply, leads to availability of health specialists across various disciplines, and fosters the growth and development of specialized health services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments of RTA that occurred in the last year?</h4><p>With the aid of the Dubai government, RTA is leading the transformation of the transport sector into the future. The ongoing expansion of roads and infrastructure projects in Dubai include landmark developments such as the Airport Roads Project, which caters to the 92 million travelers expected to be served by Dubai International Airport by 2020, the Parallel Roads Project that will ease traffic in the area parallel to Sheikh Zayed Road to the east, and the construction of Route 2020 worth AED10.6 billion which is an extension of 15km to the existing Red Line route. In addition, RTA has set strategies to shape the future of transport with the Dubai Self-Driving Strategy, which aims to achieve at least 25% of all trips in Dubai through self-driving transport by 2030. The Dubai Self-Driving Strategy is unique and is the most comprehensive of its kind in the world, as it does not only focus on private vehicles but also targets seven public transport modes. RTA is currently studying and piloting several futuristic modes with global firms, such as the hyperloop, self-driving bus rapid transit (BRT), self-driving transport pods, and automated aerial taxis. Another important accomplishment is the Enterprise Command and Control Centre (EC3), which was inaugurated by HH Sheikh Mohammed in May 2017. It is the largest and most sophisticated facility of its kind. Known as the 'Nerve Center of Dubai,' it links all of RTA's different transport control centers into an integrated central platform, which will also play an important role in managing transport for the upcoming Expo 2020. RTA has recently also approved the RTA Digital Strategy, focusing on innovative technology solutions tailored for users. We already started the smart mobility transformation and have implemented a number of future modes that have made transportation in Dubai smarter and cleaner. We have the largest public Tesla fleet in the world, consisting of 200 electric airport limos. Moreover, we have implemented a number of smart solutions, such as smart car rentals, smart bus shelters, smart yard testing, and virtual reality training for new drivers. We currently have over 173 smart services that have reduced the number of customer visits by more than 50% in the past two years.</p><h4>What benefits can self-driving vehicles bring to Dubai? </h4><p>RTA is currently working on many projects to achieve the goal of having at least 25% of all trips in Dubai in self-driving mode by 2030. Examples of these are the connectivity framework, testing procedures, and the legislation framework. As a vital part of the success of our strategy, we already signed MoUs and partnerships with multiple international firms and research universities, such as Daimler, Next Future Transport, Hyperloop, and Tesla. Through our strategy, we will realize both measurable and intangible benefits in Dubai by 2030. Based on our own international research and applying it to our local environment, we expect to achieve environmental improvements, with a 12% reduction in our carbon footprint. Moreover, we expect a 44% reduction in the cost of mobility, a 50% reduction in parking requirements, and at least a 12% reduction in the number of accidents.</p><h4>How does RTA keep up with the rapid growth of Dubai and prevent traffic congestion? </h4><p>Cities need to have adequate regulations and technical tools that enable capturing the impact of urban and population growth on transportation systems. In dealing with increased travel demand, RTA has adopted an integrated planning framework that takes into consideration best international practices and focuses on the integration between the development and expansion of roads and mass transit infrastructure, the advancement of smart applications and systems, the application of travel demand management measures, and the attainment of higher levels of integration between different means of transport and land use. Based on this integrated planning framework, RTA has developed and implemented plans that include the development of a high-quality network of roads, bridges, and tunnels, which contributed to the UAE's top position in road quality between 2013-2016 according to the World Economic Forum.</p><h4>How does RTA contribute to Expo 2020?</h4><p>RTA has prepared an integrated plan for roads and transportation to prepare for a successful Expo. The plan includes solutions that address the matter of moving people to and from the exhibition location along with managing the movement within the exhibition. As one of the main goals of Expo 2020, sustainability was at the forefront while developing all plans. To ensure awareness and sustainability, the plan includes encouraging the use of public transportation whenever possible. It is expected that the public transportation share of trips made to and from Expo 2020 will be around 51%. The execution of this plan has already started, with the extension of the Red Line of the metro from the Nakheel Harbor &amp; Tower Station to the Expo 2020 location, which is progressing at the moment. The extension will contain seven stations, one of which will be dedicated to servicing the exhibition. The number of visitors using the metro is expected to reach around 12,000 passengers per hour in one direction. Furthermore, a number of bus stations will be provided in Dubai and other Emirates specifically to serve Expo 2020. In addition, there will be buses within the Expo site for internal movement. The plan also entails 30,000 parking places around the exhibition's location, with shuttle buses that will take visitors from the parking area to Expo 2020 location. On top of this, more than 2,900 taxis will be available for servicing the exhibition, with parking and facilities to support these vehicles within the Expo site. Also, a network of roads and interchanges with a total cost of over AED3.2 billion (USD871.21 million) is currently under development to provide flexibility in getting in and out of the exhibition. Many other RTA projects are being developed to help regulate transportation to and from the Expo site. These projects include a significant improvement of the Traffic Control Center via the ITS2020 program and the recently inaugurated Enterprise Command Control Center (EC3). The total cost of transportation infrastructure and services required to serve Expo 2020 is estimated to be more than AED15 billion (USD4.08 billion). These transportation systems and infrastructure will be utilized fully for the benefit of serving the urban development of Dubai after Expo 2020.</p><h4>What are RTA's main plans and objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>In the next few years, RTA will continue its journey leading the mobility sector and transforming Dubai into the smartest city in the world. We will concentrate on identifying and catering to emerging transport modes and trends and technologies in order to be one of the world's pioneers in shaping the future of transport. In addition, we will foster our cooperation with innovators and startups to continue testing, trialing, and deploying new trends, technologies, and modes. In this regard, we also work with Dubai Future Accelerators to launch partnership platforms that will make Dubai the global attraction of future transport modes. Another example is our recently launched Dubai Challenge for Self-Driving Transport, the largest international platform for companies and research centers to test and deploy different scenarios of self-driving technology in Dubai. We work closely with the government for projects serving the Dubai 10X initiative, as well as to establish the required regulations and legislations to facilitate the deployment of new and emerging transport modes, trends, and technologies. We also concentrate on safety, security, and privacy issues of such new modes. We will continue our efforts to optimize the efficiency of our mobility systems through initiating and launching different applications and further developing and expanding Dubai's road and public transport systems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2019 marks the 50th anniversary of ECG.

We have delivered the detail design of the energy centers for four of the major stadia including Al Rayyan, Al Wakrah, and Ras Abou Aboud. These energy centers secure the infrastructure requirements of district cooling, water, wastewater, irrigation, and electrical power. ECG also delivered the detail design of the World Cup training pitches to the latest requirements of the FIFA taking the strict FIFA's security and environmental requirements into consideration. This will be the earliest delivered project for the FIFA world cup.</p><h4>How do you assess your position in the market, and what are your main strengths and competitive advantages?</h4><p>ECG achieved business success through design excellence and leadership in the construction industry. We apply latest Quality systems in management, sustainability, HSE, and environment to the latest international standards (ISO and OHSAS).

The economy of Qatar was strong enough to show its resilience coming through this tough period to overcome all the difficulties specially anticipated shortage in construction materials and food items. The fact that the private sector reacted quickly and invested in major projects especially food security, was crucial. The Qatar Prime Material Company was able to find alternative suppliers for construction materials in a very short time, to ensure continuous material supply and prevent any delays in construction especially in the FIFA World Cup and the mega infrastructure related Projects. A huge factor in normalizing the situation was the government's major food security project in Hamad Port, which is now able to receive major deliveries and hold a strategic reserve of food. The crisis has bolstered Qatar; the country has become more self-reliant by enhancing domestic production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fouad-halawi-ceo-virgin-mobile-saudi-arabia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Virgin Mobile Saudi primarily targets the youth, which comprises nearly 50% of the Saudi population. What is your positioning in the market?</h4><p>From a demographic perspective, youth is certainly the primary target in Saudi. The mix is sufficient for Virgin Mobile Saudi to penetrate the market as we are right at the forefront of innovation, we are able to see where there is an issue and fix it. It is about making mobile better by providing a better service, and delivering our services to the customer at a fair price. In Saudi, there is a particularly strong need for good customer experience. The penetration rate for the mobile is dropping, but it is still a dynamic market because the demographic mix is changing. Therefore, our focus is shifting slightly, while the values remain consistent. We are still determined on targeting the youth by tailoring our products and services as per their needs and preferences. Virgin is an active, wild brand and this is what the youth like to see. Over 50% growth in Virgin Mobile KSA's revenue in 2017 despite the challenging market conditions has not only placed us at the forefront of the industry but has also made our competitors follow our footsteps.</p><h4>Virgin Mobile has found a niche in addressing its customers differently. What did you do?</h4><p>Virgin Mobile has entered new markets multiple times around the world, including the US, Australia, and Europe, where each environment is slightly different. When first addressing the Saudi team in January 2016, I told them we were going to change the industry perception of how to do business, and everybody is going to replicate what we are doing over the next two years. We are already starting to see that now. Our model is slightly more advanced in the way we engage with people and promote best practices. We are a place where well-being and happiness are essential.</p><h4>With the growing demand for data services, what challenges is Virgin facing in retaining customers and acquiring new ones?</h4><p>It is a classical evolution we have seen in mature markets. For example, back in 2014 in the US a mobile package came with unlimited data. That is a mature market, and that is what is happening in Saudi today. We are certainly seeing a huge shift here today from voice to data, credit goes to the positive changes in the regulatory environment. We are certainly putting a lot in favor of our customers at the moment because we believe disruption is not about gaining but giving. Gaining comes afterward. Fair competition is always healthy as it forces telecommunication companies to innovate, invest and put customers first. At Virgin Mobile we always try to stay at the forefront of innovation and disruption in order to make mobile better for our customers. This will mean that Saudi Vision 2030 can be achieved due to investments in technology, innovation, disruption and R&amp;D. That said, it is up to those who own the networks and the regulators to develop along with this technological transformation.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth at Virgin and in the sector in 2018?</h4><p>Where we are going next with technology is something that is on every leader's agenda today, including digitization. Very few people really understand what digitization means, what benefits it will bring to business, and how it is going to happen. People are slightly reserved on taking this step despite the fact that everyone wants to have digital assets. Businesses are wondering if it is cost saving, streamlining, rationalization, or some other benefit they are trying to achieve. And how is this going to be better and different for the customer? Not everyone is clear where they need to go next, while the Saudi regulator has now issued a public consultation process. They are promoting new innovations in the country, mainly IoT, which is great. Virgin Mobile has earned its place in Saudi, therefore, there is a lot of support to move forward and compete more.</p><h4>Do you think there will be a big competitive component in the future for both MVNOs and MNOs in premium services? </h4><p>Yes. And we are starting to see more acquisitions by the main telecom companies, which happened in other markets as well. In the future, you will see the competition moving into acquisitions of content providers to bring them in-house and bring the operator and content under one roof. The growth potential will come from smart cities, entertainment, and financial technology. There will be new market opportunities for B2B. This will include providing content, value-added services, digitization, and block-chain technology. There is a lot going on that could change the habits of what we do rapidly. Virgin Mobile is definitely going to digitize its assets in Saudi Arabia because we want to be first, this is how we do things.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gabriel-coimbra-group-vice-president-country-manager-idc-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the increasingly mobile and integrated position of IT amongst companies and individuals?</h4><p>IDC is a global research and advisory firm founded in 1964 with the goal of supporting the ICT industry. Since then, we have been helping ICT companies understand market trends and opportunities. As ICT has become more ubiquitous, our role has expanded and evolved, our goal today is to advise top organizations from every industry navigate in the Digital Transformation Era.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges companies here face in terms of maximizing efficiency through technology?</h4><p>There are many challenges for firms in Portugal and all over the world. The expansion of Digital Transformation at a macroeconomic scale signals a new, Digital Transformation (DX) economy. Enterprises must facilitate DX through their use of 3rd Platform technologies to create value and competitive advantage through new offerings, new business models, and new relationships. In order to achieve these goals, businesses should focus on using 3rd Platform tools to transform their decision making and experience delivery. In this context businesses need a thorough understanding of 3rd Platform technologies to capitalize on improved decision making and to deliver enhanced, customized experiences to stakeholders. The rapid acceleration of 3rd Platform technology adoption means that organizations need to actively be looking for ways to deliver transformation. IDC calls this new paradigm the third platform, and it is defined by the cloud, mobility, big data, and social technologies that are foundational elements of digital transformation in every company. In addition to these four pillars, we have innovation accelerators, which are technologies that are developed on top of these pillars. These include IoT, virtual reality, blockchain, robotics, and 3D printing, among others. All these technologies are now available for all companies, which need to understand how these technologies can help their business processes, create better experiences for their clients and customers, and create new products and services. They must embrace innovation-accelerating technologies in order to remain competitive in the digital economy. They also need to change their culture and their internal processes.</p><h4>How can IDC help investors in Portugal make the right technology decisions?</h4><p>IDC helps ICT companies understand market trends and opportunities. For other sectors, such as banking, retail, manufacturing, and public administration, we help them navigate in the Digital Transformation Era with a portfolio of decision making methodologies that enable you to make more informed strategic decisions, understanding technological trends, business requirements, and technology options.</p><h4>What steps does IDC take to better leverage big data analytics?</h4><p>IDC is a data-centric research company. We crunch a great deal of data on IT and digital markets and analyze this data using advanced techniques such as machine learning and advanced statistics to understand trends in technology and build test models to help companies understand how technology changes the entire economy. We also advise companies how to monetize data, build information architecture, security and privacy strategies, as well as new business strategies around data.</p><h4>What challenges do you face when it comes to recruiting analysts?</h4><p>As a global company, we have recruited more than 10 Portuguese analysts and data scientists in the last five years. We currently have 1,100 analysts and many Portuguese employees working outside Portugal. We have some of the very best Portuguese talent working with us. On the other hand, Portugal is losing many of its best people to other markets. In this context we have been working with government institutions and private and public universities to better understand how Portugal can create an environment that appeals to the best people in Portugal, inviting in the education system, retraining unemployed workers, and also create an strategy for bringing talent from other countries. In the last 10 years, France, Germany, Canada, US and many other countries have imported Portuguese talent, and we want to entice them back home and bring others with them.</p><h4>What policies need to be addressed to attract more investment in technology and knowledge-intensive industries?</h4><p>We have made excellent progress in the last five years, though there is still more work to be done. Other countries are doing more to develop their ICT and digital ecosystems, and we need to make sure we do more to compete in this long run. In my opinion People (not technology) is key in this long run, inviting in the education system, retraining unemployed workers, and also create an strategy for bringing  talent from other countries. In fact, I believe that the key aspects is how we can create a strategy to import new talent. We also need to make sure that our Government is also able to lead the digital transformation in Portugal. Our Government need to invest more to enact an effective digital transformation in the public sector and induce transformation in the economy and society in general. And of course, we need to have leading Digital Transformation examples and structured ecosystems in our key industries (Tourism, Textiles Manufacturing, Education, and Health just to mention four that in my opinion are key for our economy and competitive position globally).</p><h4>What are your expectations for Portugal's economy in the coming years?</h4><p>By 2020, more than 30% of Portuguese GDP will be digitized, with growth in every industry driven by digitally-enhanced offerings, operations, and relationships. In this context, IDC forecasts ICT investments to reach almost EUR8.4 billion by 2021 and grow at an average annual rate of  3.1% over the period 2016-2021. But the most important is that technologies associated with the 3rd Platform and the Innovation Accelerators, the enabler for Digital Transformation in all other industries, will grow at an average rate of 12.1% and represent around ¾ of the market in 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

However, when one is engaged in working from an early age, you mature faster. For example, we established a a factory that makes butter processed cheese, currently the leading cheese brand in Panama. Before, the butter was imported directly and had to be stored and transported refrigerated. This raised costs significantly. Over time, my Australian partners found a different way to do it that did not require refrigeration, but in a 55-gallon tank. When exported, it does not need refrigeration and when it reaches Panama, we merely add 20% water. I entered that business many years ago and have done extremely well; to date, no one else is doing this. I produce and export butter for everyone else. Before, producing butter generated a lot of taxes. When we produced butter with raw materials, we paid USD0.10 per pound; however, I did not think it was right to raise prices because it would affect consumers. We have been able to surpass Nestlé and are currently number one in terms of cheese sales in our country. We also produce butter for other companies and export it.</p><h4>Tzanetatos works with several segments such as food, personal care, cosmetics, household, and automotive. What is the company's core activity?</h4><p>We started in the food segment, so one can say that is our main area of business, but over time we have ventured into other areas such as real estate development. We have constructed several buildings, including a commercial mall in Colón and a 40-story apartment building in Costa del Este with two apartments of 400sqm per floor. I own 10% of the mall in Colón, we have prominent developers as minority partners (one of them is a great builder with a great deal of experience). As developers we have seen an increase in demand for small apartments of 70sqm with shopping centers on the ground floors and apartments on the upper floors. We have 3ha of land available and want to build two buildings with a green zone in the middle with various facilities such as restaurants and pedestrian areas.</p><h4>After 50 years in the country, how has Tzanetatos Group contributed to the socioeconomic development of Panama?</h4><p>I think that our contribution can be summarized in our main belief in making a better society for all. There are so many ways to help out your fellow man: I purchased a house with 20 rooms, 42 beds, and a small chapel so that the mothers that came from outside the city who bring their children to the Children's Hospital had a place to sleep because they could only sleep on the floor. We developed a blood bank for a hospital that did not have one. We also built a school called Instituto Atenea for Panamanian students. When they finish seventh grade, we send them to Athens, where we have a hotel. Their accommodations are taken care off and we help with flight tickets. There is also a hospital called Irma Lourdes that we collaborate with that is on a 30,000sqm plot of land.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>We pay a great deal of attention to the developments surrounding the general elections due next year. But business have to go along with social responsabiklity: I have purchased a plot measuring 3,000sqm for a project with commercial premises on the ground floor and an amusement area for young people on the upper floor in Chorrillo, a low income area stricken by crime. There will also be a children's dining room for 50 children who will be supported with rental income for life. You have to create opportunities for a better living in order to have better citizens.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has GOFSCO contributed to Kuwait?</h4><p>Being a local company, we have to rely on our local resources to provide our services with high-quality assurance and in a safe work environment. We own our equipment, bring the most talented workforce on board and train them, and provide services and solutions based on our long experience. Due to our long relationship with our clients, we have created a strong bond of trust, especially with Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), which is our main client and is responsible for 90% of our work activities; we consider our relationship as a partnership rather than customer relationship. Another large client we have here is Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC). We take pride in being dynamic and flexible in providing our services to the local market. We have employees who have been with us for more than 30 years, and this continuity gives us an advantage over any other player in the market. We are here to stay and have built up a strong know-how and trust with our clients. One of our targets for the next three to four years is to increase the number of locals working in our company to over 70%. The more competitive the market becomes, the more we want to keep our investment in the country. There is a high turnover of foreign staff in the oil and gas business because expatriate workers move around to new jobs internationally. Locals typically stay in the country until retirement. Localization gives us a more sustainable employment base in terms of turnover, and our clients appreciate this stability as well.</p><h4>How are you strengthening your position to become the preferred business partner for primary operators operating in the region?</h4><p>GOFSCO's strategy is to have experienced people on board and ensure we have the most reliable equipment. We invest a great deal in both our people and equipment. We try to align ourselves with the challenges of our clients and predict how we can fix any new issues they might have. We have been able to adapt to all the changes in the market over the last 45 years. We understand the trends because of our experience here and have developed a strong database of market trends and client behavior. We also ensure all our equipment is state of the art. We position ourselves as a company with high standards that is comparable to any of the international players in the market. We draw on the numerous sources of new technologies that are available in the market today. We have a dedicated team that looks for changes and enhancements in technology for us to adopt. We also create a number of customized competitive solutions for our clients.</p><h4>How does GOFSCO ensure a constant commitment to the highest health, safety, and the environment (HSE) standards?</h4><p>HSE is at our core and part of our culture. We ensure that the safety culture is part of every employee's daily approach to work. We have a dedicated team, including certified people, who look after HSE. Every quarter, a team in charge of safety practices performs a site visit for spot checks to ensure all our safety standards are being applied and followed. Any accident—day or night—is immediately reported to me as part of our HSE procedures, and we have a fast response safety team. Every day, the head of the team at every site holds a safety meeting to remind our onsite working employees about the safety procedures they need to follow, because we deal with high pressures and toxic gases on a daily basis. We also have a system of safety observations where staff can note any safety issues that arise and we address these during a weekly staff meeting. These procedures have helped us avoid accidents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the last year been for Total's operations in Kuwait?</h4><p>Total has been in Kuwait for 20 years now, providing technical support to Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), through a technical services agreement (TSA). Our secondees, in the KOC organization, have been bringing their added value by participating in specific E&amp;P projects. Working on multi-disciplinary and integrated projects with skilled engineers from Total and KOC with a common goal would result in tangible benefits for KOC. We could do even more in Kuwait as we are currently doing in other countries in the GCC, where Total is among the top leaders in the upstream sector (E&amp;P), the midstream sector (gas and LNG) and the downstream sector (refining, petrochemicals, and marketing). Total is eager to contribute to the achievement of Kuwait's energy objectives by identifying and developing win-win business opportunities with KOC and other K-companies.</p><h4>How do you ensure environmental sustainability in your operations?</h4><p>Total's motto is 'Committed to Better Energy.' This means Total considers its mission and added value as bringing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to the planet and its 7 billion inhabitants. Therefore, environmental sustainability is a key component of our strategy, with three main priorities. The first is to produce oil and gas in a safe manner respectful of the environment; hence, our commitment on reducing flaring, decreasing our CO2 emissions, and improving our energy efficiency. We also fight against climate change and embed the 2 degrees Celsius scenario in our strategy, which led us to exit from coal and promote gas and gas usage. Finally, we seek to build solutions for tomorrow by developing renewables, batteries, and energy efficient innovations. These are not just platitudes; there are already investments made. Total is indeed the world's second-largest solar energy company as a result of the 60% share we acquired in 2011 of SunPower, which manufactures photovoltaic panels with the world record highest efficiency. We acquired as well more than 90% of Saft, a world leading designer and manufacturer of advanced technology batteries for the industry.</p><h4>How do you foresee the global oil market evolving?</h4><p>Especially during times of uncertainty, our priority in Total is to continue to reduce costs as much as possible in our operations, making our business more resilient to fluctuations of the oil price. By lowering the breakeven point, one can make projects profitable even when the oil price is low. Total has been extremely successful in doing so, cutting OPEX by nearly 40%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We seek to continue to grow in Middle East and if possible in Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments of PIC over the past year?</h4><p>2017 was a challenging and exciting year for PIC with respect to the progress of the company's strategic projects and the development of the Petrochemical 2040 Strategy, which has been developed and approved in compliance with the long-term strategy of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC). Moreover, we have been successful in our ambition to achieve new production records. Since commissioning, the highest production of our urea plants reached 1,155,480 tons, equivalent to 114% of our target. PIC has worked on other existing opportunities in Kuwait and abroad as well to implement green field capital projects and to acquire equity stakes in reputed international companies. We signed a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract with a leading engineering consultant for Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Corporation (CKPC), and the work is now in progress. CKPC is a 50-50 joint venture between Canada-based Pembina Pipeline and PIC for an integrated propylene and polypropylene plant in Alberta. In additon, PIC signed an MoU with a leading Asian petrochemical company to enter the derivatives business. Our due diligence activities to acquire equity stakes in petrochemical plants in North America and Asia are in progress. We are happy that in 2017 there were no lost-time incidents or environment incidents in our fertilizer plant operations. In fact, the fertilizer plants have been running with no major turn-around obstacles for the last three years. As per the KPC Strategic Directions, the Fertilizer Exit Plan has been approved and is currently being implemented. Finally, PIC continues to implement the Six Sigma methodology to enhance business processes, and 48 projects were successfully completed in 2017.</p><h4>How does PIC add value to Kuwait's natural resources?</h4><p>PIC plays a significant role by adding value to Kuwait's hydrocarbons. We are involved in the Al-Zour Integration Project, which will produce 1,400kg tons per annum (kta) of paraxylene and 940kta of polypropylene. The project is in the FEED phase, and licenses for both the refinery and petrochemical part have been awarded. Other projects that are illustrative of our contribution are the Local Refining Project, for which the feasibility study has commenced, and the Ethane Cracker Project (Olefins IV), for which the feasibility study will commence shortly. In addition to the national goal of adding value to the country's natural resources, we also play an important role in another key national objective. PIC has exceeded the Kuwaitization target set by KPC, and is at the forefront of hiring locals and creating new employment opportunities for young Kuwaitis.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>As per the Petrochemical 2040 Strategy, PIC's aspiration is to achieve a leadership position with downstream extension into high-value petrochemical businesses, while ensuring integration with KPC's activities both domestically and internationally. PIC is looking forward to working with all our customers and strategic partners to contribute to the expansion and diversification of the Kuwaiti economy. In 2018, we expect to see important progress with our key projects. The transformation from the fertilizers business to operating polypropylene and paraxylene plants will be an important development, and we expect to witness the completion of the FEED work for CKPC in Canada, and the subsequent commencement engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) phase. Moreover, significant construction activities are to be completed for the US Gulf Coast project producing ethylene glycol. The feasibility studies for Olefins IV and expansion in local refining capacity will be completed, and PIC will finalize multiple deals for petrochemicals and derivatives in Asia and North America. Also, PIC will establish a sales office in Vietnam that will cover the Southeast Asia region. Finally, PIC will continue to explore new opportunities inside and outside Kuwait as per the Petrochemical 2040 Strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the creation of KIPIC in 2016?</h4><p>The downstream sector is an important part of the 2030 strategy of maximizing the value of hydrocarbons in Kuwait. The Al Zour Refinery has been approved and is now under execution, and an LNG import terminal (LNGI) is part of the 2030 strategy for supply of clean energy to Kuwait's industrial and power sector. After a study, KIPIC was established in late 2016 as an integrated company to manage the integration between refining and petrochemical activities to gain synergies and maximize the value of hydrocarbons. KIPIC was initially mandated to construct and operate three mega-sized projects at Al Zour: the Al Zour Refinery, LNGI, and downstream petrochemical production facilities. Ensuring that these three megaprojects are as integrated as possible is the essence of this company despite the fact that these projects were approved and are being implemented on different time schedules.</p><h4>How has the organization evolved since it was founded over a year ago?</h4><p>The process of establishing the legal entity was finalized in November 2016. Considering the size of the company, the time it took to finalize all the necessary legal steps was short and commendable. Once the legal entity was established, we needed to determine the organization structure of the company and its vision. This was approved in November 2016, along with the appointment of the board and the management. We had to be absolutely sure we were ready to assume responsibility because the last thing we wanted was to hinder the progress of the ongoing projects during the transition to KIPIC. We developed a detailed plan that ensured a smooth transfer of responsibilities without interruption. This plan saw to it that by May 2017 the foundation and systems would be in place to have everything transferred to KIPIC, and it is heartening to note that all went according to plan. Before the establishment of KIPIC, the progress of Al Zour Refinery was around 15%, and now it is around 42%. LNGI progressed from 12 to 20%. Things are also moving forward with the petrochemical project. The company faces many challenges in terms of the resources to be brought in and the right systems to be established. Things are now moving according to plan and I hope that by 2018 that many of the well-detailed systems that are needed to equip the company will be in place.</p><h4>What are the advantages of integrating refining and petrochemical activities?</h4><p>The ultimate goal is to maximize the value of Kuwait's hydrocarbon assets. We enhance the margin of crude oil by refining it. These refined products can be used as feedstock to produce petrochemical products such as polypropylene, p-Xylene, benzene, and so on to increase the margins even more. The integration of refining and petrochemical activities leads to important synergies. It ensures that we do not seek for profit maximization in isolation, but rather, look for the approach for maximized profit across the value chain and help us achieve the greatest margins. By having everything under one umbrella, we will save on investment and reduce our operating costs.</p><h4>How do you see KIPIC contributing to the future of Kuwait and generating employment opportunities?</h4><p>Our growth programs will tap into Kuwait's many strategic goals. Maximizing the value chain of crude will be a great resource for the economy of Kuwait, and the investments in the three megaprojects will create a positive environment for many industries and raw materials. Moreover, it will create 2,700 direct employment opportunities, as well as the jobs that are available for contractors and maintenance. The investments will provide an avenue for the private sector to be involved in the downstream industry. In addition, we will supply the country with clean and high-quality fuel that will help reduce the impct on the environment. Together, these points make up KIPIC's contribution to the future of Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the agency's role in the Kuwait government's strategy?</h4><p>CAIT was established in 2006 as an oversight organization for the IT government sector. Our role is to participate in government strategies in the field of information technology, possibly with the council of ministers. We are also responsible for overseeing all IT projects within the government sector. We supervise the e-government project across governmental agencies and also manage the official electronic portal for the state of Kuwait. We are also responsible for the sharing of technologies and best practices among the IT departments in the government sector to perform their functions according to the specified standards. As well as building awareness in IT usage and e-government services, we evaluate and study the IT requirements and needs of the country. ICT helps the government to perform better. In 2016, we collected data and developed results in the form of ICT indicators on the work of various agencies, businesses, and non-governmental organizations; it explains how people use, access, and utilize IT tools, which affect all aspects of our lives today.</p><h4>How much progress has been made in providing government e-services?</h4><p>Once trust has been instilled among the public for e-services, the demand for e-services will then increase. For example, this year we have gathered, through e-payment, KWD94 million through our portal for government services, a growth of over 80%. In recent years, the annual growth of usage of e-services was no less than 50%. The most important thing we want is for the government to focus more on e-services and provide more e-services that serve our businesses and citizens. The key issue is ensuring that users of government services are satisfied with their experience .</p><h4>How do you partner with private companies?</h4><p>The IT industry today has a roadmap, and the industry has a plan for where it will be in two to three years. However, the impact of trends or developments affects how a company or government entity does its business and how they manage their resources, activities, and IT infrastructure and resources. It is crucial to partner closely with the industry to leverage all the innovations to utilize them to the extent that they can help us. For example, we have a national licensing agreement with Microsoft. We conduct a large amount of business with major private companies.</p><h4>What is your role in the 2017-2020 national cyber security strategy?</h4><p>There is a national strategy that has been signed, drafted, and initiated by the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority (CITRA), and we are definitely a part of that strategy. Most of the critical infrastructure today is run by cyber and information technology via automated systems, for example, in the financial sector. This means any breach or attempt to breach security impacts the entire infrastructure. For example, the power grid in Kuwait is extremely important and if the grid goes down, the entire country will be hit hard. Today, hacking is no longer a hobby or an individual activity; it is organized crime. There is state-to-state espionage. Kuwaiti citizens use our e-services to pay fees, traffic violations, and more. We need to be resilient and protect ourselves from such breaches.</p><h4>What steps do you take to become more efficient and create an e-government?</h4><p>Today, all government entities exchange their correspondence electronically through Kuwait Information Network. Since 2015 we have introduced more than 270 e-services for all government entities. Some are social services like housing loans, social allowances, and building permits from the Kuwait municipality. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has initiated the Kuwait Business Center where one can request commercial licenses and receive some of those electronically. The public authority of labor has also launched e-services for renewal or initiating working permits. We look forward to there being more transactional services. Our ambition is to be a leader in this area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures do you take to ensure you are an employer of choice?</h4><p>We want to emphasize that we work with quality partners, both offshore with Aramco and onshore with Chevron. That opens the doors for any present or future employee to work with companies of the highest standard. The transfer of technology and knowledge that employees receive from working with those companies is significant. They are able to differentiate themselves from employees who work with other companies under the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) umbrella, and this is simply from the nature of their work with our partners. In addition, we have a great and competitive package for people working in joint operations onshore and offshore. It gives them better benefits compared to working with other companies in the oil sector. In addition, we provide focused training and they tend to work in areas unavailable in other companies. When it comes to offshore, KGOC is the only company that offers Kuwaitis work in Kuwait. Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) is just starting, while we have many people with experience working offshore. That differentiates KGOC.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the environmental sustainability of your operations?</h4><p>Health, safety, and the environment (HSE) is the number-one objective and issue that we look at every day. With our onshore operations, HSE is critical because some of the equipment and facilities are old. We make sure that everything is maintained in great shape to avoid any environmental issues or accidents. We also stress the training of our employees and those in joint operations to the highest HSE standards. We are fortunate to have partners with strong HSE standards. We try to match them and implement best systems that will meet guidelines set by KPC. We continue because no matter how much effort is placed on HSE; it is never a lost investment.</p><h4>What is the strategy regarding developing your partnerships for the medium and long term?</h4><p>We continuously develop our partnerships. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are historically attached at the hip. We build on that relationship in the work environment. The work relationship is strong because we are building on the culture itself. It is not just a commercial relationship.</p><h4>What are your plans after production restarts?<br></h4><p>There are many projects that have been planned, but were shelved. There is a great deal of work coming. When the restart takes place and orders come in, there will be many activities and major investments. This will happen across the board in all aspects of the industry for both onshore and offshore. We are lagging behind now for almost three years. The world has moved on, and new technologies have been introduced; it does not make sense to do the same old thing. Currently, under a low oil price environment, the challenge is to reduce costs to be more efficient and lean.</p><h4>How do you see the oil trade evolving globally, and what opportunities can it bring to Kuwait and companies looking to invest in the country?</h4><p>We see this change of global commodity prices as an opportunity for Kuwait, KGOC, and companies to take advantage of. We can secure deals that may not be available when oil prices are high and the world is living in a glut of good fortune in terms of high oil prices. Making excellent deals now and forming contracts makes a great deal of sense. Service providers face many difficulties so it is best to form deals with them at the moment in the hopes of production and activities resuming. We are trying to secure that. Furthermore, we are taking advantage of this slowdown or inactivity by training our people again. It is also important to secure the development of our people. It will be wise to move our company into the 21st century in terms of using the latest technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[engine-of-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for KPI's operations?</h4><p>KPI has a network of more than 4,700 retail fuel stations across Europe, with operations mainly in Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark for retail fuels, direct supplies, and lubricants. KPI is also a leading jet fuel marketer, supplying over 200 airlines at over 60 international and regional airports. After recording the highest operating profit in the 2015-16 financial year, KPI's financial performance during FY2016-17 was satisfying, as it was mainly achieved through strategic and operational initiatives, including cost savings, in spite of tough market conditions. KPI achieved a record product sales volume and has increased its market share in many regions. This was progressively achieved over the past three years at average sales growth rate of over 6% per year. Divestments from under-performing markets or areas with supply issues helped KPI to optimize operations. KPI implemented a cost control program, not only for operating cost reduction and CAPEX deferment or rationalization, but also to enhance margins through efficiency improvement schemes.</p><h4>Are there any plans for investment by the company?</h4><p>Diversification can reduce business risks, and KPI's international investments are in further downstream product development, including petrochemical and capturing retail-marketing opportunities. Diversification can stabilize our income stream from external sources via the local-demand refineries overseas and will simultaneously reduce the risk of crude oil shocks, thus providing us with a competitive edge. Re-deploying existing manpower, recruiting fresh talent, and managing relevant and critical competencies including market intelligence, business development, M&amp;A, and corporate finance, have been KPI's top priorities. We have undertaken a company-wide organization capability and development initiative that will nurture in-house talent. Training and development and K-Lead programs have been at the top of KPI's priority to prepare employees to manage change and accelerate business developments in refining and marketing globally.</p><h4>What are your long-term strategic goals, and how you plan to achieve them?</h4><p>We have seen a slowdown in downstream investment, just as upstream investment has been reduced. When product prices are low, the refining margin is not healthy enough to support major investment in downstream activities. Building a new refinery has become expensive because a large, integrated complex refinery is needed, with petrochemicals production capabilities and expensive units to crack fuel oil. With these requirements, it will cost no less than USD7-9 billion per project. However, in Kuwait and other GCC countries, KPI is proceeding with these projects because the oil business is cyclical. After three to five years in a downward cycle, there will be no projects around while demand has grown. We will face that period with great projects on hand. Demand will catch up, especially in the Middle East and Asia.</p><h4>How do you foresee the global oil trade evolving, and what opportunities does that yield?</h4><p>Crude oil is one of the most widely used and actively traded products in the world, and accordingly, the price of oil remains center stage as an important economic indicator for both present conditions as well as expectations for the future. Crude oil and petroleum products have the highest share of energy consumption in the EU region, which is the world's second-largest producer of petroleum products, after the US. For Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, securing a large downstream portfolio in Asia is part of a long-term strategy to consolidate their shares in a key market. While competition will grow, strategic initiatives will result in long-term gains and further consolidation of Asian-Middle East energy tie-ups. As global markets move toward rebalancing, Kuwait is redesigning its investment and growth strategies with signs of recovery in global markets in 2017. Kuwait has maintained a promising and low risk classification, a stable outlook with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a transparent legal system, stability, and a commitment to smoothly support international business development strategies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relevance of the Mexican market for BI in terms of production and sales?</h4><p>In the past, our largest businesses globally were human pharmaceuticals with its two branches—prescription and OTC or also called consumer healthcare products—animal health, and bio pharmaceuticals. BI in Mexico is ranked 10th in the pharmaceutical industry, which is a significantly better and stronger position than in the rest of the world, where it is ranked around 14-17th. BI has been growing faster in the Mexican market than the rest of the globe. In 2017, we managed growth levels of more than 16%, and that is only in the Mexican private market, as we also participate in the government market. We are close to 3% market share in values. BI has three manufacturing facilities in Mexico; it is perhaps one of the few pharmaceutical companies that decided to invest in Mexico for manufacturing. We have two manufacturing facilities for human pharma and one manufacturing facility for animal health in Guadalajara.</p><h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages for a large multinational to function a family-owned business?</h4><p>We invest more than 20% of our own income and funds into R&amp;D. We do not necessarily need to go out and chase capital. We may be the only pharmaceutical company that is privately owned. Since the company's foundation in 1885, BI has clearly stated its intention to remain as a privately owned independent company in order to foster growth for the future. The reason why we are an independent company is because we believe in long-term investments and entrepreneurship. The company has clearly stated in its guidelines and statements that remaining an entrepreneurial family-owned company is key for the success of BI. We are not pushed by the stock market nor are we driven by the highs and lows of investments; we are driven by long-term R&amp;D.</p><h4>What criteria do you use to select and prioritize these areas of focus in your research?</h4><p>There are three elements: the need for innovation, the need for best-in-class products, and unmet medical needs. That means we will not go into research in areas where there are 1,000 competitors or participants. The vision of BI worldwide is adding value through innovation; if we do not add value or innovate, we are not interested. For example, we do not do rheumatoid arthritis because there are many companies researching that area; we go more in the specialized fields for diseases such as cancer, myocardial infection, or strokes. We need to concentrate so that we do not run out of funds. Diabetes represents more than 23% of the total income for BI Mexico. In merely a few years, the portfolio has shifted from old and ancient products to specific innovative drugs that are almost one-quarter of our portfolio.</p><h4>Why did BI decide to acquire Sanofi Merial, and what does this move mean for the animal health industry in Mexico?</h4><p>In 2017, we became the number-one company in Mexico in the animal health world because we acquired an important business that helped us reach the top. We are ranked number 10 in Mexico, with 3% market share and a strong position for human pharmaceuticals. In animal health, we are number one, with 22% market share, which is an outstanding position. The market is growing around 6% and we are growing close to 16% for both businesses, which is a significantly important growth. OTC products have not necessarily helped our reputation and contribution, so we decided to halt them. We did a swap with Sanofi and exchanged our OTC business with its animal health business. For us, it was perfect because we wanted to develop more innovative products for animal species, which got fulfilled with the swap.</p><h4>How does BI contribute to the competitiveness of Mexico as a hub for exporting agricultural products?</h4><p>One of the country's biggest challenges in the last decade, for example, is the influenza strain, and we manufacture influenza vaccines not only for Mexico but also for exports. We are extremely strong and important in this market. BI produces vaccines and pharmaceutical products for the country's growing needs. Since meat is an important component of global diet, the health of animals is extremely important for the health of humans.</p><h4>BI recently made investments to expand its production of vaccines. What is the priority in the market for these new products?</h4><p>The specialization of our manufacturing facility in Guadalajara will be vaccines for chicken. Most of our capacity there is related to the vaccines for chicken, specifically for influenza and other avian diseases. We want to provide—as we currently do with humans—value-added services, for instance vaccination technology. This is something that not many companies are doing. When a pharmaceutical company offers a product, at times it also needs to provide vaccination techniques or machines.</p><h4>What are your top priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Access for patients is challenging in our country, and it is something on my personal agenda as well as the chamber's agenda. Mexico is one of the countries that invests the least in health, less than the average contribution of OECD countries; hence, Mexico must invest in supporting the rapidly growing and ageing population. The economy needs to divert more funds to health.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the last year been for your operations?</h4><p>The new board and I were appointed on April 4, 2017. The past year has been tough and challenges remain ahead. We are dealing with these and addressing them one by one. The first and foremost challenge has been the company's financial performance. It is no secret that Kuwait Airways suffered a loss in 2016, and we expect 2017 and the coming three years to see losses as well. However, we are developing a strategy that will enable us to turn these losses into profit in about four to five years at the most. The other challenge that needs mentioning is in manpower and staffing. Three or four years ago, there was a decision to privatize Kuwait Airways. The result was that we lost a large number of professional staff. Many transferred to the government sector. The second major challenge is thus to rebuild our manpower to the strength that we used to have, which we are working on.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about reinforcing manpower training to correct that issue?</h4><p>We have done a few things in this regard. We currently have a shortage of pilots, because 35 of our pilots chose to work with the government. We now have about 400 pilots, though 35 pilots matter to an airline like ours. We have taken that as a challenge to convince them to return to Kuwait Airways. We also have new airplanes coming, which means the shortage of pilots is exacerbated. Subsequently, we were able to convince 30 of those pilots to return, which is a great achievement, enhancing our strength and enabling us to get through the summer, which is the high season for travel. Secondly, we made an arrangement with the Ministry of Education for a scholarship program for pilots to study abroad and return to work at Kuwait Airways. We have not done that in the past 20 years, and that is a big step forward by giving this scholarship for Kuwaiti nationals to join Kuwait Airways. Of course, it is a tough process, and they have to pass tests and exams to get there. Thirdly, we are developing an executive MBA program for some of the leaders that we have at Kuwait Airways. We need to create leaders for the future, and we are developing that program with this in mind, for up to 20-25 people.</p><h4>How does the acquisition of new airplanes fit into your long-term strategy?</h4><p>Modernizing our fleet is an essential part of our strategy. For some time, Kuwait Airways did not modernize its fleet. We have thus taken the right steps in this direction. We have so far received 10 Boeing 777s, between December 2016 and August 2017, approximately one plane a month, while in the September we received two. They are wide-body planes, their configuration is excellent, and they are long-range planes that can carry a great number of passengers. That has improved our services significantly.</p><h4>How will the airport expansion affect your operations?</h4><p>The airport is an essential part of the service of any traveler. The new airport is already under construction. It will take perhaps five to six years to complete; however, it is definitely a step in the right direction and will be state of the art. Another point is that there is a support terminal, which is currently under construction as well. It is a stopgap to reduce pressure on the current airport until the new airport is finished. Terminal 4, the support terminal, is expected to be completed by May or June 2018. That is earmarked for Kuwait Airways in particular as well as some other airlines. This is an excellent opportunity for Kuwait Airways to improve its services if we move to the new support terminal. It will help Kuwait in general too in terms of attracting new passengers and visitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the corporate culture at ACICO?</h4><p>The corporate culture at ACICO is defined by transparency and open communication. These values are deep rooted, as they were developed when we started off as a small family business. Over time ACICO grew to become a medium-sized, publicly listed company with 4,200 employees, but we made sure to stay true to the values on which we were founded and applied them from top to bottom. Diversity is another important element of our corporate culture. I believe that diversity in a company proves that employees are treated equally, which is an important value that I inherited from my father. At ACICO continually look to diversify our workforce in order to further strengthen our corporate culture. We look into how our employees can add value to the company. Leadership is crucial in this regard; if the decision makers in a company believe in diversity and empowering women, it will be achieved—and it is crucial that leaders lead by example.</p><h4>How is ACICO contributing to female empowerment?</h4><p>I started as a civil engineer and gradually moved up the career ladder to obtain a management position. Last year, I was promoted to Deputy CEO. One of the first things I did when I got promoted was hire a female director for ACICO's HR Group. This is a direct approach to empowering more women in the workplace and promoting gender diversity. The results to this approach are immediate. In the past year we have hired more women in different positions and departments and we are looking to increasing the numbers across the group. </p><h4>Does the strong government investment in housing create opportunities for ACICO?</h4><p>The private sector is always eager to support state projects, and we have always been ready to assist governments in its housing development strategies. Currently, we provide support to construction and housing development projects through our operations in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Dubai. In Kuwait, ACICO's strategy is to support the state's vision and plans. In terms of housing projects, so far we have built more than 7,000 homes and we have the capacity to increase that number. Our building system allows us to build house frames in in our factory in just three days. An entire villa takes an average of seven months as a turnkey project. In terms of infrastructure, we have the capacity to support the government's plans to expand in roads and bridges to link the new cities of Kuwait. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>We are proud to have maintained sustained growth for our shareholders. I am optimistic about the coming year as we aim to continue to support the development projects of the countries we operate in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Al Mazaya's contribution to the development of Kuwait?</h4><p>We started operating in 2004 and have always tried to bring something new to the market. Since the company's inception, we have developed a number of unique and distinguished projects. For example, we were the first company to deliver an entire building of clinics for a municipality featuring the best doctors and equipment. Since its inception, Al Mazaya has delivered more than USD3 billion worth of projects, while expanding internationally and working in eight countries over the last 10 years. In the UAE alone, our investments are worth around USD1.6 billion. These have been landmark projects, such as the first residential building in Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). We come up with projects that have an added value. We want to offer something special in every project. For example, our residential project in DIFC was fully furnished by Fendi, which made us the DIFC pioneers of premium furnished apartments. At the same time, Al Mazaya builds mid-range housing that meets our customers' design and payment requirements. We focus on what is important to the customer and enhance their experience.</p><h4>Over the past few years, Al Mazaya has implemented a 10-step strategy. What does this strategy entail?</h4><p>Al Mazaya works under a five-year strategy that is updated every year. We have a unique business model comprised of two main components: income-generating assets and health or trading assets. Income-generating assets are where we focus on covering our fixed expenses and creating a steady cash flow, whereas health or trading projects are where we make our major margins. Al Mazaya has outperformed the market, and for the past five years, we have maintained a compound annual growth rate of around 20%. One of the main goals under our strategy is to maintain a two-way relationship with our clients and governmental entities. For example, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) named us one of the top-10 companies to deliver its requirements. We have our systems ready before it even asks and aim to be as transparent as possible with information. This has inspired trust between us, our clients, and other stakeholders in the real estate sector. We capitalize on this by issuing reports every year from two independent research companies. Although we are not required to do so, we have also taken the initiative to obtain a company-wide equity-credit rating from Capital Intelligence. We have always been a trustworthy company that delivers what it promises. Al Mazaya is a dual-listed company, in Kuwait and Dubai, and we work with regulators in both. Being listed in our local markets gives us more credibility, though we do not seek investors as we have enough working capital already. Our relationship with banks and our portfolio are great. We are always pursuing a situation in which not only the investors and Al Mazaya make money, but also the third party buying for us.</p><h4>In which markets do you see potential for Al Mazaya to unlock new growth opportunities?</h4><p>Al Mazaya works in every GCC country, though our main markets in terms of asset allocation are Dubai and Kuwait. In 2017 we also launched Phase I of a middle-income residential project of around 300 units in Oman. We sold 20% of those units within the first few months and have launched Phase II because sales have been so successful. Turkey was part of our growth plan, and sales there have gone well. We have sold around 90% of the units, while 70% of the mall is rented. We are pleased with our experience in Turkey, although we faced many challenges there. In Dubai, we launched four new middle-income projects. I personally prefer middle-income housing projects because the units are affordable enough for living or investment purposes. About five years ago everyone was doing high-end luxury projects in Dubai; however, we focused on middle-income, and this paid off well. Al Mazaya is now an established brand in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Root of the Matter]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-root-of-the-matter]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major developments over the past 12 months?</h4><p>The sector in which we operate is not directly affected when the economy slows down, including a fall in oil prices, because we provide services for existing buildings. We even slightly surpassed our financial and operational growth targets. Outside of Kuwait, we have some new projects and compared to other industries, we have been fortunate because of the nature of our business and the sector we serve.</p><h4>Why do clients choose UFM as their partner for facilities management?</h4><p>Our main philosophy is to look after everything for our clients so they can focus on their core business. Many of our clients have a wide range of services within their umbrella. They do their core business in addition to all the support services within their organization, and this is our main challenge. Some of the large malls in Kuwait have all the operations on their shoulders, while their core business is in fact managing and operating malls and getting the right mix of tenants to attract shoppers. Meanwhile, their time is taken up by maintenance, security, and cleaning, all of which take up a major part of their operations. We tell our clients to focus on their core business while we do the rest. This is especially difficult with the government, because of the way things are structured there. Typically, technical services are all under one undersecretary while the soft services go with the administration and HR department. There are many government and private sector organizations that have not yet benefited from having an integrated facilities management provider serving their organizational structure.</p><h4>How do you make sure UFM consistently provides its customers with the highest quality services?</h4><p>We have to understand their business and needs. Our focus is not only on the people whom we signed the contract with; we also have to look at the real customer within that contract. For example, although my contract may be with the owner of a mall to provide it with services, the most important people in that chain are the mall's visitors. We have to look into the client's needs and ensure he is getting the entire benefit. If we have a contract with a governmental body for a service center and people do not receive good service, it will be in the newspaper the next day, an embarrassment for that ministry or division. Understanding these relations and the importance of each partner within it is vital to our success.</p><h4>What competitive advantages do you have?</h4><p>We are the largest in Kuwait in terms of size, the number of projects, and number of employees, with over 3,700 staff members. We are one of the few companies that do over 95% of our business with our in-house team; we only outsource certain specialized services. We do not do landscaping because we have a sister company doing that; we give such contracts to this company because we do not want to create competition within the group. When it comes to cleaning, security, valet parking, and maintenance, we do it with our team. Subcontractors have their own standards, and even if we have a contract, it takes a great deal of energy to manage them and ensure they are working to our expectations. Our competitors who use third parties have staff who are not necessarily fit, clean, or presentable because they do not manage their accommodation and transportation. They might use public transportation, which takes time, especially if their accommodation is a long distance away.</p><h4>What role do innovation and technology play in your company?</h4><p>Facilities management is a technology-driven industry. We are one of the few companies in Kuwait that use a computer-aided facility management (CAFM) system to administrate operations. All our activities are generated, controlled, or documented through that system. This is important when we have such a large workforce where things change frequently. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of MPW to the comprehensive development of Kuwait?</h4><p>MPW endeavors to achieve comprehensive development in various vital fields in the country. Our strategic plan, Public Works 2035, includes the launch of several projects that will have great benefits in several fields. These projects are diverse and have multiple beneficiaries, such as the Ministry of Education, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Department of Marine Transport, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health, and other ministries, institutions, and authorities. One of the most important strategic objectives of MPW is the construction and completion of the new terminal of Kuwait International Airport. This project increases the capacity of the airport to 25 million passengers annually in the first phase. It also meets the highest standards of generating and preserving sustainable energy. Another significant transport project is the upgrade and development of Mubarak Al Kabeer Port. This project is deemed to be the cornerstone of the marine transport system and the development plans of the entire northern area of the country. With the completion of these two strategic projects, Kuwait will witness a qualitative leap in the field of transport, which is considered to be the main momentum of development. MPW also has strategic plans to complete the establishment of a number of health facilities. As education is one of our strategic objectives, we completed the construction of the headquarters of the Ministry of Education in South Surra, an architectural masterpiece that embodies the idea of the boom—a traditional Arab sailing vessel—being part of the Kuwaiti heritage. MPW has also designed three complexes of special schools in three different areas in the country with an eye to provide integrated care, education, and special-needs training. The strategic objectives of MPW do not stop at that; it has further expanded to other areas such as the construction of the main headquarters of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, which will soon be completed and stand as a distinguished architectural landmark reflecting the civilized nature of Islamic art. Another of MPW's strategic objectives is to renew, develop, and upgrade sewerage networks all over the country, alongside the construction of several wastewater treatment plants. This takes us to one of the most strategic goals of MPW, which is the preservation of the land and sea ecosystems in Kuwait to protect the environment and mitigate the negative impacts of floods.</p><h4>How does MPW seek cooperation with other countries in the spheres of transport and infrastructure?</h4><p>MPW cooperates with other countries through concluding a number of protocols, agreements, and MoUs. Over the course of the past few years, MPW has closed partnerships with ministries and governments from around the world. In 2014, the MPW signed an MoU with the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, around the development of infrastructure, sewage water treatment, harbors, and the safety and conservation of the environment. An MoU was signed between the governments of Kuwait and Spain for bilateral cooperation in the field of transportation infrastructure. An MoU was also signed with Hungary, and we are currently preparing a visit of an MPW delegation headed by myself to Hungary to examine the potential cooperation opportunities in the field of public building constructions, sanitary engineering projects, and logistic services through acquiring expertise and developing work in a way that achieves the best interests of both parties. Finally, a cooperation agreement in the field of construction and transport infrastructure with France is about to be activated and put into force. There is also coordination, cooperation, and participation via several joint committees with a number of countries in which MPW suggests proposals, topics, and visions in the field of infrastructure development, sanitary engineering, construction projects, harbors, maintenance, and the like. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your organization's role in Kuwait?</h4><p>The main issue of this arm of DDI is to tackle the prevalence of diabetes in the region by establishing a scientific program of training and teaching through which we can lower its incidence and minimize the rate of complications for patients. We have to do a great deal of public awareness programs because outreach is important. These factors include exercise and the quality of diets. It is important to encourage a healthier type of diet and suitable portions. We also have to tackle the rate of obesity; Kuwait is one of the top countries in the world in terms of obesity rates, a leading reason for our high incidences of diabetes. More than 76% of the population is overweight, while 48% is obese. These figures include Kuwaitis and expats. This is because of the lifestyle, which significantly affects health. These figures are truly alarming. Therefore, a great deal of effort should be made, and not only from the health sector. Many sectors in the government could chair a regular program to address many of these risk factors. The results are backed by medicine and research from many countries in the surrounding region. We have excellent medical services and have the platinum accreditation of the ACI.</p><h4>Do you have ways to measure the impact of education and outreach programs?</h4><p>This is the directive of the Ministry of Health. We have limited capabilities, and our resources are for standard programs that target a certain age and deliver many activities. We have a mobile clinic fully equipped for screening and check-ups. We also have a fully qualified staff, from dietitians to health educators, nurses, and physicians. The Ministry of Education has growth and sustainability programs. We focus more on health promotions for diabetes. There is a great deal of information and education in this regard. We have a magazine that also raises awareness amongst students, in addition to other educational programs. On top of this, we engage with the partners and even teachers as well. Most people are aware of diabetes; however, they need more specific information. Everyone knows diabetes is caused by high blood sugar, but they need to understand how to prevent it by living a healthy life, knowing what to avoid, and how much exercise they should do. These are issues that need more visibility. We should give them a straight and clear message.</p><h4>How do you assess the benefits of your partnerships?</h4><p>We classify them according to need. Sometimes we focus on education and how to build capacities for new research and universities. Other times we do population-based research and focus more on programs that train scientists, though we also have to focus on training our health professionals more toward teaching, managing, and educating. We have many partnerships, including Kuwait University and the Kuwait Faculty of Public Health, and have an open platform to access their resources. Most of our resources go toward research.</p><h4>How does DDI fit into international research on diabetes?<br></h4><p>Because DDI is a new center, we are building up our facilities; our research activities will take time. It is also important to recruit many high-caliber scientists as well as develop our staff. We currently have a new research strategy with our new chief scientific officer. There are many elements, the most important of which are partnerships and attracting more high achievers. It is also important to improve our infrastructure. We have the center itself, as well as contact with universities such as Harvard and other medical schools. We have the resources and collaboration to turn the center into a training hub if we can attract more students and candidates from the GCC through our internal collaborations and research activities. We recently established a scientific advisory board comprising high-caliber scientists that assist us with our research. The future is bright. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Breaking Down Barriers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[breaking-down-barriers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the idea behind the development of the Kuwait Logistics City Project?</h4><p>In certain places such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dubai, the port is the main pillar of the economy and is where everything circles around. In Kuwait, we need to make the port the pillar of our economy as well. The vision of HH the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah is for Kuwait to become a financial and trade center and we see ourselves as the gateway within that vision. The Kuwait Ports Authority does more than just import and export products; it is the catalyst for supporting infrastructures such as historical marinas and logistics cities. We will establish several logistics cities in different locations in Kuwait, on land owned by KPA. This will support local trade facilitation for foreign companies that wish to invest in Kuwait and require a logistics hub, and bring down the artificial glass ceiling of any new SME entering into the market. Once we have developed the logistics cities, we will transform the storage sector to a logistics service provider. In the future, we envision having a smart logistics app that allows businesses to offer products that are stored in one of the logistics hubs to be ordered at a competitive rate. This enables SMEs to achieve economies of scale. Multinational companies that have been in Dubai for many decades may be keen on the opportunity of adding Kuwait as a hub, because of our proximity to large markets such as Iraq and Iran. The latter will become more interesting after the lifting of sanctions. Kuwait scores relatively low on the World Bank's port infrastructure and logistics performance indexes. Once we have developed the logistics cities and improved our ports in terms of infrastructure and systems, we will be among the best in the GCC in terms of port management efficiency.</p><h4>How do you assess the capacity of the three ports you manage, and what are your plans to increase capacity in the coming years?</h4><p>At the moment, we have two expansion programs in Shuwaikh Port and Shuaiba Port, and these will increase capacity upon their completion in four to five years from now. We have awarded both to engineering firms—SMEC for Shuwaikh and CH2M for Shuaiba—and these contracts are currently being processed by the Audit Bureau. We are also within our current capabilities, freeing more land within both ports. We are demolishing old buildings, which will allow us to have more container space and general cargo space. In addition, we are working together with the customs clearance to give it more land, as this is where our bottleneck currently lies.</p><h4>How have you proceeded with plans to transform the three ports you oversee into smart port systems with fully integrated control systems?</h4><p>It is all about digitalization of the port but we have to do it in stages. Stage one is the paperwork flow while stage two is the actual container and general cargo flow. We need to increase the flow and the efficiency of both. There are 12-14 government agencies that support customs to clear the different types of goods, depending on the type of cargo that is shipped in. We will first integrate these into one single window, and will subsequently put everything online. First, we have to familiarize customers with having a one-stop shop. We are improving customer service, quality, and port operations, which involve the development of a port community system and a commander control center with cameras monitoring maritime operations. Port authorities in other countries are already steering away from the single window into working online, so we are in fact behind. However, we have to do those steps first before we can go online, and can catch up with them in the next two to three years and surpass them in the next four to five years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Strengthening Mexico-Canada Relations]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[pierre-alarei-ambassador-canada-in-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you expect the impact of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to be on trade between Canada and Mexico?</h4><p>It was important in terms of timing. Together with Mexico, we have shown that we are interested in new markets in Asia. It has an historical and commercial value in the sense that we are opening ourselves to new Asia—Pacific markets.  Furthermore, we did not have FTAs with certain countries in the region, such as Japan and Malaysia, and now we have a means of engaging in these agreements, together with Mexico. Mexico and Canada have shown commitment to being partners as we seek to open up new trade in Asia. The CPTPP demonstrates this importance that we attach to trade diversification.</p><h4>How does Canada see the Pacific Alliance (PA), and what can it gain from the strengthening of this commercial and political alliance?</h4><p>This is an interesting alliance for us, even though we already have FTAs in place with all of its member countries. We are embarking with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia in this venture of becoming associate states. The fact that Mexico pushed so hard for Canada to become one of the first associate members demonstrates the strong bilateral relationship between the two countries. We often forget that Mexico is Canada's third-largest trading partner after the US and China; we need to keep it in the forefront of our trade consciousness. Canada and Mexico have the same issue: we export about 75-80% of our goods to the US, and we need to look elsewhere if the US becomes more stringent in the way it does business. The Pacific Alliance and the CPTPP are great examples of such initiatives.</p><h4>How are Canadian and Mexican companies cooperating to transfer knowledge and conduct joint research projects in key sectors for both economies?</h4><p>Aerospace is one example. Bombardier came to Mexico about 15 years ago and established a plant. They realized the market did not have the right makeup of skilled workers; hence, they sat down with universities to create a curriculum that would train for these necessary skills. This has since transformed into an aerospace cluster that now trains some of the most highly skilled workers in the sector. Canadian companies are doing the same in the mining, oil, and gas industry. There was an important agreement in 2017 between the Ministry of Energy, the University of Alberta, and the University of Calgary to train technicians and engineers in these areas. We want to help develop the curriculum to ensure fresh engineering graduates have the right skill sets and knowledge base to address the industry's growing challenges. The reality is that the  last 18 months have allowed Canada and Mexico to assess their relationship more closely and forge new and lasting bonds. The relationship was slightly dormant before this. We were partly ignorant of one another before recent events forced us to reevaluate. Over the last 18 months, this reevaluation has gone extremely well, and we are poised to strengthen ties in ever more exciting ways.</p><h4>What short-term results do you expect?</h4><p>In the short term, we expect a number of positive developments. More Mexican students will be able to come to Canada to study. Roughly 20,000 Mexican students come to Canada to study every year, and we can do better than this. That said, this marks a significant increase from just a few years ago. We have top universities for a fraction of the price one might pay in the US. Canada has done a poor job of selling itself in terms of its education value in the past, though that is now changing quickly. We have a full-time education officer in the embassy whose job is to promote education opportunities in Canada—the proof is in the pudding. Now, we need to bring more Canadian students to Mexico, which has been a challenge for us. If one studies abroad, they become an excellent personal ambassador for their country, and they build a network that will last their whole life. We want to deepen these ties to Mexico. We could have 25,000-30,000 Mexican students in Canada, year in and year out. We must be ambitious.</p><h4>How can Canada and Mexico foster their reciprocal promotion as tourism destinations?</h4><p>We recently won the bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Mexico and the US. This will provide us a huge opportunity to promote the image of all three countries together. Now that we have lifted the visa requirements, the increase in tourism reached 47% last year. A total of 257,000 Mexicans visited Canada in 2017, and we hope for 400,000 this year. Many Canadians are unaware of how great the cities in Mexico are. We hope to see more Canadians visiting these great cultural centers across Mexico when they come to visit the beaches. I am extremely confident that tourism will continue to grow between the two countries.</p><h4>Which sectors of the Mexican economy hold the largest potential for increasing investment inflows from Canada?</h4><p>We are extremely active in the aerospace, auto parts, mining, and financial sectors in the country. We have around 60 Canadian companies in the auto parts sector, and they operate 116 plants across Mexico. However, this is an industry that flies below the radar a great deal of the time. We also have important activities in the banking sector. Moreover, we have pension funds that operate here and they have hundreds of millions of dollars invested. Canadian companies are looking more at the agribusiness sector as well. There are many new areas of investment popping up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the background of The Regency?</h4><p>The Regency Hotel Kuwait is a beautiful hotel on the shores of the Arabian Gulf. It is the only independently managed luxury hotel in Kuwait and has been identified as the elite's favorite destination ever since opening in 1981. Many Kuwaitis embrace this hotel as theirs, and our lobby lounge in particular has become many people's living room, as it is widely seen as a symbol of luxury throughout the country. After an extensive renovation, we have 203 rooms, including 50 suites. We also have the largest convention center in Kuwait directly connected to the hotel, as well as five food and beverage outlets. Our emphasis is on providing a boutique hotel service. We are the only independently managed and privately-owned five-star hotel in the country, and are not part of a chain. For us, operating a Kuwaiti icon in a market such as this is a great advantage.</p><h4>How do you see the hospitality and tourism sector evolving in Kuwait?</h4><p>For the last few years, the hospitality industry has been changing dramatically, which can also be seen in guests' booking behavior. Nowadays, direct digital marketing is key as many guests book online. That is the great advantage of being independent as we can formulate and tailor our approach to reach beyond our customers' expectations.</p><h4>Who is your target audience, and what is your client profile?</h4><p>From Sunday to Thursday, our guests are mainly here for business as a result of the convention center and large collection of meeting rooms we offer. During the weekends and holiday season, especially in the summer, we are more like a resort hotel, thanks in part to our prime beachfront, Salmiya location, but mainly due to the facilities we offer. We experience this transition every week, from a corporate and business hotel to a resort during the weekends. It makes things exciting for the team. It is not always easy to constantly manage this change. However, for us, as a hotel it is beneficial because we do not solely depend on one sector or type of customers; we combine both business and leisure.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>Independence is key, but our location is also ideal. The design of the hotel is unique, and we offer our guests a personalized service as a boutique hotel. The hotel was locally designed and one of the owners was personally involved in selecting many of its details. We have five pools and two private beaches. One advantage we have over the competition is that we have a more traditional ethos at the hotel; we respect the local culture and have an exclusive facility for ladies only, “The Ladies' Lounge," which includes an outdoor pool and private beach served by a team of women for guaranteed privacy. The main pools and beach are mixed-family areas.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Last year was a year of assessment, reengineering, and improvements. We have undertaken a vast rebranding exercise, which is having a positive effect on many areas, such as our online presence and physical offerings and services to ensure that all guests are provided with a personalized and memorable experience. We will continue along this path in the years to come as we aim to stay at the forefront of luxury hotels in the region. In many ways, this is thanks to our independence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your role in Kuwait's education and tourism sector?</h4><p>TSCK has always played a key role in tourism and education through its exhibits and facilities, which rouse people's curiosity in science and technology. We are located in one of the most beautiful areas of Kuwait, which plays an important part in tourism as well.</p><h4>How do you promote science among young people?</h4><p>We promote it through touch and feel experiments in addition to outreach programs. We go to schools, do live examples, and have people visit us here, not to mention other programs that bring things to life. This is the way we portray science. As for involving the community, TSCK attracts families. We target youth in schools, while our doors are always open to families to interact through our exhibits and the aquarium. That is how we connect. Over the years, we have had different exhibits that encourage parents to bring their children somewhere they can learn. We have become part of the quest to expose children to science education. Though mostly for people living in Kuwait, it is not just for Kuwaitis. We have been receiving tourists for the last 17 years; when people come to visit the Amiri Diwan or the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS), they come our way. Of course, part of the reason is to see the largest aquarium in the region.</p><h4>What could be done to make TSCK more attractive to tourists?</h4><p>Tourists coming to Kuwait want to see something cultural or unique to Kuwait. We are working on an expansion plan for the center that includes a larger space and exhibits. It will be more interesting for tourists, nationals, and people living in Kuwait to see something new. Tourists in general need more facilities. We could, therefore, attract them better by expanding the services available in the center, not to mention more restaurants and better transportation options. </p><h4>How do you educate people about the culture and history of Kuwait?</h4><p>The idea behind TSCK is that it was built like a souk, which can be seen in the architecture. The second aspect was the idea behind the aquarium and desert, which is unique to Kuwait. We wanted to showcase the environment in Kuwait and all its local animals. We have a boat in the Dhow Harbor, the only one its kind in the country. We are developing ways to bring it alive and build stories around it. </p><h4>What is the current strategy for the years ahead?</h4><p>We fall under KFAS, which is keen to drive innovation in Kuwait. One arm is the scientific center. Today, we have a larger role to play in driving people toward STEM and possibly the arts. The world today is looking at where the jobs are tomorrow. This is partially why TSCK wants to do what is necessary for millennials and subsequent generations. One is more likely to understand STEM through a beautiful exhibit rather than sitting in a class and reading a book. Over the years, all scientific centers have played a role, working hand-in-hand with curricula, schools, and government policy to drive these key education subjects. We also fall under Kuwait's 2035 Vision in these sectors. As far as education goes, TSCK satisfies part of the vision for Kuwait to be less of a consumer and more of a contributor in tomorrow's world. We also want to be a driver for a better environment, which is why we show marine life and stress sustainability. For example, we engage artists to showcase the situation of marine pollution. We also showcase researchers and scientists, bringing them to the center to talk about these important subjects. As we see humanity overeating, overfishing, and so on, we need to be leaders in driving sustainability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your operations in the culture sector in Kuwait?</h4><p>In 1973, NCCAL was established as an independent organization administered by the Minister of Information supervised by the General Secretary. The council's goals are to support different cultural and creative business sectors; modernize and advance Kuwait's cultural structure, as well as its founding cultural centers; encourage reading and creative thinking for youth and children; protect Kuwaiti monuments, heritage, and folklore; and encourage investment in cultural tourism.</p><h4>Which particular forms of culture do you aim to promote and develop?</h4><p>The council aims to provide culture to people of every social background in the best way possible without exorbitant costs. Through its different sectors, the council works to maintain and take care of historical monuments, renovate museums, support publications, encourage authors and publications, sustain the status of agreements, and document the council's associations within other local and international cultural centers through dozens of cultural covenants. The council has achieved success in two different ways. The first is through a number of local activities and features in the last five years. In 2016, the council executed over 820 events, including artistic and cultural activities. Second, Kuwait was crowned the capital of Islamic culture as chosen by the Islamic Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ISESCO).</p><h4>How do you promote reading among young people?</h4><p>The council supports activities that encourage reading and writing among children. In the last year, 47 different activities were held in this domain. Different reading and writing workshops are conducted via specialized sectors or in cooperation with national groups and voluntary organizations concerned with children's affairs. The council provides annual awards through a variety of cultural festivals during the summer holiday, encouraging kids to read and write at the national level. Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah, an organization affiliated with the council, works hard to establish reading and writing workshops for children throughout the cultural season. </p><h4>The council publishes many magazines. Who is your target audience?</h4><p>The council issues two types of publications. The first are periodicals, and our distribution is 678,000 copies across the Arab world, of which 95% is sold. Second, we publish Kuwaiti authors in paper as well as electronically at no cost through the council's official website. The diversity of the council's publications is unique in a sense that it caters to all tastes and interests. The council is also keen to open up to global knowledge and literary production as part of its strategy and principles.</p><h4>How do you support art creation and artists in Kuwait?</h4><p>The council takes great interest in the arts through encouraging fine arts such as drawing, painting, calligraphy, and sculpting; audio arts such as music, singing, and theater; and kinetic arts, which includes dancing, circus, and puppet shows. The council holds the Kuwaiti Theater Festival and the Comprehensive Exhibition of Fine Artists annually. As a way of showing its appreciation, the council hands out gratitude and encouragement rewards for the most innovative people in these fields. The council supervises many artistic centers, such as the Free Drawing Studio, the Modernized Art Museum, the House of Porcelain, and others.</p><h4>What do you seek to achieve through the cultural activities, festivals, and book fairs you organize?</h4><p>The council holds an annual exhibition book fair every November. It is one of the most famous exhibitions in the Arab world and is the second-most important after the Cairo Exhibition. This exhibition aims to familiarize the public with new books and increase awareness of the importance of culture and its various branches, to educate the public, and to use culture and arts for intellectual communication between people locally and internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Master of Method]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-master-of-method]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the company's performance last year?</h4><p>Despite the turmoil in the region, the company's total revenue in 2016 rose to KWD98.6 million (USD326 million) from KWD97.5 million in 2015. The company's activities witnessed growth because of the continuous increase in urbanization, including the construction of buildings, infrastructure, and private housing. In 2016, ACICO invested in its own activities, which resulted in consolidated total assets increasing by 8% compared to the end of the previous year. Our assets are diversified on the basis of geographical and sectorial variation as well as their ability to generate revenue and sustainable income.</p><h4>One of ACICO's sister companies launched the Integrated Smart Parking Solutions project last year in efforts to facilitate urbanization through efficient construction. How is this project progressing?</h4><p>Kuwait faces many challenges in regard to parking, especially in the city. ACICO launched Smart Parking Solutions to help resolve the stressful situation related to parking in Kuwait. It is the first project to be implemented by ACICO Construction Company. ACICO Construction obtained exclusive rights for smart parking systems in Kuwait and GCC countries in cooperation with one of the largest Italian companies specializing in this field. Through this collaboration, we can use smart parking solutions to accommodate 420 cars in only 900-sqm of space, for example. Our smart parking solutions can be customized to meet clients' needs, from parking two cars to over 1,000 cars.</p><h4>What other innovative products and offerings are you introducing to the sector?</h4><p>One area in which we are focusing is not so much a particular product, but rather a method. The method of construction utilizing autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) has proven to be the most suitable for the environmental conditions of the region; notably, its thermal insulative properties and faster curing period make it a preferred building material for these climes. Thanks to its higher insulation quality, it is more environmentally friendly, and also increases energy efficiency of buildings by decreasing costs of air-conditioning and cooling. AAC has been used successfully in various types of buildings such as schools, villas, hotels, and residential buildings, among others. AAC has not only been used in Kuwait but also in Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. The significant growth in demand for cellular concrete suggests that its future is promising. Our position as one of the largest manufacturers of AAC in the Middle East has enhanced our international presence, and we ensure our products comply with the international ASTM standards and German DIN standards. Moreover, all of ACICO's products, such as AAC, cement, and ready-mix, are approved by the appropriate ministries and government agencies.</p><h4>Given your strong presence globally, what is the approved plan to expand in other markets?</h4><p>Over the years, ACICO Group has focused on the industrial sector; however, it has subsequently shifted its focus to support its financial position and market share through investments in sectors such as construction, real estate, and hotels. This diversification helped us to benefit from additional market opportunities and to distribute the risks across sectors while simultaneously supporting the company's growth and revenue. We are currently looking to expand in our current markets, both locally and regionally, as well as enter new markets to capture new investment opportunities. This will be done after studying each opportunity and ensuring its investment feasibility.</p><h4>With expansion plans in place, what are your expectations for next year?<br></h4><p>We expect a better performance for the company in the coming period due to the government's continued implementation of residential projects in Kuwait. ACICO aims to benefit from the opportunities and projects from Kuwait's Vision 2035, which is the strategic plan for infrastructure, oil sector projects, and more. We also expect the expansion of the company's activities in the fields of cement, light bricks, and other industries. Geographically speaking, there are also future expansion plans in Dubai, Sauid Arabia, and Qatar. After the company develops its assets and establishes a solid base of operational and human assets, it will enable ACICO to achieve sustainable returns.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Appetite for PPPs]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[appetite-for-ppps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main milestones and accomplishments of KAPP over the past year?</h4><p>We have reached the preferred bidders stage in two major projects in our pipeline. One is the solid waste treatment facility, which transforms waste into energy. We have sent the project documents to the State Audit Bureau and are awaiting its review. The second project is the Umm Al Hayman (UAH) wastewater project, a large project with an estimated total capital expenditure of around USD2.6 billion. We have finalized discussions with the preferred bidders over certain technical issues to be amended in the contracts, and will send the documents to the State Audit Bureau as well. Hopefully, we can determine the winning bidder and reach the financial closure of this project in 1Q2018.</p><h4>Lower oil prices have strained government finances throughout the Middle East. How do you assess the role PPPs can play to fill this gap and give impetus to the Kuwaiti economy?</h4><p>Governments in the region use PPPs as a tool to attract direct investments rather than solve fiscal difficulties. PPP projects are typically used to offer investors opportunities with a reasonable distribution of risk between the public and private sectors. It has become a tool to enhance FDI as well as local investment and, to some extent, solve some bureaucracy issues in the public sector to develop projects and manage public utilities. By inviting experienced private investors with the relevant know-how to participate in development projects, they can become part of the infrastructure management of the country. PPPs are not a tool to solve fiscal difficulties but to create a new channel to attract direct investment. KAPP can play a role in transferring ownership from the public sector to the private sector in greenfield projects, and in shifting the management of infrastructure projects from the public to the private sector. Privatization has proven to lead to higher efficiency and lower operational costs. The government and investors will reap the benefits of this policy.</p><h4>Are you seeing a growth in acceptance of the PPP model in the business community?</h4><p>PPP is a rather new model in this country; however, Kuwait started creating PPP regulations before other countries in the region. The appetite among investors for PPP projects was above expectations. The attractive distribution of risk enhances interest among investors for PPP projects in Kuwait. The offtake agreement with the government removes the demand risk, and the partnership with the government, therefore, has a high rating from international rating agencies. This is why investors from Asia and Europe are keen to participate in PPP projects in Kuwait.</p><h4>Do you see KAPP as a gateway for foreign investors to come to Kuwait?</h4><p>KAPP has to be one of the gateways for direct investment in Kuwait, though it cannot take full responsibility. Large PPP project capital expenditure is typically focused on infrastructure projects, and KAPP offers foreign investors the opportunity to deploy a significant sum with reasonable risk through a partnership for a long period of time, sometimes exceeding 25 years. Such an investment opportunity is particularly interesting when taking into consideration that Kuwait has a strong solvency status, and these factors have been behind the appetite among investors to participate in the power station projects, the solid waste treatment facility, and the UAH wastewater project. In PPPs, the financial structure typically relies on leverage, and the fact that banks have assessed the opportunities and accepted to go to this level of leverage means that there is general acceptance for the investment proposition. KAPP could therefore be a gateway to attract foreign investment to Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[redirected-toward-renewables]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about the Shagaya Renewable project?</h4><p>We were granted 100sqkm to design and host multiple renewable energy technologies with the goal of commercially producing electricity to be supplied to the grid. Shagaya's implementation has been divided into three phases. Phase I is 80% complete. The purpose of this phase is to collect data and information for investors, which will be handled by the Ministry of Electricity and Water. We are also beginning Phase II now, and it is currently being adopted by the oil sector through Kuwait National Petroleum Company under the name of Al-Dibdibah. Phase II involves capacity installation of 1,200MW of renewable energy, and bid proposals are being reviewed. The Kuwait Authority for Project Partnership is now conducting feasibility studies for Phase III for another 1,000MW or more generated by the private sector; we see great interest from private-sector investors in the project and renewable energy.</p><h4>How do you address the issues of energy security and drinking water in Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait faces a challenge when it comes to water and energy. More than 95% of potable water comes from desalination, which is an energy-intensive technology as we basically burn oil, gas, and expensive resources to produce clean water. We are considering other technologies, especially renewable energy technologies, to be a part of the mix for the supply of potable water. Regarding electricity, the challenge is that we notice greater demand and consumption locally for energy due to transportation, building, and industry. We currently consume about 12-13% of the produced oil domestically among these sectors, and this is expected to rise to 20% by 2020. In addition to utility scale renewable stations, there are other initiatives that have been undertaken by Kuwait Foundation for Advancement of Science, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and Kuwait National Petroleum Companies to reverse this trajectory, and we see more business opportunities have emerged due to these initiatives to integrate renewable energy sources. We have three main goals for the benefit of Kuwait: free up more oil for exporting, protect the environment, and create new business opportunities and jobs.</p><h4>How do you promote reduction of energy use in buildings?</h4><p>If we want to promote greater efficiency with better consumer behavior, then it should not start with renewables but with energy-efficient measures. The problem is the low electricity tariff in Kuwait in general that has caused people not to look into this. We consume about 16MWh per capita annually, which is considered to be among the most inefficient consumption behavior in the world. Given that Kuwait is not an industrial country and our consumption does not contribute toward our economy, then the energy intensity is inefficient. Though, I am optimistic that energy reforms, price hikes in fuel and transportation, and possible electricity price reforms for industrial, commercial, and other sectors will result in better consumer behavior in the future.</p><h4>How will your mission evolve along with the 2035 Development Plan?</h4><p>To reach the 2035 goals, we need to diversify our sources of local energy so that we can export more oil for greater revenues and sustain our economy, which is so far not extremely diversified and still heavily reliant on oil. We also need to maintain Kuwait's position internationally by creating clean, environmentally friendly products. This is where innovation comes into play to make Kuwait's oil products more competitive and more attractive, adding value to our exports. This is the mission that the center is working on with the stakeholders. We are in the mid-term review of our eighth strategic plan that will end in 2020. We are reviewing what we have accomplished and are preparing the ninth strategic plan for 2020-2025. The 2035 vision has to truly be a fundamental part of our strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the National Fund support the economic grid of SMEs and help increase SME participation in the economy?</h4><p>In 2013, Kuwait's parliament enacted a law that created the National Fund to broaden the scope of promoting and supporting entrepreneurship and SMEs in Kuwait. The National Fund's mandate focuses on access to funds and markets, and on providing training and building capacity, as well as providing land. In addition, the National Fund provides other logistical support, such as operational enhancement, gap analysis, and different kinds of training. It also covers various subsidies that allow entrepreneurs to interact within the economy. All these resources and packages aim to transform Kuwaitis from being public sector employees into either business owners or private-sector employees. The second goal is to find ways to help entrepreneurs and SMEs contribute to the diversification of Kuwait's economy. The third issue is to transfer the necessary knowledge and experience from outside Kuwait into the country. The role of the National Fund within those general terms is to provide the packages that allow entrepreneurs to thrive. For example, the National Fund has had four types of pilot incubation programs. In 2017, we issued bylaws to enable private incubators in Kuwait and we are in the midst of introducing the first cohort program that will be supported by the National Fund, though operated by the private sector. </p><h4>What is the importance of bringing modern technology to Kuwait?</h4><p>Technology itself is becoming a huge industry that is overtaking traditional industries. The pillars of those disruptions currently are trends in artificial intelligence and its subsets, which are machine learning and deep learning. These are concepts such as autonomous driving and blockchain, which are disrupting many industries, not just finance. As an international fund, we intend to focus on offering high-quality training programs conducted by the right international providers who can bring their talents to Kuwait and develop the mindset here. We also work with other government agencies in Kuwait to achieve this change. We want to help improve Kuwait's creative and innovation sector, especially in the field of R&amp;D.</p><h4>In which industries do you see potential for SMEs to claim a larger role?</h4><p>Different sectors of the country offer excellent prospects for SMEs. One area is agriculture, and our Board of Directors recently approved the National Agriculture Program. We focus on the business side of the equation and are looking at how farms in Kuwait can generate enough income for farmers to be interested in investing further in their operations. We have talked to other agencies, such as the Municipality of Kuwait and the Public Authority of Farms, and they agree with our approach. The National Fund enables every single farm in Kuwait that qualifies to enter the program and give each farm a small workshop space amounting to 1-3% of their farm size while also providing the financing to purchase equipment and set it up. The workshop will be used to convert raw materials into by-products that have a longer shelf life and better positioning in the market. Through one of our linkage programs, these small enterprises could be linked with larger companies that specialize in packaging and distribution to overseas markets under international standards. This program will help create local food security and self-sustainability to some degree, as well as exports. We are doing this program with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) as it possesses the necessary technical know-how. Besides agriculture, we are exploring how we can get SMEs into the petrochemicals value chain. A third area is the National Development Program led by the Supreme Council that is focused on the development of Kuwait, for example new buildings, roads, the metro, and other infrastructure. We are working to engage SMEs across different sectors in the development of the national economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been KDIPA's key achievements in promoting Kuwait as an investment hub?</h4><p>KDIPA attracted a total of KWD707.9 million (USD2.3 billion) in cumulative direct investments approved and licensed between January 2015 and March 2017. This entailed establishing 22 legal entities from 14 different nationalities focused on the services sector with activities in ICT, maintenance, healthcare, and renewable energy services. The licensed investments are expected to provide more than 1,000 direct jobs for Kuwaiti nationals, as well as a host of indirect jobs along with specialized training programs and supporting R&amp;D efforts. Ultimately, these investments are expected to contribute favorably to diversifying the economic base, enhancing productivity, and fostering competitiveness and sustainable growth in support of the National Vision 2035 and its developmental pillars. Moreover, they will generate a positive trickle-down effect in the local economy through collaborations and linkages with local suppliers and producers. Regarding KDIPA's promotional activities that stem from its core role as the country's promotional agency, it continued to receive several investment and trade missions interested in doing business in Kuwait; participated in official dialogs, delegations, and bilateral negotiations to promote Kuwait internationally; took part in specialized promotional events and exhibitions; and signed MoUs with several peer agencies. In September 2017, KDIPA partnered with the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and the US Chamber of Commerce to organize the US-Kuwait Economic Forum in Washington DC, the first of its kind that brought together various Kuwaiti and American officials and business people to further enhance bilateral economic relations. Furthermore, KDIPA partnered with the Financial Times (FT) and fDi Magazine to launch a targeted external promotional campaign Kuwait Investment Outreach (KIO) roadshows, the first of which kicked off in London in December 2017. Upcoming roadshows are scheduled in Singapore and Silicon Valley.</p><h4>What steps is KDIPA taking to support the shift toward innovation and sustainability embedded in the economic diversification process of Kuwait?</h4><p>KDIPA initiated a national project to prepare the study, Enhancing the Competitiveness of Kuwait in International Indices: Engine for Transformation into Knowledge and Innovation-Based Economy, and listed it under the second medium-term Development Plan (2015/2016-2019/2020). The project ultimately aims to produce a proposed national roadmap to transform Kuwait's economic development path from the current transitional phase between factor-driven and efficiency-driven toward an innovation-driven economy, according to the renowned Global Competitiveness Index developed and published annually by the World Economic Forum. Phase I of this project is completed, and we are proceeding with Phase II to develop a proposed coherent growth strategy that sets priorities, identifies policies, and creates programs that will facilitate sustained inclusive growth and competitiveness to achieve the intended socioeconomic development goals.</p><h4>What are your initiatives for the coming year?</h4><p>KDIPA has adopted a more proactive approach to achieve its intended goals by continuing to implement various promotional campaigns, generate investment leads, conduct investor targeting initiatives, provide continuous facilitation, and develop investor services and aftercare operations. Of particular importance, KDIPA will co-organize the second Kuwait Investment Forum (KIF2018) under the patronage of HH the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah with KCCI, to be held on March 20-21, 2018 at Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre (JACC). This event is anticipated to be one of the largest economic events in the country, which reiterates the government's commitment to attract value-added investments and support the private sector's role in the economy in line with the country's National Vision 2035. In addition, other Kuwait investment outreach roadshows will be organized focusing on key sectors and targeting leading multinational companies. KDIPA is also carrying on with its plans to develop the three economic zones in Abdali, Wafra, and Na'ayem, as well as managing the free zones in Shuwaikh, Nuwaiseib, and Abdali, and the commercial plots transferred by the Council of Ministers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[enabling-progress]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the execution of the Kuwait National Development Plan in the past year?</h4><p>The Kuwait National Development Plan (KNDP) is progressing well, and the government has passed important laws that are critical for the enabling of the economy. Many strategic projects had been signed and are currently in process. Public-private partnership (PPP) projects have been initiated already and are making headways. Compared to previous years, we see great progress in the major projects, mainly in the areas of logistics, healthcare, and higher education. Kuwait University had great progress in 2017 and expects further improvements in the coming year. We also forecast that 2018 will be an exciting year as we will see the completion and opening of long-awaited strategic projects, mainly the Jaber Causeway and the Ahmad Jaber Hospital. We will also witness further progress of the new Terminal 2 project at Kuwait International Airport. The Jaber Causeway, which is currently 80% complete, is a cornerstone project of major significance, though our most vital project at the moment is perhaps the education reform that was initiated in September 2017 and is led by the Ministry of Education with support in the form of technical assistance from the World Bank. For the oil sector, a key development is the establishment of the Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company (KIPIC), which will bring horizontal integration to the sector. KIPIC is in the process of completing the front-end engineering design and moving toward the implementation and extraction phase. Together with other projects in the oil sector, this will further enhance the diversification of the economy of Kuwait. We will move toward a larger petrochemical industry and cleaner fuel. Our Shagaya Renewable Energy Park will achieve His Highness the Amir's vision to have an energy mix that consists of 15% renewable energy by 2030. The potential for solar energy generation is huge in Kuwait; we are blessed with a geographically advantageous position, natural resources, and human capital.</p><h4>How will New Kuwait contribute to the development of human capital?</h4><p>Education reform, labor market reform, alignment of education and the labor market, and the social safety network—together these form the components of broader reform of the national labor market. They should not happen sequentially but in parallel. The aforementioned education reform pays careful attention to the alignment of education and the labor market. Another important element is empowering Kuwaitis to seek jobs in the private sector and become less dependent on the government for employment, and consequently, the country has initiated many enablers. One of these is the National Fund for SME Development, which has a budget of USD6.6 billion to promote entrepreneurship and SMEs. Another enabler is to attract FDI and attach certain conditions to hire locals. A third enabler is the creation of PPP projects, which will shift the labor market more toward the private sector. Our aim is to reduce the size of the public sector and allow the private sector to grow by 2035. The vision of His Highness is for the private sector to lead the economy, with the government having a regulatory and oversight role.</p><h4>How do you expect Kuwait's National Fund for SME Development to create the right environment for entrepreneurs?</h4><p>The key concept that the SME Development Fund focuses on currently is incubation, which is a change of strategy. Before, we used to focus on the project, whereas now we focus on the people. When focusing on the project and its feasibility, one might find extraordinary talent working on a rather humble project. Then again, one might find a great idea that is not led by the right entrepreneur, and this is solved by incubation. That is why the SME Development Fund licenses incubators and leaves the private sector to run them, which will create the right ecosystem for entrepreneurs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[samuel-evans-director-ucl]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the embargo impacted your operations?</h4><p>Qatar has made a remarkable show with the embargo. The country's ability to keep business as usual going in this context is an outstanding example of the quality of the Qatari leadership. UCL Qatar has benefited from that stability, allowing it to continue focusing on the delivery of its academic and research mission. For us at UCL Qatar, the progressive increases we were seeing year on year in our student recruitment were directly affected by the embargo; we are a graduate school, and the blockade occurred in the middle of our recruitment cycle, which usually ends in late July. We always have an international mix, with on average 20 countries represented in our student population, and the immediate impact of the embargo was on regional recruitment, but our international recruitment was also affected.</p><h4>Is UCL one of the few players that specialize in library and museum-related studies?</h4><p>We are the only player, no other institution in Qatar offers any postgraduate degree in similar subjects. Our post-graduate students need to meet UCL's extremely stringent entry requirements, which allows us to attract some of the best students, certainly regionally. According to one of the main global ranking agencies, UCL is a top 10 university globally and we compete successfully with Oxford, Cambridge and the Ivy League colleges. We are not a government-sponsored institution; UCL works in Qatar in partnership with the Qatar Foundation, and operate under our own academic regime.</p><h4>Why did UCL decide to set up in Doha and not China, India, or Dubai, for example?</h4><p>This goes back to the vision of the Qatar Foundation, which was able to bring together leading global universities in one place in Education City. It is the mix and attraction of this international campus, and the significant academic, research and infrastructure investment that enables us to better leverage the UCL brand to help create a unique proposition for the Qatar Foundation.</p><h4>Do your students mostly look for work in their home countries when they graduate or do they go elsewhere to further their careers?</h4><p>By coming to UCL, our students seek a prestigious UK stamp that will take them further. Many people come here because they are interested in studying their subjects with a special focus on the Middle East and would like to practice in the Middle East. However, for international students, their ability to seamlessly move into local employment is definitely made more difficult by the fact that currently their student visas expire two weeks after graduation. Thus, people who want to work here and who are sought after by employers in the region must apply from overseas, and will certainly start to look for employment in their home or neighbouring countries. This is a matter which the Qatar Foundation is discussing with the Ministry of the Interior, and we look forward to hearing on progress on this matter. Certainly a visa model that lets the potential workforce we are creating as an international campus flow into the local labour market will be of benefit in helping shape a knowledge economy. For now, the human talent we are helping to create should be focussed on helping Qatar in the first instance. At the moment many of our students will return to their home countries and will be immediately employable there.</p><h4>Will UCL continue to be associated with Qatar following the school's decision to not renew its contract in 2020?</h4><p>UCL made a strategic decision a few years ago to discontinue its international campuses. In consultation with the Qatar Foundation, UCL intends to complete its current operation in Qatar in October 2020. UCL is currently expanding our London operation and because we are a global university, we do not necessarily have to partner with other institutions through bricks and mortar. We can do it through technology and travel where needed. Thus, we are working with the Qatar Foundation and other national stakeholders on how we can continue our relationship to achieve the same outcomes, through a different operating model.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Qatar's education sector?</h4><p>The next phase of education in Qatar will offer a clearer line of sight between the needs of the country and the education focus. This will be aligned with the development of a more coherent Research &amp; Development pipeline, made up of people who are educated to an advanced standard, know how to do research, and move through the international workforce bringing their innovation ideas to the mix. This is when R&amp;D can take on an expanded role in economic diversification. The Qatar Foundation has been given the lead on two of the six pillars of Qatar's national plan, one of which is Research and Innovation. A great deal of the work being done is about aligning the education system with the needs of Qatar's development strategy, such as diversification, growth, and helping closing the productivity gap through education. Qatar will eventually need to run its own higher education system and become self-sustaining in terms of its higher education population, however, and for the short to medium term, to maintain a critical mass, it will need to think about continuing to partner with the big providers of education. It is a simple question of demographics because the population is 2.6 million and fewer than 300,000 are Qataris. Based on the OECD average, if Qatar aspires to be a knowledge-based economy, 4% of the population must have an advanced degree. Thus, partnering arrangements with leading educational research providers will continue to be a feature longer term. Qatar is rapidly getting there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your contribution to the development of the ICT and other sectors in Qatar through your products and services?</h4><p>Intertec Group started its business in 1992 as the exclusive dealer of Siemens mobile phones. Two years later we started distributing Samsung phones and made it the market leader in Qatar and the MENA region. Since we took the exclusive dealership of Samsung it grew from 100 phones sold per month to 80,000 phones. We launched a dedicated service center where we could honor all the customer warranties. Offering not only the product but also the service to our customers is the story of our success. Furthermore, Intertec is a multidivisional organization with eight business units; we have an interior decoration division that does certain ceilings and partitions, such as Villagio Mall, Sheraton Hotel, and Hamad International Airport (HIA), to name a few. We also have a B2B business division where we install display boards, and 2,000 were installed at HIA. Additionally, we are one of the major food suppliers to the government. The Ministry of Economy &amp; Commerce floats tenders for oil, rice, sugar, and milk and we typically win at least three of these four. On top of that, we are a distributor of handsets supplying the oil and gas industry and the Ministry of Interior. We also have an agency for PAGS access control systems and are one of Ooredoo's main distributors of scratch cards. These are our basic business functions and they are strategic to meet the country's needs.</p><h4>How is being the exclusive distributor of Huawei mobiles in Qatar a milestone in your operations?</h4><p>For the last 18 years we have only been representing Samsung in Qatar and now we have taken the strategic decision to go multi-brand. That is the way the world moves and if we stick to one brand our growth potential is limited. After proving our success with Samsung mobiles, we now plan to double Huawei's smartphone market share in Qatar to 20% by year-end. This target can be achieved combining the quality of Huawei products with Intertec's strong distribution. In addition, at the beginning of the year we opened Huawei's first exclusive showroom in the Middle East, and more will be opened in the future. We aim to leverage our strength in the market and expand our business reach to other segments. In this regard, the relationship with Huawei will not only be on mobile distribution; it has B2B products and we are engaged with it to expand our relationship into other business segments.</p><h4>How will you capitalize on the rapid expansion of retail spaces in Qatar?</h4><p>The opening of malls and shopping centers provides two types of opportunities for us. On the one side, our B2C business units can take advantage of the mall's footfall. On the other, we can do business with the mall itself by selling handsets to the security staff, as an example. We aim to portray ourselves as a reliable partner in Qatar for anyone seeking to enter the country. We are in talks with certain Turkish companies willing to enter the country. We have been in Qatar for 25 years; we have strengths, know-how, and networks. We would like to use this experience to help new partners enter Qatar.</p><h4>What sectors offer the most potential in Qatar for the future?</h4><p>Over the years, different divisions have performed well depending on the market scenario and economic factors. For example, this year the interior decoration contracting and the food business were the most in demand. For the future, the telecoms industry and the food sector, where we have won many tenders, will be key for growth. We are not looking at regional expansion, although we have an office in Dubai to coordinate with suppliers. However, we are always seeking new opportunities based on a country's profile and the changing economic dynamics. We are always open to those changes and take advantage of those business opportunities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>This will be a great year for us. We currently have many food tenders in hand, accounting for over 230 million orders. In the interior decoration division we are executing the final stages of the New Hamad Port. We have a substantial amount of jobs in hand for these two divisions, and as far as telecommunications and consumer-based business is concerned, we are confident we can do well. We have taken on new brands such as Huawei and can only grow as we are starting from a low level of sales.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Mexico’s new Fintech law]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[luz-adriana-ramirez-general-director-visa-mexico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Visa México perform on the global market last year?</h4><p>The company recorded double-digit growth across the world, and Mexico's numbers were even higher than the global average. Mexico has been growing well in terms of consumption, but there is still room for improvement. The Mexican market continues to be heavily dependent on cash; the penetration of electronic payments for consumption expenditures per person remains as an opportunity as it is  around 15%. Although the growth is satisfying, we are working hard on cash conversion through our transformational initiatives aimed at penetrating digital and electronic payments.</p><h4>Why is digital penetration low, and what are the main obstacles?</h4><p>A recent study conducted by Visa to Roubini ThoughtLab found that by transitioning to digital payments, businesses stand to experience greater efficiency, lower costs, reduced crime, more seamless customer experience, and greater sales. In an analysis of 100 cities, Mexico City was classified as a “Cash Centric City.“ The potential net benefits that Mexico City will experience by moving to an “achievable level of cashlessness“ will sum more than USD$ 12,000 million if the entire population reached digital payment usage equal to the top 10% of users in the today. The industry as a whole has multiple challenges to overcome. In addition, education and behavior play a vital role in ensuring a friction-less experience for the public. The market needs to match the number of terminals person with the region; Mexico has approximately nine terminals per 1,000 people as compared to more than 10in Latin America and around 27 in Brazil. The introduction of payment facilitators few years ago helped trigger growth in 2017, and new players in the ecosystem are injecting solutions such as fixed terminals for easier accessibility. Currently, Visa is working on enabling contactless payments, working with merchants on the implementation of contactless terminals and collaborating with banks to issue contactless cards.</p><h4>Is Visa pushing for a direct leapfrog to contactless payments where there is no infrastructure yet?</h4><p>Mexico provides an opportunity to maintain both types of payments. Contactless cards are an extremely convenient method to reduce long queues and for cash conversion for low-ticket transactions, a category that cash dominates. On the other hand, we are working on building a future for the Internet of Things to have acceptance at the point-of-sale (POS).</p><h4>What impact will new payments technologies have on fraud?</h4><p>Security is one of the company's main pillars and Visa has been the industry leader in ensuring security with debit and credit cards, and adding security layers in e-commerce. For example, tokenization, does not show the complete account number, allows us to create a device-specific or merchant-specific token. Another example is 3D secure, which is a dynamic form of fraud detection. In present times, the amount of information available on customers enables us to protect them better. The company is fast moving into Visa ID Intelligence: a technology that uses biometrics and other authentication methods to conduct easy and secure transactions.</p><h4>How do you see the public in Mexico receiving wearable technology?</h4><p>New payment technologies in Mexico equally excitethe company and the Mexican public. For example, the introduction of Samsung Pay was well-received here. The Mexican youth is eager to use wearable technology for payments, as being done around the world. According to a study, there will be 20 billion connected devices by 2020 that could become a point of sale. Besides the technology, we are trying to modify consumer's behavior. Contactless payments are the catalyst for the next generation of payments, and the gateway for the countless possibilities in the world Internet of Things.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the recently passed fintech law and what opportunities does it represent for Visa?</h4><p>Fintechs will have a tremendous effect on the whole ecosystem. While fintechs are more agile in terms of innovation, we have opened our platform; by opening our Visa Development Platform two years ago, players in  the ecosystem could use application programming interfaces (APIs) to get the best of Visa. We have created Visa's Everywhere Initiative, where we bring hundreds of fintech companies to participate in creating projects to help us build the future of commerce.. At the same time, the company is working with banks and merchants on co-creating solutions with the sole priority  toput the consumer in the center of everything.</p><h4>What does the opening of VisaNet represent for final consumers?</h4><p>VisaNet, our advanced global processing network, processes 65,000 transactions per second. In the past, it was associated with physical work, but we are scaling up our capabilities in the digital world. We opened the VisaNet capabilities for any interested party to access it through APIs. In parallel to that, we have created several different innovation centers across the world to harness the collective strength of the ecosystems into creating human-centered design technology. VisaNet provides an openness that allows for faster speeds and additional convenience; we are continuously searching for the consumers' demands and needs in a 360 integrated way.</p><h4>How are you contributing to enhance financial inclusion?</h4><p>Financial inclusion is one of our key strategic pillars in Mexico. A significant percentage of the population here does not own a bank account and we are investing heavily to fill that vacuum. Our goal is to serve all the present market segments with tailored products. For example, Visa partnered with Oxxo to develop Saldazo, which is an entry-level debit card that can be used at Oxxo convenience stores. Another such project, Banco Compartamos, aims to empower women in rural areas by replacing a loan's cash payments with a debit card. We have also developed technological solutions for small merchants. For example, Bimbo helps mom-and-pop stores contend with bigger competitors by accepting credit cards and providing other financial services like top-ups.  Additionally, we recently announced Visa Foundation, which is committed to helping low-income, financially underserved micro and small enterprises around the world to thrive and prosper.</p><h4>How are you working together with Ministry of Tourism to foster the attractiveness of the country?</h4><p>We have a multifaceted agreement in place with various goals. One aims is to increase acceptance rates for cards at tourist destinations. The Ministry of Tourism is collaborating with Visa Mexico to bring digital payments to the Pueblos Mágicos: a select group of Mexican villages whose cultural and natural treasures have been deemed magical. Another important aspect of the agreement is related to information; Visa shares data, analytics and insights on the type of tourism coming into Mexico as well as Mexicans traveling abroad. Through this information, the country can witness growth on the back of richer data and dynamic promotions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Working toward 150,000bpd]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[chike-onyejekwe-ceo-aiteo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your most recent operations?</h4><p>In 2015 Aiteo acquired 45% equity share of SPDC, Total, and NAOC of the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29 (with Three Producing Fields) and the 100km Nembe Creek Trunkline (NCTL). Following the acquisition, SPDC continued to operate the two assets and as at September 1 2015 when Aiteo took over the operatorship, average daily production was 23,000bpd. What did we do? We looked at the portfolio of our assets within producing fields, with four clear roadmaps. First, safety takes priority with emphasis on security of our personal, contractors, and facilities critical to operational success. Secondly, our short-term strategy of sweating the producing fields by maximizing well intervention portfolio studies is focused on low cost, low hanging fruit to ramp up production. Thirdly, rigorous asset integrity activities to revive/replace vandalized and damaged production facilities and well head equipment. Fourthly, we see our communities as stakeholders. By December 2015 we had increased production from 23,000bpd to 60,000bpd. By the end of 2016, we reached a peak of 95,000bpd. Our current production is about 85,000bpd. Being a brown field, with old wells, ageing equipment and facilities with her challenges, a great deal of reviews, spend and work had to be done and still being done.</p><h4>How achievable is your target of 150,000bpd?</h4><p>We have a projection of those activities that will increase production, which are all CAPEX dependent. These are medium to long term activities driven by Capex investment in existing producing fields and green fields that will grow production beyond 150k bpd . The government had earlier in 2017 announced the stoppage of JV Funding and advised oil companies to source for alternative funding, to fund/execute those new developments and projects for incremental production going forward... We know as a Company that we must develop new oil in order to sustain and grow production, we have worked and matured those new wells and associated opportunities that would grow this production. We know what to do to get to 150,000bpd; we have a world class asset with huge reserve base, we have the technical and operational capacities and by 2018, I believe we can start these activities.</p><h4>What role do you play in power generation?</h4><p>AITEO is part of a group of companies involved in downstream, upstream, and power. We are working closely with our power team and government to see how we can get the produced gas to the power plants. Additionally we are looking at other options of how to utilize and monetize the incremental gas that will come from the incremental production from new oil developments.</p><h4>What does Nigeria need to resolve the issue of power generation shortages hindering economic growth?</h4><p>Nigeria needs to generate more power, though it is not just about generation, it also has to do with power transmission and distribution. She also needs to get the pricing along the value chain right. Once these are sorted out , there will be a great deal of interest in developing gas and power. If they do not get the pricing attractive down the value chain then there is bound to be challenges with needed investment in this sector.</p><h4>As an indigenous company, what gives you the edge over multinational companies?</h4><p>Growing indigenous companies is one of the key objectives of the Nigerian content law,; the law among other things is intended to ensure that Nigerians play strongly in various businesses and industry space, including oil and gas. Indigenous Companies understand the terrain better, we are very hungry to make our mark and are very keen to keep pace with technology developments, applications and deployments in developing and growing local capacity. Indigenous companies want to demonstrate that with the experience Nigerian Contractors and Nigerians (in these Indigenous companies) have gained from working with IOCs, they will continue to drive the development of the divested oil and gas assets to global standards, including capacity development of younger ones.</p><h4>Do you believe in the “end of easy oil" notion and what is your vision on renewable energies in Nigeria?</h4><p>While many talk about the end of the oil era, I am one of those who think differently. Africa will still be dependent on oil and gas for many years to come. We do not have a stable power supply or adequate road infrastructure, how will we be able to drive electric cars?. Europe only holds a certain portion of the world's population; our population is increasing and many countries will still depend on fuel and gas for a long time. There are targets for fossil fuel to disappear from the roads, but in Africa there will be a gap of many years to fill. Outside of Lagos, we do not even have good roads and I don't know how electric cars will fair on those roads; even if we had adequate power supply, it will take some time. Though the other types of energy will eat into the percentage of oil-driven cars with time, I believe that a larger proportion of the energy mix will still be oil and gas.</p><h4>What cost reduction measures will companies need to implement in order to adapt to the new era of low oil prices?</h4><p>The era of huge profit for oil companies is no more with us; we have to deal with the new reality facing us. Oil companies are looking inward to determine what costs and processes they can take out and avoid. Companies must start looking and asking themselves, what are those activities that can benefit from faster turnaround time in order to reduce costs. When the chips are down companies are bound to eliminate many processes, though safety cannot be compromised.</p><h4>What is your vision for putting an end to Nigeria's reliance on imported finished products?</h4><p>If we do not have the right pricing at the pumps then investors will not come. People who want to invest need to be able to adapt to the market price rather than a fixed price from the government. We have not had it right over the years because there were subsidies. The government sets a price for the pumps but our costs of production is far more than that. People who are looking into investing in refineries as business will assess if the business environment will be right for investments to make reasonable returns; if the answer is positive, then they will likely invest.</p><h4>What it your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect in 2018 to grow our production. We look forward to having more uptime on our NCTL pipeline for sustained production without any vandalization of our assets or other security issues. We want to secure our assets , work and execute new activities to grow production, maintain our asset integrity and also meet all our obligations . Once we can sustain the momentum, I have no doubt we will be looking forward to a 2018 (and beyond) healthier business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Improving SME development in Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[emad-al-khaja-ceo-injaz-qatar]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Qatar's SME development changed in the past year?</h4><p>In 2017, Qatar was behind the region by about 20%, but this figure has since significantly improved as a result of many variables. The number of initiatives that support SMEs has increased, including incubators and educational support, which is where Injaz has a direct role, especially in entrepreneurial education in line with our partnership with the Ministry of Education. The whole ecosystem of entrepreneurship has developed rapidly, including all the different stakeholders; the blockade provided the last push in the right direction, and we are now seeing the results. Entrepreneurs typically ask: What do we need, and how can we be less codependent? Answering these questions is where ideas emerge and businesses are set up. In addition, one of the main changes is legislation, which has significantly improved to support the SMEs sector. In just one year, we saw massive changes in the entire ecosystem.</p><h4>Private sector companies mentor and sponsor Qatari students. How much of that is international companies versus domestic companies?</h4><p>It is a mixture of different sectors, public and private. We want to attract more industries to be involved in this process and create awareness of these industries and the job market here, especially to fill the large gap between the job market and the educational system. According to available studies and statistics, many students are not employment ready and lack certain soft skills to identify a suitable career that fits their skills. We help bridge that gap.</p><h4>Which sectors need the most help at the moment?</h4><p>When it comes to SMEs, there are many gaps. For example, companies in the local insurance sector are struggling to recruit local talent, and this is also the case in the banking sector. It all falls under same the gap that we addressed earlier, which starts early on from high school. If it is a matter of lack of knowledge, we come in and provide this knowledge and the influence to encourage students to explore different options, even when it comes to things related to the arts, for example. It all comes down to a cultural change that we are trying to encourage, and it is a process. It needs everyone to come together and complement each other to achieve that; it needs different stakeholders, time, effort, and in some cases money. There are three main pillars in terms of what Injaz focuses on: employability skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy. Financial literacy and financial inclusion have become hot topics, and we are working closely on these with the Qatar Central Bank, under the administration of the Governor. We set up a committee for financial inclusion with the goal of catering to the younger segment of the population. Financial literacy is an extremely important pillar and it has been neglected before, and we are thus working hard on this as well.</p><h4>Is Injaz funded by sponsors from the corporate side or does it receive government funding?</h4><p>We are considered as a private entity for public benefit, though our funds come mainly from our board companies. Most of our board members are from the private sector and include companies such as Boeing, Qatar Financial Center, Citibank, and Deloitte, among others. These are the main funders of Injaz, though we also have other non-board sponsors. Partnerships do not necessarily mean financial partnerships because we do have many other partnerships, for example most recently with the French Embassy. We continually seek to partner with new companies, organizations, and affiliations, because the involvement of the employees of that company is essential as mentors. People who represent a certain company or industry are needed as well, and partnerships can come in different shapes and forms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What capabilities have allowed you to build one of the respected brands in the Iranian food industry?</h4><p>The most important variables that help us to be respected in the food and beverage industry are the infrastructure and customization of our licensed brands. From the creation and the design of the brand to the management strategy, having these capabilities in the Iranian legal environment along with the right certification from the government are the most important factors to succeed. The full range of the services that brands need in the food industry are provided by ATA Corporation, and this is the most important focus to attract major firms such as KFC or McDonalds. I am proud to say that ATA is now the leader in the fast food industry in Iran. We have a different and varied share of the total sales of the fast food industry. Due to our 10 years of experience, we have established 35 branches between our two brands, Atawich and Grill Fast Food 17. Our market research is based on the young consumers, and our brands are customized accordingly. Our R&amp;D section renews the menu every six months based on the results of thorough research. As generations pass, the eating trends of Iranians have changed, and nowadays we are moving toward healthier food with fewer calories. In this regard, Grill Fast Food 17 aims to offer a healthy option for youngsters, whereas Atawich targets families.</p><h4>Do you forecast an increase of foreign brands coming to Iran?</h4><p>We had many requests to be the master franchisee of international brands like KFC or McDonalds in Iran. If anyone would like to invest in the Iranian fast food industry, we will help them with full customer proposals. There are untapped opportunities following the sanctions, when no major brands entered the market. In this sense, we are join ventured with MAKPA group. We are the third party, which manages the implementation of the global brand in the country, and we are now in the process of franchising. At the same time, we want to expand our franchises in the Persian Gulf, Turkey, and CIS countries. After the lifting of sanctions, we have had several requests for opening franchises of Atawich and Grill Fast Food 17 abroad. Our products are new for foreign countries in the portion size and the way they are cooked, so there is a lot of interest. We are currently negotiating with some major franchisees in Turkey, Kuwait, and the UAE.</p><h4>How are you adapting your business to global standards amid plans to expand across the Middle East?</h4><p>After predicting that sanctions were going to be lifted, we designed a vision of where we would like to be over the next decade. We have prepared ourselves and adapted to Iranian standards by developing a supply chain system which is specialized for Iran. Now we have an inspection team operating throughout our branches with the main idea of expanding in the Middle East and the neighboring countries. We are also preparing ourselves to be the first choice for big brands such as McDonalds coming to Iran, developing our capabilities to support the franchising process when international brands join the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[A geologist by background with extensive depth and breadth of experience in the oil and gas industry spanning over 30 years, Chike Onyejekwe has worked in various leadership and senior management positions within and outside Nigeria, covering exploration, development, asset management, operations and management. In early 1991, he proceeded on a five-year broadening overseas assignment to the Petroleum Development Company of Oman in the Middle East as Senior Production Geologist/Seismologist, where he was responsible for maturation of appraisal and development opportunities that added significant reserves and production to Sultanate of Oman. On coming back in early 1996, he worked in different senior capacities as Divisional Head of Geology, Asset Development Manager, and Chief Geologist for SPDC, as well as SPDC’s General Manager for Exploration, before being appointed in 2008 as Managing Director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), Shell’s deepwater operations. In 2014, Onyejekwe retired from SNEPCo and has since taken up the position of Group Managing Director of Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCo), the largest Nigerian upstream independent indigenous oil and gas company, which operates the 100km Nembe Creek Trunk Pipeline and the prolific OML 29 block in the Niger Delta.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your most recent operations?</h4><p>In 2015 Aiteo acquired a 45% equity share in SPDC, Total, and NAOC of the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29 (with three producing fields) and the 100km Nembe Creek Trunkline (NCTL). Following the acquisition, SPDC continued to operate the two assets and as of September 1, 2015, when Aiteo took over the operatorship, average daily production was 23,000bpd. What did we do? We looked at the portfolio of our assets within producing fields, with four clear roadmaps. Safety takes priority an with emphasis on security of our personal, contractors, and facilities critical to operational success. We also have a short-term strategy of sweating the producing fields by maximizing well intervention portfolio studies with focus on low-cost, low-hanging fruits to ramp up production. We carry out rigorous asset integrity activities to revive/replace vandalized and damaged production facilities and well head equipment. We also strive to see our communities as stakeholders. By December 2015 we had increased production from 23,000bpd to 60,000bpd. By the end of 2016, we reached a peak of 95,000bpd. Our current production is about 85,000bpd. Being a brown field, with old wells, ageing equipment, and facilities with other challenges, a great deal of reviews, spend, and work had to be done and is still being done.</p><h4>How achievable is your target of 150,000bpd?</h4><p>We have a projection of those activities that will increase production, which are all CAPEX dependent. These are medium- to long-term activities driven by capex investment in existing producing fields and green fields that will grow production beyond 150k bpd. The government had earlier in 2017 announced the stoppage of JV funding and advised oil companies to source for alternative funding, to fund/execute those new developments and projects for incremental production going forward. We know as a company that we must develop new oil in order to sustain and grow production. We have worked and matured those new wells and associated opportunities that would grow this production. We know what to do to get to 150,000bpd; we have a world-class asset with huge reserve base, we have the technical and operational capacities, and, by 2018, I believe we can start these activities.</p><h4>What role do you play in power generation?</h4><p>Aiteo is part of a group of companies involved in downstream, upstream, and power. We are working closely with our power team and government to see how we can get the produced gas to the power plants. Additionally we are looking at other options of how to utilize and monetize the incremental gas that will come from the incremental production from new oil developments.</p><h4>As an indigenous company, what gives you the edge over multinational companies?</h4><p>Growing indigenous companies is one of the key objectives of the Nigerian content law; the law, among other things, is intended to ensure that Nigerians play strong roles in various businesses and the industry space, including oil and gas. Indigenous companies understand the terrain better; we are very hungry to make our mark and are very keen to keep pace with technology developments, applications, and deployments in developing and growing local capacity. Indigenous companies want to demonstrate that with the experience Nigerian contractors have gained from working with IOCs, they will continue to drive the development of divested oil and gas assets to global standards, including capacity development at younger ones.</p><h4>Do you believe in the “end of easy oil" notion and what is your vision on renewable energies in Nigeria?</h4><p>While many talk about the end of the oil era, I am one of those who think differently. Africa will still be dependent on oil and gas for many years to come. We do not have a stable power supply or adequate road infrastructure, so how will we be able to drive electric cars? Europe only holds a certain portion of the world's population; our population is increasing and many countries will still depend on fuel and gas for a long time. There are targets for fossil fuel to disappear from the roads, but in Africa there will be a gap of many years to fill. Outside of Lagos, we do not even have good roads and I don't know how electric cars will fair on those roads, even if we had an adequate power supply. Though the other types of energy will eat into the percentage of oil-driven cars with time, I believe that a larger proportion of the energy mix will still be oil and gas.</p><h4>What is your vision for putting an end to Nigeria's reliance on imported finished products?</h4><p>If we do not have the right pricing at the pumps then investors will not come. People who want to invest need to be able to adapt to the market price rather than a fixed price from the government. We have not had it right over the years because there were subsidies. The government sets a price for the pumps but our costs of production are far more than that. People who are looking into investing in refineries will assess if the business environment will be right for investments to make reasonable  returns; if the answer is positive, then they will likely invest.</p><h4>What it your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect in 2018 to grow our production. We look forward to having more uptime on our NCTL pipeline for sustained production without any vandalization of our assets or other security issues. We want to secure our assets, work, and execute new activities to grow production, maintain our asset integrity, and also meet all our obligations. Once we can sustain the momentum, I have no doubt we will be looking forward to a healthier business in 2018 and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[avenues-of-cooperation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kuwait and Turkey have signed agreements to develop relations in a variety of fields. What do you hope will come out of these agreements?</h4><p>Turkey and Kuwait enjoy excellent political relations. We signed 12 agreements in various fields in 2017. This shows that both sides have a strong political will and determination to take bilateral relations even further and extend cooperation to other fields as well. We will closely follow up the implementation of these agreements in order to realize our targets.</p><h4>In addition, military cooperation was discussed. How do you see this cooperation moving forward?<br></h4><p>In the last 15 years, Turkey has made significant progress to become self-sufficient in the field of national defense, and started to produce many modern weaponry systems of its own. We do not see Kuwait simply as a market. On the contrary, Turkey is ready to share its vast experience, know-how, as well as technology, and to meet Kuwait's specific needs in this field. We believe that there is significant room for cooperation between the two states.</p><h4>Turkish companies are deeply involved in Kuwait, particularly in the construction sector; how can economic cooperation be strengthened further?</h4><p>Turkish construction sector companies are active in Kuwait and the Gulf countries, and are undertaking many important projects. The Turkish construction sector recently won a total of USD6.5 billion worth of projects in Kuwait. When you consider that it was only USD500 million in 2013, you can see the tremendous positive difference in this sector. Amongst these projects is the new International Airport of Kuwait being built by world renowned Turkish construction company Limak. Economic cooperation can be further strengthened by increasing bilateral trade, which amounted to only USD1.3 billion in 2016, by attracting Kuwaiti investments in Turkey and also by developing tourism. Kuwaiti businesses have invested USD1.7 billion in Turkey and there is an increasing trend. We are easing bureaucratic impediments in front of investments from the Gulf countries. Turkey has become an important destination for Kuwaiti tourists, with 180,000 Kuwaitis visiting Turkey in 2016. The number of Turkish tourists visiting Kuwait is also steadily increasing. </p><h4>Kuwait has been working to help Syrian refugees in Turkey; how can both countries cooperate further on this issue?</h4><p>The number of Syrians in Turkey has exceeded 3.3 million. For wide-ranging services provided for Syrians such as education, language courses, vocational training, access to the labor market, as well as support for social and health requirements, we have spent USD30-billion. However, the international community in general has so far failed the test of burden sharing. Only a limited number of countries, including Kuwait, have been the exception in providing financial assistance. We are more than happy to see our friends like Kuwait extend their helping hand to share our burden. We continue to reiterate our call that equitable and meaningful burden and responsibility sharing is necessary. We appreciate the efforts of Kuwait, especially through the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED). In January 2016, KFAED signed grant agreements with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education worth a total of USD20 million. KFAED also signed three grant agreements in March 2017 with the municipalities of Gaziantep, Kilis, and Åžanlıurfa, each worth of USD5 million. In the forthcoming period, we are prepared to deepen our relations on migration and refugee issues, and exchange views in the preparations of the Global Compact processes.</p><h4>What field would benefit from further cooperation between your countries?</h4><p>We believe that excellent political relations pave the way for better cooperation in other fields as well. The Joint Committee for Cooperation is an important tool in that respect through which we can explore new avenues of cooperation. We hope to hold the next session in Turkey in the months to come. For example, we signed Tourism and Culture Cooperation Agreement last March, which will help develop our relations in these fields. We are also closely following Kuwait's undertakings in becoming a regional financial and trade center. Coupled with the Five-Year Development Plan, we believe that Turkish companies and experts will be ready to contribute to these goals. There are certain areas where our cooperation can be further developed such as the defense industry, energy and especially renewable energy, and organic farming. Food and energy security in Kuwait along with the strengthening of its defense capability are areas where Turkey can definitely contribute. Besides, our region is going through a critical period and the current circumstances in the region call for better cooperation and coordination among friendly countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I feel deep satisfaction and pleasure regarding what was produced by the results of ambitious young people who raise the feelings of hope and optimism in building of our dear country. I would also in this regard like to acknowledge the constructive role played by the public and private media in the embodiment of democratic practice and encouragement of citizens to perform their national duty and to promote a positive approach to our core issues.</p><p>I have warned of the magnitude of the challenges that hinder our progress and our permanent pursuit in protecting our national security and stability, while working to make citizens happy, preserve their dignity, and ensure a decent future for them and generations to come. It is a matter of serious concern that these dangers and challenges have escalated and increased. Terrorism has reached our peaceful and safe country, trying to ignite the fire of strife and violating our national unity.</p><p>The growing phenomenon of terrorism has spread throughout countries and societies under different names and extremist slogans, in an unprecedented phenomenon, thus threatening security and stability and targeting the lives of innocent people. The State of Kuwait is aware of the danger of terrorism and its evil motives, and stands united in solidarity with the international community in fighting terrorism in all its forms and working to dry its sources to eradicate this dangerous phenomenon. The above-mentioned fears and dangers require more caution, solidarity, and cohesion to preserve the security and safety of our nation.<br>We look forward, with hope and anticipation, to overcoming the recent developments in our region and to create an atmosphere for resolving the unfortunate differences and bridging the rift with dialog and communication, in view of solid historical ties and common interests that bring together the GCC states and their peoples. We must exert every possible effort to preserve this Gulf entity to remain cohesive and realize the hopes and aspirations of its peoples. We pray to the Almighty that the sincere efforts succeed in preserving our Gulf States and their peoples, and to avoid all that disturbs our strong relations and threaten our security and safety.</p><p>Regarding the relationship with Iran, at the time, we recognize the importance of establishing a constructive dialog between our countries and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and for the success and the continuity of this dialog we underline that it should be based on the principles of international law governing relations among nations, which provides for the respect of state sovereignty, good neighboring, and non-interference in internal affairs.</p><p>If it is our destiny to bear responsibility in these difficult conditions in the region, we will deal with our surroundings and with the world in its Arabic and Islamic dimensions and its regional and international framework. We remain committed to our usual moderate approach as a bridge of peace and love for the good of humanity and human progress. It is the time to move to a new phase of cooperation between the GCC countries that rises to the challenges at various levels and embodies the unity, and strengthens their cohesion to achieve comprehensive development to the peoples of these countries and to preserve their sovereignty, security, and stability.</p><p>There is no doubt that sustainable development is our first and supreme goal in the present and future. It is the permanent challenge that decides the fate of our country and society.<br>The priority of security issues, economic and financial reforms, and confronting the scourge of corruption does not mean forgetting the other ills that our nation suffers and the chronic diseases that impair our society. On the top of that comes the need to develop and increase interest in youth, to listen to them, to share with them, to teach them about moderation, to lead them away from extremism, to educate them to accept the differences and other opinions, and to promote the spirit of cooperation and teamwork. We must open the doors for young people and find true jobs for the tens of thousands that enter the labor market every year.<br>Kuwait assured its commitment in participating with the international community in supporting the efforts of the UN to control climate change through its active and continuous participation in negotiations to reduce the negative effects to this phenomenon, based on the principles and provisions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and subsequent Paris Agreement. We strive to implement these as mandatory legal instruments and view them as a basis for mutual cooperation, taking in consideration the differing burdens and capacities and levels of sustainable development in developing countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your membership structure?</h4><p>Members of the SCDE are presently some of the most relevant global technology companies in Portugal. There are also certain Portuguese companies that are excellent case studies in this new digital world. Some of them are start-ups that later became global in their activities. We also have academic members that focus on these issues. While some are from the University of Lisbon, others are located in Porto, Aveiro, and other parts of the country. We have a far more decentralized approach. For our work, it is crucial that SCDE has the perspective of someone with experience in the public sector. Their experience, feedback, and input are particularly useful for us. We are a diverse group, with a great deal of different perspectives and approaches. At the end of the day, we all have the same objective, which is to make Portugal a more pro-digital country. In that sense, we aim to promote economic development in the country as well as a better social balance.</p><h4>What does your cooperation with top research institutes in Portugal involve? How do these synergies contribute towards achieving the goals of Portugal 4.0?</h4><p>The change can, and should be, made in Portugal. It must involve a comprehensive and holistic approach; all partnerships are, therefore, relevant. The great challenge is to have wider adoption of technology by the entire population working together. Research centers are extremely useful, as are associations with industry, to work more closely with people in the field. We need to be there and better linked with the structure of the real economy. The merging of these perspectives is the most valuable thing we can achieve here.</p><h4>What steps can you take to help foster a culture of innovation in the various clusters present in Portugal?</h4><p>The big challenge is to make sure examples of innovation in the country are not exceptions, but the standard. They must become more holistic and comprehensive. In some global rankings, we are ranked in either first or second. We are leaders in industries because of fantastic companies, some of which are small but win global competitions. Some of them are members of the council, like TalkDesk and Farfetch, companies that see a great deal of global success. Our goal is not only to have local champions; SCDE can be far more useful by bringing greater innovation to all those companies. Those with a family-based governance are the ones that need to transform the most and cross into this new digital world. At the end of the day, all countries need to move and grow in the same direction. That is why our members are not the final target of the council. What matters is how we contribute, pro bono, to our society and benefit the Portuguese economy.</p><h4>What additional incentives need to be implemented to better support start-ups and foster additional growth in technology-intensive industries?</h4><p>Portugal has a cultural problem with risk as well as with the funding of companies. The global financial crisis greatly impacted the banking system in the last few years. Most of our economy was based on funding through banks. That affected funding, though we are currently overcoming the crisis. On the other side, what should be more balanced, which was not previously, is having more investors bringing new capital to companies. We first need to change the cultural approach from investors and the companies from their management side with shareholders and stakeholders. We should start learning from what has happened in other countries, such as the US, to make it less European in that sense. Beyond that, we need to have more incentives to encourage a shift in this direction. Our public-sector system, fiscal policy, and the labor market need to be further modernized to help channel money to these companies more fluidly. We are working on this through SCDE and have clear objectives and concrete proposals already in place. We expect to have new proposals drafted before the next national budget is discussed.</p><h4>What more needs to be done to raise awareness of Portugal's brand to bring in more investment?</h4><p>We are on the right track. We can see the difference between the current state of Portugal's economy compared to what it was during the crisis. Furthermore, we are definitely much better off now than we were before the crisis. Now, globally the Portuguese economy is seen in a completely different and better light. While we are on the right track, we have a long road to travel. For that reason, there are many things that should be done, for example, from the perception perspective. We should help brand Portugal as being the most pro-digital country in the world. We must be extremely ambitious. If we get this label through concrete measures, it will be easier to attract the attention of investors. There are many things to be done. The proposals we are preparing can contribute to that. From the regulatory and legislative perspective, the labor market, as well as other areas, we follow the latest technological trends. Things have been changing the past three years, and they will continue to change. Portugal can follow these trends and also be the first to take concrete actions. If we can do that, then we can position Portugal as an innovator the way it deserves to be seen.</p><h4>What are some of the top priorities and initiatives for SCDE going forward?</h4><p>As a country, we still have certain structural issues, such as our debt, as well as a demographic problem that is fairly challenging. We should be aware that while the situation is better, we have to deal with core structural issues. From the perspective of the council, the core objective is to make Portugal more pro-digital. While it may not be possible immediately, the aim should be to make Portugal number one in the world. We should do this in the next three years. We now face a turning point in the global economy. The challenges coming alongside—AI, blockchain, and other new technologies—will definitely change the business model. Some companies are leading their sectors from a competitive perspective. However, they may not exist in two years' time because of the many rapid developments underway. In that sense, all the opportunities are open. Either we will be the first in line or completely excluded from this new era of economic growth and opportunities for all. The mindset of the country, the political, social, and economic aspects all need to be better understood. That is my first goal as leader of SCDE. The Portuguese people are quick to execute what needs to be done. We must get them in the right mindset to understand what they should do. We want to bring people's mindset to the digital era.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your activities in relation to your mandate to set standards in higher education and quality control?</h4><p>Our main goal is to drive excellence all over the higher educational institutes, and to help universities to improve their performance in a continuous way up to the international levels. Towards this end we build a new set of accreditation standards that response to the immediate and far needs which are outcome-driven rather being a process driven as before. The new accreditation standards are impactful, economic, flexible, and scalable. NCAAA does not work as inspection agency yet, it helps the universities and faculty to build up their capacities and improve their caliber for continuous improvement. We provide training, consultations, and versatile range of support to all types of universities including those established 50 years ago and more, a middle section 20-30 year-old, and the newly established one. Our accreditation standards concern about two major domains namely institutional capacity and the educational effectiveness.</p><h4>Education is considered a major pillar under Vision 2030. What does that mean for NCAAA?</h4><p>It means a lot, where Vision 2030 requires a skillful, impactful manpower, which is directly related to education and training, which is the core business of NCAAA. All the educational institutions, and their academic activities, must be aligned and coordinated in a suitable frame that serves vision 2030. There is a clear shift in student preparation and evaluation from knowledge to competences including the soft and future skills necessary for 2030. The future is rapidly changing and the labour market and the needed jobs and professions in the future is totally different from those of today, and we must be ready, and quickly respondent through student preparation which all serves the vision.</p><h4>How does the NCAAA meet international benchmarks and to what extent is it collaborating with foreign partners to do so?</h4><p>We meet the international benchmarking on several levels including the individualized work on a hand, through the international experts we cooperate with them in training and in external review of institutions, and on the institutional levels on the other hand where most of our work such as the accreditation standards are subject to international evaluation. Moreover, many memorandum of understanding are in place with many international bodies such as Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the area of accrediting IT and engineering programs, as well as many others in the area of medical education. We are a member in ANQAHEE, Council for higher education accreditation (CHEA), and working on obtaining a full membership from INQAHEE. In turn, this will reflect on Saudi universities where we have five universities are included in the top 500 universities in the world ranking, and planning to have five on the top 200. Saudi universities now are the best in the Arab world.</p><h4>How do you envision increasing the amount of research done in the country and what are some of the ways it will be funded moving forward?</h4><p>The amount of research is one of many other concerns and interests where the added value of the produced research, its impact on improving the reality, helping to shift into knowledge society and building the knowledge economy are serious issues we are working on. The newly developed accreditation standards included a complete standard on scientific research and innovation, and we start preparing a specific indicator for this standard to be able to calculate the international indicator, to which the performance of each university could be compared. A proposal for ranking the universities based on scientific research regarding productivity, creativity, applicability is under consideration. Having the link between the scientific research and its applicability will change the funding map and landscape where the industrial institutions will accelerate in funding the good research and this itself will -in due- enhance the quality of researches. All these acts are supported by restructuring the universities and widening the governing bodies and boards. We are focusing now on new directions such as artificial intelligence and other fields that will increase the citation index of Saudi researches.</p><h4>What changes do you expect to the education landscape in the coming years, both for public and private institutions?</h4><p>Universities have to work according to our standards. However, we want to connect both public and private universities to the market. It is now mandatory for all schools to have advisory boards made up of representatives from the market, including large companies and corporations, as well as government. Once the universities are connected—and most of them already are—we do not have problems with future employability. However, the problem before was that every school has its own mission and objectives. Now, we ensure their visions are aligned with the national vision to make sure there is coherence between the needs of the market and all the stakeholders and schools, private or public. This is what we are working toward for the future. Many schools are already working closely with us, though the newer ones are on our agenda for the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[150% profitability growth in recent years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[adnan-chilwan-group-ceo-dubai-islamic-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the development of DIB in recent years?</h4><p>In the last four years, DIB has transformed into a regional powerhouse in the world of finance.  Our successful growth strategy has led to significant enhancement of all key metrics, particularly those around profitability and returns leading to the bank joining the “billion dollar profit club" for the first time.  However, there is more to the bank than just financial success. The entire institution has changed from within. It is almost as if the rebuilding efforts prior to embarking on growth were like a vaccine that not only provided the strength to recover from the woes of the global financial crisis, but also provided immunity from future market volatility. While the growth and profitability make me proud, what truly hits the mark is the fact that the bank had its best performance in times that were genuinely challenging for all. I have always believed DIB had the potential and the prowess, and it just needed the right focus and strategy to unleash these. Today, the market views the bank not just as a performance benchmark for Islamic finance but also for the entire banking sector. This, to me, is the greatest achievement, particularly in the face of tremendous adversity in the form of global economic slowdown, low oil prices, liquidity challenges, and rising cost of funding.</p><h4>How can Dubai further strengthen its position as the global capital of Islamic finance?</h4><p>Dubai's commitment to Islamic finance is irrefutable. After all, it was the Emirate that first introduced the concept by establishing the world's first full-fledged commercial Islamic bank, which I have the privilege and honor to lead today. The Emirate and regulators have since continued to support the development of this sector over the last four decades into what is today, a flourishing industry. Every institution wants to be part of it, including global multinational names and governments, even in non-traditional countries and markets. We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to be headquartered in Dubai. The government focus, not just on Islamic finance but also on the development of Islamic economy as a whole, has been a massive factor in enabling us to break the age-old myth that Islamic finance is a niche offering with limited scope. The sector's growth has far outpaced its counterpart over the years, and the last decade has clearly shown that the segment can not only compete head to head with conventional players but can in fact surpass them in many aspects. Additionally, Dubai government's unflinching commitment to this industry is fully aligned with its aspiration to become the global capital for Islamic economy. Many steps have already been taken since the unveiling of this agenda, a key one being the establishment of a development center (DIEDC) to oversee this ambition. The center has already set in motion various programs to help develop a modern framework for Islamic economies. From a financial success viewpoint, one glaring example is NASDAQ Dubai. The entity has now become a leading international financial exchange for Sukuk listings with the total listed value of around USD56 billion, the largest for any listing center in the world.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand your international footprint?</h4><p>Over the recent past, DIB has established its presence in Indonesia and Kenya, with plans to further grow in the East African belt. Combined with the growing presence in Pakistan, the PIK (Pakistan, Indonesia, Kenya) focused expansion is targeted on capturing the flows between Southeast Asia, the subcontinent, and Africa, with Dubai as the hub. DIB is already positioning itself in these markets as the ideal partner for connecting the three continents. We believe in organic growth, so even if there is an acquisition, we start small and grow from there. Our growth strategy in the UAE has worked phenomenally well, and we are now translating this strategy in the other countries. Pakistan has already turned around with significant increase in business and profitability, and we expect to see similar stories in Indonesia and Kenya. We seek opportunities that create value for the overall franchise. If there is a possibility of unlocking value and a feasible business logic, we will always remain interested. Today, the GCC, ASEAN, India, and East Africa continue to remain exciting potential geographies for us and, depending on the opportunity, DIB could expand in these markets, if the economics make sense at the time.</p><h4>What is the significance of fintech to the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>The challenges in the new digital world are exactly the same for Islamic banking and finance as they are for the conventional counterpart. And so. Like the rest, we should also take this phenomenon, which many refer to as the fourth industrial revolution, seriously. This  development is the reason why the progress in the last decades has surpassed that in the preceding half century by an infinite margin. With changing family needs, disappearing cultural barriers, and enhanced lifestyle, it is inevitable that financial services will have to follow suit and evolve accordingly. Hence, I expect to see more opportunities and many new avenues, though one has to be quick, nimble, decisive, and ready to act. The world is moving fast and technological advancements will only see an acceleration going forward. So, the choice is to evolve or dissolve. The global fintech industry is expected to triple in the coming five years to over USD150 billion, and here in MENA, the UAE leads the fintech evolution with nearly 30% of start-ups based in the emirates. We, as financial institutions, are at a crossroads; we need these start-ups just as much as they need us, so it is about complementing rather than competing. It is about embracing rather than excluding, and it is about using the latest development in the industry to our advantage.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of Islamic Finance both in Dubai and globally?</h4><p>I believe Islamic finance is fast becoming a norm in the financial world. Stats from across the world show extremely positive trends and the existence of high levels of liquidity among GCC investors and other predominantly Muslim markets continue to push the industry northbound. Yet, the real driver above all these is the fact that the myth of the sector being limited to Muslims is clearly gone. Any customer can go to an Islamic or conventional player competing in the same landscape and expect to get all the typical banking and finance needs fulfilled. Investors from all over the world are making decisions by analyzing both types of institutions in the same manner. There are no more product or offering gaps, and there is no more confusion about how the Islamic financial institutions conduct their business. The industry is clearly not an alternative anymore and is in fact globally accepted as a system for banking and finance. Dubai started the concept with DIB and the last four decades have seen the emirate truly take the leadership position in this arena. In fact, the ambition of becoming the global capital of Islamic Economy is going to be another major boost for the Islamic finance industry. As Dubai's government continues its efforts to attract investments in areas such as halal healthcare, fashion, cosmetics and related products, food, and entertainment, imagine the advantage for banks and financial institutions offering Shariah compliant services. While the global expansion and penetration continues to excite us, we are perhaps even more excited about what our home location has in store for us in the years to come.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p>2018 is the final year of our 10-year strategic master plan. The last five years of that plan have been focused on an unprecedented growth agenda. We have been ambitious from the start and perhaps the market was slightly skeptical about us in the earlier years. However, seeing our performance, this skepticism is fast dissipating and being replaced by even higher expectations. Our financial guidance for the year continues to be well above the existing market trends and we expect our market share to continue to grow this year, as has been the case for the last few years. Specifically, we expect our Pakistan operations to continue on an upward trend post the translation of our UAE strategy two years ago. The results have been strong over the period, with over 150% profitability growth in the last few years. With Indonesia and Kenya operations now revamped with infrastructure, systems, and people, we are set to push forward a similar strategy in both markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Improving water efficiency]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jordi-valls-ceo-suez-mexic]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main drivers of your growth in Mexico, and have they changed in recent years?</h4><p>In Mexico, we work in the municipal market, more specifically on building and construction operations with wastewater plants, desalination plants, and water production plants. At the same time, we work together with GE Water &amp; Process Technologies, which the company acquired a year ago. This company is focused on the industrial sector, and for us it is important to expand the introduction of Suez and this technology to the industrial sector. We are currently focused on three main questions; one is advanced solutions that strive to provide technologies and service to water companies in order to improve the commercial and physical efficiency and all services relating to the improvement of water services. The other two are smart agriculture and waste. One of our targets in Latin America is to start a waste business, not only in Mexico but all of Latam.</p><h4>How do you assess the sustainability of Mexican cities' utilities networks compared to other Latin American cities?</h4><p>The operation is more or less the same. Here, there are certain trends regarding the reuse of water. We are working and operating the management of the San Luis Potosi wastewater plant, and the regulator is currently using the wastewater to provide water to the agricultural sector and cool energy plants. This is one of the trends Mexico is trying to spread. The second is perhaps one of the most important challenges around the world, trying to improve water efficiency. In Mexico City, for example, between 50 and 60% of water is lost in the network, which is the average across Latin America. In Europe, it is 18-20%, while in Las Vegas or Singapore it is 5%. It is important to improve physical efficiency because we are in the position to reduce the investment in CAPEX. The third aspect is more focused in the north of Mexico, which is the drawing of the use of water, which is one of the major challenges. This is great technology to implement in these specific sites where the aquifers right now are warm, and increasing the water surface via rivers is difficult due to the international agreement between the US and Mexico. It is important in the case of Mexico to increase its autonomy in the north in order to get water as a raw material and not depend on the US.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the plan to build a water desalination plant in Baja California, and what innovation it represents for the country?</h4><p>We are working to get financial closure on when we will be able to start building the plant. It is important for geopolitical decisions and is the responsibility of the Baja California government and the federal government. This plant is important to bring greater water autonomy to this part of the country; furthermore, desalination is a great technology. An issue is the production, because it is not possible to be the only option. We need more water sources and part of our water comes from rivers, aquifers, and desalination; it is necessary to have a split between different options.</p><h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of public private arrangements you have signed with different layers of the government?</h4><p>It depends on the goal the country wants to achieve and the security that the public sector provides. There are several models. One PPP model is the service contract, where, for example, in Mexico City Suez provides 50% customer service to a public water company though we provide all the customer service: invoicing, metering, network, call centers, offices, and collection. The other is build, operate, transfer (BOT), which are extremely reliable here because Mexico has excellent and reliable regulations. In Mexico in the last 10-15 years the government invested a great deal of money in public-private partnerships (PPPs) and BOT projects and the private sector is involved in deploying and developing water infrastructure. The third is concessions, where the client is the end user and in that case there are more political concerns. Right now, we are working on a concession in Saltillo, where 55% is a public company owned by the municipality of Saltillo and 45% is Suez. We have been working on this concession for the last 15 years, and the results are excellent in terms of public necessity as the tariff is cheaper and the commercial and physical efficiency is one of the highest in the country. PPP programs are possible to put in place if it solves public necessity. If there is no public need, then PPPs will not work no matter how excellent the client relationship or profit is.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind massive water leakages, and how can companies such as Suez contribute to solve this issue?</h4><p>The most important question to solve is physical efficiency. To invest in assets is not enough if you do not improve the maintenance of the network in order to reduce leaks. The first step is to create macro and micro sectors in the network. After that, one is in the position to control the micro sectorization and introduce a specific pressure. We can manage the pressure with new technology (open and close valves) and also to find where the leakage is without breaking the water pipes. One can use,  for example, helium gas or sound; however, in Mexico City using sound is difficult as it is a noisy city.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your plans in smart agriculture?</h4><p>We are looking at this as a group decision, as 85% of the water is used in agriculture and 10-12% is used for residential uses. We are experts in water, and we need to move from the public sector to the private sector. One of the targets has been the industrial sector via the GE Water acquisition, though the second one is to become an important player in smart agriculture. Mexico is a huge market in this sector to make agriculture less water intensive. Chihuahua is the first pecan nut producer in the world, and  Mexico as a country is the first in avocados and in the top 20 of apple producers thanks to Chihuahua (80% of the national production). Agriculture is an important market for us to help develop by introducing new technology and reducing the water intensity in the market.</p><h4>What are your short-term priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>For me, the first priority is to become an important player in desalination in Mexico. The second is to be an important player in the re-use of water, water efficiency, and smart agriculture. The last is developing in this business to become a top player in the industrial sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the value of your relationships with international institutions, and what do you look for in these partnerships?</h4><p>Some of these partnerships are for accreditation purposes. We are a member of the Middle State Commission for Higher Education and being a member of the association allows us to participate in the decisions of the accreditation criteria. Through the association we are developing best practices in governance and institutional policies. Some other collaborations are there for program development and research objectives. For example, we have been running a program where we invite scholars from world-renowned universities to come and teach at Zayed University. We also bring people to advise on improvements to our institution, particularly when it comes to English instruction and the English skills of students. This reflects our aim of always looking for aspects that improve the environment for all students. Finally, we also have a number of research collaborations with institutions around the world.</p><h4>Are there any specific areas of research that you are aiming to be more involved in?</h4><p>As a comprehensive university, we have research strengths in multiple areas; IT security and data analytics, environment and public health, accounting and other business fields, social sciences, and innovations in education and other fields. As we have these expertise, we look for partners who share similar specializations. We have around 250 research projects annually in these fields and around two-third of these are in collaboration with international research partners. Also, there are a number of contract research projects funded by government agencies for specific objectives.</p><h4>How do you assess students' ability to adapt to all these new technologies and programs? </h4><p>Our students are the first adopters of technology, which makes the integration of innovative approaches natural. To further this, we are creating an innovation and entrepreneurship center at the university to coordinate developing the business enterprise culture in partnership with business incubators and accelerators, and national organizations developing the SME sector. The university has a FAB-LAB that was just established at the College of Arts and Creative Enterprises, where we combine IT skills development with design courses and fabrication facilities. The Fab-Lab is an interesting concept because it has 3D printing capabilities for small items, and for bigger items the lab contains an eight-axis robotic arm can fabricate these using subtraction technology. By programming this robot, our students can take images and then fabricate these images thereby carry out reverse engineering. This opens a lot of possibilities for students, who are eager and capable of adopting new solutions.</p><h4>How does Zayed University contribute to the further economic diversification and Emiratization of the UAE?</h4><p>About 55% of our graduates get jobs in the first year, and about 70% get jobs in the two to three years after graduation. The remainder go to graduate schools or work within their families' businesses or simply prioritize family. Our graduates are well articulated, and have gone on to work across all sectors of the economy and in government. A great example is the current Minister of Community Development, HE Hessa Bint Essa Buhumaid, who is an alumnus of our university.</p><h4>How do you go about fostering leadership when designing your programs?</h4><p>The learning outcomes of Zayed University are based on a core comprising the skills to be learned by all and are modeled after the twenty first century skills. They include critical thinking, communications skills, leadership skills including the roles within teams, technological awareness, and relevant IT tools. We use a lot of role-playing, which fosters the ability to interact with a team well and contribute. We also have student councils for each campus, student clubs, and training programs. We believe that students learn though experiences thus the quality of the learning experience is important. Thus, we encourage students to apply their skills in classroom projects and in the wider community, through volunteerism and other activities outside the campus. Additionally, people from the community are often engaged to deliver workshops on campus. By sharing their expertise with the campus, students then get a mixture of experiences.</p><h4>How do you promote the development of original research and entrepreneurship?</h4><p>We have been running an undergraduate research program where a select number of students are mentored by faculty members for 2-2.5 years, after which they are expected to produce an original piece of research. Upon successful completion, we reward them by supporting their participation at local and international conferences to present their findings. Students completing this program are well prepared for graduate school, as they have acquired important research skills. We are going to start a new program in entrepreneurship along similar line in which a cohort will be recruited to engage in a co-educational program to develop their enterprise skills. This program will be complement a mandatory course for all students in the freshman year on entrepreneurship skills, whose faculty have received training at Stanford University as part of a Ministry of education initiative for public schools in the UAE. And will also complement upper level courses now offered in which students develop business plans within their majors, such as IT, Design, Communications, etc.  </p><h4>What is on the agenda for 2018?</h4><p>The university will complete its first round of national program accreditation in 2018. This is a major milestone which will add to its institutional accreditation, and international accreditation by US-based program accreditation bodies. It is noteworthy that Zayed University, as a public university, was not required to undergo national accreditation until recently, thus it obtained its international accreditation before the national accreditation. We look forward by end of 2018 to the start of construction of the new male student campus in Dubai, which will allow the university to offer new programs. This expansion will cater for male students as well as have shared labs for STEM programs and an expanded sports facility. As every year, we will have a seminar speaking about the legacy of Sheikh Zayed, but for 2018 it will take on added significance considering it will be the Year of Zayed. His legacy is about being active in all aspects of life, being considerate, mindful, and tolerant. The University in 2018 will establish an innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship center. Every February we participate in the national innovation month, where activities starting in Abu Dhabi during the first week, go through the other Emirates, and end in Dubai during the final week. During this month, we will have a lot of activities both on our campuses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and out in the communities. We are showcasing a lot of innovations that have been developed by Zayed University, including quality assurance, smart services, and a platform for online courses. Through the Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship center, students will have the opportunity to develop their ideas into viable business ventures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Under which financial and administrative arrangement do you operate?</h4><p>It is an interesting model because we operate through a private trust built on municipal land. The city laid the ground and built the facilities, and the trust participants have either a definitive transfer lasting 99 years or a temporary one for an agreed upon amount of time. The trust has just turned 35, meaning in 64 years when it is over, everything returns to the property of the government of Mexico City, though this will likely be adjusted when the time comes. It works through the fees charged to participants, the toll at the entrance, the parking, and the use of public toilets on a monthly basis. We do not have public resources, but have two structures, a government structure to cover the salaries of those who work here, and the trust, a private structure where everything that is collected is distributed and reinvested.</p><h4>How do you measure the economic spillover that the Central de Abasto generates in the city but also in the wider metropolitan area?</h4><p>It generates an impact at the national level because it supplies 80% of what is consumed in the Mexico City metropolitan area and 35% nationally. This country has a large territory, with different climates; therefore, the products are not from a single region of the country. The Central de Abasto is the second most important economic unit in the country and generates USD9 billion, as well as 90,000 direct and 500,000 indirect jobs. Another important fact is that we have the highest concentration of SMEs nationwide, some 6,000; it is a cluster of entrepreneurship and an important logistics center. It is also important to highlight that in 35 years it has not closed its doors even once—not even during in the earthquakes of 1985 and 2017—which has been hugely important to protecting the nation's food supply.</p><h4>What infrastructure challenges do you face on a day-to-day basis?</h4><p>There has been no need for a major structural modification; the plant essentially remains the same with the flower and vegetables market and commercial plaza, and the supply, reception, and distribution of food has maintained its structure. This plant is the only one in the world that works 24/7, 365 days a year; thus, our capacity to do maintenance work, due to this and our budget, is limited. So, the strongest problem we have is in the issue of paving the maneuver yard where the trailers arrive, which requires a large investment, around USD23 million, not to mention all the time and logistics it would take to not stop the power station. This is why we have urged the federal government to take the issue much more seriously.</p><h4>What strategy do you have to cushion the urban impact of the Central and make its logistics as fluid as possible?</h4><p>Generally, the issue of traffic is complicated because 60,000 vehicles enter it daily. To cushion this impact, we have an internal transportation system called Cedabús. Concerning logistics, e-commerce is something that will gradually grow and start replacing much of the wholesale visit to the central, which will have a positive impact on the issue of pollution and mobility. We have also developed sustainability strategies that are underway, such as the installation of solar panels on the roofs of the warehouses. If panels for all the ceilings were developed, we would have the largest solar farm in Latin America. We also have projects with natural gas and have which accounts for almost 100% of our supply.</p><h4>What has been your strategy to put the Central on the tourist map?</h4><p>The tourist theme starts from a simple logic: it is the biggest wholesale market in the world of its kind, and therefore ought to be a tourist destination. We have added the cultural theme through murals and using the art cellar to present expos and films, for example, so that people see the center from that perspective too. It has been successful for us to participate, for example, in the world gastronomy forum, since Mexican food is an intangible heritage of all humanity. This dynamic has allowed us to participate in important events such as Sirha (hospitality and restaurant industries) and the National Meat Congress, among others. We are closing a deal to have a tourist bus company include the Central in its city tour. In 2017, we took advantage of our 35 years to make a documentary about the central and its murals, present a book, and launch a new logo. All this hype this generated got us an invitation to FITUR in Madrid where we were given an excellence award.</p><h4>How are you contributing to fighting food waste?</h4><p>There are several privately run food banks managed by civil society associations that try to go through the central to collect the viable food leftover that people are not buying anymore. There is another food bank supported by City Hall that we hope will supply government agencies. Recently, we received people from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for a project that we are going to develop with them. It seems they are going to support us so that FAO sponsors with counseling our food bank.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>We want to consolidate the touristic project and to get it recognized for the potential revenue generator that it is. We are also working on safety and consolidating our social projects within the central. We already have the most successful social dining room in the city and brought about a successful campaign called "Médico en tu chamba" (Doctor at you workplace).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Access to 11.7 million patients in Mexico]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alvaro-torres-ceo-khiron-life-sciences]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Khiron Life Sciences started in Colombia, though it has ambitious plans for the rest of Latin America as well. What role does Mexico play in your regional expansion plans?</h4><p>Mexico represents a significant market for Khiron. With a population of approximately 123.5 million people and access to nearly 11.7 million patients for medical cannabis, we see an attractive opportunity to transfer the wealth of knowledge we have created into this new market. Mexico will play an important near-term role in helping us achieve our business objectives, and ultimately it is our intent to be the leading medical cannabis product brand across the entire Latin American region and a major global exporter of medical cannabis products.</p><p>For Khiron's needs, how does Mexico's regulatory environment compare to other Latin American markets that you are also interested in?</p><p>Although slightly more limiting—for example, Mexico currently only permits the import of medical cannabis products that contain less than 1% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the regulatory structure for medical cannabis in Mexico is similar to that of Colombia, in that both countries have—we believe wisely—exclusively legalized cannabis extracts as a means to generate a market for legitimate medical products of the highest quality and consistency. While excluding recreational cannabis and the inherent societal challenges that go along with it, the medical cannabis regulations create an opportunity for innovative companies to develop master preparations, phytotherapeutic products, and “ethical drugs“ that can be distributed to patients through well-regulated channels.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of support for medical cannabis in the country, both from the general public and the government?</h4><p>The Mexican government is taking a cautious and well-calculated approach to the legalization of medical cannabis in the country, as it clearly wants to avoid any missteps that could potentially exacerbate, rather than reduce, the well-known troubles Mexico—like Colombia and other LATAM nations at various times in recent history—has had with criminal organizations involved in the illegal drug trade. The Mexican government's efforts in this area are being driven by a deep and genuine belief that the potential social, health, and economic benefits of legalized medical cannabis could have a major positive impact for the whole country. The Mexican people predominantly hold conservative social views that could conceivably impede the government's efforts to legalize cannabis in any way. However, despite the fact that the vast majority of Mexicans are opposed to the legalization of cannabis for recreational purposes, surveys show that more than 75% support the legalization of medical cannabis. We fully expect support for medical cannabis to grow even stronger in Mexico as more patients are successfully treated for a range of health problems and the body of evidence builds that medical cannabis is a safe, effective, and affordable option for many ailments.</p><h4>What role, if any, do you see a robust medical cannabis industry in Mexico playing to combat against the country's issues with drug-related crime and violence?</h4><p>Khiron is the first medical cannabis company in Latin America to implement US DEA standard pharmaceutical compliance protocols for security and safety. We have a scalable and comprehensive security plan that identifies and mitigates risks relating to Khiron's assets and covers the entire production, distribution, logistics, and operations chain. We are setting a standard that the entire medical cannabis industry can emulate. The long-term viability of the industry and all the social, health, and economic benefits it can bring to the nation—including reducing drug addiction and related crimes—are well worth the effort.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of investment interest in the sector, both from within Mexico and from foreign investors?</h4><p>The interest from global investors in the potential of the medical cannabis sector in Mexico and across Latin America is growing rapidly. Investors are obviously impressed with the scale of the market opportunity, along with a long list of significant and unique competitive advantages LATAM medical cannabis producers have over cannabis producers in almost any other part of the world.</p><h4>What are Khiron's concrete plans through 2019 for the Mexican market?</h4><p>We are looking to submit medical cannabis licence applications with the nation's regulators as soon as the country enacts the final regulations and actively plan to enter the market within the next 12-18 months. In the meantime, we continue to develop strong commercial relationships with numerous medical associations and potential distribution partners across Latin America—including Mexico—by providing the most up-to-date international medical information about the benefits and applications of medical cannabis. This is why we were one of the lead sponsors of the CannaMexicoWorld Summit, held in León in late May. It is our duty as an early-stage developer of medical cannabis products in Latin America to take a patient-oriented approach that includes working closely with healthcare professionals to offer patients safe, effective, and affordable alternatives to existing medications. From a product perspective, we have a portfolio of than 19 medical-grade cannabis strains with full genetic history and suitability assessments based on 10 years of observational clinical data across various indications. From that, we are developing a variety of specific formulations of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) compounds for patients that will be available both over-the-counter and by prescription, depending on the product and the regulatory definitions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 6,000 companies in Jalisco]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[aristoteles-sandoval-diaz-governor-jalisco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Jalisco's long-term plan for economic specialization?</h4><p>It is based on innovation, science, and technology; not as a concept but as a system. The current administration's first action was to create the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology. We carried out a study regarding the changes in technology in industry, like manufacturing, over the past 50 years. Through this, we were able to reinforce technological ideas and conditions powered by innovation and science. Our development plan is based on this philosophy.</p><h4>How has private and public spending regarding research and technology evolved in order to promote your innovation strategy in recent years?€¨</h4><p>Since the start of current administration, we have increased the budget for research and technology from 0.37% to 1%. Although private investment has hovered around USD10 billion across the last five years, the sector requires additional private investment for development and encouragement of start-up companies.</p><h4>Why did Jalisco opt for a “triple helix“ governance model to foster its knowledge-based economy? </h4><p>signed a triple helix model agreement that includes the government as the coordinator; the private sector as the main investor, and universities including public, private, and vocational education institutions, as knowledge and research builders. The benefits go to  society, which acts as a fourth helix. Jalisco has always had great potential and we saw the opportunity to articulate efforts in the government's agenda based on innovation, science, and technology. At present, there is a council formed by all the private and public university presidents working on projects and plans with the government. €¨€¨Guadalajara is known as the Mexican Silicon Valley. How does the government feel about this name or would you like to break away from this tag? <br>We like this name and we would like to anchor it to Mexican culture, history, and society. Nowadays, 15 companies from Silicon Valley operate in Jalisco and the state has set-up the best work atmosphere for the development of start-up companies. We have accomplished our three initial targets: making Jalisco a hub for innovation; making Guadalajara the Silicon Valley of Latin America; and lifting Jalisco to one of most important states in Mexico's food sector.</p><h4>Concerning Jalisco's powerful agri-food sector, what is the relation between innovation, exports, and national food supply?</h4><p>Success was possible due to the support for agricultural research as well as technological investment and development. Investing in technology for rural areas allows farmers to propel future generations to become entrepreneurs. Jalisco is home to Latin America's most important research center for agroindustry. By giving farmers access to investment, research, and better seeds, they are able to analyze the time of year and the type of soil for all the potential products. Due to these steps, there was a reduction in pests and animal diseases. On the back of these innovations, a development and growth model was created; farmers who only grew corn were growing berries and earning 600% more income. We provide help with production, exportation, and commercialization of their products. Through these value-adding steps, we are exporting to 193 countries.</p><h4>Many states and cities are opting for Industry 4.0. What Jalisco is doing differently in this topic to be considered a pioneer in Mexico?€¨</h4><p>Jalisco's gamechanger is investment in education. We created a Council 4.0 with an allocated budget, in charge of checking out the projects that need to be legislated and managing educational programs that suit market needs. From registering the least number of patents in Mexico, Jalisco is now top of the list. If Mexico continues to adopt Industry 4.0, it will be a world leader within 10 years. The difference can already be observed; there are 6,000 companies in Jalisco as compared to 300 at the start of our administration. By further implementing Industry 4.0, we can substantially reduce poverty, violence, and insecurity.</p><h4>What policies has Jalisco put in place to cut down its transport and industrial-related green-house gas emissions?</h4><p>We have achieved this through stringent policies. Rather than following other Latin American cities into investing in infrastructure for vehicles, we have invested in public and alternative transport systems. Jalisco's subway system didn't have any upgrade for 20 years; however, we are about to inaugurate third line of 21.4km and extend line one. Moreover, by increasing the number of rail cars per trains to three, an extra 350,000 people will be able to use the system daily, reducing the number of car journeys by 1 million. In addition, by expanding the bike-sharing system and zones with speed limits, we can reduce yearly greenhouse gases by 17,000 tons. Our broader measures include intercity transportation system, implementation of bio digesters, restoring water bodies, and stricter regulations for companies working in Jalisco.  <br></p><h4>What have been the main achievements and drawbacks of your administration concerning the fight against public and corporate corruption?</h4><p>At the start of our administration, we observed various corrupt practices in place. Since corruption is systemic and not individual, the only way to fight it is by strengthening institutions with autonomy and independence, and empowering citizenry to deal with it in both private and public sectors. At present, there is an Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office comprised of 60 citizens with an autonomy to use budget to enquiry, examine, and prosecute. We have shown that it is possible to overcome corruption with fortified digital processes and a change in peoples' conducts. We have an Open Government Council with ten challenges for different ministries, for example, social policy, education, employment, and security. On the back of these resolute steps, Jalisco was ranked number one in budget transparency in Mexico. We have managed to develop a system where any type of corruption is punished and we are positive about it proving successful in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the reason for bringing several companies under the umbrella of Prime Group?</h4><p>Our key business elements have been in operation for a long time, some of them for around 50 years. Over the past 20 years, key companies have evolved and smaller SMEs that operate in different segments of the economy were set up to support our major operation areas. Each company had its own supervisory board and board of directors; however, it was impossible for the smaller companies to develop on their own. Our shareholders had to put in a great deal of effort to coordinate the activities of each of the companies. A consolidation of the resources of all companies was required to work with second-level banks and various financial institutions, including international ones, to achieve a common goal. We assessed the advantages and disadvantages of creating a group and eventually went for it. We identified key development strategies based on equities of the companies, their HR potential, and available assets. Prime Group primarily focuses on infrastructure projects in transport, including roads, sea transport, railway transport, and possibly pipelines.</p><h4>What is your strategy to bring the company to the market?</h4><p>The first step is to conduct audits and assess the HR, engineering, and financial potential of each company in the group. The next step is to establish a development strategy for every entity and come up with a joint development strategy for 11-12 companies. We will have two to three strategic areas to develop. One of them will be construction in transport, where we plan to compete with other companies across CIS. We want to enter international markets and find a niche there, and to actively participate in transit logistic operations worldwide. We are preparing to embrace international projects and are tailoring our development strategy by considering entering international markets. We established a subsidiary company in Russia, Serbia, and Morocco, set up a joint venture in Bulgaria, and launched a branch in Italy. We bid for contracts in Eastern Europe, the UAE, and Afghanistan. We are also studying opportunities in Algeria and Tunisia. We are considering establishing service companies within the holding to provide technical maintenance to existing roads and railways, including those overseas. In countries where railway transport is at the early stages of its development, such as the UAE and Afghanistan, there is a need for a complex build, operate, and transfer (BOT) approach from design and construction to commissioning and maintenance. Companies that can provide such a set of services will definitely benefit in such markets.</p><h4>How much of your strategy is based on the New Silk Road project?</h4><p>The development of the New Silk Road project is an initiative by China that was widely supported in neighboring countries. New Silk Road infrastructure in Kazakhstan has been largely completed and includes a fully revamped road connecting Western China with Western Europe, with works set to be completed in 2018. As for a railway network to support the initiative, there are two new border checkpoints commissioned. In 2019, our company will finish construction of second seaport at Kuryk that will handle increasing amount of transit freight from Asia to Europe via the Silk Way. That will be done through Kuryk, Baku, Tbilisi, and the Black Sea. However, our vision of the New Silk Road extends far beyond Kazakhstan. Looking at the Balkans, for example, we studied opportunities in Bosnia, Macedonia, and Croatia, and eventually came across privatization in Serbia that we took part in. This way we created a base of operations across Eastern Europe in Novi Sad (Serbia), which is a fully operational company with 300 employees. It is the only company in the former Yugoslavia that has a full set of mechanisms, talent, and technical base for construction and maintenance railway tracks. There is no single company similar to this in Bosnia, Croatia, or Macedonia. With the acquisition of this company, we gained access to the regional market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind grouping all your companies' real estate assets together to create Mercury Properties?</h4><p>The main reason for creating Mercury Properties was to start a company that could professionally manage real estate assets. Our shareholders thought our properties were undermanaged, so the decision to create Mercury Properties was made to manage them and establish a strategy and operational model to increase our shareholders' value. In many ways, it was a vision that gave rise to a more professional real estate market in Kazakhstan, which was quite missing from the local industry. When we started the company, our total real estate assets accounted for 270,000sqm, while today the figure reaches more than 600,000sqm. Clearly, while small assets require a lot of resources, the revenue they generate is often low, so we chose to focus on assets of over 10,000sqm. These larger ones can also be of interest to institutional investors. We want to create a company with the kinds of assets and management approach that suit potential investors.</p><h4>Which segment of the real estate market have you focused on over the past 12-18 months? </h4><p>Recently, we have been focusing particularly on logistics, which led us to acquire another warehouse in Almaty. We see real potential in logistics, as there are no new assets under construction now. As Kazakhstan's GDP is gradually increasing, so is the interest in logistics. We recently completed the acquisition of ALG Company, a large logistics operator with a warehouse area of over 48,000sqm. We have also considered opportunities in Karaganda and Aktobe, but these cities sometimes offer a big gap between the current owner's price expectation and how we value the asset. In general, we consider any assets that can give us a good rate of return. To illustrate, we recently bought Car City, a C-class property in Almaty, because of the brand. A 27,000-sqm trade center, Car City is well known for being a place that offers anything for cars. Looking at the retail sector, there are too many shopping malls and centers, particularly in Astana, and the sector is too volatile. In the mid to long term it will affect everybody in the market because this is a new concept, a new way of shopping and delivering entertainment. This will negatively affect any shopping centers that have a weak concept, selection of outlets, or building. Comparable to business centers, we acquire and upgrade them to increase the value and attract better tenants. For example, we changed a business center in Almaty from class C+ to B+ by upgrading the exterior, interior, parking, and management. We put in electronic key access for parking and have an app for contacting the management company. We also invited more affluent tenants to move in, such as Tengri Bank and several multinational companies. So, we invested a considerable amount there and we saw our revenue go up as a result. Most importantly, revenue fluctuations were minimized.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans at Mercury Properties for 2018?</h4><p>Our strategic objective is to keep every asset in our portfolio for now; this has been our approach since 2014. Naturally we intend to wait for increased profitability and then sell, but our shareholders want to keep their assets. At some point, we need to think about what to do next and have started to consider Southeast Asia's capital markets to raise financing for future projects. Our whole group is audited by EY according to international financial and accounting standards. We have established a good operating model and have a good track record in acquiring assets and improving them. We also have a strong record in our internal rate of return. Unfortunately, our local banks are limited, and finding local sources of financing for the group is our biggest problem. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Come Together]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohammad-al-hawari-executive-board-member-managing-director-takaful-emarat]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Takaful Emarat concept and business model?</h4><p>The word takaful means “come together" or “be responsible for each other." Insurance is actually also the same concept. Back in the day, the origins of insurance were everyone coming together to put a little money in a pot to create a fund. In case anything unforeseen happened to someone in the community, everyone was there to support each other. Nowadays, customers do not understand the jargon and have stopped trusting the industry. Insurance companies collect money from their customers to pay claims later, their profit is based on the difference between the claims and the money they collect; that surplus is where they make their profit. With takaful, we are bringing people together to pay into a fund, and simply taking a 20% fee from that. From the remaining 80% we pay out claims for sickness, accidents, and so forth. However, unlike standard insurance companies, we give back whatever we have not used. It is simply ethical insurance, based on sharia principles. While you pay into the fund, you are not only helping the community, but you are also insured in terms of risk. In the end, you might get a portion back.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans inside the UAE and regionally?</h4><p>We have an ambitious goal. By 2020, we want to franchise what we have here into the Middle East, including both the GCC and Egypt. Entering new markets with insurance is always difficult because we have to have a license. We might partner with insurance companies in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, for example, through co-branding. That is organic growth for us. However, what we have done recently is inorganic growth through acquisition. Our acquisition of Al Hilal Takaful has opened up the doors for us into segments other than life and health: general insurance. We are excited about the general insurance space, there is room to grow in a segment where we can insure anything.</p><h4>To what extent is Takaful Emarat embracing new technology such as blockchain?</h4><p>We have two methods we plan to use. One is to create a digital platform. We would like to become the Uber of insurance; a platform where we do not need anyone working in the areas we have launched. We would like it to be scalable so that we can link up with anyone working around the world. We want to make an easy-to-use product for our insurance. It could be something like an app that notifies a customer after buying something expensive like a TV with an insurance offer. Secondly, we would like to see technology that can help us do a risk-based analysis. If there are two people with Porsches of the same color and both drivers are the same age, but one is a poor driver, how will we know which to insure? We can either put a chip in the car or an app that can tell if someone is speeding or braking too hard or not using their turn signals. Based on positive driving behavior, premiums can be lower. Lower premiums translate into lesser claims. This digital platform can actually help us determine how much to charge, but it also helps drivers think carefully about how they want to drive. With our recent new brand launch of 'tlife' for our life and health business and 'tinsure' for our general insurance business (post completion of the acquisition of Al Hilal Takaful), we are now giving our customers and partners a fresh perspective. Amusingly, our employees now refer to me as “Mr.t"! What's more, this isn't just a cosmetic update, there has been a tremendous amount of work that has gone into digitalizing our offering including launch of new websites for our existing business and the acquisition of Al Hilal Takaful, introduction of a new enhanced health product that is sold and fulfilled digitally end-to-end, introduction of Tbo, our new intelligent chat bot available across all our websites, a vibrant online community aimed at improving lifestyles, health and wellness of our members and beyond. We are also working on native mobile applications that will further add to our omni-channel customer experience and the overall digital ecosystem.</p><h4>Takaful Emarat aims to be the first takaful company in the world incorporating blockchain. What does this mean for the company?</h4><p>The number-one issue in the insurance industry is that customers do not trust their insurers. They do not trust them to pay a claim and they feel like it will be a hassle to get the claim paid out. Insurance companies also do not trust their customers because they are always suspicious that there is fraud going on. We believe that blockchain will solve that. It creates authenticity and trust. Additionally, there will not be paper anymore. We will get into smart contracts that will not be transferable and they speak only to the specific client's needs and do not require signatures. We will not have to manually check records anymore. Everything is going to cost a lot less as well. That is why we want to be the first to roll it out.</p><h4>How will the digital revolution impact the Takaful insurance business?</h4><p>We believe it is the digital component. Agents will be obsolete, and chat bots and automated call center operations are going to become the new norm. We make it an attractive product and pull people in without using agents. That is really where the difference is. We need to sell with a combination of IT, big data, analytics, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. We are in an age where we are about to see huge changes in the industry. With the appointment of Fadi Hindi as Takaful Emarat's new CEO this year, we have set the stage for something special that will completely change the way people and businesses look at insurance. Fadi brings in an ocean of knowledge and expertise from his successful appointments at DEWA, Smart Dubai and NBAD to name a few. We also recently hired a Chief Digital Officer, a full Marketing department and an IT team. We honestly believe we need data and IT specialists for the future, not financial experts. The final piece is R&amp;D. We need someone who is always on top of what is coming next and can help us improve the next version of our company. I always push people to think about innovation. I think innovation is what has never been done before, what I will invest in, and where I will be the first. If I do not have these three things aligned, it will not be me; somebody else will do it if I do not. We want to innovate and change the mindset. There is the saying, “Uber yourself before you get Kodaked."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2017 for TECNASA?</h4><p>It was a challenging year for the country and its socio-economic status in the region. TECNASA is a company that has been able to diversify its risks by expanding geographically. So, when one country in the region faces economic difficulties, we have other geographic locations that are able to grow and compensate for it. We are a company that has consistently been growing throughout our 45 years of history. Our market share depends on the service and solutions we provide. One of our most important solutions throughout the region are the financial solutions and ATM's, especially in Panama where we cover over 80% of the market. We also have over 2,000 clients in the region that are the most important companies in each their respective industries. We are a business-to-business company focused on mid to large-sized enterprises.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand into new markets? </h4><p>Our vision has always been to become a regional leader in IT solution integrations. In 2017, we analyzed that TECNASA has become the IT solutions leader in Central America and Ecuador. After more than two years of planning, we launched our new strategy in 2017, which is focused on managed services. It is not a strategy based on geographic expansion but on improving the quality of our services and transforming our portfolio from the hardware sales to service solution implementation. Our strategy is also based on becoming consultants for our clients and helping them understand the new disruptive technologies present in the market and how it can help them improve their business operations.</p><h4>Are IT companies getting more into IT services instead of hardware?</h4><p>It is no longer a trend, but a fact—and not only for services focused on repairing the technology, but the entire solution for a monthly fee. Then, it is up to us as their technology partner to make sure these solutions are available 100% of the time.  </p><h4>How is TECNASA University progressing?</h4><p>We are launching it with 13 online courses focused on customer services. These are courses that every new recruit for the company has to take when they join as new associates so they can understand our new vision and mission and see how we are becoming a management services and consultancy company.</p><h4>TECNASA has received multiple awards recently. What do these mean for the company?</h4><p>It is a result of our hard work and a benchmark for how TECNASA compares to competitors in the region. We strive to be the best at everything we do, and that includes our partnerships with the most important IT leaders in the world. These awards show that the company is on the right track.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve for Panama and the region? </h4><p>We have a five-year strategy that we want to incorporate into the entire region in order to deliver the best integrated technology to the entire region. Therefore, our challenge is being able to evolve and grow our human talent up to the company's and its clients' expectations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over its 20 years in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The entire pharmaceutical market in Kazakhstan has evolved quite distinctively over the past two decades, and in particular, we are making amazing strides in the healthcare segment. In Central Asia, Kazakhstan is by far the leading country in terms of people's access to quality healthcare, though there is still some room for improvement. Sanofi has been in the local market for 20 years. During this time, the company has evolved considerably globally: we have completed several mergers and acquisitions that have helped us become who we are today with a diverse and strong portfolio. Today, we have about 200 types of products in Kazakhstan and almost every citizen has come into contact with our products or used them at some point, even if they do not necessarily know that Sanofi produced that product.</p><h4>How would you describe your product portfolio in Kazakhstan today?</h4><p>We have a diverse portfolio in Kazakhstan with a focus on five main areas: vaccines, diabetes, cardiovascular, rare diseases, and over-the-counter medicines. In recent years, we have been particularly focused on Sanofi Pasteur vaccines and have an absolute leading market share in this segment, which is crucial as almost every child in the country has been vaccinated. Another focus area is diabetes. In this area, we have a full range of products. Cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rate is particularly high in Kazakhstan and we have a broad portfolio for CVD treatment too. We take care of rare diseases with products that are often needed by just a handful of patients. We also have an over-the-counter portfolio, with some of the products being in Kazakhstan for 50 years.</p><h4>How important is Central Asia as a whole and Kazakhstan specifically for Sanofi?</h4><p>Emerging markets are growing at high single-digit—or even double-digit—rates. The pharmaceutical industry and healthcare business are highly connected to overall GDP growth. We identify Kazakhstan as one of these markets that are expected to grow, and we expect the healthcare industry to open up to new opportunities as well. Thus, as a business we want to grow faster than the market. It does not mean we could open up Kazakhstan as a production hub—prices here are fairly high for the products that are produced locally and are more expensive than products from Europe or elsewhere. Production requires investment in infrastructure and innovation, and as a relatively small market in terms of population size, such a move would not be economical for Sanofi or patients at this stage. However, if we can bring true value to patients by having local production, then that is something I am happy to look into in the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We had a difficult year in 2015 after the sharp devaluation of the tenge. However, we recovered in 2016 and established fairly strong growth trajectory for 2017. I hope this trend continues and we are working tirelessly to support our leading position in the market. An excellent year for us is not only related to revenues; we are also keen to bring innovation and new products to the market and our patients. We have several interesting products at affordable prices that we aim to introduce to the Kazakhstani market in 2018 and if we can do that, it will surely be a strong year. Kazakhstan will be an interesting market for Sanofi as we are well established here, and we have a long heritage and an outstanding reputation. We are not here for the short term. We want to continue to build our partnerships, which are now moving into the third decade. Innovation is certainly part of this strategy, though it is not easy to implement, and we want to ensure our organic growth here. Nonetheless, the future is bright because the country is growing and, as it does, the healthcare sector will evolve as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the EFKO Group's decision to establish operations into the oil and fat crop segment in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>EFKO has been present in the Kazakhstani market for 15 years now; however, before 2015 our operations were mainly focused around the export and distribution of goods produced in Russia. Gradually we realized we needed to localize production for further development. Besides, the investment climate of Kazakhstan is one of the most favorable in the world. In 2015, at the Foreign Investors Council, we presented a project to create an oil and fat cluster in Kazakhstan, which President Nazarbayev approved. Our business model is a vertically integrated one, and the production process includes the full cycle, starting from the fields to the final products ready for retail. Two stages of the oil and fat cluster project can be outlined: the first is the reconstruction and modernization of our oil and fat production facility. The last phase was completed in 4Q2017 and required an investment of about KZT11 billion (USD32.67 million). During this renovation period, we also managed to create 750 new jobs locally and all this allowed us to establish a local production in a fairly short amount of time. We also plan to invest KZT7 billion (USD20.79 million) into the second stage, which includes creating a network of service manufacturing centers in Almaty region that will provide a wide range of services for growing soy in the region.</p><h4>How do you expect your production portfolio to develop in Kazakhstan compared to operations in Russia?</h4><p>Currently, in Kazakhstan we process oilseeds and produce the value-added products on their basis: the vegetable oils in bulk and packed; oilseed meals, which are used as animal feed ingredients; and specialized fats and margarine. Due to the technology transfer from Russia, Kazakhstan went from being a net importer of oil and fat products to a net exporter. Around 40% of the manufactured production is sold for export while 60% remains in the local market. According to the results of 2017, the total volume of oilseeds processing was 32,000 tons, oils in bulk realization increased by three times, and specialized fats and margarine realization increased by 35%. In addition, a sunflower oil press factory started production. Also, there is an actively growing export flow to countries in Central Asia such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The other EFKO products that are popular—mayonnaise, ketchup, and dairy and fermented milk products—are currently not being produced in Kazakhstan yet, and we import them from Russia.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>We hope 2018 will be even stronger for us, especially in soybean processing market. On top of this, the new state program aimed at developing agricultural industry for 2017-2021 has a special focus on oil crops. In the following five years, total sown area will be enlarged by 600,000ha, 126,000ha of which will be located in Almaty. To balance the disproportion between the production capacities and the gross yield, we need at least 70% of that land to be allocated for oil crops. The major goals for us will be to increase crop yields and the gross harvest through our collaboration with the local agriculturists. Taking into consideration all the mentioned programs, the government's special attention to the sector, and our own plans, we are optimistic about the future despite some unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. We have the support of the government and therefore, in five years, we expect to be able to allocate 20,000 tons of high-quality fats used in food industry for export. We also hope the subsidiary amount for each kilogram of a grown product will be increased, so that farmers can receive the necessary financial support, and it also will reduce the raw materials' export from the Republic. Today, the key goals are to secure the safe food production and to expand the republic's export potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background behind the creation of Bayserke Agro? </h4><p>Around 10 years ago, I first started my activities in agriculture. After speaking with the President, we decided it was important to build a farm that would be an example to other farmers for how to do business in agriculture. While our country is blessed with great agricultural potential, it is difficult to develop without the use of cutting-edge technologies. People know how to work the land and sow, though they do not know that there are new revolutionary technologies beyond our borders that could increase output 10 fold. The future of agriculture is all about technology; therefore, we are actively investing in new equipment.</p><h4>How do you separate the different strands of businesses and what is the company's main focus?</h4><p>We have different divisions and focus areas for the holding. For example, we have a greenhouse in Shymkent of 4ha together with a South Korean company. It is run using the most advanced technologies because there is a shortage of land in South Korea and they are extremely effective in green housing. They have even surpassed Israeli technology, which was considered the best. We are also renowned for our milk farming. We invest in breeding the best cows for milking, which can produce up to double or triple the amount of milk as normal milking cows, which typically produce around 10 to 15 liters a day. Dairy farming is extremely important to us, not only because of our high margins and efficiency, but also because it supports our liquidity day in, day out. Unlike with pastoral or crop farming, where one sows the seeds and waits full seasons for it to be harvested and then sold, with milk we bring in money around the clock. With meat there is a similar story. What is happening here in Kazakhstan is that farmers get the birth in the spring and in the next year start selling, so there is a huge bulk of meat in the November-December period, whereas later on in the year there is a shortage of meat. That is why Kazakhstan is slow in developing in meat; however, we are now changing the system in line with practices from many developed countries. For example, we are applying insemination technology from bulls in Europe and Canada, which are in better condition. This is just one example of our different divisions in agriculture that involve international technologies and best practices, but in general Bayserke Agro covers all the major divisions of the industry.</p><h4>Why do you think Bayserke Agro is of such strategic importance to the country?</h4><p>We are bringing both knowledge and technology that we are adapting and implementing here, and spreading it around the country. We are also teaching; we are working closely in collaboration with two new universities in Almaty and Astana. We are pushing them to change the education system because students have strong academic knowledge; however, their practical understanding of agriculture is low. If we want to make quick progress in agriculture, we need people who can come in and start working and know these new technologies before they have entered the workplace. Young people's minds are wide open and when they see exciting technologies and their implementation, they are inspired and can inspire back with their own fresh ideas. It is important to involve them in this vision for our country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in 2018?</h4><p>We are growing and bringing new partners to Kazakhstan. We are studying and expanding, not only in terms of size but also new technology, so we are going deeper. Our genetic laboratory project could dramatically change the livestock business; it will give us a 20-year step forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of the university and the philosophy upon which it was conceived?</h4><p>The basic idea of the university is to provide knowledge of business practices, thus creating new generational enterprises. In 1992 the government of Kazakhstan initiated a policy for the growth of labor markets. At the time there was an economic restructuring of the country and our university was created to establish businesses and help people be better prepared for this trend. Today, we are transferring this idea into the new generation, providing knowledge in the digital space, e-commerce, and so on. For people who want to start a business, they must understand the rules, the new business models, and more, and in the next five years our university will provide fresh recruits who can design or redesign businesses according to today's market demands. Our basic focus area is on the new generation of knowledge based on multi disciplines, such as finance plus management, ICT plus marketing, and more; that is the basic core of our educational programs. This program is helpful for our alumni and it also helps the research activities of our teaching staff. We work closely with a number of top companies in these fields, for example Alibaba, Yandex, and so on because collaborating with these companies is helpful in terms of case studies. In the future, our students will also have the opportunity to do an internship with these companies, thus enhancing their employability.</p><h4>How active are you in ensuring that your students are employable?</h4><p>The employability of our students currently is 73%; however, no university in the world can provide 100% employability of its students, because this is not the role of a university per se. We have a specific center that provides a special service for our students in our university. Every year we organize activities such as job fairs, internship placements, and the like. Our work with partners from the private sector consists of two components: we invite the staff of these companies to give lectures to our students, and we also design educational courses that cover the cases of those companies. As an ICT specialist, I know many people who work in this sector, so I invite them for sessions in fields such as e-commerce or digital marketing. We offer our students special digital-oriented educational discipline, which is helpful and attractive, while companies and enterprises help us provide these services and, crucially, a sense of direction about where the industry is heading.</p><h4>Around 40-60 UIB students are sent annually to East Asia or European universities for programs. How important is this aspect for you and what is your strategy going forward?</h4><p>Internationalization or international work is extremely important for our university; it is today's main activity. International business depends on the activity of the entire region, and Kazakhstan's location, between Asia and Europe, is our main strength. We want to work together with Asian, South Korean, Japanese, and Chinese universities, as well as those from Europe, Canada, and the US, to establish those links and have a better understanding of these markets for our students. Currently, we have a special strategic project from our ministry, which is an educational hub in Central Asia. We have a home program designed as a special educational program for Chinese or East Asian students. This is because if we can organize educational programs with international students, it becomes helpful to design special communities that are attractive to our Kazakhstani students, who mainly want to study abroad but may not have the means because it is expensive. Thus, our relations with companies and other universities in Asia, Europe, and even America are essential for us.</p><h4>What are your key objectives and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our university's strategy is close to the country's development plans. Recently, our president presented a new economic policy for the next five years, and we want to prepare our students to face these new challenges and help the country develop at a faster pace. If we can organize all our activities well, we can transfer the knowledge from China, Europe, and so on. We must access all this knowledge and apply it here in our country, and this is what we are aiming at for our students in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Digitalizing Portugal’s Economy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[digitalizing-portugals-economy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent can ICT boost the competitiveness and modernization of the Portuguese economy?</h4><p>The IT and ICT sectors are revolutionizing and disrupting all industries. The question is not if ICT will disrupt business, but when and how much it will change some particulars of the market. For example, in the last seven to eight years the media and entertainment sector in Portugal lost 40% of its advertising revenue. Digitization is basically a revolution; if we talk solely about technology-related transformations, we had the agricultural, the industrial, and now the digital revolution. The difference is that the digital revolution transforms business and society in a much shorter timeframe than previous revolutions, which took hundreds of years. The first part of the digital revolution was the appearance of computers that could take over support functions for businesses. However, the real revolution started in the last 20 years when businesses were completely transformed due to the exponential growth of several variables that have been maintained from 1958 to date. If we applied this same rate of exponential technology growth to, for example the automotive industry, a car that could travel at a maximum of 60mph in 1958 would reach Mars in a matter of seconds today. Feats that were impossible 20 or 30 years ago are now easy as a result of the available computing power.</p><h4>What impact did opening up APDC's membership to other sectors of the economy beyond media and technology companies have on its membership base and activities?</h4><p>APDC could not close itself off from other sectors because IT and communications technology are transforming these areas as well. It is extremely important for other players and sectors to talk with us. In addition, most of our members' clients are in other sectors, not just in ICT and media. The response we have had is extremely interesting. At our last congress in 2017, half the delegates and companies were from our sector while the other half were from other sectors. This is a huge transformation for us. Now, we plan to give associate status to companies in other sectors that want to network with our members.</p><h4>What is the importance and objectives of APDC's annual Digital Business Congress?</h4><p>This is an annual event with around 2,000 participants, typically high-level decision makers from a range of sectors. It is a crucial event where we discuss and review trends and the scope of the transformation that is taking place because of IT. We also have an exposition part to the conference where companies have a presence, including IT and ICT start-ups. We have an entrepreneurship chapter within APDC as a channel for communicating with these start-ups. In turn, start-ups use such events to look for investors and to keep up with developments in their field. They also look to APDC as a connection to corporate through specialized events.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about APDC's initiatives to help people compete in this new digital environment?</h4><p>Skills are critical for this new environment, especially digital skills, and for this reason we cooperate with the Portuguese government on INCoDe.2030, the National Digital Competences Initiative. This is a government program to empower Portugal with more IT knowledge and capacity across the entire population. The challenge for Portugal is not about what IT services are on offer, because the country has a great network with several IT services; the problem is that usage is still low. Only around 60% of Portuguese people use internet on a daily basis, while 26% do not use internet at all. This 26% either lack the necessary IT skills or the money to buy basic IT equipment. In the case of skills, we have to remove this limitation not only to have enough trained personnel in the country for IT-related jobs, but also for the population at large. I am currently the Chairman of the Forum for INCoDe.2030. Our mission is to create instruments for evaluation and give visibility to this initiative on an annual basis. We held the first conference in 2017 when it was launched to publicize the program and explain its aims. Each year the forum analyzes INCoDe.2030's recent achievements. The program also has an Executive Coordinator appointed by the Minister of Science. Regarding APDC's Digital Academy, our associates needed a mechanism to train their own people, and in 2017 we prepared the courses which we are now starting to sell. These include short crash courses for executives who want to understand concepts like artificial intelligence. The other courses are for training company personnel.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Portugal and its IT sector?</h4><p>Our top priority at APDC is to address the digital transformation and understand how it will change the business environment in the next few years. Every year, we do a study of examples in digital transformation. Our aim for the next two or three years is to bring companies from other sectors into this discussion and help our associate companies during these important transformations. APDC's aim is to develop the market; we are not focused on representing members to government or other stakeholders. We help our associates transform and grow the size of our sector. To do this, we have to understand the ongoing transformations and then work on explaining how these transformations will have a profound effect on all sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-e-bundakji-group-managing-director-initial-saudi-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide us with a recap of ISG's history? </h4><p>Our origins date back to 1975 with Duraclean, a U.S. franchise that later in 1986 merged with Initial Saudi Arabia Ltd. a British joint venture between Initial Plc. a UK based company and our founder Mr. Faris Bundakji who later on merged the two companies to form (ISG) Initial Saudi Group (as it is known today) a 100% Saudi company. Since then the group has grown organically by way of mergers into several complementary services. Originally established as a cleaning company based in Jeddah, today our offices are spread out across the Kingdom with our main regional offices in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam supported by satellite offices in another 15 locations covering the entire country. Initially operating with approximately 200 company members providing basic cleaning services, Initial today employs' over 15,000 people that cover all aspects of Managed Services that a client may need, including cleaning, maintenance, landscaping, pest control, landscaping (hardscape &amp; softscape), property management services and security services and solutions. An example of the projects we are involved currently servicing would include King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), the Royal Commission for Yanbu, Toyota Abdul Latif Jameel, Sovola, and Kanoo to name a few, while some clients are being serviced for over 25 years which include the last three companies mentioned above.</p><h4>How would you describe ISG's relationship with the major international companies you have as clients?</h4><p>The role we play in our relationships with our clients is that of a strategic partner by providing turnkey solutions that enable our clients to concentrate on their core business goals and objectives rather than needing to worry about the management and operations of their facilities as well as the Human Resources needed to manage those properties. Through our buffet of services our clients benefit from a hassle-free experience, with all services provided to them under one agreement for all their needs, requirements and managed through one service level agreement (SLA) resulting in a Total Integrated Facility Management Solution that saves our clients time, effort, and most importantly cost at a high-quality standard that is expected of us.</p><h4>What would you say are the most important elements that makes ISG different from the other companies in your sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>What I can say are the elements that make the company successful operating in today's market include the ability to adapt to a changing market, constantly developing strategies, dedication to high standards, and most of all an awareness of our clients changing needs together with our one-stop-shop of services I mentioned in my previous answer we feel that we are poised to constantly provide a quality offering. An example of developing strategy our organisation recently added to the list of our services, Recruitment &amp; Outsourcing. This particular ISG subsidiary company named Workforce Saudia was created as a wholly owned closed joint stock company capitalized at SAR 100 Million and licensed by the Ministry of Labor to provide long and short-term outsourcing and manpower solutions to the commercial &amp; domestic household sectors such as drivers, maids, cooks, and care takers under the household category while we provide engineers, technicians, IT specialists, general labor and any other category needed, even a CEO. In conclusion, we feel as an organization these elements are what enables us to be resilient in today's market. </p><h4>What trends do you see for the market over the medium term?</h4><p>I see an encouraging trend driven by a higher demand for quality. Saudi Arabia was once a price-driven market to a large extent. Now, our observations of the market say clients are moving towards a quality-driven demand, are more concerned of about their ROI, and knowledgeable about facility management.</p><h4>What role does ISG play in a given market? </h4><p>ISG has always positioned itself as playing a Support Role to the markets changing needs. Historically our organization has derived its development and expansion from its clients and market needs, which led us as I mentioned earlier into developing the many different complementary services that we provide today. In addition to this role, we like to think that we contribute to the quality of standards in the market and its development in different ways.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>2016 is going to be an interesting year for us, the organization has taken on some challenges this year with high expectations on returns. Some of these goals are for example our new ORACLE ERP system that is being implemented across the group which alone is an extraordinary task. To add to this we have also taken on the establishment of new internal KPI's, procedures to further streamline our operations and best practice protocol's which will together with tech upgrades enable us to track supervise and deliver our services in a more comprehensive manner. Finally, developing our Local Talent, our HR has taken on a large training and development program that includes aims towards training our Saudi Human Resources through training programs such as “SNAP" Saudi National Acceleration Program, thanks to which we are proud to state that we have successfully trained 200 /Saudi Nationals to date educating them in skill sets such as sales, marketing, and operations thus far with more programs being developed constantly. With the successful completion of our goals we expect to be a leaner yet robust organization providing a smarter solution to our clients in the Saudi market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From Dream to Reality]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-dream-to-reality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major objectives over the past 12 months?</h4><p>The main objective has been to continue to train the people inside the company, meet with investors, and make the project known, not only in Kazakhstan, but also globally to attract foreign investment. We need to explain our long-term strategy and ambitions because this is clearly a project built with a transformative impact for the supply chain. We highlight the value proposition of the project and respond to the concerns that investors might have. When we meet with investors, they request clarifications about regulations, and sometimes we have to raise recommendations to the Ministry of Investment and Development based on the feedback received. We do this intermediary work between investors and the ministry, which is in charge of creating a favorable environment for attracting investors. There is also constant interaction with the rail operator, namely Temir Zholy (KTZ), since we are connected by rail and the idea is to build services and improve the connectivity of Khorgos to any destination in Central Asia or Europe. The next point that we are working on—given that a new border crossing between China and Kazakhstan will open soon—is to connect it efficiently with the special economic zone so that Chinese logistics operators are encouraged to cross over, come to the special economic zone, and do trans-shipment operations without facing visa issues or road limitations. We are trying to create an environment where Khorgos will be a multi-modal hub connected not only by rail but also by road. The most significant development in the past six months was the implementation of a paperless IT platform where all the people involved in the trade and supply chain can do their transactions and will include customs, the special economic zone, rail operators, banks, and truck operators all on a single platform.</p><h4>What are some of your recent achievements in terms of volume and attracting investors to Khorgos?</h4><p>A crucial landmark for the new Silk Road is that the number of container trains passing from China to Kazakhstan has increased by 46% in the first eight months of 2017, whereas Khorgos itself has increased by 119%. The growth of the market is a result of the fact that there is a need to use this new mode of transportation, and a growing number of logistics operators believe in this route. Projects such as Khorgos contribute significantly to bringing attention to the trans Sino-Kazakh route, and more companies are looking to base their model on rail transportation. In terms of attracting investors, the logistics zone is where we will give land to investors to build warehouses, around 65% of which are foreign. Of this 65%, the majority comes from either Dubai or Europe. The other 35% in the logistics zone are mainly SMEs from Kazakhstan. In the industrial zone, the majority are local SMEs that take three to four hectares of land to test the market for assembling. In this sense, they are shifting from being pure traders to also becoming assemblers.</p><h4>What are your overall expectations of the new Silk Road?</h4><p>This new concept of the Silk Road started in 2013 and by having two visions—one from China with its clear, far-sighted ambition and one from Kazakhstan's strong leadership—we can see that concrete steps have been taken in only a few years. We have a special economic zone that is ready and operational; with cargo increasing and a new highway, border, and city, it is no longer a concept but becoming reality. This is excellent and reassuring for investors, and having those promises delivered has had a positive effect on the project. We now need the first investors to start construction for the next phase to begin; then new things will start to happen in the supply chain, which will then attract more people to the project. The new Silk Road is no longer a dream but very much a reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your merger with Hong Kong-based Kerry Logistics come about?</h4><p>Our merger was a customer demand-driven growth process. Globalink Logistics had set up in 22 countries and needed better global coverage with an enhanced service portfolio to fulfill our customers' demands. As a result of merging with our long-standing partner Kerry Logistics, we now operate under the umbrella of our Hong Kong stock exchange listed company and operate more than 4 million sqm of warehousing and terminal space, have more than 1,000 service points, and employ 25,000 people in 51 countries worldwide. As a fully integrated member of Kerry Logistics Network, we will continue to expand our global footprint through a combination of organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. Speaking of strategic acquisitions, we recently acquired a 50% share in one of the leading China Railway-owned operators, Lanzhou Pacific Logistics, which gives us unrivalled access to China's One Belt One Road Initiative, as we can now cooperate directly with all the rail operators in the region and create customer focused multimodal products and overland mobility solutions between ASEAN, China, Central Asia, CIS, and Europe. Owing to our merger, we have an impressive fleet of 8,000 trucks in greater China and Asia and are rapidly expanding our fleet in the CIS and Eastern European markets. As a result of our merger, we are truly scaling up in every possible way and have become one of the global market leaders in selected segments of transportation and logistics. We are now listed among global top 10 sea freight forwarders and the top 20 airfreight forwarders in the world, not to mention a leading e-commerce service solution provider in China and Asia. </p><h4>How do you see this merger with Kerry Logistics impacting your CIS operations?</h4><p>Our focus in the market will remain the same. With our merger, we have a remarkable presence in China and a new customer base in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, Baltic States, Eastern Europe, Russia, Central Asia, and the Caucasus that are doing business in China and now rely on our extended geographic coverage and enhanced service portfolio. In Central Asia and Kazakhstan, besides our large-scale global customers and national companies, we are focusing more on SMEs, which are crucial for any future economic growth. What's more, our SME customer base takes enormous advantage of our adaptable business model. We transfer general knowledge on best practices attained from our large-scale global customers to our local SME clientele to make their business more efficient and cost effective. These organizations do not have enough in-house resources to manage their supply chain and logistics and rely on our IT solutions and business process management to manage their businesses. We do have large-scale customers that we really appreciate; however, for SMEs we need to give them an efficient and economical service network around the world to help them grow their businesses. </p><h4>What is the secret of your success?</h4><p>Our customer service is the key. Every customer is a unique case study and source of learning for us. While we have many small and medium-sized businesses as loyal customers, the majority of our biggest revenue generators are the Fortune 500 companies with well-established global best practices, which we focus on. Rather than modifying their logistical systems and standards region by region, we adjust our operating model to complement theirs. Rather than a one-size-fits all approach, we always take a boutique service approach and customize our service methodology to adapt to the needs of our customers. We thoroughly investigate our customers' internal and external needs in regard to their supply chain, logistics management, and compliance to develop fitting logistics solutions. Our backbone is our IT system—the one-stop-solution concept and our Global Network, which means we have technical, commercial, and human resources on the ground in every major global market and trade center of the world to serve our customers with the utmost care. </p>]]></richbody0content>
