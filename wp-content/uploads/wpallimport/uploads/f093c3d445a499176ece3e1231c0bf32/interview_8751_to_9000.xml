		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Mehriban Aliyeva, First Lady of Azerbaijan, on the 10th anniversary of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation.</h4><p>After the founder of the Azerbaijani state, National Leader Heydar Aliyev, passed away in December 2003, various initiatives were put forward to establish a special public organization with a view to preserving his rich legacy, passing it down to future generations, and continuing his noble deeds. Taking into account social demand, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, a non-governmental organization, was founded in May 2004. The major mission of the Foundation is both to popularize and advocate the life and activities of Heydar Aliyev, and also to support socioeconomic and humanitarian development within the country and abroad. Committed to these principles since its establishment, the Foundation has implemented educational, healthcare, cultural, sport, scientific and technological, environmental, social, and other projects. The Foundation has achieved positive results in both Azerbaijan and abroad through its programs, projects, and charity activities. The Foundation initiated the creation of centers provided with state-of-the-art equipment, and the necessary literature for popularizing the history and rich culture of Azerbaijan and National Leader Heydar Aliyev's life and activities. The centers do not function simply as museums, they also help young people and teenagers acquire diverse skills and knowledge. Computer, carpet weaving, chess, fine and applied arts, sculpture, and other courses are taught in these centers.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation, which pursues the provision of equal opportunities in education, as well as the integration of the country into the world educational system, has implemented a number of programs and projects on this front. Among them are the “Development of Orphanages and Boarding Schools," “New Schools for a New Azerbaijan," and the “Support for Education" projects. Supported by civil society and the private sector, these projects and programs involved the construction and overhauling of dozens of children's facilities, and over 400 schools. The Foundation's initiatives enjoy strong government support also, with a total of 2,700 schools built or reconstructed in the country over the past decade. The “Development of Pre-School Educational Facilities" project is the latest in a line of new initiatives on this front. Made public this year, the project provides for the execution of complex measures in order to fully meet the demand for kindergartens in Baku.</p><div class="quote">“  The major mission of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation is both to popularize and advocate the life and activities of Heydar Aliyev and support socioeconomic and humanitarian development within the country and abroad. "</div><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation places special emphasis on the mutual enrichment of various cultures and civilizations, the expansion of dialogue among nations, and the preservation of the traditions of tolerance, and to this end is implementing the “Azerbaijan Home to Tolerance" project. Under the project, the Foundation is reconstructing religious monuments and temples and arranging relevant exhibitions.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation is also actively contributing to preserving the health of the population of Azerbaijan. One of the key tasks the Foundation has set for itself is helping children and teenagers in orphanages and boarding schools, as well as the children of martyrs, refugees, IDPs, poor families, and children suffering from various diseases. In partnership with international organizations and the world's leading healthcare companies, the Foundation implemented initiatives which include the “Best Care for Children with Diabetes" and the “For Life without Thalassemia" projects, and has completely repaired, remodeled, and rebuilt medical facilities. A number of hospitals, polyclinics, diagnostics centers, and other medical facilities have been built, repaired, or remodeled in Azerbaijan since the establishment of the Foundation.</p><p>Charity is one of the key priorities in the activities of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. It carried out charity campaigns aimed at promoting the integration of children deprived of parental and family care into society, and ensuring the effective organization of leisure activities. As part of these campaigns, the Foundation provides a broad range of assistance and sends gifts to orphanages and boarding schools, while also organizing concerts and entertainment.</p><p>The Foundation arranges annual New Year and Novruz celebrations for children who have distinguished themselves in education and those who have been brought up in orphanages and boarding schools. It also assists children from refugee and IDP families, as well as orphans and those deprived of parental care, and sends holiday gifts to such institutions operating in Azerbaijan and also abroad.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation organizes foreign visits for these groups of children and also provides opportunities for children from other countries to visit Azerbaijan and familiarize themselves with our country's history and rich culture. Initiated and supported by the Foundation, Azerbaijani schoolchildren have visited Germany, Belgium, France, Georgia, the Netherlands, and Romania, while schoolchildren from the US, Georgia, Romania, and Russia were given a chance to spend time in Azerbaijan.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation is an organization that operates at an international level. It has offices in the US, Romania, Russia, and Turkey. The Foundation maintains close cooperation with the UN Development Program, UNESCO, ISESCO, and other international organizations, and is carrying out important programs and projects in foreign countries. Its activities abroad focus around three priorities: promoting Azerbaijan, including raising the international community's awareness of the truth about the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict; restoring and preserving the historical and cultural legacy related to Azerbaijan and its citizens; and fostering humanitarian and social development.</p><p>In foreign countries, the Foundation presents Azerbaijan through the organization of culture days, exhibitions, as well as events to mark historic occasions and pay tribute to prominent figures in science and culture. Cultural events held by the Foundation abroad include the “Azerbaijan: To the World of Tales on Flying Carpets" exhibition, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the restoration of national independence by the Republic of Azerbaijan, marking the 870th anniversary of the great Azerbaijani poet Nizami Ganjavi, which visited several cities in Europe including London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Strasbourg, and Rome.</p><p>The Foundation, which places a special emphasis on making the truth about the Armenia Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict known to the international community, has been carrying out commemorative campaigns about Khojaly in prominent cities across the world since 2007. These campaigns feature the presentation of the “Khojaly Genocide" film, photos documenting atrocities committed by Armenians in Khojaly, articles on the Khojaly tragedy issued by leading foreign editions, the “Truth about Karabakh" series, and the “War Against Azerbaijan: Targeting Cultural Heritage" book. In February of 2012, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation initiated the erection of a memorial commemorating the victims of the Srebrenica genocide in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Khojaly genocide in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p><p>As in Azerbaijan, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation's projects in education, healthcare, culture, and other fields are a success abroad too. For example, several schools were remodeled and completely repaired in Georgia, Egypt, Romania, Russia, Pakistan, and the Netherlands under the “Support to Education" project. The construction of a school for girls in Pakistan is one of the major success stories. A devastating earthquake completely destroyed a girls' school in Rara, in the Pakistani city of Muzaffarabad, in 2005. In response, within a short period of time, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation had built a new 650-seat school there. Projects implemented by the Foundation in the sphere of public health include the   vaccination of tens of thousands of people from low-income families against the Hepatitis B virus in Pakistan, the provision of an ambulances and blood banks for people suffering from thalassemia, hemophilia, and other blood diseases, and carrying out eye surgeries.</p><p>In 2013, the Foundation also provided financial assistance to schools in the State of Maryland, US, for the purchase of interactive whiteboards, and special equipment for children with disabilities, and in 2014 embarked on a new project in partnership with the US Urban Alliance organization. This was set up to provide assistance to graduates through training sessions and practical education. Another project by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in the field of healthcare was initiated jointly with “Save a Child's Heart" in Washington, and the Foundation also provided support to the reconstruction of the Center for Blind and Visually-impaired Children and Youth in Sarajevo.</p><p>The Foundation's cultural projects in foreign countries demonstrate its respect for cultural diversity and universal values, contributing to a strengthening of dialogue between cultures and civilizations. This is evidenced in the restoration of monuments in the park of the Palace of Versailles, the Louvre, and the Berlin City Palace, which was destroyed in WWII, as well as medieval manuscripts in the Vatican Archives and the Roman Catacombs in the Vatican, and the repair of the Philosophers' Room in the Rome Capitoline Museum.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation's work abroad also includes programs and campaigns in the field of healthcare. In April 2008, people with heart disease received treatment in cooperation with the Ioan Pop de Popa Foundation. In December of 2010, a fully equipped Sobol ambulance car was donated to the Center of Paediatric Oncology and Hematology at the Regional Clinic Hospital No. 1 in Yekaterinburg.</p><p>In December 2012, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation organized, in partnership with the Polish Embassy in Baku, a visit of physicians from Anna Dymna's Mimo Wszystko Foundation to Azerbaijan. As part of the visit, the physicians conducted training and courses at the Association of People with Down Syndrome. In March 2013, the Foundation organized a visit of Azerbaijani children with Down syndrome and their parents to Krakow.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Foundation's activities abroad include other social projects, too. It financially assisted Haiti in dealing with the consequences of an earthquake, and Romania in tackling the consequences of a natural disaster. In September 2011, the Foundation provided financial assistance to the French Association for the Victims of Terrorism to help it organize the 7th International Congress for the Victims of Terrorism in Paris.</p><p>Social projects implemented by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation in a number of cities of France, Russia, Hungary, Italy, and Germany contribute to bringing nations together, and the successful integration of cultures. Projects related to the design of parks and the restoration of historical monuments are of moral significance, and are becoming a kind of symbol for calling for friendship and peace all over the world.</p><p>On May 10, the Heydar Aliyev Foundation will celebrate its 10th anniversary. Thanks to its advanced organizational skills and tireless efforts, the Foundation has walked a glorious path, having become the bearer of universal values in Azerbaijan and abroad, and a symbol of development and prosperity, hope, and humanity.</p><p>The Heydar Aliyev Center embodies Azerbaijan's dedication to promoting the Creative spirit.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main achievements of the Ministry of Emergency Situations last year?</h4><p>Considering the results of the work carried out and the measures taken in 2013, we can say with full confidence that last year was a success for the Ministry of Emergency Situations. Of course, this success has been underpinned by the socioeconomic development observed in our country in recent years thanks to the successful implementation of the policies of Heydar Aliyev by President Ilham Aliyev. In 2013, we managed to ensure a high level of preparedness, the prevention and elimination of potential emergency situations, and to improve the Ministry's material and technical infrastructure, and expand its international connections. In order to establish rigorous fire safety procedures we have conducted inspections at social, industrial, transport, communications, and agricultural facilities, and service organizations. On the basis of our findings, the managers of these properties were informed of the shortcomings discovered and allowed the opportunity to rectify them. Gas safety inspections have also been carried out at thousands of private houses and apartments, and appropriate correspondence sent to local gas suppliers urging them to take necessary steps to eliminate the faults. To provide protection from sources of ionizing radiation, we have carried out safety inspections at industrial, scientific research, and medical institutions. In addition, we exercise control over the import and export of radioactive sources. The Ministry has also continued work to ensure the compliance of construction standards with regulatory requirements and construction standards. In 2013, we also continued work to further strengthen the material and technical resources of the Ministry, construct office and auxiliary buildings, and refurbish some of the old facilities subordinated to the Ministry. Additionally, over the course of 2013, the Ministry purchased diverse machinery, including multifunctional fire trucks, rescue boats, equipment to detect and deactivate explosive objects and substances, transportation vehicles, related equipment and spare parts. Besides these initiatives, several apartment buildings have been constructed to house Ministry personnel. A major success in 2013 was the elimination in August of the open flow at the Bulla-Deniz field in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. Our personnel displayed courage and professionalism in responding to this emergency. As a result of the measures taken in an extremely challenging setting, our specialists managed to cope with this man-made disaster, salvaged the well, and have already re-commissioned it. It is particularly gratifying that not a single member of the engineering, technical, or fire-fighting crews was injured during the operation. In addition, as is well known, the government of Azerbaijan does everything in its power to safeguard its citizens regardless of their location. For example, we arranged for the emergency evacuation of our citizens in Egypt at the height of the unrest there.</p><h4>Taking into consideration the extensive building activity of recent years, how does the Ministry ensure that new buildings comply with relevant safety standards?</h4><p>The Ministry of Emergency Situations and the agencies under its umbrella exercise state control over all stages of construction activities, from engineering to research, design, construction, and the assembly of buildings and facilities in accordance with the applicable regulatory and legal documents. After a permit has been issued for the construction of a facility according to Article 75 of the Code on Town Planning and Construction of the Republic of Azerbaijan, we started a logbook to chart government control over the construction process. In an effort to implement the relevant orders of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, drafts of a number of regulatory documents have been prepared and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers. Measures continue to be taken to bridge the gaps in construction laws and align them with international standards.</p><h4>Baku is widely believed to be the capital of the Caspian region due its high-rise buildings, broad avenues, and business opportunities. What challenges does the vertical development of the city pose to the Ministry?</h4><p>Baku is becoming one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Specific work is currently underway in accordance with the instructions of the President to develop and modernize Baku and its suburban settlements, and the city is growing more beautiful every day. A large number of multi-story blocks, road junctions, and bridges have been built and commissioned in Baku in recent years. And this process shows no sign of slowing. Considering the fact that these buildings and roads are inhabited and used by millions of people on a daily basis, one priority of the Ministry of Emergency Situations is to have sufficient search and rescue capacity. To meet this objective the State Fire Safety Service under the Ministry has further expanded its logistical supplies by purchasing cutting-edge machinery capable of operating in the least accessible locations, including the highest floors of high-rise buildings. In addition, office buildings and operational depots of the Fire Safety Service have been built in different parts of the capital. In order to promptly eliminate the potential of emergency situations in the historical parts of Baku, with its narrow streets and small neighborhoods, special vehicles have been purchased and provided to the Ministry's High Risk Rescue Service. At the same time, ministerial personnel undergo regular training at the Baku Underground and other facilities in order to improve their emergency response skills. Our motto is a quote from our National Leader Heydar Aliyev, “It is easier to prevent an emergency situation than to deal with its consequences." The subdivisions of the Ministry are engaged in extensive public awareness campaigns related to the prevention of emergency situations in Baku and other cities, districts, and even remote villages. Public meetings are arranged at health and educational facilities, and our information is available on our website and through television broadcasts.</p><div class="quote">“   We are interested in conducting academic and research exchanges with educational institutions from overseas. "</div><h4>What is the Ministry doing in terms of cooperation with international institutions and the exchange of expertise?</h4><p>To improve the Ministry's work in its primary fields of activity, we are constantly developing cooperation with relevant agencies of other countries, as well as international and regional organizations. We currently cooperate with organizations from over 30 countries, including NATO, the OSCE, GUAM, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Economic Cooperation Organization, the International Civil Defense Organization, Germany's Technical Cooperation Society, and various other international and regional organizations. In order to improve the professionalism of the Ministry's personnel, cooperation agreements have been signed with educational institutions from a number of countries. As part of this cooperation, employees from these groups have come to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. We are interested in conducting academic and research exchanges with educational institutions from overseas, and are working in this direction. In addition, representatives of the Ministry regularly attend various international activities and training sessions dedicated to the prevention and elimination of emergency situations. As a matter of fact, Azerbaijan has also hosted a number of regional and international conferences on this subject. One of these events was organized by the Ministry of Emergency Situations on the initiative of the International Civil Defense Organization in Gabala during mid-March 2013. The conference, entitled “On Civil Defense and the Prevention of Casualties," was attended by the representatives of over 50 countries along with several international organizations. Prior to the conference, its participants observed the Caspian-2013 tactical exercise organized by our Ministry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Romania is perceived as a close diplomatic partner of Azerbaijan, and was the second country in the world to recognize its independence after Turkey. What are the main pillars of bilateral relations today?<br></h4><p>Our relationship centers on mutual respect and political partnerships. The links between Romania and Azerbaijan are strong, and we believe that the increased economic success of our cooperation will only strengthen this relationship.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijan's importance as a future energy exporter to South east and Central Europe, and to Romania in particular, in light of the plans to build a pipeline through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Romania?</h4><p>One cannot disregard Azerbaijan's role in today's energy market. Given that an increasing number of political and economic actors understand the necessity of the diversification of energy supply, the plans for the building of this project are being given serious attention and consideration by the Romanian government. We are looking forward to developing this project and, at the same time, we are interested in pursuing other bilateral projects.</p><h4>Having reached $55 million in 2012, trade between the two countries remains relatively modest. What efforts are the two administrations making to develop this?</h4><p>We are aware that a great deal of effort needs to be put into increasing the level of bilateral trade, and we hope that the excellent political links between the two countries will contribute to the development of the economic ties between Romania and Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“  We are definitely looking forward to encouraging Romanian investment in Azerbaijan. There are several economic sectors in which Romanian products and companies are increasingly competitive. "</div><h4>In recent years, several Azerbaijani companies have invested in Romania in sectors such as construction and infrastructure. What are your expectations regarding the evolution of two-way direct investment?</h4><p>We are definitely looking forward to encouraging Romanian investment in Azerbaijan. There are several economic sectors in which Romanian products and companies are increasingly competitive, and we expect not only to increase the volume of bilateral trade, but also increase Romanian investments in Azerbaijan against the background of a strengthening political relationship.</p><h4>Could you please give examples of past instances of cooperation and support between Romania and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Of course. One of Romania's foremost policies has been that of supporting, by institutional means, the cooperation between Azerbaijan and the Euro-Atlantic institutions. To this end, since 2009, the Romanian Embassy in Baku is the NATO contact point embassy. Moreover, in 2009, our two countries signed a declaration to establish a strategic partnership between the two countries. In addition to the increasing commercial relations, I would like to mention the initiatives undertaken in order to develop cultural and scientific ties between our two countries as relevant endeavors in the field of bilateral cooperation.</p><h4>What do the educational exchanges between Romania and Azerbaijan consist of?</h4><p>Educational exchanges allow for students and teachers from both countries to spend a period of time at universities in the partner country. We are currently discussing policies to improve the connections between the Romanian and the Azerbaijani academic arenas.</p><h4>President Ilham Aliyev won a third landslide victory at the polls in October 2013. What do you expect his third term will bring in terms of Romania-Azerbaijan bilateral relations?</h4><p>We believe that the institutionalization of our cooperation is the next step in the development of the relations between our two countries. Therefore, we believe that the warm and close relations between our two countries can only further develop, given their political continuity and stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What has been the increase in its turnover, number of projects, and which sectors of activity stood out?<br></h4><p>In 2013, Synergy Group completed several large-scale projects with a strong focus on the social and economic development of the outlying regions of Azerbaijan. Overall, 2013 was productive for our businesses in construction, manufacturing, hotel management, agriculture, and ICT. A number of grand openings in Shamkir city, such as Excelsior Hotel Shamkir, Shamkir City Park, and WestGate Shopping Avenue, provide strong evidence of Synergy's diversified development strategy. By launching successful new projects, the number of subsidiaries within our Group has doubled to 28. This was accompanied by a two fold increase in staff.</p><h4>How have the developments associated with the Year of ICT in 2013 benefited Synergy Group's ICT operations?</h4><p>One of our strategic goals was to establish an innovative IT company, which took the form of Cybernet, today a success story in the ICT sector. The e-Government Information System, Automated Tax Information System (AVIS), and Mobile Signature (ASAN imza), are just some examples of the company's achievements. Offering a number of reliable solutions to banks, public institutions, large organizations, educational institutions, and business communities, we continue to play a creative and innovative role in the ICT sector in Azerbaijan. Moreover, Cybernet is a flagship company of Azerbaijan, which shares its best practice in tax administration with other CIS countries. In 2013, we successfully implemented an ICT tax administration project at the State Tax Committee of the Republic of Tajikistan. Expanding its services abroad, Cybernet is also negotiating with European countries like Estonia and Slovenia on the implementation of similar projects. In 2013, the Year of ICT in Azerbaijan, Cybernet was awarded the title of “IT Company of the Year" for its innovative e-government solutions.</p><h4>What are the main growth opportunities in the construction sector in 2014-2015?</h4><p>High-quality contemporary construction projects require world-class professional expertise. In 2010, Synergy Group partnered with leading regional contractor Renaissance Construction to establish Renaissance Construction Azerbaijan LLC. The target is nothing less than to become Azerbaijan's leading construction contractor with highly skilled construction, design, and engineering teams. In 2014, we intend to complete Galaalti Hotel &amp; Spa construction in Shabran, which is situated about 120 kilometers to the north of Baku. Located on the Siyazan and Shabran mountains, the venue will feature high-class wellness, hospitality, and recreation centers where guests will enjoy breathtaking Caspian Sea views from all areas and rooms of the hotel. The entertainment center boasts facilities like an infinity pool, outdoor sport activities, and therapeutic activities with spa waters and Galaalti spring, which is as good as Truskavets in Ukraine.</p><div class="quote">“  The regions of Azerbaijan have enormous potential for development in the non-oil sector, especially tourism. "</div><p>Elsewhere, a new building for the Inland Revenue, which is quite challenging from an engineering perspective, is shortly due for completion. Our construction materials production factory AAC is expanding through a huge project involving a two fold increase in production capacity to be completed this year. In addition, audits conducted by TÜV Austria, the leading service provider of integrated safety, quality, and technical resource management in Central Europe, confirmed that AAC operates in compliance with international requirements. Being the main player for almost all megaprojects in our country, we know that AAC will continue to meet the rising demands of the local construction market by increasing its production capacity. Currently, we are designing a fiber cement plant, which will be the first such facility in Azerbaijan. The plant would also be the first to manufacture construction products such as roofing materials, facing panels, and sidings made from fiber cement. Located in the Garadagh district, it is likely to come online in mid-2015.</p><h4>What projects does Synergy Group have in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>We are involved in the development and modernization of agricultural production in Azerbaijan. We are also channeling strategic investment into the restoration of the country's winemaking traditions. In 2010, Synergy Group modernized its winery in Siyazan region. I am delighted to note that in 2013 we reaped the first harvest from our vineyard in the Hamya Valley. Known for its finest and most authentic Azerbaijani wine brands, Caspian Coast Winery &amp; Vineyards also presented a new brand of cognac, the “City of Winds." Consequently, we expanded our portfolio to 21 wines and four cognac varieties. We export our products to the Russian Federation. In its agribusiness business, Synergy Group also produces Dutch roses. Located in Shamkir region, Azagro grows the finest ranges of world-renowned rose types, such as Avalanche, Fiorenza, Red Naomi, and Spray Rose. As of March 2013, the company started distribution to flower stores all over the country under the brand name SBuket. It is worth noting that Azagro is also expanding its business abroad. We have already entered the Georgian rose market and, according to an initial agreement with Kazakhstan and Russia, the first shipments have already been sent.</p><h4>Synergy Group oversees hospitality properties in numerous provinces of Azerbaijan. What is the Group's contribution to regional development through these operations, as far as creating employment and attracting tourism is concerned?</h4><p>We at Synergy Group are inspired by the development of large-scale tourist infrastructure projects in Azerbaijan. By acting locally, we aim to contribute to decreasing the gap between the regions and the capital Baku, where all major industries are concentrated. The regions of Azerbaijan have enormous potential for development in the non-oil sector, especially tourism. To create new job opportunities and improve the quality of life in the regions by developing the tourism industry, we invest in the construction of hotels and recreation destinations. One of our remarkable accomplishments in 2013 was Excelsior Hotel Shamkir, which was inaugurated by the President during his last visit to Shamkir in September. We also own and successfully operate Caspian Sea Resort Hotel in Nabran, known as the “choice of good taste." Another major project we are currently implementing is the construction of Galaalti Hotel &amp; Spa in Shabran, which will be managed by Synergy Group upon completion. Along with that, we are already operating Chinar Hotel &amp; Spa in Naftalan.</p><h4>In 2013, President Ilham Aliyev was voted in for a third term of office. What do you expect this new era to bring to the economy in general, and the business sector in particular?</h4><p>Due to the strategic vision of President of Azerbaijan, a favorable investment climate has been created in the country, which bolsters investment inflows into the economy. As the architect of Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future, President Aliyev encourages the development of non-oil sectors and promotes opportunities for small-, medium-, and large-scale businesses. Those policies ensure sustainable economic growth and ensure greater prosperity for future generations. We consider Synergy Group to be one of the most successful entities to be enjoying a favorable investment climate. On behalf of the Group, I had the opportunity to participate in various international business forums held both locally and internationally. During meetings with international partners, we have observed the growing attractiveness of Azerbaijan's economy for investors and their active search for local business partners. Various efforts made over recent years have played a decisive role in shaping a positive image of Azerbaijan, and thus further expanding bilateral relations with foreign countries. I strongly believe that President Ilham Aliyev's election for a third-term will give him an opportunity to successfully realize his economic policies that foster a sustainable and favorable investment climate in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>For all its accomplishments, Synergy Group is relatively new in the Azerbaijani business environment. What are your goals for the Group's fourth anniversary this year?</h4><p>The President has declared 2014 the Year of Industry. Synergy Group considers the industrial sector as one of its strategic investment priorities, and so far we have made substantial investments in this area. We have launched the construction of the fiber-cement plant in Azerbaijan in cooperation with Austrian Maschinenfabrik Liezen und GieíŸerei Ges.m.b.H. (MFL) based on bilateral agreement signed at the Austrian-Azerbaijan Economic Forum held in Vienna on May 13, 2013. Furthermore, we are planning to open Zayam Technologies Park, featuring a plant specialized in the manufacturing and production of metal structures used in the construction of factories, buildings, and bridges. Synergy Group is also set to expand its activities in the non-oil economy. At the moment, we are conducting geological studies in the limestone bed located in Gazakh region. To discover the rich potential of the regions, another subsidiary of ours, Ecolime, will be engaged in the production of slaked and burnt lime. It is worth pointing out that the construction of a plant adjacent to the natural resource itself is a sound strategic move from a logistical perspective. The plant will be launched in 2015. Our slogan is “For a Sustainable Future," and thus, we aim for excellence, value teamwork, and apply innovative approaches to our business activities, ensuring the sustainable development of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The World Bank increased its investments in Azerbaijan over 2013. What prompted this decision?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan's need for resources is not huge. Therefore, in 2013 we mainly provided additional financing to existing projects that had been successful or demonstrated potential to be successful. One of the projects for which we provided additional financing and which was very successful was the Solid Waste Management Project. Initially, we helped the government to clean up the Balakhani Landfill and develop a sustainable method of sorting recyclable material and then processing it appropriately. We provided financing to further modernize this landfill, and this is where the additional funding of $47 million will be directed. The second project was to provide additional financing of $220 million to the Trade Facilitation and Railways project, which is part of the program of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the railways system. The World Bank's investment in this project will go to the establishment of proper power conversion and signaling systems. The resources originally allocated were not sufficient to cover these two big components, and that is why additional funding was provided. The third project delivered in 2013 was the Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project (AzRIP) to the amount of $30 million. This will increase access to running water, local roads, and primary healthcare facilities, and help them engage more actively in economic activities, for example by organizing small agro-processing plants in villages. The project helps communities to develop their skills and capacity to prioritize their needs and develop and implement micro projects to meet them. This is what we call community-driven development.</p><h4>What do you think are the main challenges Azerbaijani entrepreneurs encounter?</h4><p>One of the constraints in Azerbaijan that was identified by a World Bank study on entrepreneurship was access to finance. Loans from banks are mainly for up to one year only and with a high interest rate. This is probably good for buying a TV set or a refrigerator, but it is not good for productive activity. Medium- to long-term financing is needed and at much lower interest rates. This calls for more competition in the financial sector to provide relevant access to medium- and long-term financing for business. There are many layers related to the issue of income growth and improved living standards, including social protection and providing support to vulnerable people, but the major task is to create jobs through private sector development. Here we see a lot of challenges, and this is where the government should put relevant policies in place in order to address these challenges.</p><h4>How does Azerbaijan contribute to international development and to the World Bank's programs in other countries?</h4><p>The World Bank promotes knowledge sharing among developing and developed countries. There are many innovative ideas in Azerbaijan, particularly in the field of ICT, which we are ready to support and, once implemented, share the gained experience and practice with the rest of the world. Azerbaijan has so far demonstrated good practice in managing its oil resources. Azerbaijan was the first to sign the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the modernization of the judicial system is also an example to follow for other CIS nations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say were your major accomplishments in recent years?</h4><p>Our group of companies is posting annual growth as we define new goals and work to reach them. Our factory project is still under development, and we are considering its integration into other major projects. It is a part of the large industrial center in Nakhichevan, where a diversity of manufacturers are located. Construction is underway with an estimated completion date of 2017. Together with the government of Nakhichevan, we recently launched two further large-scale regional projects. One, the Boulevard, located on the banks of the Nakhichevan River, includes an entertainment center, a promenade, and a shopping mall. The second scheme is called Youth Town, which aims to provide several hundred young families with high-quality, affordable accommodation.</p><h4>In addition to its operations in Azerbaijan, Cahan Holding has offices in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. How does the company benefit from its presence close to its distributors and important markets?</h4><p>First of all, our representative offices in the countries where we are active provide our partners with the opportunity to get know Cahan Holding better. And, of course, dealing with export/import partners directly yields significant benefits, which reflects product quality. For example, we have a partner, Ceylon, which supplies tea for packing at the tea factory in Nakhichevan. Thanks to the representatives at our Asian office we have selected a superior blend under the Tudor brand, which has gained popularity.</p><h4>As one of the most developed regions in Azerbaijan, what role do you think Nakhichevan can play in the country's economic development looking ahead?</h4><p>Thanks to effective state management policies and the resulting rapid economic growth, Nakhichevan City, the capital of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, has changed dramatically over the past 20 years. In macroeconomic terms, while the world recoiled from the adverse effects of the economic crisis, in 2009 the GDP of Nakhichevan grew by 26% YoY, and by a further 21% in 2013. Meanwhile, the total volume of industrial production rose by over 100% between 1998 and 2013. These figures prove the effectiveness of President Ilham Aliyev's policies and of those implemented by the administration of the Autonomous Republic, especial taking into account that Nakhichevan remains disconnected from the main part of Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“  In 2009 the GDP of Nakhichevan grew by 26% YoY, and by a further 21% in 2013. "</div><h4>Cahan Holding has a staff of over 3,000. What is your human resources policy as far as training and development is concerned?</h4><p>The motto of Cahan Holding is “strength in unity," and we do our best to stay loyal to it. I am more than confident that the attitude to work is transmitted effectively between managers and employees. I, and the department heads, remain well informed about people's expectations and always try to meet them. We also ensure that our staff are well trained in their respective positions.</p><h4>President Aliyev was voted in for a third term in office in 2013. What do you expect this new era to bring for the business environment in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>During his meeting with the business community after reelection, President Aliyev made a number of statements related to the future of the business environment. First of all, he reaffirmed his commitment to the economic policy begun by our National Leader Heydar Aliyev. One of the goals of this policy was to reduce the dependence of the economy on oil and gas. Another priority was to pay more attention to regional development. This objective directly concerns Cahan Holding, as one of the major players in the regional development policy. President Ilham Aliyev also repeated his call to all governmental structures for mutual understanding with the business community.</p><h4>Lastly, what are your most important plans for the near future?</h4><p>We have numerous goals for 2014 and beyond. First of all, we are going to complete our Boulevard project, which we started in 2013 and aim to inaugurate on May 10, 2015, the 92nd anniversary of the birth of Heydar Aliyev. This project is very significant for the entire infrastructure of the city of Nakhichevan, as it will change the landscape of the Nakhichevan River shore and transform the area into a popular destination, presenting citizens with a quality retail experience and a roster of well-known brands. Another important project is the new industrial center, which is under constriction right now and will be commissioned phase-by-phase by the end of 2015. Then, there is the large-scale construction project we embarked on in March 2014 located in central Nakhichevan to provide young families with high-quality, comfortable apartments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AtaHolding OJSC is known for promoting a corporate social responsibility (CSR) platform focused on the development of culture and sport in Azerbaijan. What are the most important initiatives supported by AtaHolding?<br></h4><p>AtaHolding is fully aware of its social responsibilities and makes every effort to fulfill its obligations in this area. We have implemented a number of projects in the spheres of culture, the arts, sports, education, and social infrastructure. In general, we view CSR as an important part of our activities. Our objective in everything we do is to create value-added and contribute to the prosperity of our society. In 2007 and 2008, AtaHolding signed agreements to become one of the main sponsors of the International Hockey Federation and the general sponsor of the International Wrestling Federation. At present, AtaSport club operates under the patronage of the holding. AtaHolding attaches tremendous importance to the development of sport in Azerbaijan and promoting the country in the international arena. We have sponsored a number of international competitions and supported Azerbaijani athletes in their efforts to represent the country with dignity. We are proud to say that our holding sponsored eight out of 11 Azerbaijani medalists at the London Olympic Games. In addition, AtaHolding has several long-term sponsorship agreements in the area of corporate social responsibility. On March 21, 2011, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, AtaHolding commissioned the AtaHolding Center and Marneuli Sport Complex Georgia Azerbaijan in the Marneuli region of Georgia. The holding provides continuous support for the operation of the center, which is already playing the role of a cultural and sports bridge between the people of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Marking our 10th anniversary, we wanted to implement a project that would stand out for its originality and provide support for the social and public agenda of our society. From this point of view, we launched a project, also on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, to have the black-and-white film “Arshin Mal Alan," which was based on Uzeyir Hajibayli's operetta of the same name in 1945, colored in Hollywood. The objectives of the project have been to ensure the continuity of the work carried out by AtaHolding earlier and to add value to Azerbaijan's cultural wealth. The “Arshin Mal Alan" operetta also marked its centennial anniversary in 2013. We believe that the restoration and coloring of this film is an historic event and a fine gift to Azerbaijani culture and the future generations.</p><h4>As an advanced player in the financial market, how do you think the requirement to increase the volume of registered capital until 2015 will impact how banks operate?</h4><p>In general, the new registered capital requirement of the central bank will play an important part in strengthening the banking sector and expanding financial opportunities. The high capitalization of the banking sector will make a significant contribution to improving bank services and enhancing the efficiency of assets from an investment point of view. By increasing their capital, the banks should also be able to raise their net profit margins. Bank capital should grow in parallel with growth in all activity types, which will enable the required profitability. In this case, banks would be more interested in investing in the national economy and supporting small- and medium-sized businesses. This, in turn, will encourage companies and entrepreneurs to use financial tools and bank resources more actively.</p><h4>In addition to tourism and finance, what other sectors is AtaHolding interested in?</h4><p>AtaHolding successfully operates in the IT and industrial sectors. By investing in state-of-the-art and technologically advanced businesses, we aim to produce high-quality and competitive commodities, substitute imports, encourage the export of local products, and eventually contribute to the socioeconomic development of the country's regions. In 2012, we started the upgrade of Shamir Poultry, which specializes in egg production. Today, this enterprise accounts for about 10% of Azerbaijan's total egg production. AtaTechnology, which has set itself a number of goals in the ICT sector, started out as a software company. Its products are intended for banks, major companies, and other organizations. AtaTechnology LLC cooperates with such market leaders as Microsoft, Oracle, Yaz, Netsis, HP, Dell, and Cisco.</p><div class="quote">“  We are proud to say that our holding sponsored eight out of 11 Azerbaijani medalists in the London Olympic Games. "</div><h4>What was the impact of the Year of ICT in 2013, and how has it developed AtaHolding's activities?</h4><p>The use of cutting-edge communications and IT plays a huge role in the activities of any company, regardless of its specialization. Therefore, the AtaHolding group of companies is trying to apply the latest information technology solutions to its operations. In doing so, we attach special importance to using transparent and licensed technologies. I would like to emphasize in this connection that AtaHolding group is one of a handful of local companies to have signed an agreement with Microsoft. In addition, we are also working to diversify the activities of AtaTechnology. In 2013, the company started to provide additional services to its customers in cooperation with several telecommunications companies. We are currently working on a number of new and interesting projects.</p><h4>The government provides support for all economic development initiatives, including such large-scale events as the 2015 European Games. How does AtaHolding plan to benefit from these activities?</h4><p>First of all, let me say that such high-profile events are of particular importance as they promote Azerbaijan as a rapidly developing and modern state. The Games are a wonderful opportunity to introduce Azerbaijan's unique tourism potential to the world. Besides this, the fact that such international events are held in Azerbaijan breathes new life into the establishment of modern infrastructure in the country. And this is making Azerbaijan a regional leader in terms of the availability of modern infrastructure. All this is important to the overall development of the country. It is clear that the attention of the world will be focused on Azerbaijan during the European Games. The Games will also expand the tourist inflow to the country. Therefore, AtaHolding will make its contribution to the development of tourism as well. The European Games will last for one-and-a-half months, during which a large number of tourists will be living in Azerbaijan. These people will have the opportunity to travel across the country and take advantage of our tourism potential and opportunities. I am sure that foreign tourists assess the services we provide in the tourism sector in a positive light. In addition to this, we intend to take an active part in the large-scale preparations carried out by our government ahead of the Games, and to contribute to and ­benefit from the activities under way. We also hope that the sports federations we are sponsoring will delight us and the people of Azerbaijan with victories at the Games.</p><h4>How do you assess the short-term development prospects of AtaHolding?</h4><p>The President of Azerbaijan has declared 2014 the Year of Industry. With this in mind, we intend to further speed up our projects in this area. We will make every effort to reinforce our positions in the financial sector and introduce new financial services and tools to our customers. Also, we will further expand our activities in the sectors of information and communication technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan has seen interesting developments in terms of high-end car use and competitive auto racing, which culminated in the Baku World Challenge race in November 2013. What were the most significant highlights of 2013?</h4><p>The automobile market in Azerbaijan is remarkably rich and promising. For this reason, Azerbaijan has a special place based on the volume of its sales in the world automobile market. Hosting world famous events such as City Challenge and Baku World Challenge (FIA GT finals) is also an indication of the importance of the automotive sector in the country. The most important and the most exciting event of 2013 for the Porsche Center Baku was the launch of the new product improvement, the new Porsche Panamera. This particular model is unique and effective in this segment.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijani consumers' appetite for high-end cars?</h4><p>The number of purchases of luxury automobiles has been increasing exponentially over recent years. The willingness to pay for these cars has always been high among our consumers. This is definitely associated with the country's growing economic development.</p><h4>What advances has Porsche made in 2013 in terms of increasing its customer base and its product offering?</h4><p>Potential customers for the newer models offered by Porsche A.G are no longer limited to age. This in fact makes the Porsche brand unique and favorite among our potential customers in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are you looking to achieve in these areas in 2014?</h4><p>As a reliable Porsche partner, we are confident that in 2014 we will be able to introduce new models specifically for sports car fans. Initially we will introduce the new compact SUV named the Porsche Macan, the first such model in the whole range. We are confident that the introduction of this model in Azerbaijan will be the beginning of a brand-new segment among automobile enthusiasts.</p><h4>As the Azerbaijani population becomes wealthier, what are the prospects for auto dealers in the coming years?</h4><p>The exponential increase in the financial status of Azerbaijani population is leading to the development of various sectors of the economy, including the automobile segment. This development will play a major role in increasing the quantity and quality of potential Porsche customers and fans. Therefore, we are confident in setting goals to further expand our customer base in these specific conditions.</p><h4>How is Porsche seeking to stand out from other high-end auto brands in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Porsche is already different from the other automobile brands represented in Azerbaijan. This is mainly due to the quality, safety, and reliability of the Porsche model range. In addition, a more customer-centric approach in our showroom and after-sales service will definitely make a difference for other luxury brands.</p><h4>President Ilham Aliyev was voted in for a third term last year. What do you expect this new term will bring to the Azerbaijani economy?</h4><p>The year ended successfully for the Porsche Center Baku, as President Ilham Aliyev was elected for his third term.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan has completed its two-year term on the UN Security Council (UNSC). What is the country's legacy in promoting increased international cooperation?</h4><p>As declared by President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan's priorities at the UNSC were to promote the ideals of justice and the supremacy of international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Guided by this vision, Azerbaijan, by virtue of its experience and potential, worked hard during its tenure to make a unique contribution to global peace and security. With a firm belief in goodwill diplomacy, we started, first and foremost, to build constructive dialogue within the UNSC. Azerbaijan has demonstrated that non-permanent members of the UNSC can make a difference, affect outcomes, and contribute constructively to consensus building, while bringing diverse and unique perspectives based on their regional knowledge and experience. This is especially apparent, as Azerbaijan has held the Presidency twice. The central theme of Azerbaijan's first Presidency, in May 2012, was “threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts: strengthening international cooperation in the implementation of counterterrorism obligations." This topic was discussed at the high-level thematic meeting of the Security Council, held on May 4, 2012 under the Chairmanship of President Ilham Aliyev. During Azerbaijan's second Presidency, the UNSC convened on the theme of “strengthening partnership synergy between the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)," the first ever meeting of the Council on this subject. The purpose of the meeting was to review the current state of cooperation between the UN and the OIC, as the second largest intergovernmental organization, in the maintenance of international peace and security, while exploring ideas, measures, and joint actions for strengthening the partnership synergy between the two organizations. Azerbaijan's Presidency at the UNSC also featured intense discussions on African issues, consultations with the African Union, and the visit of an official UNSC mission to Africa, as well as the adoption of a number of resolutions and presidential statements. Also, under Azerbaijan's chairmanship, the presidential statement adopted by the Council provided a solid basis and support for addressing the humanitarian consequences of the Syrian crisis. During its membership of the UNSC, Azerbaijan has demonstrated its principled position of respect for international law and justice on all issues on the Security Council agenda. As such, Azerbaijan has placed particular emphasis on the situation in the Middle East, African issues, and working methods and reform of the Security Council. Throughout this period, the Republic of Azerbaijan has proven to be a reliable partner determined to further strengthen its cooperation with the international community, including members of the UN, intergovernmental organizations, and civil society. I can also add that UNSC membership has opened a new page in Azerbaijan's foreign policy. While on the UNSC, Azerbaijan's diplomats gained great experience that will help to promote our cause further in the global arena.</p><h4>How do you reflect Azerbaijan's increased importance for the energy security of Europe?</h4><p>As stressed by President Ilham Aliyev at the Shah Deniz II project final investment decision signing ceremony on December 17, 2013, this project will change the energy map of the region and Europe. High-level attendance from participating countries at the ceremony, including the EU and the UK, once again demonstrated the willingness and determination to move this project forward. Since the introduction of the concept of the Southern Gas Corridor, Azerbaijan has continuously demonstrated its political will to contribute to the implementation of this project. The birth of the Trans-Anatolia Pipeline (TANAP), as a strategic midstream component of the Southern Gas Corridor, testifies to our dedication. It was followed by a decision by the Shah Deniz consortium to select the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) as a delivery route. Shah Deniz II, TANAP, and TAP are among the world's largest energy projects. The project will involve an investment of $45 billion, and more than 30,000 new jobs will be created in the countries along the route. In the first phase of this project, it is expected to deliver 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Azerbaijan's natural gas, but in the subsequent phases the figure could exceed 20 bcm. This means that Azerbaijan is making its contribution to the energy security of Europe not only through diversified routes of supply, but also by enabling diversified sources of those supplies. Azerbaijan's energy policy has been developed based on the principles of mutually beneficial cooperation, commercial viability, matching the interests of consumers and producers, transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Proceeding from this logic, we are convinced that the TAP project, through our joint efforts, will add considerable value for Europe's energy supply and its diversification. By combining the interests of producer, transit, and consumer countries, it will contribute to further economic development across the board and enhance mutual cooperation and friendship.</p><h4>At what stage is the resolution of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?</h4><p>The ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan continues to represent a serious threat and challenge to international and regional peace and security, and hinders the materialization of sustainable regional development at full capacity in the South Caucasus. The conflict has resulted in the occupation of almost 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan and has created over 1 million internally displaced persons and refugees. The war has led to the deaths and injury of thousands of people, including women, the elderly, and children. Not a single Azerbaijani historic or cultural monument, including sites of Islamic heritage, has remained undamaged, and no sacred site escaped desecration in the occupied territories and in Armenia. Our view on the solution of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is unequivocal and is based on the fundamental principles of international law, four resolutions of the UNSC, and documents and resolutions from other international organizations. We sincerely believe that there is no alternative to peace, stability, and mutually beneficial regional cooperation. Without prejudice to its rights under the UN Charter, in particular those set forth in Article 51, Azerbaijan has embarked on, and remains committed to, the conflict settlement process, confident in its objective to put an end to illegal Armenian occupation, restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, ensure the return of forcibly displaced people to their homes, and guarantee the peaceful coexistence of Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan. We firmly believe that eliminating the military consequences of the Armenian occupation, along with the launch of confidence-building measures, is the proper route to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. But, on the contrary, attempts by the Armenian side to misinterpret the norms and principles of international law and its insistence on unrealistic annexationist claims, which Azerbaijan will never accept, represent an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and could greatly jeopardize the negotiation process. The Armenian leadership has to understand that demonstrating a constructive approach and denouncing its annexationist policy toward its neighbor will change security perceptions in the region, positively affect the peace negotiations process, and be beneficial to all players, internal and external.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as an economic and diplomatic actor in the Turkic Council?<br></h4><p>In spite of the recent global economic crisis, our members, especially Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, have continued to develop remarkably fast. Over the past 10 years, the economy of Azerbaijan has tripled to become the 66th largest economy in the world, up from the 106th ranking it had in 2003. Azerbaijan successfully hosted the Third Summit of the Turkic Council on Transport and Connectivity in the city of Gabala in August 2013. The first summit was held in October 2011 in Almaty and focused on economic cooperation, whereas the second was held in August 2012 in Bishkek and focused on educational, scientific, and cultural cooperation. Azerbaijan is currently Chairman-in-Office of the Turkic Council. It is responsible for realizing the Council's initiatives of cooperation within the region and beyond and of the elimination of hurdles that stand before these initiatives in collaboration with the Secretariat. Cooperation within other international organizations is one of our main priorities. Azerbaijan was overwhelmingly elected a member of the Security Council of the UN in 2011, and during its membership it defended the interests of our other members. And by leveraging its influence in the international arena, Azerbaijan also contributes to the work of the Council within other international organizations.</p><h4>What is Azerbaijan's importance as a transport and energy link between Central Asia and Europe?</h4><p>Azerbaijan undertakes a crucial role in providing energy security for Europe by pioneering secure transport and reliable supply. The construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline opened an international energy and transportation corridor. Upon the completion of this project, other Central Asian states benefited from its transit opportunities. For the first time in history, the Caspian Sea is connected to the Mediterranean Sea, and this has encouraged the implementation of other huge projects. Nowadays, it is difficult to separate the transport and energy sectors. The restoration of the ancient Silk Road is already realistic, and in this sense the operationalization of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway in 2015, initiated by Azerbaijan, will represent a major achievement as an example of truly great geopolitical and geo-economic cooperation. If a transport corridor is developed, the Caspian Sea member states will benefit commercially from bilateral trade and transit. Currently, cargo loaded in northwestern China travels 23,000 kilometers to reach Europe via sea routes. However, the new multi-modal transport network utilizing the Caspian Sea connection within the Central Transport Corridor could cut transport times from 30-45 days to 10-12 days, and shorten the distance from 23,000 kilometers to 8,500 kilometers. In this respect, the new Baku International Trade Seaport, to be completed in 2015, will play an important role. The Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID), signed on December 17, 2013, will ensure Europe's energy security and expand regional cooperation. Meanwhile, the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP), on the territory of Turkey, and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), to be directed from the Turkey-Greece border to Italy, will carry Shah Deniz II gas on to Europe. The challenge we face today is the speedy conclusion of these pipelines within five years. In the future, other Central Asian states could join these projects, providing additional opportunities for the diversification of energy supplies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the country's economic growth in recent years?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan has experienced a further strengthening of its state institutions, the sustainable development of the national economy, and increased social welfare of the population, each representing major achievements. As a result, Azerbaijan was elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and entered the list of the few countries to have launched a satellite, while also completing the transition to a market economy and becoming an investment exporter and political, economic, and cultural center for the region. Building upon the founding principles set out by National Leader Heydar Aliyev, the perseverance, pragmatic policy, and sustained efforts of President Ilham Aliyev have brought rapid social and economic developments to Azerbaijan. Over the past decade, GDP has grown 3.2 times, revenues of the state budget 16 times, industrial output 2.7 times, and fixed capital investments 4.7 times. During this period, average annual economic growth has been at 12.9%, making Azerbaijan one of the best performing economies in the world. Over the course of the past decade, the volume of the country's strategic currency reserves has increased by 31 times. The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to GDP was at 68%, more than eight times higher than the nation's foreign debt. Investments in Azerbaijan over the past 10 years have topped $160 billion, 65% of which represents the inflow of the non-oil sector of the national economy. And today, Azerbaijan is recognized as an investor country, having pursued business in a number of European countries, in addition to other neighboring states. Over the past decade, the ratio of the budget deficit to GDP has been below 1%. The external debt-to-GDP ratio has not exceeded 8.3%. This once again proves the sustainability of the national economy in the face of global challenges. The income of the population has increased by 6.5 times over the same period, while the average monthly wage rose 5.5 times. The creation of over 1.2 million new jobs and the reduction of the unemployment rate to 5% and poverty rate to 5.3% have also been welcome developments. The expansion of exports and access of exported goods to new markets along with the traditional ones are also important achievements. The foreign trade turnover has increased 6.6 fold; 9.3 fold in exports and 4.1 fold in imports. Non-oil exports grew by 4.7 times. Now, Azerbaijan is conducting trade operations with almost 150 countries. These were the great achievements underlying the victory of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev at the elections held in October 2013. The democratic, transparent, free, and fair win, which unequivocally met international standards, demonstrated Azerbaijan's political and electoral sophistication, its loyalty to national, spiritual, and universal values, and deep trust and confidence in its leader for the whole world once again. Dynamic development continued in all sectors of the economy in Azerbaijan and the growth of GDP was mainly due to the non-oil sector, which reached 5.8% in 2013. In 2013, non-oil sector growth was at 10% and its share in GDP rose to 56.6%. Record investment ($28 billion) was made in the economy last year. Subsequent socio-economic achievements have duly been reflected in the reports of reputable international ratings agencies. In the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, Azerbaijan has been a leading country among CIS states for five years. Azerbaijan ranked 8th in terms of the macroeconomic environment, 10th for the gross national savings-to-GDP ratio, and 13th in terms of the government debt-to-GDP ratio, while the country was recognized as having the lowest inflation. Recently, Azerbaijan took 81st place among 178 countries in the Index of Economic Freedom-2014 published by the Heritage Foundation, allowing it to enter the category of “countries with moderately free economies." In addition, Baku's hosting of the World Economic Forum in 2013, the first in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, confirms the recognition of Azerbaijan's economic successes and its growing reputation in the international arena.</p><h4>What sectors are identified in terms of diversification of the economic matrix?</h4><p>Pursuant to the goals identified in the Azerbaijan 2020: Outlook for the Future development concept, high-impact measures are being implemented to accelerate economic diversification and increase non-oil GDP. As a result, over the past 10 years, the country's non-oil sector rose by 2.6 times, the non-oil industry by 1.9 times, and investment in the non-oil sector by 15.2 times. The formation of a knowledge-based economy and active pursuit of innovation and research will be accelerated over the coming years. Measures implemented to support the development of agriculture are important issues in terms of eco-friendly agricultural production, reduction of import dependence, employment, and, in particular, food safety. The allocation of subsidies and preferential loans, the organization of leasing and agricultural services with the support of the state, and the creation of logistics centers all create favorable conditions for the sustainable development of this sector. State support will also continue to stimulate the intensive and effective development of the agrarian sector in subsequent years. Along with the improvement of new ICT services, the launch of the first telecommunications satellite into orbit in 2014, and the creation of a leading-edge technology park offer an opportunity for the development of this field. Azerbaijan has great potential and a rich history, a good geographic position, and favorable climatic conditions for the development of tourism. The number of hotels and related facilities has increased by more than fivefold nationwide. In addition, we are pursuing alternative and renewable energy sources as a matter of importance.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the current environment for foreign investment?</h4><p>As a result of the dynamic development of Azerbaijan, international organizations, multinational corporations, and investors are showing considerable interest. Azerbaijan is a politically stable country, and notable for its national, religious, and ethnic tolerance. Secondly, due to the successful policy pursued by the government, Azerbaijan enjoys macroeconomic stability. Even during the period of global economic and financial crisis, Azerbaijan maintained economic sustainability and achieved notable economic development. One of the key factors in assessing the attractiveness of the country, of course, is its favorable business and investment climate. Investors, foreign and local, enjoy full protection of their rights and interests, as well as equal opportunities. The inviolability of property is constitutionalized in Azerbaijan. Moreover, administrative procedures have been simplified, transparency mechanisms applied, and the outreach of e-services expanded. The total inflow of investments to date amounts to $172 billion, with around half being accounted for by FDI. As a result of these measures, Azerbaijan was declared the world's most reformed country in the World Bank's Doing Business 2009 report. The next factor to consider is Azerbaijan's reputation as a reliable partner in the international arena. Our country fulfills its obligations arising from international agreements in full and on time. Transnational projects initiated by Azerbaijan play an important role in ensuring the energy security of Europe. The energy resources of the Caspian Sea are transported to the countries of the region and Europe via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline. The Trans-Anatolian and Trans-Adriatic Gas Pipelines will also expand cooperation in energy, as Azerbaijan becomes one of the largest natural gas suppliers in Europe. Azerbaijan is also an important transit center, with its unique geographic position. In this regard, the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, the International Sea Trade Port, the reconstruction of highways within the framework of TRACECA, and the North-South corridors, as well as the inauguration of seven international airports over the past decade, have turned Azerbaijan into an essential link in the Eurasian transport corridor.</p><div class="quote">“  In the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, Azerbaijan has been a leading country among CIS states for five years.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During your visit to Baku in May 2013 you mentioned that the cooperation between the EU and Azerbaijan is of strategic importance. In addition to energy, what are the priorities of bilateral relations?<br></h4><p>The engagement of Azerbaijan with the EU is based on the European Neighborhood Policy and on the Eastern Partnership. The current legal framework for bilateral relations is still the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1999 where our focus is on democratization, economic development, and cooperation in a number of important fields including democracy, the principles of international law, and human rights. We have an interest in developing this legal framework with the conclusion of an Association Agreement. These negotiations need time, and at this stage cannot include an agreement on a comprehensive free trade area, since Azerbaijan is not yet a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is clearly a shared strategic interest. A reinforced and updated legal framework in our relations would also contribute to strengthening democracy and the protection of human rights, which in light of the developments of the recent past also merit the distinction of a strategic interest. Given Azerbaijan's geographical location and the clear interest expressed by Azerbaijan in its efforts to promote tourism and develop business beyond energy, we also see a strategic interest in continuing the negotiations on an aviation agreement or promoting the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, the development of the new Baku International Sea Port at Alat, and the realization of the Silk Wind project, and the latter foresees the creation of a container block train route with the advanced electronic exchange of information, the simplification of customs and border-crossing procedures, and the reduction of transit time and travel time in the TRACECA transport corridor.</p><h4>What are your views on the EU's contribution to finding a peaceful and speedy solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict?</h4><p>The EU is fully committed to supporting the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement process. Only a peaceful, negotiated settlement can allow the entire region to move toward a secure and prosperous future and can help unleash the full potential of the South Caucasus region as a gateway between Europe and Asia. The EU is concerned about the lack of tangible progress on the settlement of this conflict, which remains one of the top priorities for the EU's foreign policy. In this context, we welcomed the meeting of the President of Armenia and the President of Azerbaijan in Vienna on November 19, 2013, and commended the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs for their efforts in facilitating the resumption of top-level meetings. It was encouraging that the Presidents agreed to advance negotiations and meet again in the months ahead. The EU has called upon Armenia and Azerbaijan to step up their efforts toward agreement on the Madrid Principles as a basis for peace, in accordance with the commitments undertaken by the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan within the Minsk Group. In relation to this, we have reiterated our full support for the work of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and their proposals for the peaceful resolution of the conflict on the basis of the principles of the non-use or threat of force, territorial integrity, equal rights, and the self-determination of peoples, as is reflected in joint statements made by the Presidents of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries. The Minsk process would require maintaining an environment conducive to progress. Concerned about the escalation of tension due to confrontational rhetoric and serious incidents along the Line of Contact and along the international border between the two countries, the EU has urged both sides to respect the ceasefire, fulfill their commitments made in the framework of the Minsk Group, and refrain from actions and statements that could heighten tension and undermine the peace process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Azerbaijan Export and Investment Promotion Foundation (AZPROMO) went to great lengths over 2013 to promote trade and investment with new partners, such as Spain, Saudi Arabia, Austria, and the Netherlands. Could you describe the accomplishments of the company?<br></h4><p>Indeed, 2013 was successful in terms of trade and investment promotion. In order to stimulate and facilitate the internationalization of Azerbaijani companies, AZPROMO organized 277 events, including business forums, B2B meetings, trade missions, round tables, and seminars, among others. The geographic coverage of our activities was also broad, including at least 60 countries on five continents. In 2013, we launched three new projects through our representative offices in the US, the UAE, and Romania regarding the export of Azerbaijani wines and spirits to the US, non-alcoholic beverages to the UAE, and foodstuffs to Romania. In order to increase the awareness of Azerbaijani entrepreneurs on various matters related to exports to foreign markets, we continuously undertake market research, organize seminars and round tables, and render free-of-charge services to our exporters. We have also been actively promoting investment opportunities in Azerbaijan and rendering services to 54 potential and existing investors from 26 countries. As a matter of fact, we are seeing excellent results reflected in these figures. Thus, around $10.5 billion was invested in 2013 in the Azerbaijani economy from abroad. Our non-oil exports increased sustainably with almost 6% growth in 2013. Azerbaijani exports to traditional markets, such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine increased along with many relatively new partners, such as Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Afghanistan, South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. This is an encouraging message for Azerbaijani exporters.</p><h4>The institution has partnered with numerous investment agencies from Asia and Europe. How do these partnerships help in promoting Azerbaijan's trade and investment opportunities?</h4><p>AZPROMO has partnered with 53 organizations, including investment and export promotion agencies, chambers of commerce, international organizations, and public institutions from 34 countries. In 2013 alone, we signed seven memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with institutions from Slovenia, Italy, China, Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Moreover, we closely cooperate with investment promotion agencies through the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA), where we hold the Vice-Presidency and lead the South Caucasus and Central Asia on its Steering Committee. WAIPA gathers together over 250 national and sub-national agencies from 162 countries. In terms of the practical implications of these partnerships, they are crucial in promoting Azerbaijan's export and investment opportunities. As such, together with our partners, we continuously share experiences in trade and investment promotion and exchange information, which is important in better understanding our export and investment potential, analyzing foreign markets, organizing various important promotional events, finding new partners for Azerbaijani companies, and helping them enter foreign markets and address any issues. We actively disseminate information on Azerbaijani products to potential buyers and distributors through our partners' networks and invite international companies to invest in the non-oil sector of our economy.</p><h4>Azerbaijan celebrated the Year of ICT in 2013. What improvements have you noticed as far as foreign investment in this sector is concerned?</h4><p>In recent years, the ICT sector has played an increasingly important role in the economic development of Azerbaijan. While recognizing this important role, the government has identified ICT as one of the key sectors and has taken significant steps toward forming a modern information society and knowledge-based economy. ICT is one the fastest developing non-oil sectors of Azerbaijan's economy. Its volume in the period of 2003-2012 increased six fold. In 2013 alone, the sector grew by around 14%. The role of the private sector, including international investors in this development trend, is vitally important. Around 80% of income derived from ICT is that of private companies and foreign investors. For instance, IT and mobile telephony are fully in private hands, while five out eight fixed-line operators, 33 out of 35 post operators, and 38 out of 40 internet providers are private companies, many with foreign capital. Foreign investors placed around $63 million in ICT in 2012. As a matter of fact, Azerbaijan is one of the leading economies in the CIS region in terms of ICT development. According to the Global Information Technology Report of the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan is ranked 56th among 144 countries in the Networked Readiness Index and 20th in terms of ICT affordability. Indeed, the Year of ICT was full of significant events and abundant new initiatives and projects. In February 2013, the first Azerbaijani satellite, Azerspace-1, was launched and is already fully operational and turning a profit. It is an historic event for Azerbaijan to have become a part of the “space club." In order to stimulate further investments in this field, including FDI, various projects and stimulation mechanisms have been launched. One such important project is the High Technologies Park, focused on innovation, IT, and e-services, where investors are offered tax and customs incentives and infrastructural advantages. In addition to the High Technologies Park, the President of Azerbaijan has established a State IT Development Fund aimed at promoting innovative entrepreneurship, providing financial support, attracting foreign and domestic investments in ICT, and stimulating R&amp;D in this field. Other important national and international projects being implemented include the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM), the Europe-Persia Express Gateway (EPEG), the development of national broadband internet in Azerbaijan, the People's Computer, e-government, Dilmanc, and many others. All these projects create favorable conditions and offer attractive opportunities for foreign investors. At present, half of the top-20 ICT companies of the world are operating in Azerbaijan and implementing various important projects. Their operation is substantial evidence of the huge potential of ICT and of the business-friendly environment in Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“  Foreign investors placed around $63 million in ICT in 2012. "</div><h4>To what extent are Azerbaijani entrepreneurs being incentivized by the government to consider export markets for their goods and services?</h4><p>Export promotion is among the key economic policies of our country. Azerbaijan chose an export-oriented economic model as reflected in the Azerbaijan 2020: Vision for the Future development concept. This is translated into a number of measures aimed at increasing the volume of non-oil exports and their geographic structure. Everything starts with readiness for exports; for example, productivity and competitiveness. We promote the productivity and competitiveness of products made in Azerbaijan by introducing new technologies and know-how. There are a number of mechanisms and incentives established by the government, such as the State Fund for the Support of Entrepreneurship, which offers soft loans for local producers, the Azerbaijan Investment Company, a public equity fund investing together with local and international companies in various fields and projects of the non-oil sector. I would also like to highlight our industrial parks, such as Sumgait Chemical Industrial Park and Balakhani Eco-Industrial Park, where investors are offered tax and customs incentives, the necessary infrastructure under the plug-and-play concept, and the availability of on-site raw materials. Another important example is the agriculture sector, where producers are exempt from all taxes except land tax, and offered a scheme of government subsidies. This in turn stimulates farmers to reinvest in increasing productivity and product quality. In terms of the promotion of exports and the increased share of non-oil goods in the export matrix, we have undertaken a number of legislative and institutional reforms to facilitate exports, cut red tape, and incentivize entrepreneurs. Such measures include, among others, the introduction of a one-stop-shop at customs, the simplification of export procedures, the abolition of customs duties on exports, and the internationalization of Azerbaijani companies.</p><h4>HE President Aliyev was voted into office for a third term in 2013. What do you expect this new term to bring as far as trade and investment in Azerbaijan is concerned?</h4><p>The re-election of HE President Aliyev in October 2013 demonstrated the lasting support for the President's sustainable, and future-oriented economic policy. One of the major characteristics of our economy is its predictability and clear understanding of its future development. It is embodied in a major document, a strategic concept paper called “Azerbaijan 2020: Vision for the Future" adopted by the President late 2012. This fully reflects the expectations that this new period will bring our country in terms of the development. To be more precise, our goal, as far as economic development is concerned, is to double the economy by that time, and to reach a higher national average income and greater social development. We have opted for an export-oriented development model of increased diversification, competitiveness, productivity, and economic effectiveness. In terms of internationalization, the aim is to increase non-oil exports up to $1,000 per capita and attract FDI into various key sectors of the economy. We predict average annual growth of non-oil GDP of at least 7%, which is quite achievable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wherever-were-needed]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) contributed over the past year to national development?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2013 was immensely successful for Azerbaijan. We saw the launch of our first telecommunications satellite earlier in the year. Some 20% of the 3.2—ton satellite's capacity will be used to meet local demand, whereas the remaining 80% will be offered up for international commercial purposes. As recently as December 17, Azerbaijan hosted an official signing ceremony following an agreement over the construction of the $45 billion Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) for natural gas deliveries to Europe, a 520-kilometer Southern Gas Corridor to carry natural gas from Azerbaijan through Turkey, Albania, and Greece to Italy, which will serve to enhance Europe's energy security. The TAP, a project of Norwegian Statoil, Swiss Axpo, and German E.ON Ruhrgas, is due for completion in 2019. The total cost of the project is approximately $2.2 billion. The annual capacity of the pipeline will be 10 billion cubic meters (bcm), with the possibility of expansion to 20 bcm in the future. The jewel in the crown for AIC, though, was Baku Shipyard Company LLC, a new 62-hectare shipyard jointly owned and developed by the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), AIC, and Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine Ltd. (Keppel O&amp;M), a Singapore-based world leader in the maritime industry. It was inaugurated by the President of Azerbaijan, HE Ilham Aliyev, on September 20, 2013. The new yard is designed to undertake the construction of a wide range of specialized vessels and merchant ships including subsea vessels, anchor handling tug and supply vessels, and multi-purpose offshore support vessels such as platform supply vessels, as well as tankers and cargo vessels. The yard also has ship repair and conversion capabilities. Although Keppel O&amp;M owns just a 10% stake in the yard, it has full responsibility for management and operation. The largest shareholder, at 65%, is SOCAR, followed by AIC, which owns 25% of the company's equity. Phase I of the yard was built at a cost of $470 million. When operating at full capacity, it is able to undertake up to 100 repairs and conversions per annum and is estimated to achieve an average annual steel output of 25,000 tons. Plans for Phase II include the construction of a graving dock with added facilities for offshore projects. With highly skilled human resources, world-class expertise, and the right know-how, as well as well-structured capital investments, we will not have to wait too long to see the shipyard become a globally recognized center of excellence in shipbuilding, repair, and conversion. Baku Shipyard Company LLC will not only be serving local demand in Azerbaijan, but also that of the littoral countries of the Caspian basin, as well as becoming an important production hub for maritime industries in the region.</p><h4>In what ways is the government helping to support agricultural producers in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The state has established a strong institutional mechanism aimed at sustaining economic growth and stimulating production and development in the non-oil sector of the national economy. To promote the further development of business in this sector the state has been encouraging the introduction of a range of financial and non-financial schemes. Agricultural producers do not pay taxes besides land tax, which varies depending on the quality and location of the land in question. Businesses engaged in the food processing industry are subject to the statutory tax regime, which is still quite competitive. All companies registered in Azerbaijan, even those that are 100% foreign owned, may benefit from numerous subsidies, discounts, and other privileges provided by the state. Such subsidies and discounts can scale up to 70% of the value of goods, products, and services producers may require in the line of their business. Recent disbursements of soft loans in the agricultural sector by the National Entrepreneurs Support Fund total over $930 million. As another part of the institutional mechanism, the establishment of the AIC was a showcase of one of the government's first public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives. Projects in agriculture add great significance to the structure of our portfolio, coming second only to industry, and representing nearly one-fifth of our total investments. So far, AIC has invested over $28 million in various projects in the sector. One such project is Aghstafa Agroservice. Launched in 2012, and with an overall value of just under $6 million, one-quarter of which is owned by AIC, the project serves the purpose of establishing an advanced agro-technical services facility to help improve productivity and the efficient use of soil. Having partnered with RAO Global Group GmbH on this project, we at AIC are pleased to have been able to facilitate local access to modern technology and machinery for daily use. Another project AIC has invested in is Davachi Broyler, a poultry production facility with an overall value of more than $60 million. The AIC investment of about $15 million back in 2010 helped with the renovation and capacity expansion of one of the largest poultry production farms in Azerbaijan. The facility today occupies 135 hectares of land and employs over 800 people, who contribute to the production and processing of poultry products in excess of 13,000 tons a year. Azertokhum is one of the greenfield projects AIC joined in 2010. The $24 million investment was aimed at the construction of the ï¬rst modern seed processing plant and granary, as well as the cultivation of highly reproductive, elite, and super-elite seeds using advanced technologies. Three years later, Azertokhum today occupies a 70,000-sqm area in central Azerbaijan. It has a production capacity of 86,400 tons of seeds per annum. The plant also has dry and wet grain silos, and a drying tower with a capacity of 36 tons, as well as a 10 ton-per-hour packing unit. These, and other new projects that we are currently considering, help to put AIC in a privileged position as a part of the mechanism established to support the non-oil sector of the national economy.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has reached out to a number of relatively new partners in 2014. What are your expectations regarding the contribution of foreign investment and trade to economic diversification?</h4><p>This year has been particularly productive in terms of building new partnerships with foreign investors. Here, I would like to refer to a famous quote by Mark Zuckerberg, who defined the basis for Facebook's partnership strategy as: “We build the social technology, they provide the music." In Azerbaijan, we offer mutually beneficial investment opportunities and a dependable partnership in return for globally attested and recognized new technology, know-how, and innovative ideas that will serve our goal of fostering development in the non-oil sector of the national economy.</p><div class="quote">“  So far, AIC has invested over $28 million in various projects in the agriculture sector. "</div><h4>Azerbaijan will be the host of the first European Games in 2015. What will that mean in terms of investment in the economy?</h4><p>The forthcoming European Games is just another success story in Azerbaijan's drive to assert its well-deserved reputation as a host country for large-scale international events. Every such event opens up new development avenues, including the construction of multiple venues for various sports and games, such as a new football stadium with a retractable roof to house 65,000 spectators, the state-of-the-art National Gymnastics Arena with a seating capacity extending to 12,000 people, the new Baku Aquatic Centre, athletics villages, roads, and other related infrastructure. The government has not been sparing in the provision of resources in developing this infrastructure, which will continue to serve local people and attract a good number of returning visitors, helping to boost tourism in the years beyond 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main focus areas for Delta Group's business activities?</h4><p>Delta Group's activities comprise three major areas: imports, service (distribution and logistics), and production. The production facilities feature Saglam Qida, BisMak, and a mill complex. The opening of our new logistics center in 2013 was one the year's highlights. The center complies with the highest international standards, and caters not only to Delta Group's needs, but to those of other businesses, too. And in terms of distribution, we are continually expanding our network, as we plan to have the necessary infrastructure to distribute our own products. Distribution is a fast-changing and challenging business. Some products, such as bread, have a short shelf life of one to two days, which demands fast and reliable distribution channels. Our distribution networks cover the entire territory of Azerbaijan and, to date, we have eight regional distribution centers. Delta Group employs roughly 450 professionals in the logistics and distribution sector, and about the same number in production, which includes both the newly opened Saglam Qida and our older facility BisMak.</p><h4>How did the Saglam Qida complex perform in its first few months?</h4><p>The inauguration of this complex in 2013 was the crowning moment in the history of Delta Group. It is also very important for Azerbaijan to have such a pastry baking plant. With our Chorekchi, or “Baker" brand, we are endorsing a quality bread culture. The center opened five months ago and utilizes technology from leading German provider Werner &amp; Pfleiderer, one of the oldest companies the world providing technology for the bakery industry. The factory's production capacity is 125 tons a day. We plan to expand the number of pastry varieties we produce there to 100-150 types over the next three years. The plant also comprises a granary and a flour production line. When fully operational, the plant will create 300 jobs.</p><h4>What has been the performance of your other production complex, BisMak?</h4><p>Apart from the Saglam Qida complex, Delta Group operates another complex called BisMak, which has been in the market for almost a decade. BisMak is a widely recognized brand on the Azerbaijani market, as well as overseas. In 2014, we plan to increase the BisMak product range. We also employ foreign experts to improve the performance of both the BisMak and Saglam Qida complexes.</p><div class="quote">“  Some products, such as bread, have a short shelf life of one to two days, which demands fast and reliable distribution channels. "</div><h4>How did your import business, Delta Import, perform?</h4><p>The third area of our activities is the importing of high-quality FMCG products. These are, for example, Fonterra (New Zealand) brands, Anchor, and Doyarushka butter (five years on the market). We have been distributing Fonterra brands for the past 15 years. Fonterra is one of the world's top-three butter production companies. Another key brand in our portfolio is Ammerlander cheese (Germany), which we have been importing for over a decade. Finally, the Kamar brand from Germany covers the halal sausage market.</p><h4>How is Delta Group contributing to regional development in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We hire 1,000 people overall, including the head and regional offices; therefore, we create numerous jobs in the regions. To date, we have been distributing our FMCG products in Baku alone, but we plan to commence distribution to the regions as well on the back of the new pastry plant, thereby creating more employment. To date, we have started working in regional areas including Balakan, Zakatala, and Shamaha, to name a few.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID)?</h4><p>The signing of the FID is no less than a turning point for the industry. We value the project as a major driver of the energy strategy developed in the mid-1990s. The signing of the FID in December 2013 dramatically increases our export potential as it covers not only the full development of the Shah Deniz gas field, but also the construction of the Southern Gas Corridor, infrastructure that will deliver Azerbaijani gas to European markets. The Southern Gas Corridor is a chain of several projects including the expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). We plan to deliver the first extracted gas from Shah Deniz, utilizing TANAP, to Turkey in mid-2018 and to Europe through TAP in 2019.</p><h4>Given the international nature of the projects, what challenges do you anticipate in building and operating the TAP and TANAP?</h4><p>These two large-scale projects, with a total length of over 2,600 kilometers, will head from Turkey crossing Greece, Albania, the Adriatic Sea, and come ashore in Italy. Taking into account the sheer scale of investment, the number of companies involved, and the diversity of countries, projects such as TANAP and TAP usually present major challenges on their own. Being aware of the potential risks and challenges, we constantly work with our partners to identify risks and implement effective risk management strategies, which is an ongoing process. TAP and TANAP are very well positioned due to their strategic importance for Europe's energy security policy. Therefore, the projects are supported not only by the participating member countries, but also by the EU as a whole. From an international perspective based on that information, TAP and TANAP fall into the low-risk projects category. However, we are exposed to the risk of rising steel prices due to the lack of long-term hedging instruments. Another type of common potential risk is the disruption to materials supply at the construction stage of projects, preventing timely execution. We have understood and evaluated the possible impact of these risks for our projects; therefore, we have taken the appropriate pro-active measures to mitigate them. These measures are not limited to the hiring of a highly skilled and experienced management team, and the involvement of third-parties in order to achieve minimum deviation—if any—in both the cost and the schedule of the projects respectively.</p><h4>The Umid field was SOCAR's single largest gas condensate find. How has production at the field performed since 2010?</h4><p>The SOCAR-UMID LLC, a joint venture between SOCAR (80% working interest) and Nobel Oil Exploration and Production Ltd. (20% working interest) was established in May 2008 for the exploration of the Umid structure. The exploration program was approved on July 24, 2009. Drilling at the first exploration well started in September 2009 and was concluded in November 2010 with a gas discovery at a 6,006-meter depth. On the same day, SOCAR made a public announcement on the estimated reserves at Umid, putting the figure at a minimum of 200 bcm of gas and 30 million tons of condensate. In May 2011, SOCAR and Nobel Oil approved a decision on the drilling of a second exploration well at Umid, which commenced in July 2011 and finished in April 2012 at a depth of 6,400 meters. The well was successfully flow tested with 1.2 mcm of gas and 150 tons of condensate at the wellhead. Pilot production from this well started in September 2012, and by January 2014 accumulated net production from the well was 251 mcm of gas and 40,000 tons of condensate. On September 26, 2012, SOCAR and Nobel Oil approved a decision on the drilling of a third exploration well at the Umid field, which started in November 2012 and ended in December 2013 at the depth 6,309 meters. The well was successfully tested in January of 2014 with a flow of 1.5 mcm of gas and 200 tons of condensate at the wellhead.</p><div class="quote">“  The OGPC is SOCAR's largest downstream project in Azerbaijan. "</div><h4>What were the noteworthy downstream developments for SOCAR in 2013, and what are your plans for 2014?</h4><p>Currently, the oil and gas processing and petrochemical complex (OGPC) is SOCAR's largest downstream project in Azerbaijan, and boasts national significance. Its development stage started in 2013 and will continue throughout 2014. The complex will consist of an oil refinery with a capacity of around 9 million tons and a gas refinery with a capacity of 12 bcm, as well as a petrochemical plant. Completion of the complex is scheduled for 2020. Meanwhile, in Turkey, we initiated downstream investments to become the major shareholders of the Petkim Petrochemical Complex in 2008 and, since then, have successfully developed our business in that market. We continue to invest in the expansion of certain product lines and complex facilities. In 2013, we also started construction of the STAR Refinery with the capacity to process 10 million tons of crude oil per annum, which will pave the way for future regional projects. The STAR Refinery will be built using environmentally friendly technologies to produce petroleum products such as diesel oil, jet fuel, and LPG, for example. It will also produce 1.6 million tons of naphtha, which will reduce the dependency of the petrochemical sector on imported oil products.</p><h4>What role will initiatives like the Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute, as well as the Science Fund, play in the company's future development?</h4><p>As a successful global company, R&amp;D is of the essence, including in particular the development of nanotechnologies. SOCAR, along with its Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute, boasts a nanotechnologies department within the company structure. The fact that most of the Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute's world-class research projects have been certified, and that the institute has over 1,200 inventions in its portfolio, shows that we have already registered strong achievements in R&amp;D. In addition to this, SOCAR's nanotechnology department holds four related patents. Elaborate technologies are being continuously tested on our wells. Our Science Fund is also dedicated to stimulating scientists external to the company to conduct research in our fields of interest. We believe that someday our in-house research has the capacity to contribute not only to the company's future development, but also to the development of the oil and gas industry worldwide.</p><h4>To what extent has SOCAR become an international actor in the energy sector?</h4><p>Currently, SOCAR is the owner of companies operating in Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Switzerland, and other countries. The largest component of our international portfolio, worth approximately $20 billion, including TANAP, is located in Turkey, where we hold a major share in the Petkim Petrochemical Complex, projects such as the STAR Refinery, and other mainly downstream assets. SOCAR is currently the biggest foreign direct investor in Turkey. We are also the largest taxpayer in Georgia, where we have invested over $400 million since 2006. Currently, our Georgian assets include a gas distribution network, filling stations, and the Kulevi Oil Terminal and Port. Moreover, there is a network of over 300 SOCAR-branded filling stations in operation in Georgia, Ukraine, Romania, and Switzerland. In 2013, SOCAR placed its first Eurobond issue on the London Stock Exchange, which was positively perceived by investors. The company also delivers oil of Brent quality that is traded on the London Stock Exchange. Besides, SOCAR has representative offices in Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Austria, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, the US, the UK, Iran, Germany, and Ukraine, as well as subsidiaries in Singapore, Vietnam, Nigeria, and elsewhere. Our continued steps toward expanding our foreign activities include the recent acquisition of a 66% stake in Greek natural gas transmission network operator DESFA, which will allow SOCAR to participate in various investment projects in Balkan countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are coming up on 20 years of cordial diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan. What are your priorities for bilateral cooperation?<br></h4><p>In my opinion, we enjoy perfect relations, and are looking forward to further discussions on the practical development of our partnership. We have started large projects together that are still at the initial stages, but I expect positive contracts to be signed based on long-term cooperation. This is also valid for countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. We need to boost transit connections between all of these countries, across rail, sea, and air, which requires practical links. Our meetings, as ever, are cordial, but ultimately produce clear and thoroughly thought-out arguments that form the practical basis for the future.</p><h4>What is the importance of Azerbaijan for Latvia and Europe as a large energy producer in terms of energy security?</h4><p>This is one area in which much discussion has taken place, especially regarding Azerbaijan, but also concerning other countries in the region. We're analyzing the situation and trying to better understand the course of shale gas development. Such developments could create a completely new energy picture for the entire Eurasia region. There are, of course, prospects, but they may be highly expensive. From the outside, it appears that at the Baltic level it will not be so easy to reach a consensus. These are complicated questions and should be analyzed. Expanding energy projects with Azerbaijan is certainly a possibility.</p><h4>Do you see gas from Azerbaijan or the Caspian Sea reaching Latvia?</h4><p>We will see, as this is an early consideration. For the Baltic countries, any misjudgments could have serious consequences for the future. Finland and Poland must also be considered when making such decisions. It is much easier to coordinate these development projects by utilizing the strengths of each country. As I said, we have perfect political and human relations and a good basis for future activities, not only on a political and social, but especially at the commercial level. There are many practical contacts for Latvian companies in Azerbaijan. Again, visits to the country have provided us with solid opportunities for Latvian businesses to expand. We are leveraging our past Soviet links to boost relations in NATO, as other EU countries have done via their historical relations with other parts of the world. We do this not only to promote our own interests, but those of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will the recent credit upgrade do in terms of Bank Technique's attractiveness to investors?<br></h4><p>A high level of NPLs partially explains the bank's previously low credit rating in the 2012-2013 period. However, following intensive and fruitful work during that period, we managed to achieve a significant upgrade from rating agency Fitch in December 2013. Along with the development of retail and corporate banking segments, we want Bank Technique to be active on the financial markets as well. We are in the process of establishing a strong relationship with global financial institutions in the context of our interest in developing treasury and interbank operations. A higher rating will provide the opportunity to establish better and closer cooperation with international financial institutions. From now on, we are going to be more concentrated on trade finance and forex operations. At the same time, we are considering the issuing of the bonds as the next stage of our strategic plan.</p><p>We are set to participate in various large-scale projects of our customers by financing them. Large projects require substantial funds, which is, again, why sound ratings are so crucial to making sure our customers enjoy uninterrupted financing. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve our figures, which will ultimately benefit us on the financial markets. And since we are considering the issuance of corporate bonds at later stages, the role of credit ratings becomes all the more essential to our operations.</p><h4>What innovations is Bank Technique trying to bring to its retail-banking arm?</h4><p>There are several initiatives being realized, and currently we are moving forward on the opening of e-branches, which will complement our e-banking lines, and will be installing ATMs with access to the e-banking system. At the same time, we are looking into specific equipment for transactions that do not involve ATMs. We ultimately want to enable our customers to execute all of their transactions through the e-banking system, although we understand that changing people's habits and increasing the popularity of e-banking requires time. At the same time, we are about to issue a special display card that will act as a payment card with an embedded chip and identification tool. The card will be enhanced by display and will generate one-time passwords. These passwords are required for customer identification in our online banking systems Technique Online (desktop) and Technique Mobile (smartphones and tablets). This innovative card—a MasterCard Gold—will enable us to provide our customers greater security and comfort, and is the first display card in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the card will provide additional security when shopping online. Apart from CVC, customers are provided 3D security through MasterCard. Usually, with similar products, the code is static, yet our product has the advantage of being dynamic. We plan to use this card as identification at our e-branches, as well, while the same will apply for our call center. The operator will ask whether you are an e-banking customer, and if yes, a one-time code will be requested. During 2013, we gave much time to the implementation of our new online banking system, which we scheduled for launch in the spring. Our objective was to make as many transactions as possible available on one platform. As a result, we succeeded in building an online banking system with the largest functionality and most innovative features. We expect our customers to respond positively to the system, which enables almost all non-cash banking transactions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you expect to be the impact of the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID) on Azerbaijan's energy sector?<br></h4><p>At the beginning of 2014, our President gave a speech saying that 2013 was very successful, especially in the energy sector, because the country signed some important agreements. Of course, I agree that the most important agreement we signed was the FID, and it was significant because it signaled the start of the southern gas corridor after two or three years of tough negotiations. Azerbaijan always worked hard to get the best deal on transit and delivery rights for gas headed to the European market. On December 17, 2013, the deal was concluded and nine companies signed documents with the state oil company on the sale of 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to the European market. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was also signed between the ministers of energy in several Balkan countries, meaning that the southern gas corridor does not just concern Italy, but also Georgia, Turkey, Greece, and Albania. Furthermore, we are considering expanding this corridor, which is why we involved several countries in the December signing. Our desire is to have a very strong, large-scale southern corridor. To finally have a decision about the upstream was very important for Azerbaijan because the upstream portion of Shah Deniz II is a large investment of approximately $27 billion. If we factor in other costs, such as the expansion of the Sangachal Terminal and of the South Caucasus Pipeline, which are worth approximately $6.5 billion, and the construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) on Turkish territory, which has an estimated cost of $13 billion, it brings the total cost of the investment to approximately $50 billion. Such a large investment must be handled responsibly, which is why our President established a state committee on the monitoring of all these projects and to support the companies that will implement this project in Azerbaijan and the region. In the future, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan may use the infrastructure we are currently building to export their resources to the European market. As such, the Shah Deniz II FID will have a major positive impact on the economies of many countries, including Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia, Italy, Greece, and Albania.</p><h4>To what extent do you believe this project is just the beginning of further gas projects from Azerbaijan to Europe?</h4><p>In order to answer this question, we have to look at the Caspian region's energy resources, which are tremendous. According to UN statistics, oil and gas production will double in the Caspian region by 2035. In recent years, Azerbaijan increased its oil production five times. Kazakhstan is going to increase its production because it has giant oil fields like Kashagan. Turkmenistan has tremendous gas reserves, as Yolotan is the biggest gas field in the world. I think this is just the beginning because many resources will be added to existing production. There are talks about adding Iranian and Iraqi gas reserves to this corridor. The third factor is that many countries need energy resources, such as natural gas. The demand opens up opportunities for us because the gas corridor can serve more and more markets. Recently, I met the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, who expressed his interest in the interconnection between Turkey and Bulgaria. Other neighboring countries, such as Montenegro and Serbia, are also very interested in having this corridor elongated. The people of these countries need natural gas for cooking, lighting, living, and generally improving their living conditions. That is why I think what we are doing now is only the beginning. In the next decade, all these ideas will be implemented.</p><h4>Looking at the future of the upstream sector in Azerbaijan, to what extent do you expect SOCAR to play a role in this sector?</h4><p>For the government of Azerbaijan, it is not so important to have large-scale production in the short term, but stable production in the long term. That is why I am very glad that in 2013 Azerbaijan produced 43.5 million tons of crude oil, similar to its 2012 levels of production. Stable production is good for the whole economy because it is the main source of cash flow. SOCAR's oil production is slowly decreasing from year to year because it has very old oil fields and it is natural that we have seen some decline in production. SOCAR's production goes to refineries and only its crude oil is refined at our refineries. As the population's standard of living increases, so does the demand for fuel and energy. It is very important for us that SOCAR's production remains stable. In the future, I don't think SOCAR will need to export crude oil. Demand is growing, and that is why we want to refine more here. That is why I think this is our future vision. What about Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)? Now, the BTC, for us, is a very important pipeline to deliver our oil for export to international markets. We also expanded its capacity. It was designed for 1 million barrels per day, and we expanded it up to 1.2 million. We have options to increase this capacity if needed. Before, we were very interested in Kazakhstani oil coming across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan and being delivered to the Mediterranean and so on. That is why the idea is so desirable. We very much believe that when the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan is fully implemented, production levels will be very high. We are glad because Kazakhstan promised that at the first stage it would produce 23 million tons per year and would grow in the second stage to upward of 50 million tons. In that case, some portion of this crude oil will be exported through Azerbaijan to markets in the West. That is why the BTC is very important for us.</p><div class="quote">“  The implementation of the Shah Deniz II project and the Southern Energy Corridor will be our main priority for the next five years. "</div><h4>How does the Ministry endorse the development of R&amp;D locally in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In 2013, we implemented several projects on constructing an electric power station. Now, our generation capacity has increased and stands at more than 7,000 MW. And the development doesn't stop with power stations, but includes grids, transformers, and stations—all were upgraded, renovated, and constructed and that is why we have a reliable energy system. While 15 years ago our power generation was unreliable, nowadays Azerbaijan has become an exporter of electricity to Russia, Georgia, and Iran. At the same time, we have interconnections between Azerbaijan and Georgia. That is why interconnecting Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey is providing us the opportunity to establish a new electricity corridor. Azerbaijan will then have the opportunity to export electricity to Georgia, Turkey, and, maybe, in the future, the Black Sea Energy System Ring. There are many opportunities now. This is why I think the development or strengthening of the electricity matrix in Azerbaijan is very important for us.</p><h4>What projects will the Ministry be working on in 2014?</h4><p>The implementation of the Shah Deniz II project and the Southern Energy Corridor will be our main priority for the next five years. Some of the main tasks comprising it are the construction of two new platforms and the drilling of 26 subsea wells, expanding the Sangachal Terminal. The Ministry of Energy aims to strengthen energy efficiency in the country, for which we will implement new rules and laws in the coming years. We do not want to increase fuel prices, so we have to find a solution to offer incentives for energy efficiency at constant prices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In December 2013, the BP-led consortium signed the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID). What is the significance of this deal for BP and its operations in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The FID was an important milestone that enabled us to move our Stage II development plans forward to the execution phase. It was a historic step that the Shah Deniz partnership took together with Azerbaijan to embark upon what is one of the largest and most complex endeavors ever undertaken by the global oil and gas industry. However, I believe the significance of this project goes far beyond the oil and gas industry as it paves the way for Azerbaijan's future and the region's future. I have observed that when people talk about Stage II, before they mention the 16 bcm of gas that it will deliver, they talk about the opportunities that it will open up for all nations related to the project. This is a unique project designed to bring benefits to all countries on the way stretching from the Caspian Sea to the heart of Europe.</p><p>For BP, it is a new development opportunity enabling it to unlock Azerbaijan's giant gas resources and delivering them to the regional and European markets. We are proud to be associated with such a project that will create a direct pipeline link between the Caspian and Europe for the first time in history. In fact, this project has an opportunity to open a new chapter in the development of Caspian resources and thus change the energy map of this region.</p><p>We are also proud that through this project we will deploy advanced subsea production technology in the Caspian Sea for the first time. The use of this technology in Azerbaijan will open up new opportunities for oil and gas developments in this region.</p><h4>The project is among the biggest of its kind in the world. What are its implications in terms of human capital and resources required for BP?</h4><p>Clearly, as a company we are privileged to be the operator of part of this huge Shah Deniz II/Southern Corridor project, which is expected to bring about $45 billion investment creating approximately 30,000 new jobs in the countries involved, including 10,000 in Azerbaijan. In addition, during the construction phase Azerbaijan will be able to utilize its fabrication facilities, barges and vessels, and other high quality industry resources. As a result of the project, the country will gain new onshore assets, offshore facilities and export infrastructure—all built to international standards.</p><p>The two planned platforms and most of the subsea installations for the Shah Deniz II project will be built in Azerbaijan. To do this, the technical and technological capacity of the construction yards near Baku will be enhanced. In addition, technical and functional parameters of several vessels to be engaged in subsea operations will be upgraded. A unique multipurpose vessel will be built at the newly commissioned shipyard in Baku to implement subsea construction work.</p><p>To deliver this giant project, we need to attract some of the best talent in Azerbaijan, in the region and indeed in the world—especially project managers, engineers, and technicians. New skills will need to be developed to operate the new high technology installations. Our nationalization plans target learning enhancement and development programs in order to further improve local talent. We are currently training over 150 local technicians specializing in the latest production technology. Over 500 welders will also be trained in the latest construction techniques in line with the highest international standards.</p><p>BP currently directly employs around 4,000 staff in Azerbaijan. We will further enhance this resource. Our aim is to ensure that by the end of 2018, 90% of our staff in Azerbaijan and Georgia is composed of Azerbaijani and Georgian nationals. Our construction contractors in Azerbaijan and Georgia are expected to mobilize a workforce of some 5,000 people this year for Shah Deniz initial construction activities. This number will nearly triple over the next four years.</p><h4>How can the additional infrastructure that will be built in connection with the Shah Deniz II project, such as the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), serve to export gas from other fields in Azerbaijan and from fields in neighboring CIS countries, such as Kazakhstan?</h4><p>At this stage our focus is on delivering the Shah Deniz II project and the associated pipelines that will form the Southern Corridor. To export 16 bcm of Stage II gas, we will expand the South Caucasus Pipeline with a new 48" pipeline loop in Azerbaijan and two compressor stations in Georgia. Across Turkey, Shah Deniz gas will be transported through the planned TANAP, which is expected to be a key part of the Southern Corridor. From the western border of Turkey, gas will flow through Greece and Albania to Italy via the TAP. In addition, as part of the sale of the 10 bcm of gas to Europe, 1 bcm will be sold to Bulgargaz at the TAP exit point in Greece and this requires development of a new interconnector.</p><p>While it is premature for us to speculate about other sources of gas for the Southern Corridor, we believe it will provide attractive opportunities for other sources in the future. This belief is based on the concept of the project that will be designed to allow all the sections of the pipeline to be scalable. We expect this ability of the Southern Corridor to bring new sources of supply to European markets will extend as additional supplies become available. When I say new sources I definitely mean additional supplies that can be anticipated with several gas opportunities in Azerbaijan including Shah Deniz Deep, Shafag-Asiman, and Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) Deep that are being evaluated by BP and its co-venturers.</p><h4>According to the FID, the Shah Deniz PSA was also extended until 2048. What prompted this decision and what how will it influence BP's operations in the country?</h4><p>These are two separate decisions. The PSA extension decision is based on Azerbaijan's and the Shah Deniz partnership's confidence that this giant filed has a great potential. In 2007, we discovered further major new gas-condensate resources in the Shah Deniz field.</p><p>At that time, one of our appraisal wells encountered a new high-pressure reservoir in a deeper structure below the currently producing reservoir. It represented a potentially significant find and was a tremendous success for the Shah Deniz partnership and for Azerbaijan. There will be further appraisals to add to our understanding of the new structure and the entire field. In addition, such a deep, high-pressure reservoir will require new technologies that are presently under development in the industry. Thus, there are very excellent opportunities for the future of Shah Deniz, and we are confident the field will continue to bring benefits to Azerbaijan and other regional and European countries for many decades to come.</p><h4>President Ilham Aliyev began his third term in office in October 2013. What changes do you expect the new mandate to bring for the energy sector and the economy overall?</h4><p>The country's oil and gas projects including those operated by BP are key to the national economic growth and President Ilham Aliyev has always shown personal interest in these developments. His extensive political leadership experience combined with his deep knowledge of our projects and industry in general has been crucial to ensuring the success of Azerbaijan's long-term oil and gas strategy and vision.</p><p>President Aliyev has always provided active support to our projects and we will continue to seek his guidance with regard to our future plans for the joint development of the country's world-class oil and gas resources. We hope this support will continue as we work together with SOCAR to link Azerbaijan with Europe directly for the first time in the country's history. We believe the realization of the plans to deliver Shah Deniz gas to Europe is fully in line with the government's policy of utilizing the country's resources for both economic growth and further enhancement of Azerbaijan's role as a reliable energy supplier and a significant player on the international stage.</p><h4>What do you anticipate to be the highlights of 2014 for the oil and gas sector in Azerbaijan and for BP in particular?</h4><p>I believe the highlights of 2014 will be the progress of the Shah Deniz Stage 2 and South Caucasus Pipeline expansion projects that will boost visible wide scale construction activities at all sites and fabrication yards of the country including the Sangachal Terminal, ATA yard near Baku, Baku Deepwater Jackets Factory, and along the pipeline route. The project is now progressing at pace. We have already awarded most of the major engineering, construction, and supply contracts. Early works have already started in most areas. At some yards we have even started main works. In particular, at the ATA yard, we have already commenced fabrication of the platform decks. I am pleased to say that this happened three months ahead of schedule. We will continue contract awards throughout the year as part of the overall progress being made across multiple areas of this major development project.</p><p>In addition, 2014 marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the ACG production sharing agreement, and the year started with a major milestone achieved by ACG—the start-up of oil production from the West Chirag platform. This platform is the eighth world-class offshore platform that we have started up and operate in a safe and efficient manner in the ACG field. It represents a big step forward towards stabilizing ACG's production and increasing recovery. We will continue to focus on production as part of our primary commitment to delivering our operations safely and reliably in the Caspian.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the signing of the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID) in December 2013 mean for Total?<br></h4><p>It means, first of all, that the full development of Shah Deniz as a resource of condensed gas for the future has been made possible. This is a highly complicated project because it encompasses technology-intensive equipment, including sub-sea developments that have to take place in the Caspian Sea. Similar projects have been carried out in other parts of the world, but this is a first for the Caspian Sea. It also encompasses infrastructure developments in order to transport the gas to customers in Turkey and further into Europe. For Europe, there are two main pipeline projects, namely the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). This all means that the logistical challenges to turning Shah Deniz II into a profitable project have been overcome. Furthermore, the infrastructure that will be built for this project will be used for future projects, which is important for the development of the energy sector post-Shah Deniz II. The same will hold true for the network of service providers that will develop around this project, who will acquire know-how to be channeled into future projects. Therefore, this is a foundation stone for the future and will have a meaningful impact on the country and the private companies that will work on the project.</p><h4>What does the project entail for Total specifically?</h4><p>There will be 26 wells drilled at the field. Then, there are two platforms, gas and condensate lines, and an extension of the Sangachal Terminal to be built. From a pure upstream point of view, it is a large-scale project. After that there will be some de-bottlenecking to do, which means laying more pipes and developing sections of the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Subsequently, the TAP and the TANAP, the construction of which will start from scratch, will have to be built from the border of Turkey and Georgia to several kilometers inland in Italy. We currently hold a 10% equity stake in Shah Deniz and SCP, a 10% share in TAP, and a 5% share in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. For Total, it will, therefore, be a significant investment over the years to come. The BTC is not yet running at full capacity, so the condensate from the Shah Deniz II field could contribute to increasing the capacity utilization. For Total, as an operator, the Absheron block is a new element in which our future development could be shaped. Shah Deniz, to some extent, paves the way for Absheron as a future resource. However, our project is not yet mature enough for an FID.</p><h4>Azerbaijan is already a transit point for oil from other CIS countries to Europe. To what extent can it become a similar transit point for gas?</h4><p>Our presence in the BTC pipeline is, in a way, linked to this concept of using Azerbaijan as a hub to access international markets. We did consider the possibility of exporting oil from our fields in Kazakhstan through the BTC. I do not foresee major challenges in setting up gas export infrastructure from Central Asia to Europe through Azerbaijan. However, the main constraint before making a significant investment in infrastructure is how to make the exports economically feasible given the great distance and the different gas infrastructure it would have to pass through in order to reach the European market. If every operator along the chain of distribution were to capture too much value, the initiative would no longer make economic sense, which would kill the project. Therefore, even if Azerbaijan becomes a transit point for gas from the CIS to Europe, it would have to not retain too much value to allow enough netback to upstream operators.</p><h4>What role do you anticipate emerging markets playing in Total's growth?</h4><p>In 2014, we expect some start-ups, and at the same time, we are trying to tame our investment. We still have to turn our previous discoveries into production and to make some new discoveries through our exploration strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pit-stop]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, AzPetrol continued expanding its network of fuel stations. What is the potential for further expansion in 2014?<br></h4><p>AzPetrol commenced activity by opening its own fuel station on Tbilisi Avenue in Baku on July 15, 1997. Over the subsequent years, the company rapidly expanded its activity, and today is engaged in the retailing and wholesaling of petrol, diesel, and gas fuels to individuals and legal entities across most of the republic. Among the 81 currently operational fuel stations, 76 sell petrol and diesel fuel, while five sell liquid petroleum gas (LPG). As in previous years, we also plan to open new fuel stations in Baku and in other regions over 2014.</p><h4>What is AzPetrol's contribution to the training and professional development of its own personnel as one of the nation's largest employers?</h4><p>Bringing new fuel stations into operation in all regions of the country, particularly in rural areas, envisages the establishment of new and permanent workplaces, which is a core consideration in our business activities. The meeting of targets is difficult without first establishing a high-quality and disciplined workforce. We may confidently say that the company has succeeded in achieving this. It has been possible by means of a strict recruitment process followed by the provision of thorough training to improve the quality of our personnel. Thus, employee-candidates attend our Training Center to gain theoretical knowledge in compliance with their job descriptions, while simultaneously participating directly in production. At the end of the courses, the examining board assesses the theoretical and practical knowledge of these candidates, with those successfully passing the exam being recruited.</p><h4>AzPetrol cooperates with various international companies and organizations including the US-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce. What does AzPetrol gain from this exchange?</h4><p>Certainly, a company striving for perfection and advancement needs to pay attention not only to its own international activity, but also to broader international relations and cooperation. From this point of view, our company has increased the establishment of bilateral and multilateral relations with international organizations and foreign companies, and nurtures existing contacts. Besides the inherent mutual economic benefits, such relations have great significance in terms of the advanced exchange of practical knowledge and promotion of business achievement. In my opinion, AzPetrol, in claiming a certain share of Azerbaijan's unique economic success of recent years, is also representative of foreign commercial entities that champion free market transparency.</p><h4>What are your expectations regarding the impact of increased oil exports in the Caspian region on the price of crude in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Currently, the effects of the global economic crisis are felt worldwide. The global economy is exposed to a slump and employment has been negatively impacted. However, largely thanks to the successful economic policy implemented by President Ilham Aliyev, the negative impact of the economic crisis on the economy of Azerbaijan was negligible. In fact, GDP registered a rise, and would have performed better still but for the prevailing fallout from the crisis. AzPetrol also largely escaped the economic crisis. It fully mobilized its potential and avoided a decrease in workforce, actually increasing its head count by opening new fuel stations. This performance was also observed among other advanced companies of Azerbaijan, and, consequently, in my opinion, the rise in oil exports in Iran will not negatively impact the local market, or economic relations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Azerbaijan's energy sector over 2014?</h4><p>The main tasks of AzPetrol are to actively build on its current commercial position, and continue its contribution to the development of the private sector. We intend to extend our sphere of activity, fully covering our regions, generating employment, increasing the versatility of the sectors we operate in, and delivering comprehensive information on our corporate activity. A company clearly cannot develop without a workforce that is dedicated, and possessed of intellectual fortitude and a professional attitude.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide an overview of Baku Shipyard's operations since its inauguration in September 2013?</h4><p>The Baku Shipyard is a national project in which the participating partners are SOCAR, the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC), and Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine. Primarily, Baku Shipyard will focus on shipbuilding for clients operating in the Caspian Sea. The nationalization of Azerbaijan's maritime industry is a key government focus, which is why the shipyard was built to a scale capable of accommodating all the shipbuilding and ship repair requirements of the Caspian. The shipyard will provide jobs for Azerbaijani nationals as well as excellent growth potential for the maritime industry, and also act as a spin-off to related industries. It will help attract international support from vendors and contractors to deepen the know-how of ship building activities in Baku. The development in the Caspian Sea is expected to be vibrant and operators are getting ready to meet additional demands. Baku Shipyard is designed to provide a good turnaround time for ship repairs, and is capable of building large tankers that provide economical solutions for clients. There have also been discussions on the possibility of transporting oil from Kazakhstan to Baku via the existing pipeline to the international market. Such a venture would require the chartering of tankers with a good turnaround time. This has led to the concept of the Caspianmax Tanker, similar to Panamax tankers. Ranging from 230 to 250 meters in length, they can transport between 60,000 and 70,000 dwt of oil. The shipyard is equipped with state-of-the-art technological facilities, readily capable of building such tankers. This is why Baku Shipyard has a capacity of 25,000 tons of steel per year, with a provision for expansion.</p><h4>What projects is the Shipyard working on?</h4><p>When we were engaged in yard development, we also had the opportunity to undertake shipbuilding projects. The first was our own floating dock that we constructed together with our associates, Caspian Shipyard Company. We completed the project successfully with our own newly employed manpower, contractors, and some makeshift facilities. Similarly, we built the first project, a 50T BP ASD Tug for our client, SOCAR Shipping. It turned out to be an excellent pilot project, which allowed us to better understand the actual processes and issues that we need to overcome here in Azerbaijan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Minister of Transport, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa, transport infrastructure investment has doubled between 2010 and 2012. What has been the level of investment in airports since 2013?</h4><p>We are looking to develop connectivity through different modes of transport. The policy of this government is to improve all of the existing transport options, from air connections to roads. The government's allocation of $1.3 billion from the national budget to make the Magdalena River navigable indicates that investment is going not only to airports, but also to highways, as well as to the construction of railways, seaports, free trade zones, and airports. All of this is being done to achieve comprehensive connectivity across the country, and therefore cater to the commercial program that the government has outlined for the near future.</p><h4>The National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) has been working on the creation of a new terminal at a cost of $183 million. Can you expand on this endeavor?</h4><p>Firstly, it analyzed the current status of this airport and looked at which long-term requirements would be needed to meet international standards. It invited government officials, entrepreneurs, and business groups here to make a needs list, and after that was able to identify five specific areas that needed to be developed. It identified passenger, cargo, fixed-base operator (FBO), maintenance repair operator (MRO), and training as the key areas. On top of that, we would then need to learn how to commercialize each and understand that being a hub would not be a business for the city itself; a hub means business for the airport and not for the city because 95% of the people that are moving through are in transit to other destinations. Those people have a connecting flight, which means they spend 30 minutes to an hour in the airport and then head off without spending any money in the city. We can convince companies to come here because of our privileged position as a point of connection between South America and the rest of the world. We are at sea level and have a 3,000-meter concrete runway and, therefore, all of the advantages necessary to establish a hub. However, before we can do this, we must establish sufficient security measures to ensure the safety of travelers.</p><div class="quote">“There are five modes of transport, namely sea, river, rail, land, and air, and the latter is the most expensive."</div><h4>What is your vision for Barranquilla's capacity for logistics centers?</h4><p>There are five modes of transport, namely sea, river, rail, land, and air, and the latter is the most expensive. Passenger flights are generally purchased as round trips, while in cargo there are individual one-way trips that must be organized for each aircraft. Essentially, it boils down to the fact that air is the most expensive way to transit cargo or passengers. It is important to be aware of the subsectors of cargo being transported, too. For example, perishable goods need to be moved efficiently and quickly. In Colombia, the transport of refrigerated fresh flowers, as well as tropical fruit, is a major area of business. In addition, urgent items delivered through companies such as DHL or UPS are also crucial, particularly for items such as newspapers and magazines and other items for next-day delivery. There is also the luxury category, which requires items to be moved with minimal risk of damage during transit. The last category includes any item that is not easily transported by other modes, or that simply take too long to send another way. We use this criterion to find logistical methods and solutions to get cargo out. One such idea is to establish an agricultural showroom at the airport and then to shape policies that will incentivize the goods that farmers cultivate. I believe that Colombia, Barranquilla, and this airport can become the breadbasket for all of the Caribbean islands. That is the way forward, and it is also the reason we need to establish both an agricultural and logistics center here, in order to both produce and, ultimately, deliver.</p><h4>What is the ambition of this airport following the FTAs and the strengthening of the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>The airport is not solely responsible for attracting more airlines or passengers to Barranquilla. My point of view is that the city has to have the attractions and incentives that encourage people to come here. We have to invite people by offering an integral tourism proposal and enacting policies that foster its development. The city has to develop something alternative in terms of the resorts on offer. We have to provide something different through cultural tourism and sports tourism, and with exciting formats. The construction of the new Centro de Eventos del Caribe Puerta de Oro, the new museums, as well as work on the Magdalena River and the deep-sea port are all aimed at boosting tourism and creating incentives; it is not the airport that determines all of these, and we have to ensure that all of this is part of a greater initiative. We should also work with Mexico and try to establish a hub here for cargo and passengers. We have to work in partnership with the north to get this done, something which is essential to the overall success of the initiative. We have to work with the city's mayors, the governor, the Ministry of Agriculture, and other organizations. We have to work together cohesively to achieve this wider goal.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[two-pearls]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the key measures that Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic have taken to strengthen bilateral ties in fields such as maritime and air transportation?</h4><p>Both our countries have enjoyed continued collaboration and cooperation over the past few years. For example, President Medina attended my official inauguration. The ties between our nations are historical, and have transformed over time. During the first half of the 20th century, many Puerto Rican people moved to the Dominican Republic seeking employment. This trend was reversed in the second half of the century due to the evolution and progress of our economy. We have also set up joint industrial projects; production plants in the Dominican Republic receiving goods and products that are initially manufactured in our country. Currently, President Medina and I have decided to explore opportunities for both countries and create new synergies to further strengthen our economies in the international arena. Puerto Rico has strong air transport connections with the US, whereas the Dominican Republic enjoys more consolidated air connections with South America. This is something we can both benefit from. Air Europa recently launched a two-flight per week route connecting San Jose with Spain, and we aim to have an extra daily flight connecting us with the Dominican Republic to create even better connections with Europe. On top of that, Lufthansa is set to open a maintenance and repair center for the region in our country. This center will be open to other carriers too, and we are 100% convinced that this will help to create additional synergies between both countries.</p><h4>What is behind Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic's plan to purchase oil together?</h4><p>There have been talks already, but we have agreed on nothing thus far; Puerto Rico has more economic energy costs than the Dominican Republic. The idea would be to make joint purchases of oil, so we can have a stronger position when negotiating. Talks have also addressed the construction of an underwater energy cable to better exchange energy that has already been produced.</p><div class="quote">“Agriculture and textile manufacturing have been two traditionally strong sectors in Puerto Rico."</div><h4>What other sectors offer the greatest potential to boost bilateral cooperation?</h4><p>Agriculture is one of the main sectors offering bright future prospects to boost commercial ties. Both countries understand this, and have in the past few months taken steps in this field. We are actively increasing the area of farmed land, and value Dominican expertise in several areas. For example, we have started cultivating rice—in 18 months we have gone from 0 acres to more than 600 acres under cultivation. We have also increased sugar cane crops, and plan to reach 20,000 acres in the next few years having started from scratch almost two years ago.</p><h4>Apart from the pharmaceutical industry, what are some of the other strategic sectors your government aims to further develop?</h4><p>We are in the process of diversifying our economy. Agriculture and textile manufacturing have been two traditionally strong sectors in Puerto Rico and we believe we need to revive them. Chemical products and medical devices are two segments with the potential to boost the diversification of our economy. Today, 48% of our economy depends on manufacturing activities and we know that we must diversify this for greater economic success. In this context, we have taken positive steps within the aerospace industry, as exemplified by the example of Lufthansa. These efforts have also enabled us to attract software production activity related to this industry. The main multinationals in this sphere are present in Puerto Rico, which is significant. They create many job opportunities for our people, and fortunately, we have seen a shift toward research and development in our economic activity as a country. Innovation is playing an important role today. The impact of tourism activity in our economy is considerably rising, and the number of tourists is increasing with each passing month. We attract many cruise companies into the country, while over 1,000 additional beds will shortly be included in Puerto Rico's touristic offering. Meanwhile, in terms of security we have reduced crime rates by over 20% since I began my tenure as Governor.</p><h4>What have been your landmark achievements since you took over as Governor of Puerto Rico?</h4><p>Puerto Rico is set to pass its first balanced budget in 22 years, which will enable us to allocate more resources to generate employment opportunities. We are also diversifying our industrial base. We need to transform our agricultural sector to make it more efficient, and also renovate our tourism sector. These elements will enable us to become a more competitive economy in the region and the world.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of investing in Puerto Rico?</h4><p>I would sum it up in one statement; all the main multinational pharmaceutical companies have a presence in Puerto Rico, and they are all continuously expanding their activity. The same is true for software developers such as HP, IBM, and Microsoft, and many others that are already operating successfully here. Many airlines and tourism companies have already returned to the country in recent years. Avianca has increased its routes from Puerto Rico from three a week to five, and will soon have daily flights, too.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi Sewerage Services Company (ADSSC) increased from a 12% Emiratization rate in 2006 to 72% in 2012. How do you manage to attract and keep Emiratis on your staff?</h4><p>We work closely with other stakeholders in terms of Emiratization. We have a large number of graduates coming into the business, and we try and provide them with the best training possible. Some of them go on to work closely with contractors, meaning that they learn about how the private sector operates as well as how a government business works. We are able to retain them because they enjoy the work, the atmosphere, and the positive aspect of learning and contributing to Abu Dhabi's society. We have been successful in this regard.</p><h4>What ongoing projects do you have to prepare for the upcoming population increase?</h4><p>ADSSC has recently completed four large treatment plants for Abu Dhabi and Al Ain to cater for the increased volumes there. We also have a sewer tunnel project, the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP), which will treble the current capacity of wastewater flows and prepare Abu Dhabi for the next few decades. We are putting in a system that will replace 35 pumping stations with one. It will use gravity to move the wastewater from the city out to our treatment plants, which are located on the mainland. We are constantly looking at providing for the future. To build sewage infrastructure takes several years. You have to plan it well in advance, because as more people come into the area, you have to think about how you plan downstream. New development impacts on the downstream development, meaning you have to allow for downstream flows when you examine upstream development.</p><div class="quote">“We want to promote ourselves as an environmentally friendly, sustainable business."</div><h4>What are the main achievements that you have accomplished in the STEP?</h4><p>STEP has been extremely successful, and has brought attention to what we do. We use it as a stepping-stone to promote good environmental practice and broaden what we do in Abu Dhabi in terms of keeping the country running, helping to make a clean environment, and making sure people are healthy. The STEP visitor center has been a fantastic central focus, because not only do we cover what is happening in STEP, but we cover some of the broader environmental aspects of our work as well. We have had visitors from Japanese and German schools and universities, as well as many local dignitaries.</p><h4>What is the current status of your project to rehabilitate the pipeline network?</h4><p>The rehabilitation process is addressing the structural condition of the network. Some of our pipes were laid in the 1970s, and the material used back then was thin and weak. Quality control in the past was not as good as it is now. The rehabilitation process effectively puts in a new pipe without having to dig the ground up as much as you otherwise would. Therefore, we clean the pipe, and depending on its condition, we will either replace it or reline it. This brings back the full capacity to the pipe, which could have been compromised due to the ingress of water or the settling of solids. The ongoing rehabilitation program is addressing all of these issues in the older part of the city where the pipes are older, and as such not performing as well as they should.</p><h4>What are the keys aspects that will allow you to accomplish your vision of becoming the world leader in the provision of sewerage services by 2020?</h4><p>Investment in our infrastructure will deliver excellent sewage treatment and collection facilities. Equally, we treat the water to a degree that it can be used for irrigation. We recycle the water and it can be used to irrigate the parks, golf courses, and other green areas in the city. By doing that, we hope to be the first city of this size with 100% of our water re-used. On top of that, we want to give excellent customer service and value for money. The investment in infrastructure will allow us to run at high efficiency and also deliver a service that Abu Dhabi and its visitors will enjoy.</p><h4>How do you ensure that wastewater from hospitals, industry, and commercial activities does not harm your treatment facilities or those who carry out maintenance?</h4><p>If we get harmful chemicals coming into our system, it can affect our treatment process, which is biological, meaning it is a very natural process. We use bacteria that are naturally found in the environment and the water to effectively treat the wastewater. By doing that, we end up with high-quality water. Hence, when we are finished, the water that comes out is very clean. In order to stop the discharge of harmful chemicals or detergents that would impact on the biological reaction process, we have a regulation called trade effluent control, which effectively gives us the power to consent discharges into the sewer. If a factory was discharging harmful substances into the sewer, we have the right under the regulations to ask the factory to pre-treat its water before it comes into the wastewater system. We have effective controls that were introduced into the region in 2010 that enable us to talk with industry and ensure there are no harmful chemicals are coming into the system. We have inspectors who will knock on doors and discuss the issues with factories. We are fortunate that industries with harmful byproducts are rare in Abu Dhabi. Most of our wastewater is of domestic origin, as opposed to industrial. Nevertheless, we don't want any risk to the treatment process.</p><h4>What kind of partnerships are you looking for?</h4><p>We are looking for partnerships where we are all working together as opposed to against each other. We obviously entered into contracts with consultants and contractors to deliver services. We expect high-quality service, but we also look for long-term relationships where we work in harmony with these contractors and consultants. As time goes on, they understand our business better so they can produce a better service for us. A good example is our four operating contracts. When we awarded these contracts, they were awarded for seven-year periods. STEP represents another good example of how we run a long-term project. Our program managers are from US consultancy CH2M Hill, and we have been working in partnership with them since 2008 when we first embarked on STEP—and they will be here until 2016, when we finish. Our working relationship is such that they are in this office, working with our people. This goes back to retaining Emiratis. By working closely with the private sector, we can get people trained to the highest of standards, which helps retain the staff as well.</p><h4>How do you want to promote yourself within the community?</h4><p>We want to promote ourselves as an environmentally friendly, sustainable business. In order to achieve our goal of being a world-class provider of services, we need to have that recognition. Only through branding and interaction with our government and citizens will we gain that recognition. Typically, a utility business (power, water, or sewage) is not recognized by people until something goes wrong. When it goes wrong, it is a big problem. Fortunately, it doesn't go wrong very often. To a certain degree, we enjoy being anonymous because we can just get on with our work; however, we do want people to understand what this service is about, and that it does cost money. If you didn't have water and sanitation, everyone's health would suffer. Therefore, it is an important service, and one that people should not take for granted. People should recognize that it is expensive to run a sewage or water business, especially in the desert. People should value and respect it, not waste it.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Your Excellency won a third sweeping victory at the polls last October. What will be the priorities of your third term in office?<br></h4><p>The presidential election of 2013 was an important event in the public and political life of Azerbaijan. It demonstrated the attitude of our society toward the political course we have pursued over the past 10 years. Over the course of the decade we followed the path of national leader Heydar Aliyev and succeeded in meeting the goals we had set for our state and society. In terms of its economic performance, Azerbaijan has become a world leader, which has made our country even stronger. As a result of the goal-oriented activities carried out on the basis of thought-out programs, our GDP has increased 3.4 times, the non-oil sector of the economy 2.6 times, and budget revenues 16 times, while the volume of strategic exchange reserves now exceeds $50 billion. Over $170 billion has been invested in the national economy.</p><p>Such rapid development has also led to the improved well-being of our citizens. Over the last 10 years theincomes of our population have increased 6.5 times and the average salary 5.5 times. I think that the decline of poverty from 49% to 5.3% and the reduction of unemployment by half to 5% can be viewed as important achievements of the country. The last 10 years have seen extensive construction in the country, our cities, settlements, and villages have significantly improved, and modern standards and advanced technologies are being applied to all our cities.</p><p>Azerbaijan's achievements are well received by leading international organizations and prestigious rating agencies. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014 of the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan is ranked in 39th place in the world.</p><div class="quote">“  In the last 10 years, a portion of the revenues obtained from oil and gas production has been specifically, and under special programs, channeled into the development of the non-oil sector, the establishment of new high-tech industrial facilities, and the diversification of the national economy. "</div><p>Over the years our standing in the world has strengthened further. Azerbaijan has earned itself a good reputation in the international relations arena and is treated with respect. The numerous international events held in Azerbaijan are evidence of the fact that our country is already seen as a political, economic, and cultural center in the region.</p><p>Against the backdrop of growing trends of tension, unemployment, and poverty in the world, Azerbaijan is registering processes of a completely opposite nature—rapid development, progress, growing well-being of the population, public and political stability, national solidarity, and more. I think these have been the key contributors to the outcomes of the 2013 presidential election. The PACE, the European Parliament, the OSCE PA, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the CIS, and other authoritative organizations have made unequivocally high assessments of the election and described it as free, fair, and transparent. And this confirms yet again that our people and the international community see the election and its results in the same way. By their votes the people of Azerbaijan expressed support for the policies pursued to this day and have given us the mandate for a continuation of these activities.</p><p>Our plans are also ambitious. There are important issues on our agenda. Activities on further enhancing Azerbaijan's potential, expanding the competitiveness of the economy, building a modern society, improving the well-being of our population, reinforcing our international standing in accordance with our foreign policy priorities, stepping up the systemic fight against corruption, bribery, and other negative phenomena, and strengthening civil society will be continued in a consistent manner.</p><h4><br>Azerbaijan made great strides in ICT over 2013, the Year of ICT. Looking ahead, what role will technology play in Azerbaijan's development?</h4><p>The advantage of the economic policy pursued in Azerbaijan is the fact that all activities are carried out on the basis of the country's real potential, best international practices, and specific programs. Experience shows that the application of state-of-the-art technologies is one of the key preconditions of a competitive economy. For this reason, innovation is extensively used not only in the economy, but also in all other areas. The sector of information and communication technologies is developing very rapidly and has a great future. The adoption of the National ICT Strategy in 2003 and the subsequent adoption and implementation of the state program on electronic governance gave a major impetus to the development of this sector. In the years of independence more than $3 billion was invested in ICT development in Azerbaijan. As a result, the sector has expanded 8.2 times over the past decade. The launch in 2013 of Azerbaijan's first telecommunications satellite into orbit and the establishment of a space industry has been a historic event. Work is currently underway to launch two further satellites into space in the years ahead.</p><p>The internet has also developed very rapidly in recent years. According to a report of the International Telecommunication Union, up to 70% of Azerbaijan's population uses the internet. We have started building broadband internet channels to all cities of Azerbaijan.</p><p>I want to draw your attention to another fact. We don't just apply the innovations existing in the world but also try to initiate some innovations ourselves. I would like to emphasize what can be described as Azerbaijan's own brand, the State Agency for Public Services and Social Innovations, and its “ASAN Xidmet," or Easy Service centers. The scope of “ASAN Xidmet" services include the coordination of services provided by public agencies, oversight and evaluation, mutual integration of government databases, the effective provision of electronic services, and the modernization of management systems. This service is an example of a progressive government-citizen relationship. The centers currently provide a total of 25 legal services. It is no coincidence that over a million people have applied to the service in a matter of one year. Therefore, we intend to further expand the scope of services provided by “ASAN Xidmet."</p><p>As far as the role of advanced technologies in the future development of Azerbaijan is concerned, I can note that in order to facilitate the further dynamic development of the economy and increase its competitiveness, specific measures are taken to expand the ICT spheres based on advanced science and technology achievements, attract both domestic and foreign investment to this sector, create a database of qualified professionals, and more. To fulfill these goals, we have set up a High-Tech Park, established the Information Technology Development Fund, and the Information Technology University. The creation of a strong economy based on innovation is one of our primary objectives and we are consistently moving in this direction.</p><h4>You declared 2014 as the Year of Industry. What activities are to be carried out in this direction this year?</h4><p>Azerbaijan used to be considered an agricultural republic before. In the 1970-1980s, steps were taken to develop industry, and hundreds of new industrial enterprises were established to produce goods for partner republics. However, the collapse of the USSR led to a cessation of ties between the former Soviet republics. In general, the planned economy suffered a fiasco. At the same time, the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan, the anarchy dominating the country at the time, and the physical and moral obsolescence of the old enterprises led to a gradual economic decline and a disruption of the manufacturing process. Only thanks to the efforts of National Leader Heydar Aliyev was it possible to restore production in the early 2000s to the level of the 1990s.</p><p>Over the last 10 years, a portion of the revenues obtained from oil and gas production has been specifically, and under special programs, channeled into the development of the non-oil sector, the establishment of new high-tech industrial facilities, and the diversification of the national economy. As a result, the non-oil sector has been registering an annual growth rate of 10% each year. In addition, the comprehensive support for private enterprise, the implementation of major investment programs, the establishment and reconstruction of the socioeconomic infrastructure, and the construction of competitive enterprises based on cutting-edge technologies have increased the volume of industrial production 2.7 times.</p><p>One of the goals on our agenda today is to take advantage of the available potential to transform Azerbaijan into a powerful industrialized state. Certain work has already been done in the area of industrial diversification and modernization. We are engaging the existing natural and economic resources, creating new industrial estates and technology parks, and speeding up the process of innovation. For this reason, 2014 has been declared the Year of Industry. A general plan of activities to be carried out this year has been prepared and approved. At the same time, there are plans to prepare and adopt the “State program on industrial development covering 2015-2020." We believe that the experience we have accumulated and the overall economic potential of Azerbaijan will allow us the opportunity to meet these objectives.</p><h4>The third state program on the socioeconomic development of districts covering the 2014-2018 period was adopted in 2013. What have the first two programs achieved and what are the expectations from the third program?</h4><p>When we adopted the first state program in 2004, our goal was to ensure the all-round development of the regions and eliminate the gap in the level of development between the capital and the rest of the country. I said even ahead of the 2003 election that if I was shown the confidence of the people, I would first of all tackle the development of the regions, and that a special program would be adopted to this end. And so it happened. The adoption of two state programs covering the 2003-2008 and 2009-2013 periods, the signing and implementation of around 250 resolutions, in addition to the two programs, created a watershed in the regions and changed the socioeconomic landscape of our districts beyond recognition. As a result, the quality of public services and social infrastructure in the regions has substantially improved, the business environment has become  more favorable, investment has increased, thousands of new enterprises have been commissioned, and more than 1.2 million jobs have been created, including 900,000 permanent ones. Over the last 10 years, the production of goods in the districts has increased 3.2 times and industrial production 3.1 times. All Azerbaijani districts and residential settlements have been landscaped and modernized. I can say with full confidence that this program has contributed a great deal to the development of the country's regions and, in general, to Azerbaijan's economic potential.</p><p>The strategic goal on our agenda is to further strengthen Azerbaijan's independence and make it one of the most developed and competitive countries of the world in all respects. Therefore, taking into consideration the challenges of the contemporary world, the work on the dynamic development of the regions will be continued. I believe that the implementation of the newly approved “State program on the socioeconomic development of districts of the Republic of Azerbaijan covering 2014-2018" will facilitate the sustainable development of the non-oil sector, further improve public services and social infrastructure as a whole, and elevate the country to the ranks of leading nations of the world.</p><h4>As far as foreign policy is concerned, Azerbaijan has seen important achievements in recent years. The country's activities in the UN Security Council and the determination and implementation of new foreign policy priorities are among them. What will be the main directions of foreign policy in the years ahead?</h4><p>The comprehensive development of Azerbaijan, the strengthening of its economic potential, and an active foreign policy have enabled the country to strengthen its international reputation, facilitate its close integration into the international world, and improve its relations with different countries in both bilateral and multilateral formats. Today, Azerbaijan is considered to be a country that is pursuing an independent policy, possessing its own view on global political developments and the system of international relations, and enjoying great international respect. Our election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2011 in competition with other countries was not only an historic achievement and a tremendous foreign political success, but also an indicator of the great respect we enjoy in the world. As is evident, the world supports the position of our state and approves the steps we are taking. Azerbaijan acts with dignity in all international organizations and puts its national interests above everything else. In the two years of membership in the UN Security Council, especially at the times of its presidency of the organization, Azerbaijan has made its contribution to global security, the establishment of peace in the world, and the development of a dialogue between cultures and civilizations.</p><p>Azerbaijan has also initiated a number of transnational and regional projects. The energy policy pursued by our country represents significant importance not only to us, but also to the region and the world. As you may be aware, the final investment decision on the Shah Deniz II project to produce and deliver the ample gas reserves from the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian to world markets was signed in Baku on December 17, 2013. I believe that the Shah Deniz II project will contribute to the redrawing of the world's energy map and go down in history as the Contract of the 21st Century.</p><p>Azerbaijan has become a political, economic, and humanitarian center in the South Caucasus. Baku has traditionally played host to numerous international events. In 2013, the international conference on support for Palestine within the OIC, the Third Humanitarian Forum, the Second Forum on Dialogue between Cultures, the Davos World Economic Forum, and a number of other high-profile international events were held in Baku.</p><p>Our bilateral and multilateral relations with the world's leading international organizations and countries have also developed. Azerbaijan continued its effective operation within the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the OIC, and other authoritative international organizations. Last year, we signed an important agreement with the EU on simplifying visa regulations. This is an indicator of our relations with the EU. I am confident that we will succeed in creating a format of strategic partnership with the EU to further expand our cooperation.</p><p>In addition to developing our relations with regional countries and leading states of the world on the basis of mutual trust, we are also reaching out to non-traditional partners. In parallel to expanding our relations of cooperation with the traditional countries of Europe and Asia, we also seek to establish political, economic, and humanitarian cooperation with countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, Latin America, and Africa. We have identified this as another foreign political priority. It is no coincidence that a number of Latin American countries have recently expressed their support for Azerbaijan's fair cause in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. A total of 10 countries have already recognized the massacre perpetrated by the Armenian armed forces in the Azerbaijani town of Khojaly in 1992 as an act of genocide. The parliaments of these countries have passed relevant decisions to this effect.</p><p>In the coming years we intend to further strengthen the political and economic potential of our country, enhance our international reputation, and expand our cooperation with international organizations and countries. Our foreign policy is underpinned by the protection of national interests, and all the necessary steps will continue to be taken in this direction.</p><p>I regret to say that there is no progress in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is our top foreign political priority. The Armenian side continues to use different pretexts to delay the process of negotiations and tries to maintain the status quo. There was some revitalization in the talks at the end of last year, which gives us grounds to expect some progress in the settlement of the issue in 2014. The Armenian leadership must understand that Azerbaijan will never tolerate the establishment of a second Armenian state on its soil. The conflict should and will be resolved on the basis of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. As long as the conflict remains unresolved, the Armenian state will remain sidelined from all transnational and regional projects, the plight of the Armenian people will continue, and the already frugal potential of the country will be completely exhausted.</p><h4>How are the preparations for the much-anticipated European Games advancing?</h4><p>We have entered into a crucial year in the preparation for the inaugural European Games. As is known, preparations for a competition of such proportions usually take seven to eight years. We have had only two and a half years to stage the European Summer Games. I am sure that we will succeed in meeting all our objectives in this respect. The Organizing Committee is already in place and is working very hard on the project. The construction of most of the sport facilities that will host the Games is scheduled for completion this year. The Olympic stadium, the gymnastics center, the aquatic palace, and the trap shooting complex are now under construction. The Heydar Aliyev Sports Center and the Hand Games Palace are being refurbished and other sports facilities are being set up. However, preparations for the Games are not limited to the construction of various facilities. Issues relating to security and transportation, the establishment of an Olympic village, accommodation for visitors and athletes, the organization of training camps, and other issues require a great deal of attention and effort. If we take into consideration the potential already available in Azerbaijan, the presence of sophisticated sports infrastructure and our extensive experience in hosting prestigious international competitions, I have no doubt whatsoever that we will conduct the Games at a high level. In fact, I believe that the standards applied to the Games in Azerbaijan will lay the foundation for all future European Games.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back on 2013, what were the highlights for the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan Republic (SOFAZ)?</h4><p>As of 2012, SOFAZ began investing in new asset classes such as equities, real estate, and gold, as well as diversifying its currency portfolio toward the Turkish lira, Russian ruble, and Australian dollar. This portfolio diversification was enabled by new investment guidelines approved by Presidential Decree. Overall, 2013 saw a continuation of this expansion and gave us solid experience in terms of the new asset classes and the approach to the implementation of the new investment strategy. The process of increasing exposure to a specific asset class requires a well-organized and detailed due diligence of the considered asset classes, as well as thorough analysis of increased exposure to risk and return measures. Accordingly, SOFAZ made a major investment of $500 million in VTB Group, a leading banking group in Russia. Furthermore, SOFAZ has also been carrying out its monitoring on the MSCI World Index, a public equities index in which SOFAZ has previously invested. These initiatives constitute a solid base to meet our target equity allocation of 10% in the years to come. Furthermore, SOFAZ made a fresh commitment to the IFC Global Infrastructure Fund following two previous commitments to the IFC Catalyst and IFC ALAC funds. This move further diversified our private equity portfolio by including infrastructure investments. In 2013, SOFAZ expanded its private equity asset class by conducting research in this market and by identifying major players, resources, and service providers. This will enable us to channel more investments into private equity as the global investment environment improves. As far as real estate is concerned, we analyzed opportunities for investment in East and Southeast Asia, conducted the necessary evaluation of investment prospects in the respective countries, and targeted the Asian market as the most promising destination for real estate investments. In 2013, SOFAZ reached the 30 tons of planned gold purchases that started in 2012.</p><h4>As 2014 is the Year of Industry, is SOFAZ looking to increase the number of its industrial projects and assets?</h4><p>First of all, it must be noted that Azerbaijan's economy has experienced rapid development in the industrial sphere over recent years. Large-scale industrial projects have enabled the restructuring of social and economic life in the country and provided for the creation of basic requirements for continuous development. The construction of the oil, gas, and petrochemical STAR Oil Refinery Complex in Turkey and the construction of a new, semi-submersible drilling rig project are some of the industrial projects that SOFAZ began financing in 2013.</p><h4>Azerbaijan's contribution to energy security in Europe was enhanced late last year by the contract signed by a BP-led consortium to export gas from the Shah Deniz II field to Europe. How will this decision influence SOFAZ's priorities?</h4><p>The Shah Deniz II project serves to expand the South Caucasus Pipeline along the territories of Azerbaijan and Georgia, and will give impetus to the implementation of plans for the construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), while opening up a new gas corridor to Europe. As part of the project, the drilling of 26 subsea wells is planned, as is the construction of two major platforms. The gas, to be transported over a distance of 3,500 kilometers, will supply millions of customers in Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, and other countries. We expect the gas to first be supplied in 2019. As a beneficiary of oil, gas, and transportation agreements, SOFAZ's mission is to transform depleting hydrocarbon reserves into financial assets generating perpetual income for current and future generations, the financing of strategically important infrastructure and social projects on a national scale, and ensuring the representation of the country in international agreements on the joint exploration of natural resources. Financing the TANAP project will meet SOFAZ's objectives to support major projects to support socioeconomic progress and will positively influence SOFAZ's priorities in the energy sector. The implementation of the Shah Deniz II energy project will secure the long-term development of our country. The entire project will involve an investment of $45 billion, and more than 30,000 new jobs will be created in the countries along the route. The Shah Deniz II project is highly significant and will make Azerbaijan's large gas resources available for the European market, which will bring greater benefit to the state and, as a beneficiary of the state, SOFAZ's gas revenues in turn will increase.</p><h4>How important is transparency for SOFAZ?</h4><p>Since the establishment of SOFAZ, our philosophy has held that as the overseers of national wealth we are accountable to the people of Azerbaijan. Accountability begins with transparency, which is why we need to be extremely open to scrutiny. Since the outset, SOFAZ has been audited by internationally renowned companies. We have published every single item of information regarding SOFAZ, including its assets, strategy, and internal procedures. And since 2003, under the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, we have been running the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), an initiative to which SOFAZ has been one of the major contributors. The head of SOFAZ is also the head of the national commission of EITI. We were the first country to publish EITI reports and became fully compliant with EITI requirements in 2009.</p><h4>What is the extent of SOFAZ's international outreach?</h4><p>An international forum of sovereign wealth funds was established in 2009, the inaugural meeting of which was held in Baku. There are around 25 sovereign wealth funds in the world including the funds of Qatar, Norway, Abu Dhabi, Russia, Australia, Peru, and Botswana. This is a highly diverse group that meets regularly, once a year, in a member country to discuss common issues that revolve around three major topics. The forum is organized around the Santiago Principles of how funds should generally be managed. This is always the first area of questions to see discussion. The second group of questions is directly related to business, investments, forecasts, and global economic development. And the third always concerns the investor-recipient country relationship. In that group, we always represent members from the EU and the US and discuss the relationship between the investor and recipient countries. There is broad cooperation between sovereign wealth funds within this framework.</p><h4>What do you think President Aliyev's third term will bring for SOFAZ and for economic growth?</h4><p>In October 2013, the people of Azerbaijan overwhelmingly voted the President in for a third term by a huge margin. This evinced the success of the long-term program of President Aliyev, which has been implemented over the past 10 years. In that decade, the country's GDP has tripled and the population's income growth has been in double-digit territory. The economic policy of President Aliyev has proven to be successful. Its cornerstone is the development of the non-oil sector, and we can see from the numbers that a significant shift in GDP toward the non-oil sector has occurred. Three or four years ago, the non-oil sector was worth about 40% of GDP, while today it is over 60%. That is the most successful achievement of the President's policy. In terms of his relationship with SOFAZ, the President has been supportive in changing our investment strategy as of 2012 in diversifying asset classes; we expect this support to continue. The President is adamant that we should not only support the level of our foreign exchange reserves, but also increase them consistently. Since the establishment of SOFAZ, there has not been a single year when our reserves decreased. Even in 2013, where our budget had forecast a deficit, its execution resulted in a surplus of over $1.7 billion. In short, we expect this strategy to continue, SOFAZ's assets to grow, and the diversification process of our investment policy to be supported.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Velsimex is one of the top six companies in the agrochemical sector, and your competitors are all major global companies. How do you stay competitive in such a market?</h4><p>We started 26 years ago by importing just one technical product; chlordane. I had been working at Velsicol Chemical Corporation, which sold 80% of the company to Sandoz. Velsicol did not sell chlordane to Sandoz, and so we created Velsimex to distribute chlordane. It was a strong product and was used against termites, but as a technical product it faced opposition in the market and was withdrawn because it was highly persistent. As Velsicol was the only manufacturer in the world, we had been turning a good profit from the product and constantly reinvesting our profits to register and import new products, having observed independent companies from China and India. This all enabled us to compete with the multinationals at that time, 26 years ago. Global companies always have new products to launch in the market, which is their major weapon. Our major weapon has been my word, because everyone can sell a commodity, but if you honor your word you are standing by what your company promised.</p><h4>How did your company develop over subsequent years?</h4><p>Approximately 26 years ago, Mexican companies were purchasing many of their products from multinational companies locally, or from a local government company called FertiMex, which manufactured about six insecticides. In the beginning, we were buying the technical product, passing it to another company that formulated it for us, and then marketing the product under our own label. Later on, we purchased our own plant and started to formulate the products ourselves. That was how we managed to compete with the multinationals; we imported technical-grade product, formulated it, and went to the market under our own label. We improved our market share by providing credit and offering conditions that customers welcomed. At the outset we tried to sell close to the price of the multinationals, while offering a much lower price to distributors. When one of our distributors sells a non-multinational product at the same public price, they enjoy the highest margins. My thinking 25 years ago was that if I gave healthy profits to our distributors we would establish a distribution network for the future, which is precisely what happened. Today, Velsimex is the biggest supplier to 60% of our 350 customers, which gives us the opportunity to create long-term relationships.</p><div class="quote">“Global companies always have new products to launch in the market, which is their major weapon."</div><h4>In which ways are you developing these relationships?</h4><p>We are developing a loyalty plan, similar to an airline points systems. It is very sophisticated and took eight to 10 months to establish. We have also split the company up into different parts. Now we have a company that only sells green, or organic, products. For example, Agricola Innovacion sells pyrethrum, which is a plant-based insecticide derived from the Chrysanthemum. Pyrethroids, based on pyrethrum, are a very important line of insecticides in the world now. We are selling it in its natural state, and it has some very specific markets. We also extract neem,which comes from a tree that grows in India. We have another company called Quimix that sells human health products, for example products to control mosquito problems, such as malaria and dengue fever. Quimix was started in 2000 and is now the most important public health company in Mexico as a supplier.</p><h4>Do these companies operate as branches of Velsimex or are they completely separate?</h4><p>They are separate. If we put the sales of Agrí­cola Innovací­on, Quimix, and Velsimex together with the plants, then we are the third or fourth largest company in the market. When we say that we rank sixth we are purely referring to Velsimex.</p><h4>Is Quimix also one of your brands?</h4><p>It is ours and it has been widely innovative, for example in plastic irrigation hoses for carrying treatments against fly problems in garden plants. Or, if you have a summer house, you can program the system to periodically distribute insecticide over the surrounding garden to keep the mosquitoes away from your house using a mobile phone to connect to the system. This company is very innovative and we are very strong in the market in terms of malaria and dengue fever products, and also with our products for cockroach control. One of the plants formulates Temephos, which is a larvicide used to kill mosquito larvae. In general, we try to innovate with gels and are very interested in those areas.</p><h4>Have you created jobs directly or indirectly as a result of your growth?</h4><p>We have grown very fast as a result of importing technical products in our earlier years. However, these days many other companies are doing the same, particularly from India and China, and we are facing strong competition. Our plan is to continue developing registrations and manufacturing technical support at such a rate that we become the first or second seller of every product we offer, thereby increasing our margins. Another plan is to synthesize some technical insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. These are the two pillars on which we are planning to build the future of the company. Between our two plants, Agrí­cola Innovací­on, Velsimex, and Quimix we have more than 400 employees. That has all happened over 26 years.</p><h4>To what extent do you think the agrochemical market can help increase the agriculture sector's contribution to the economy?</h4><p>In Mexico, agriculture is not treated with the importance it deserves, and accounts for only 4%-5% of our economy, but more than 40% of the Mexican population lives in rural areas. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 1.6 billion people in the world. There are now around 7 billion people and the acreage is a little more or less than same. The real difference is agrochemicals, the use of which produces a much higher yield. Major developments are coming from new agricultural practices that include the use of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides. If more agrochemicals were used correctly in Mexico, the country's crop production could improve significantly. For example, in some areas one hectare produces more than 14 tons of corn, while in Chiapas there are lands where the yield is only 800 kilograms per hectare.</p><h4>What kinds of corporate social responsibility initiatives are you engaged in?</h4><p>At Velsimex we believe we have a social commitment, and we invest in scholarships for our employees and their children. We also invest in other kinds of social benefits for them.Besides that, Mexican and global companies are concerned about new foreign companies coming to the agrochemical market. We are creating an official norm that obligates these companies to follow the same safety procedures that we implement. We want to have an organization that has an open telephone line 24/7, with a doctor to provide antidote/treatment information for any cases of agrochemical intoxication. If all Mexican and multinational companies are paying for this, then any new company must have a similar program to protect the public. Another example is that our products expire in two years, after which they have to be taken off the market. Some small foreign companies are unconcerned when a product expires; they should be obligated to be responsible. Campo Limpio was created as a joint venture between multinationals and local companies to clean up Mexican fields of the bottles used to contain agrochemicals. I am glad because although these are not Mexican companies, they invest in Mexico because they care about their subsidiaries and their Mexican employees and Mexican agro-producers. Campo Limpio is doing a great job of recovering and recycling packaging. When we first started, the multinationals and the Mexican companies were recovering less than 20% of the total packaging that was reaching the market. Last year was my second year as President of the Association and the fourth year of Campo Limpio, and we managed to recover 59%, almost 60%, of all the bottles that we used. This year the objective is 65%.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Roche decide to enter the Panamanian market, and what is the regional importance of the country?</h4><p>Roche affiliates were created in our Central American and Caribbean area, in Havana (1955), Nicaragua (1965), and Guatemala (1969). Today, Roche has two main divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, the last one being the division we run from Panama. The Central America and Caribbean regional offices for the Pharmaceutical division are in Costa Rica. Roche, as a multinational, is constantly seeking new opportunities, and emerging markets are fundamental for the future growth of the Roche Group. As to why we entered this market, it is due to the potential of the region and of Panama specifically. We relocated the operations for Central America and the Caribbean Diagnostics division here from Guatemala in 2008. Panama has proven to be a hub in terms of communication and logistics, which facilitates our access to our markets. Another aspect is safety, as Panama is a secure place to live compared to other countries in the region. Additionally, you can hire good talent, with different background and nationalities, which also helps to make a sustainable business. Finally, Panama has a stable political environment under the Sede de Empresas Multinacionales law, which has fostered a favorable business environment. We have grown constantly since we commenced operations here. Overall, the main achievements have been the consolidation of strong growth, extending the use of our products and services in this territory to contribute to the improvement of overall healthcare practices. We have over 130 people working for this affiliate, of which 70 are based in Panama. Altogether, we can be more effective by managing the business from here.</p><h4>Which countries are the most significant in the region, and what are Roche's plans for expansion in Central America?</h4><p>All countries in this region are relevant for Roche. Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Cuba are maybe the strongest markets. But we do a lot of business throughout the entire region as countries are increasing their investment in healthcare. Due to this, we are also extending our presence in Central America and the Caribbean, by having direct employees in most countries as well as through a strong distribution network, a fundamental partner for our business success. The Panamanian market may require special attention because of its booming economy; we need to be ready to deliver the products and services that the governments and the society demand in order to improve the quality of healthcare in this region.</p><h4>In terms of diagnostics in Panama, what are the most important products and services you provide?</h4><p>We work mainly in the in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) business, providing routine and specialized testing for any type of IVD diagnosis that may be required to perform in a blood or urine sample, in a tissue biopsy, or in other types of specimens. We provide fully-automated technology and equipment for laboratories with the highest quality of diagnostic tests, covering the different parameters a patient needs in order to decide the best treatment alternative. Our product portfolio addresses unmet medical needs in a wide variety of clinical areas such as oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, women's health and pregnancy care, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.</p><div class="quote">“All countries in this region are relevant for Roche. Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Cuba are maybe the strongest markets."</div><h4>As the world's largest biotech company could you comment on what innovation means to you?</h4><p>Innovation is fundamental, and is reflected in the sheer volume of investment in R&amp;D we commit to annually. Some of that innovation is internal, but we also engage in the external collaborations that have proven to be highly successful in both diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. We constantly seek for new ideas and opportunities that enrich our portfolio with innovative solutions to improve the quality of healthcare.</p><h4>How would you describe the financial performance of the region in 2013, and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We have been highly successful in the region, having grown at a double-digit rate in the diagnostics business. We are very proud of this achievement in a region where budgets, although increasing, remain tight. That really shows that we are doing a good job in partnering with different countries in improving their access to a better healthcare system. Resources are being allocated adequately to improve the healthcare policies in many countries, and the outlook for this year is that we will be able to maintain solid and positive growth. That means we will keep investing here, hiring more people, and developing the business. We see very positively the partnerships we have established with both public and private customers in many countries, from which we are providing best-in-class solutions to many hospitals and healthcare services.</p><h4>In your opinion, what differentiates Roche from its competitors in the region and in general?</h4><p>At Roche we are committed to providing the best quality of products and services to our customers addressed to help in the diagnosis and treatment of unmet medical needs. We always partner with our customers seeking for improvements and innovation that can be beneficial for patients. Our key focus in the region is still providing the best solutions available for all patients, regardless of whether the customer is a public or private institution. Finally, at Roche we are highly committed to doing business in an ethical manner, all based on high standards of integrity and respect. Any business we enter absolutely needs to be aligned with the corporate values we live up to. This belief underpins our overall strategy.</p><h4>How many jobs has Roche created in Panama, and how are you contributing to national development?</h4><p>By being based in Panama we are reinforcing the country's role as a regional hub for Central America and the Caribbean and, to some extent, for the entire Latin-American region. We annually increase the number of new positions, both through direct and indirect (outsourced) hiring. In the community, we are involved in a variety of projects with the government addressing important healthcare needs such as the support in women's health initiatives for the early detection of cervical cancer, through screening programs of the papilloma virus (HPV). Also, Roche is collaborating to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes nationwide.</p><h4>The Panamanian government has made a huge investment in different initiatives in the health sector over the past few years. What is your evaluation of these efforts?</h4><p>This investment in healthcare means greater and better access to healthcare for the population. The government is already undertaking many programs, including the construction of new hospitals nationwide and the implementation of other preventive healthcare initiatives mentioned before. The government is sending a clear signal that it believes that better healthcare contributes to faster development for the country.</p><h4>What are Roche's priorities for Central America and the Caribbean and, more specifically, for Panama?</h4><p>We need to keep growing this business because that is what allows us to invest more in the market, increasing our staff and growing the organization. We need to be more effective in commercializing our products and services, working together with the public and private healthcare sector to facilitate the access to our high medical value portfolio. This is our challenge this year and in the years to come in Central America and the Caribbean. In this regard, Panama has achieved significant progress in improving access to healthcare, and we want to contribute to this increasing effort by focusing our support in preventive care and early diagnosis, to facilitate the best choice of medical treatment and to have a more efficient healthcare system. Ultimately, it is all about improving the quality of life of patients here in Panama by “Doing now what patients need next."</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[yes-icon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of your role in the UAE's construction sector, what have been the milestones since your establishment?</h4><p>There are two major projects I consider some of our most important contributions to the Emirates' skyline: the Jumeirah Beach hotel, by W.S. Atkins, and the district cooling plant at the Jumeirah Beach Residences, which is a 60,000-ton facility. I'd say these are the two most iconic, but our portfolio includes many other remarkable projects. From a corporate perspective, Drake &amp; Scull International (DSI) has undergone a tremendous transformation since the early days. We were primarily a mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) contractor in the early days but, since then, we've established multiple discipline integrated business streamlines in the form of Drake &amp; Scull Construction (general contracting), Drake &amp; Scull Engineering (MEP, water, and power), Drake &amp; Scull Rail, Drake &amp; Scull Oil &amp; Gas, Drake &amp; Scull Development (infrastructure), and Passavant Energy &amp; Environment (water and wastewater treatment, waste-to-energy conversion). We launched a very successful IPO to drive our regional expansion efforts, which was ranked among the top-20 IPOs globally in that quarter in 2008. We listed on the Dubai Financial Market and were oversubscribed 101 times. As a publicly listed company, we had to introduce a corporate culture that is now oriented toward generating value for our shareholders. The IPO and the listing proved vital in expanding our presence into key markets like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, Europe, Thailand, India, and Iraq. Our project backlog has grown to around AED12.2 billion, and our workforce today stands at over 25,000 strong, as our global footprint spans Europe, the MENA region, and Asia.</p><h4>Is there a specific project—not only in the UAE, but all over the world—that you recall as the most ambitious and challenging?</h4><p>We've worked on several prestigious, high-profile projects around the world in the last five decades. Besides the Jumeirah Beach Residences and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, we've worked on iconic landmarks like the Kuwait State Audit Bureau Headquarters, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), the Information and Technology Communications Complex (ITCC), and the Royal Amwaj Resorts and Spa. The one I'd like to highlight is under construction right now. Currently, the most prestigious and challenging project we're undertaking is called the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC). Drake &amp; Scull Construction was chosen to carry out the complete general contracting (civil works) for this project. The architect is Zaha Hadid, who designed the bridge between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. She also designed the Beijing center and the Olympic Village in London. KAPSARC is going to be iconic, and will probably be the most important landmark in Saudi Arabia. It is a LEED Platinum project that will cost in excess of SAR3 billion, and we hope to complete it very soon.</p><div class="quote">“We've worked on several prestigious, high-profile projects around the world in the last five decades."</div><h4>What hurdles have been overcome to make the project a reality?</h4><p>The biggest hurdle faced by the industry, and not just us, is a change to the labor laws that restricted the flow of expatriate workers into Saudi Arabia. This was a bold step by Saudi Arabia to boost the employment of Saudi Arabian nationals in the private economy. We all knew this was coming, but, no matter how prepared we were, the announcement was made quite abruptly. We were caught shorthanded. We basically had to bring in people from wherever we could to try and get the job done. We currently have about 7,800 people on site. The project is quite challenging, and it has a futuristic look. This building will probably stand for another 50 years as the building of the century in Saudi Arabia. If you watched the Olympic Games in Beijing and saw the stadium, it looked extraordinary, and this is miles ahead of that.</p><h4>What characteristics allowed you to become a leading player in the construction sector after the crisis?</h4><p>The crisis that hit the real estate sector was a huge setback for the industry. But in good times or bad, the values in any business are the same; you hang on to your good workers and take care of them. You also have to work with very low margins in times of crisis. And the complexity of this crisis was not only financial, but also led to a scarcity of work. The margins were not there, the collections were not there, and so the difficulties were enormous. However, we are out of it. We have not yet seen it in our bottom lines. That will come, however, as the construction sector follows market trends. What set DSI apart from our competitors was our strategy to diversify into new areas of business and, at the same time, vertically integrate these disciplines to offer our clients a one-stop solution to manage all aspects of a project, from the design stage to post-completion handover. Having multiple DSI teams on site working with the same work approach and standards and speaking the same language proved to be a huge benefit to our clients. And we've always operated with a quality-oriented, cost-conscious approach, which has earned us the trust of our clients. Our rich legacy and experience of delivering a wide range of projects all around the world dates back all the way to 1881, when Drake &amp; Scull began its existence. The history and knowledge gained by generations of DSI employees has been passed down over the years, and is something that only a few companies can offer in our industry.</p><h4>You find the relationship with your customers and partners fundamental to conducting business. Why is this factor so important in the real estate and construction sector?</h4><p>You have to look at it from two different perspectives. We always like to have repeat business. Anybody is willing to try you out once and, if they don't find you suitable, they don't come back to you. Repeat business is a good indicator that your mechanisms and policies are working properly. On the engineering side, DSI has had enormous repeat business, and this is where we are leading the market. It is very important to also be extremely competitive, but at the same time to make sure you have the right quality and offering. It is not as simple as saying you take care of your client; they have to come back to you. You also have to make sure that you are always competitive. Construction is like bread and butter; if you don't get it from this store, you'll get it from another store. You have to be extremely competitive, and at the same time take care of your clients.</p><h4>Which major projects you are expecting to complete outside the UAE, and on which specific areas will you be focusing in the medium term?</h4><p>DSI's focus has been the UAE and Saudi Arabia for some time now. Things are vibrant there. First, you have to operate in the countries where your expertise is higher. We need to move machinery and people. To deliver and be successful, you have to have a keen logistics setup. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, we know the market, we have the labor, and we have the power, so that's why we are there. However, our ambitions are limitless. The company joined the stock market six years ago, and companies like ours, hopefully, will last for other 50 years. We have high expectations from the rail business, particularly in the Middle East, where we are currently working on the passenger movement system in Dubai's airports. The oil and gas business is also very lucrative and holds tremendous potential for DSI. We are already working on oil fields in Iraq, and we recently announced a massive oil terminal project in Egypt. We are also quite active in emerging high-growth markets like Algeria and India, where we're working on large-scale, mixed-use developments and water treatment plants. We are in the embryonic stage and things are poised to take off and the company should expand even further in the future.</p><h4>What green initiatives are you working on?</h4><p>We have a strong commitment to the environment, and have an environment policy that focuses on reducing the consumption of resources and maximizing the recycling of old resources. In terms of our projects, we have worked on solar energy plants in India and we also built the first waste-to-energy plant in the Middle East at Saida, Lebanon. Our water treatment business recycles wastewater and sludge to reuse for agricultural purposes. We have worked on several LEED Platinum and LEED Silver projects in the Middle East. Green stands for so many things. In the end, it is all about us and our actions and what we do. You can live a green life, or a normal life, and the same applies to construction. Green is a gimmicky word right now. Governments talk about green, contractors talk about green, and developers talk about green to attract attention. But what is green really? Saving energy is green, and so is preserving resources for the future. The same thing is true of construction. What materials are you using for building? If you can use materials that actually reduce the consumption of electricity, that is green. You can put plants in, and not only for aesthetics, but also for oxygen. At times, however, economic reasons keep you from implementing such things. You end up doing the cheapest thing rather than the right thing. In that respect, it is a challenge for governments to subsidize industries that need a green edge.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurrí­a formally launched Colombia's accession process with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, and Colombia has surpassed Mexico in FDI receipts, ranking solely behind Brazil and Chile. In this light, what is the outlook for the Colombian economy?</h4><p>Our perception is that Colombia will continue to increase FDI over the coming years if it continues to focus on two of the pillars that attract it, namely improved infrastructure and a modernized public administration. It is also crucial for growth to maintain both government transparency and take measures to ensure public security. Regarding the OECD's invitation, it confirms Colombia is advancing in the right direction. Foreign investment has helped change the world's perception of the country, which is the first step toward generating confidence among international markets. Furthermore, Colombia is playing a key role in the Pacific Alliance, an interesting and dynamic Latin American integration process, which was officially launched as a trading group in June 2012 at a presidential summit in Chile. It currently brings together Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, and is set to include Costa Rica, Panama, and Guatemala in due course. AYESA has headquarters and strategic projects in all Pacific Alliance member states. At AYESA, we perceive this opportunity as a testing ground for key projects that can be replicated throughout all current member nations of the alliance and those that may join in the future.</p><h4>From its subsidiary in Bogotá, AYESA provides coverage in areas such as civil engineering, water and environmental engineering, oil and gas engineering, and telecommunications consulting. How has AYESA been consolidating its leading position in engineering consultancy?</h4><p>Public entities are being modernized and the government is supporting this modernization, providing the necessary legislation. Compared to other local and foreign companies, AYESA provides tools that already incorporate much of the requirements of this new legislation, and is well-versed in the necessary steps an organization must take to adapt, and perhaps more importantly, those to be avoided. This experience is embodied in the strategic projects that we are developing in Latin America and in the references of satisfied clients. We have found that this combination is highly appreciated by our customers in Latin America, and look forward to contributing our know-how to this modernization process.</p><div class="quote">“Public entities are being modernized and the government is supporting this modernization."</div><h4>The Bogotá Capital District government awarded AYESA a contract for the auditing of advanced basic engineering studies of the city's first subway line. What does AYESA's advice entail?</h4><p>AYESA audited the technical design for Line 1 of Bogotá's underground metropolitan railway, which consists of overseeing, coordinating, and ultimately controlling the project for the contracting entity. Having accumulated invaluable experience in design, construction, and the auditing of subway lines in cities as diverse as Seville, Barcelona, Malaga, New Delhi, Warsaw, and Mexico City, we are supremely positioned to implement such schemes. We were also selected by the government of Panama to oversee the design, construction, and commissioning of Line 1 of Panama City's metro system. This project allows us to present a more dynamic profile of AYESA, where we combine the services offered by our civil engineering wing with those of our technology wing; this is probably our definitive differentiator from our competitors. Few companies can offer a turnkey product if they lack strength in these two areas. This added value is what has made project implementation possible within such a short space of time.</p><h4>In Panama you are participating in the implementation of a new integrated system of Government Resource Planning (PRG) for the national government, one of the biggest World Bank projects in Latin America. What are AYESA's prospects for growth in Latin America and your priority markets?</h4><p>AYESA has been present in Latin America for over a decade, with operations in Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil, and we are conducting market research in at least three other countries. The company's unequivocal focus on Latin America is to achieve sustainable growth, following the method introduced by the founding Manzanares family, and specifically based on solvency, debt avoidance, and an approach that underpins our operations in over 30 countries across four continents.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Alpina make the transition from being an importer of dairy products to a major local producer?</h4><p>Alpina first came to Ecuador in 1995 as an exporter from Colombia. We were producing in plants located around 1,300 miles away at that point, but we saw Ecuador's potential as a market. Our first client at that time was an important supermarket chain. Once we had established our import operations, we realized that with the different standards and changes on importing rules in place at the time, it would be wise to focus on importing raw materials and manufacturing our products locally. We began working with local partners on the manufacturing infrastructure, and we had a clear vision of entering a market with our full portfolio of products. We knew we would need to invest, so the next step was to build our plant, although such investments were difficult to make in the political climate of the time. In 1998 we bought land in Machachi and, by the end of 2003, the plant was operational. Since then, we have been mixing local production with imports. The ultimate goal was to supply this market with completely local production. In 2008, we saw another opportunity to grow in this market through the acquisition of a cheese company called Kiosko, and the companies merged in 2009. Today, 92% of what we sell in Ecuador is produced locally, and only 8% is imported. We have always believed that the way to develop the market in the country is through local production.</p><h4>What is the significance of Ecuador for the company today?</h4><p>Alpina sells $1 billion per year. We are present with local production in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru. Ecuador represents 7.5% of the sales of the company, and it is an interesting market not only for the present but also for the future. Alpina has made important investments in Ecuador over the past five years, and we plan to invest in long term with the same strength. The government has done an excellent job of reversing many years of instability. However, if we do not develop a productive and solid product as quickly as possible, we cannot provide for the local market.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador represents 7.5% of the sales of the company, and it is an interesting market."</div><h4>Do you intend to export to Peru from Ecuador?</h4><p>The potential we see in this market is interesting. We have been active in Peru for three years already. With our system of assembly plants and the export of certain products, it feels rather like reliving our time in Ecuador. It is a smart decision because the experience we acquired in Ecuador can be applied in Peru. Currently, we export from Colombia to Peru with assembly factories in Peru, similar to the way we started in Ecuador, but the next step is to mix in some exports from Ecuador with local production in Peru.</p><h4>Do you see the potential of Ecuador having a major part of Alpina sales globally?</h4><p>We plan to grow faster in Ecuador than in other Alpina markets. Our aim is to grow 14%, compared to Alpina's overall growth of 8%. Innovation and quality are critical in the development of this company, and Alpina was the first company in the world to develop prepared drinkable oatmeal. The company understood consumption and product development. When we entered the Ecuadorean market, this was one of our first products.</p><h4>How does Alpina work with informal dairy producers in Ecuador?</h4><p>In Ecuador, Alpina has a 40% share of the formal cheese market and 20% of the formal dairy market. However, only 30% of cheese is sold in the formal market in Ecuador, while informal producers account for 70%. In many cases, we are working with informal producers to help them develop better safety and quality standards. One example is a small dairy cooperative in Ecuador, named Quesinor, located close to our plant (Carchi). We have been working with them to help integrate standards for technology and hygiene and to generate business value to commercialize their products. We feel that we have a social responsibility to ensure that there is a harmonious environment for business. Alpina buys more than 170,000 liters of milk every day. We have been working with the Ministry of Agriculture to source much of this milk from small farmers. By guaranteeing a buyer for these farmers, we can help support the market, and by working to identify the many cooperatives and associations and agreeing to purchase milk from them under formal conditions, we are helping to bring them out of informality. Another program we run is focused on turning solid waste into fertilizer. We are helping to create a clear pattern of fertilizer use in agricultural production, giving technical advice, and helping to set up the project and creating an incentive program in the region.</p><h4>What role can a company like Alpina play in the transformation of the productive matrix?</h4><p>Throughout these 19 years, Alpina has been interested in producing locally. That is why we constantly seek strategic alliances for the local development of Alpina's portfolio, focused on providing healthy products. We transitioned from a 100% import operation to 92% local production, with the goal of reaching 100%. Last year, we invested $2.5 million in new technology to improve local production. However, there are other innovations, such as the use of whey, which is a by-product of cheese. In Europe and the US it is often used in nutritional supplements, but in Ecuador it is usually just thrown away, which contributes to pollution. We have been working with the government to try to utilize whey as a tool for import substitution.</p><h4>What are Alpina's goals for the next decade?</h4><p>Over the coming five years, we want to go from being an importer to being an exporter, and we are close to achieving this goal. We have a master plan for investment divided into three chapters for the near future; an expansion of capacity, the modernization of existing lines, and a business development model that encourages exports. We realize that we have an investment capacity of around $30 million. We are currently focusing on strengthening the cheese and milk line, and continue to create products with added value on the platforms of our cheese and milk drinks. We visualize growth of 13% within the next five years.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines (THY) was named “Best Airline in Europe" for the third consecutive year in 2013. What key factors have contributed toward this achievement?<br></h4><p>Naturally, as a global carrier, we have adopted the “hub and spoke" strategy, which given our unique geographical position provides us with enormous reach. That is an exceptional opportunity that no other airline can boast. In fact, our excellent geographical position translates into a 30% cost reduction when compared to most European carriers. Waste is anathema to our corporate culture, and cost cutting is a way of life. Moreover, we enjoy greater economies of scale thanks to our fleet of new aircraft. Accordingly, our production costs decline by virtue of increased productivity. Our strategy, therefore, is based on cost cutting in pursuit of growth through productivity.</p><h4>THY recently signed a $560 million deal with International Aero Engines (IAE) to power 25 new A321 aircraft with V2500 engines. Could you elaborate on consequences of this deal?</h4><p>THY entered into an agreement under which IAE AG's V2500 engines will power 25 new A321 aircraft in our fleet. This brings the total number of V2500-powered A320 aircraft to 90. The deal is valued at $560 million and includes an option for a 12-year Fleet Hour Agreement. The aircraft will be delivered between 2015 and 2017. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with IAE, and are delighted with the reliability of our V2500 engines. The engine supports our mission to become the preferred European air carrier with a global network, since we are one of Europe's fastest growing airlines.</p><h4>Which new routes or regions is Turkish Airlines prioritizing as part of its expansion strategy?</h4><p>We are of the belief that the center of gravity of the global aviation market is still shifting from West to East, which should become ever more relevant for Istanbul over the next decade. Meanwhile, we value the African continent for being a relatively undiscovered aviation market. Ultimately, however, as a global network carrier flying to more countries than any other airline with the largest international network, one can say that the entire globe is our market. Via our hub in Istanbul, we fly to almost every point in Europe and crucial points in the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Over time, we will also enhance our service in the Americas and Asia, while commencing flights to Australia.</p><h4>What are your main targets for 2014?</h4><p>According to the non-consolidated 2014 budget approved by our Board of Directors, the guidance regarding Turkish Airlines' targets and expectations is as follows. By the end of 2014, our fleet number is set to reach 267, including 204 narrow-body, 54 wide-body, and nine cargo aircraft. With the inclusion of 16 new routes, the total number of destinations we serve will reach 259. Meanwhile, the total number of passengers carried is targeted to reach to 59.5 million including 26.2 million on scheduled domestic routes, 32.3 million on scheduled international routes, and the remainder on charter and Hajj flights. While the passenger load factor is expected to be 78.8%, total available seat kilometers (ASK) will reach 141 billion on an increase of 21% compared to 2013. Capacity ASK is expected to rise 33% in Turkey, 29% in South America, 25% in Africa, 22% in the Far East, 20% in North America, 16% in Europe, and 13% in the Middle East. In 2014, cargo/mail carried will increase by 23% to 653,000 tons. Compared to 2013, we expect a 2% decrease (in TL terms) in passenger yield on domestic routes, a 1% increase (in EUR terms) on international routes, and a 2% increase (in USD terms) in ex-fuel unit costs. In 2014, Turkish Airlines' total personnel count is expected to rise 18% along with a 23% increase in fuel consumption, and 2% increase in utilization levels compared to 2013. As a result of scheduled commercial activities, Turkish Airlines is targeting to increase its sales revenue by 17% to $11.4 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How is DHL's Strategy 2020: Focus-Connect-Grow being applied specifically to the Turkish market?<br></h4><p>Actually, we are already on the finish line of Strategy 2015 and just recently announced our new Strategy 2020: Focus-Connect-Grow on April 2, a continuation of the positive momentum generated by the successful Strategy 2015, which defined the group's next phase of development. Due to the tremendous success of Strategy 2015, its key elements remain unchanged, but in addition a significant further expansion into emerging markets is a key aspect of the new growth strategy. Today, emerging market revenues contribute just over 20% of the group's revenues; by 2020, the group expects this figure to climb to 30%. Given the significant increase in revenues expected by 2020, this means a substantial increase in absolute revenue growth in the emerging markets. Turkey has great potential and growth numbers. We are very excited about this as it will enable DHL Express Turkey to shape the market even more effectively.</p><h4>The CEO of Deutsche Post DHL, Frank Appel, has said that Turkey is a priority country for DHL's investment projects. Can you please elaborate on DHL's planned investments in Turkey?</h4><p>As the market leader in Turkey, our mission here is to increase our investments in new trade lanes in parallel with Turkey's national objectives. Turkey has always been an important investment area for us and is a trusted and predictable partner with a strong investment climate and FDI framework. Additionally, Turkey's youth and economic structure open up new opportunities and entrepreneurialism. The rapid population growth offers a responsive workforce and a dynamic consumer market that positively affects the steady economic expansion in Turkey. To this point, we have made investments in order to contribute to the economy. In the upcoming years, we will also resolutely sustain our efforts to expand our infrastructure and, as part of our exporters' pursuit of new markets, we will continue to offer services aimed at facilitating Turkish exporters' access to new customers and markets. The group's target is to increase investments in developing countries, and Turkey is one of these countries; our target is to invest at least ‚¬25 million over two years in Turkey. By the end of 2014, we plan to increase our capacity at Sabiha Gökçen Airport with a second aircraft, aiming to cater for the increase in shipments there. Last but not least, we invest heavily in employee training. CIM training is one example of this, as almost 1,000 of our employees in Turkey have recently been trained as international specialists.</p><h4>What are DHL Express Turkey's strategies to better serve the country's dynamic SMEs?</h4><p>Some 60% of exports are accounted for by SMEs in Turkey. These enterprises also provide more than 78% of overall employment. With our special services, we intend to help SMEs, the engine of the Turkish economy, be more effective, and more responsive in international markets. We will increase our support to SMEs through our SME Express service. The SME Express package that DHL Express offers provides express shipping for export shipments up to 150 kilograms in weight and ‚¬7,500 in value under the Micro Export service. Over the last year, more than 15,000 packages have been processed. The service also provides consultancy services on market characteristics and customs to SMEs. By using our service, one SME delivered Iznik pottery to some of the world's most well-known people, such as former US President Bill Clinton and TV star Oprah Winfrey. Another DHL Express customer exports its brand exclusively to European countries, and emphasized that by utilizing DHL Express' Micro Export product, it can export more easily and much faster. It only takes a maximum of two days to export products and samples to Europe, and our customers do not need to pay any extra fees to manage the customs process. The majority of SMEs have increased their exports dramatically by using our services. DHL has also organized SME seminars to find the best solutions to expand their reach abroad and open up markets for export. These seminars explore the business process from an SME perspective and evaluate their needs in order to offer new services that fit. The sessions also provide a networking platform for each SME to develop its own business relations. Last but not least, to demonstrate our commitment to supporting the efforts of Turkish exporters and SMEs, with the aim of developing, enriching, and diversifying Turkey's export market, we have hosted the Stars of Exports competition for 12 consecutive years. This event recognizes the achievements of the firms that shape Turkey's push in exports. DHL Express Turkey is proud to connect Turkey to the rest of the world faster and more reliably than any other company.</p><h4>What are your main targets or goals for 2014?</h4><p>Unless the macro economy destabilizes, 2014 will clearly be a year of growth for DHL Express Turkey, where we could well see solid double-digit growth. It is much too early to give a detailed forecast for 2014 but, I can confidently say that, as an export-driven company, we have started the year in a strong position. Nevertheless, 2014 is a difficult year to forecast considering the numerous global and local uncertainties. The international express industry is an exciting industry to be in, as it has constantly outperformed GDP growth globally, and also in Turkey. DHL, the undisputed market leader globally and in Turkey, is very well positioned to leverage this attractive market position into superior growth rates. DHL aims to increase its investment in developing countries, as I have mentioned. To show our commitment, we'll continue to invest in increasing our capacity, supporting SMEs, the driving force of the Turkish economy, contributing new developments to the market in collaboration with local authorities, and, of course contributing to the country's 2023 export targets. We will also continue to invest in the green shipment area and in technologies to support the fast and efficient integration of our customers into global markets, including e-commerce solutions both on internet and mobile platforms.</p><h4>Turkey's Vision 2023 includes establishing Istanbul as a major international logistics hub. What needs to happen to realize this vision?</h4><p>Turkey has a unique geographic standing as a bridge between Asia and Europe. Specifically, the Istanbul area can rise to become a leading international logistics and transportation hub using the advantages of a dynamic economy, a growing population, and well-developed infrastructure. In order to offset the negative effects of European recession on the Turkish economy since 2011, Turkey has turned toward countries and regions such as Russia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America. The divergence of shipment areas also creates new business opportunities for DHL. Turkey has the right dynamics to become a major logistics hub as long as the country keeps investing in infrastructure and increasing its economic and trade relations with neighboring countries and others. As the market leader in the industry, our mission here is to increase our investments in new trade lanes in parallel with Turkey's national objectives. Turkey needs to focus on the Customs Union deal through negotiations with the EU. Due to the existing free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, any country that enjoys free trade with the bloc will be permitted to ship duty free to Turkey, but the country will not automatically have the right to ship without duties to these countries. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), for which negotiations have started between the US and the EU, is the latest agreement to deal a blow to Turkey, causing the resentment of many local exporters. Free trade deals between the EU and third parties enable other countries' goods to enter Turkish markets via Europe with zero duties, but the decision to provide the same privileges to Turkey is up to the third party. Global trade is bound for good growth potential in the coming decades. In this regard, Turkey needs to make further improvements in its customs procedures to facilitate and stimulate global trade for Turkish exporters and importers. At DHL Express, we strongly believe that international trade is the key to global stability and barriers or uneven rules block this stability. Whilst the FTA with Europe has increased the connectivity of Turkey to Europe, it also bears some current risks due to the upcoming agreement between Europe and us.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of this region for Medtronic's global strategy?<br></h4><p>Medtronic is giving a lot of attention to make sure we provide access to our therapies globally. The focus has been placed on ensuring that this is how we carry out our decisions. Having said that, our region—an emerging global market—is receiving a lot of attention. Some people would probably feel the pressure; we think it is a great opportunity. Medtronic Global is offering us the support necessary for us to provide our patients in the region with better access to the therapies and technologies we produce. Once you look at how big the region is, you understand that you cannot have a single defined strategy, and you cannot have a single goal. Obviously, however, there are common goals. At Medtronic, we have a very noble mission that we truly believe in, and it guides us in our operations from Pakistan to Morocco, and from Turkey to South Africa. This is a vast region, and thus we have ensured that there is a dedication to creating sub-regions. These sub-regions can establish different sets of strategies that they can monitor throughout.</p><h4>How would you characterize Medtronic's specific strategy for Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is a rather diverse market. The economy has proven to be a very stable one, even in difficult times. The population is among the largest in the region, and the healthcare infrastructure provides a good level of service. Turkey has good specialty hospitals, polyclinics, and reimbursement systems. Turkey, as a market, is one of our strongest potentials for contribution. Turkey has done a great job improving its life expectancy. The population we now serve is much larger than it used to be, and I think that trend will continue. Specific diseases, such as diabetes, which is a core specialty for us, are significant for the region, and particularly for countries like Turkey. The diabetes rate of some of the countries in the region is 20% of the population. That is the estimate of a few million people around the region. When you look at the costs in the system associated with such treatments, and how companies like ours can try to reduce the impact while improving quality of life, Turkey is a perfect place to start because the set-up is there. We recently announced our acquisition of Biostar and the start of more collaboration with Medicall, our 10-plus-year distributor in Turkey. We will have access to most of the regions in Turkey for our therapies. This gets us closer to the patients. It also gets us closer to trends where we can contribute more, and that makes it easier for us to make investment decisions since we are directly engaged and involved in the market.</p><h4>Where do you see Medtronic in the long term?</h4><p>We are hoping to be able to serve every region we are responsible for through directly dedicated Medtronic resources. We believe that local experts need to serve local patients at the point of need, we are thus exploring many new models to work with our existing partners to help support them achieve top performance in terms of service delivery to patients. We estimate that we are now serving close to 300,000 patients per year in this region. We are hoping to serve 1 million patients by the end of 2018. In 2014, at Medtronic, we are going to see departments that focus on government programs and Hospital Solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The country's almost 80 million population is fully covered by the national social security system. Turkey's existing healthcare infrastructure, both private and public, is growing through the large healthcare city public-private partnership (PPP) project. This project will bring a new mindset into the market in which advanced therapies and high-level services can be provided. The challenges are creating awareness for chronic disease among patients and healthcare professionals, and increasing the effectiveness of referring channels ensuring access to the right therapy. Medtronic has the most diversified product range, treating many conditions including cardiac and vascular diseases, diabetes, and neurological and spinal conditions with the largest number of sales technicians in the field. As part of the Medtronic Global approach toward supporting the healthcare authorities, we share best practices from other countries experiences from a healthcare economics point of view and promote sustainable healthcare policies. Medtronic has approximately 150 employees in Turkey and, as a global leader in medical technology, aims to treat chronic diseases and create awareness of the diseases using the most technologically advanced therapies that we provide.</p><h4>Which of Medtronic's services or products are in greatest demand in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are Turkey's most prevalent non-communicable diseases. Medtronic products and therapies are used to treat these and many other chronic conditions to help improve the quality of life and advance healthcare. While the rate of heart failure in society in general is 2% to 3%, this rate increases to 10% after the age of 70, and 15% to 20% after the age of 80. Life expectancy in Turkey has increased by 10 years within the last two decades and is 75 now. The number of elderly is gradually increasing. It is expected that this figure will increase two fold again within the next 10 years. Around 50% of patients with heart failure are taken to intensive care units a minimum of four times a year. The number of people above the age of 60 is 7.5 million; however, it is anticipated that this will have reached 14 million to 15 million by 2023. Looking at the current situation, heart failure may be regarded as one of the heaviest burdens on our healthcare system. For cardiovascular disease, we provide innovative and comprehensive solutions that extend beyond the industry's broadest portfolio of technologies to programs and services that drive economic value across the care continuum. There are approximately 9 million diabetic patients in Turkey. Around 3.6 million of them are not diagnosed or have glucose intolerance; they are the diabetic population of the coming years. Of around 5.4 million patients who are under treatment, 1 million are insulin dependent but use different types of insulin at different times of the day. We are the world leader in advanced diabetes management solutions, including integrated diabetes management systems, insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring systems, and therapy management software, as well as offering world-class, 24/7 expert consumer and professional service and support.</p><h4>What has Medtronic identified as the main healthcare needs for the country, and how is it working to address these issues?</h4><p>Medtronic will launch its Hospital Solutions model in Turkey, with our broad portfolio of market-leading products, deep clinical knowledge, in-hospital footprint, healthcare economics expertise, lean sigma resources, and a strong financial position. We are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our customers and hospitals to provide services that deliver clinical and economic value in this challenging healthcare environment. These efforts will also address and expand patient care pathways, potentially increasing access to care for patients. This is essential at a time when hospitals and health systems are facing ever-increasing pressure to meet the demands of an ageing population with finite resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges facing the education system in Turkey?<br></h4><p>Turkey has one of the highest proportions of people under the age of 15 among OECD countries, at 25.8%. This young population must be educated and prepared for the labor market. An innovative and knowledge-based population is an important advantage for a country if it is to succeed. The 10th Development Plan (2014-2018), the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of National Education (MoNE), and sub-strategic plans, such as the Lifelong Learning Strategy Plan and Vocational Education Plan, are steering our education policy.</p><h4>What educational reforms are currently underway or planned?</h4><p>The reforms realized by the Basic Education Program (1997), the Secondary Education Project (2006-2011) with the World Bank, the Master Implementation Plan (2001-2005), the Strengthening Special Education Project (2011-2013), the International Inspiration Project (2011-2013), and the Vocational Education Development Plan were the main reflections of change for Turkey's national education system. The MoNE has conducted five EU projects for adapting the system to the EU, and eight new projects will start in 2014. The budget of the MoNE for 2014 is TL54 billion. Turkey has set the target of reaching the OECD average by 2023. Erasmus, LDV, and other EU projects are significant efforts made to increase the global competitiveness of Turkey's higher education institutions. The FATİH Project is a large national project for raising technology usage in the classroom. In 2012, legislation was introduced to increase the number of compulsory years from eight to 12 and called 4+4+4. Lifelong learning (LLL) and e-learning are the rapidly developing sectors in Turkey, having reached 3 million attendees. The technical education capacity of the MoNE covers nearly 65 vocations, including health and ICT.</p><h4>Are there opportunities in the education sector for foreign investors?</h4><p>Turkey has plans to bring its education system up to international standards, develop relations with the OECD, UNICEF, and UNDP, and invite foreign capital into Turkey. The transformation of 3,500 university preparatory courses to private schools and the promotion of Law No. 5652 are an important opportunity. The portion of the private sector is already around 4%, and is targeted to rise to 25% by 2023, which is an excellent opportunity for foreign investment. The investment promotion regulation has some great offers for education investment in both lower and higher education.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the future of the education sector?</h4><p>Critical improvements have been made over the last 12 years, both in regard to quality and equity; however, differences between the regions in urban and rural areas remain a challenge. The needs of disadvantaged students, preparing quality teachers and school leaders, improving access, the completion of upper secondary education, the development of vocational education fulfilling the needs of the new economy and labor market, tertiary education, adequately funding the education system, raising private sector investments, expanding the capacity of teachers and schools, and raising the education spending per student to OECD mean level, are some of the main agenda items of the MoNE. The MoNE is a huge family with 18 million students and 1 million teachers, training leaders, and workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean for Astaldi to construct Istanbul's third bridge?<br></h4><p>The third bridge is a prestigious project, which taking into consideration its technical and financial scale, only very few companies have the honor of participating in. This is a landmark, not only for Istanbul, but globally. The designer is a French company with significant experience in bridge projects. The involvement of many professional locals and/or foreign figures contributes to the achievement of this remarkable design, which has provided a hugely challenging opportunity.</p><h4>What effect will the bridge have on Istanbul?</h4><p>One of the main purposes of the third bridge is to ease Istanbul's chronic traffic congestion by acting as a bypass for heavy motorized traffic. Initially, the bridge's connection was intended to be located at a greater distance from the city; nonetheless, due to the length and width of the strait, the shortcut was opted for. The final scheme, located at the edge of the city, then runs close to what will be Istanbul's third airport and on to the city of Edirne. Today, during peak hours, trucks are kept off the existing two bridges as of 5:00 am and can use bridges again at 10:00 pm. Inevitably, such a project will have an impact on the surrounding developments, attracting many investors, and, therefore, relevant urban plans are wholly governed and managed directly by the city's greater municipality. The project is at almost 30% completion after its first year, followed by a further 50% in Phase II, leaving the remaining 20% to be completed in 2015.</p><h4>Could you give us an update on your other projects in Turkey?</h4><p>We will have opened Phase I of the Gebze to Iznik interchange by the end of 2015, or the start of 2016, which is currently around 50% complete. There are still 300 kilometers of motorway to be laid over the next three years. By 2019, all of our projects will have been completed, and by the end of 2015 or early of 2016, we will have laid the first stretch of road from Gebze to the İznik interchange linked to the Marmara crossing bridge.</p><h4>Is self-financing a sector trend?</h4><p>It is more of a necessity as project finance from the state dwindles in terms of availability. This model, which leverages the financial capabilities of the constructors themselves, is a good one that is used worldwide. In contrast to much of Europe, the construction sector has less security, and the financing responsibility lies 100% with the construction companies in Turkey. Meanwhile the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model arrived late in Turkey, but is now widely used.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>With over 20 years of experience in the market we have excellent qualifications, having successfully constructed numerous metro projects and airports. We have an extensive knowledge of the market and the skills needed to thrive in this industry. Meanwhile, our organization is composed predominantly of local staff, with few expatriates. To give an example, wecompleted the Kadıköy-Kartal metro line of Istanbul with the contribution of just four expatriates; the other 5,000 employees were all Turkish. In Turkey, the construction sector has great potential and thanks to the competitive educational system the country boasts many excellent young engineers providing a wide competitive human resource range. On the third bridge project, we have a staff count of 3,500 people, out of which only four are Italians. In my experience, locals have a deep knowledge and understanding of the country, which enables them to approach projects in a more efficient manner. As a foreign company, we have succeeded in creating a positive synergy of collaboration in Turkey. During our time here, we have created our own team, which is why we have come to be seen as a Turkish company, which in my opinion represents our strong point.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of Turkey's main objectives for 2023 is to increase agricultural GDP to $150 billion. What strategy is the Ministry employing to achieve this target?<br></h4><p>Agricultural GDP was at $23.7 billion in 2002 and has increased by 161% over the past decade, reaching $62 billion. Our efforts continue in order to reach the $150 billion target by 2023. At the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock, our main priority is to structure a sustainable agricultural sector that provides the population with sufficient and high-quality food and preserves and improves its net export position in agricultural products with increased competitiveness. In light of this priority, our Ministry, with a visionary perspective that goes far beyond day-to-day concerns, has established an administrative structure with improved policy-making and implementation capacities, in which all stakeholders can actively participate. As part of our strategic plan for the 2013-2017 period, shaped in accordance with Turkey's Vision 2023, and in parallel with the opinions of all sector stakeholders, the aim is to develop agricultural and social infrastructure services and enhance the welfare of rural areas through targeted development. In plant production, by integrating the basin-based production model and parcel identification system and, considering ecological conditions, suitable products will be produced in apt places in definite quantities. Certified seed production will be increased from 647,000 tons to 800,000 tons in 2015, and to 1 million tons by 2023. In livestock production, we aim to increase the share of the highly productive pure breed cattle population from 41% to 48% in five years and the meat production of sheep and goats from 12% to 25% in 10 years, all the while boosting pastoral area from 4.5 million decares to 5.3 million decares by 2015, and to 7.7 million decares by 2023 and the cultivation area for forage crops from 2.7 million hectares to 4 million hectares by 2023. In fisheries, over the next decade, we aim to increase aquaculture production from 212,000 tons to 500,000 tons and provide water resources with a total of 50 million fry for sustainable production.</p><h4>Turkey is aiming at agricultural exports of $40 billion a year by 2023. How will that be done?</h4><p>In 2002, total agricultural foreign trade was worth over $8 billion and has increased by 331% over the last 11 years, reaching some $34 billion in 2013. Moreover, while in 2002 total exports of agricultural products were worth $4 billion, this figure has increased by 343% over the past 11 years to $17.7 billion in 2013. A foreign trade surplus of $6 billion was generated in 2013. Since 2002, our country, a major exporter of foodstuffs, has been generating a foreign trade surplus on a regular basis. Turkey's success in exporting both processed and primary agricultural products has been increasing exponentially, and this further contributes to our export of industrial goods by providing inputs for industrial products, thus reducing the current account deficit (CAD). Reaching over $40 billion in agricultural product exports is one of the 2023 objectives, and will be achieved via safe food that is in compliance with EU standards as EU legislation has largely been adopted. Today, efficient and effective measures for the control and eradication of plant and animal diseases are taken and food safety is ensured. Turkish goods take their place both in EU markets and on tables across the world. As we have also experienced in the exports of dairy products, the fact that we are present in EU markets increases our reliability worldwide, thereby increasing the number of products we export and the number of countries to which we sell—Turkey's agricultural goods were exported to 197 countries in 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Minister of Health, how would you assess Turkey's progress in the health sector?<br></h4><p>Around 10 years ago, the status of Turkish healthcare was deplorable. People would go to stand in a hospital line with the morning call to prayer, and would spend half their day queuing for medicine, or would sit in hospital gardens on drips because of a lack of beds. In short, it was an approach to health that was undeserving for our nation. When we came to power, we set about correcting this dire situation. We had to prove that affordable healthcare was not a privilege, but a fundamental right for everyone. We are at the point today where those promises have been kept. Projects that were once unimaginable for Turkey have come to life. But we are not satisfied with this, and every day we add a new project to our chain of accomplishments. Among these accomplishments is the construction of the largest health campus in Europe; a high level of preventive healthcare; an expansion of our air, sea, and land ambulance fleet; free healthcare services; healthcare delivered to the homes of hundreds of thousands of people; mobile pharmacies; cancer diagnostic facilities in 81 provinces; our Türkök stem cell research project, and much more. After these projects were completed, the approval rating for health services shot up from 39.5% to 75%.</p><h4>What new projects is the Ministry of Health planning?</h4><p>We have never rested on our laurels; on the contrary, we have pushed and kept pushing to provide quality health services. In order to be able to meet the people's needs and expectations in a critical field such as health, you need long-term projects. With this in mind, we are creating health infrastructure that will live up to Turkey's Vision 2030. Our progress in preventive and curative medicine has been praised and appreciated, not only by our own citizens, but also by international health authorities. Our primary aim is to protect our people from all forms of diseases. When we do encounter those diseases, we aim to combat them effectively through our network of technologically advanced, state-of-the-art health centers. A short time ago, we opened a tender for a laboratory that would do tissue sampling. Besides that, we have also come a long way in organ donations and transplants, which has been a serious problem for Turkey in the past, starting a broad-based campaign that has included local municipalities, community religious figures, and other leading figures in society. We will continue placing all our resources to the task of improving and raising our citizens' health and life quality.</p><h4>The Ministry is paying special attention to the problem of obesity in Turkey. What kinds of campaigns and work are being done to combat obesity?</h4><p>Obesity has become a global epidemic in recent years and, unfortunately, Turkey is no exception. At the Ministry, we are undertaking three main programs: the “Turkish Healthy Eating and Active Life Program," the “Turkish Diabetes Prevention and Control Program," and the “Turkish Reduction of Excessive Salt Consumption Program." With our “Healthy Nutrition School Program," we have banned all energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, aromatic drinks, and colas, as well as fried food and chips from school canteens. Instead, schools now supply milk, ayran, mineral water, freshly squeezed fruit juices, and also fruit. Furthermore, we have reduced the amount of salt in bread, and our efforts to reduce salt in cheeses and olives are also currently continuing in ministerial commissions. The best and most effective way to combat obesity, diabetes, and coronary disease is to lead an active lifestyle and to eat a good, nutritious, and balanced diet. With this goal in mind, we have declared 2014 the Year of Healthy Living and Activity. We are organizing events and campaigns throughout the country to promote a healthy lifestyle, and this work will continue into the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is American Hospital's role in Turkey's health sector?<br></h4><p>The hospital is fully owned by the Vehbi Koç Foundation, which was one of the first foundations of the Turkish Republic. Although the American Hospital may be categorized as a private institution, it is unique in terms of its mission. The hospital is the most profitable private sector healthcare institution in Turkey, including all the big name chains. The Koç Group, however, does not benefit at all from this financial success. After allocating funds necessary to maintain the hospital, every penny of profit generated is used to support the Koç University School of Medicine and the new Koç University Health Sciences Campus. Our funds, which today are used mainly for construction and medical infrastructure, will soon be available to further support research. American Hospital has two characteristics that make it special. First is the brand name, which has been extremely strong for several decades. This fact has been further strengthened since 1995, following the hospital's acquisition by the Vehbi Koç Foundation. Another essential characteristic that is unsurpassed by any other hospital in Turkey is the number and quality of our physicians. This is important in a society in which people seek “star physicians" and believe that even their cancer can be cured by a prominent surgeon. We provide a safe and institutionalized environment not only for our patients, but also for our healthcare and support personnel. Another aspect that can be considered atypical about the American Hospital is the fact that it is one of the very few hospitals not to have a business relationship with the government. These factors are reflected in our revenues; 50% derives from individuals, and the remaining 50% from high-end private insurance policies.</p><h4>How will the Koç University Health Sciences Campus assist in improving medical education in Turkey?</h4><p>The campus itself will probably not have an effect on medical education in Turkey, but Koç University School of Medicine may potentially impact how medical schools in Turkey function. Our goal is to educate future leaders of medicine with the highest professional and ethical standards, who knowledgeable in terms of the scientific basis of medicine, and skilled in the prevention and treatment of disease, compassionate with exemplary bedside manners, and committed to a lifetime of learning. We focus on the high academic productivity of our faculty and expect the pursuit of outstanding research, as well as a high faculty-to-medical-student ratio, the early involvement of medical students in research with significant time dedicated to research projects, a flexible and innovative curriculum that is being questioned and revised continuously, and maximizing the use of novel learning methods and simulations, rather than classical didactic classroom teaching. We believe that starting a new medical school from scratch allows out-of-the-box thinking not only for curricular affairs, but also for administrative structuring. Another aspect that is new to the academic medical community in Turkey is the use of the established methods of Koç University for academic evaluation, appointment, promotion, and reappointment of faculty. The introduction of North American standards into medical research and education is unlikely to be achieved by government institutions in Turkey, as their priorities are understandably different. Similarly, the kind of medical education that focuses on research and basic sciences is not the main concern of foundation-based universities in Turkey, as, by definition, it requires a constant influx of funding. Instead, these institutions concentrate on “transferring" high-caliber academic physicians and surgeons that they can benefit from in the private healthcare setting. At this point, Koç University and the Vehbi Koç Foundation have a distinct advantage and unique opportunity toleverage healthcare-generated resources in support of medical education.</p><h4>How has your cancer treatment evolved since the inclusion of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2010?</h4><p>Our Comprehensive Oncology Program is separate from our radiation oncology business within MD Anderson. Until the fall of 2006, the American Hospital lacked radiation oncology because that had been set up in the Italian Hospital in Taksim, Istanbul, together with medical oncology and cancer rehabilitation. Our main decision there was to bring radiation oncology into the hospital so that all lines of service were combined. In those days, the president of MD Anderson had a policy of expanding MD Anderson's services around the world. We were in the process of looking for radiation oncology, they were looking for a partner, and we came together to see if it would work. We agreed that the radiation oncology center would function the way the main center and satellites in Houston do. In their business model, the satellites are connected to the main center through imaging and data sharing resources. The main principle is that any patient who enters any center receives uniform treatment through the use of identical instrumentation technology from physicians, nurses, and technicians trained by MD Anderson. All quality control systems are identical and every patient undergoes a peer review process in terms of the treatment to be received. We treat approximately 300 new patients per year; this is in line with our original feasibility study and both sides are pleased with this relationship. Multi-disciplinary care is much talked about in Turkey, but is usually limited in scope. In addition to all those essential disciplines and figures involved, we add cancer coordinators, nurse navigators, dieticians specialized in cancer care and chemotherapy patients, and psychologists who are dedicated to cancer patients and their families. Furthermore, we have a cancer rehabilitation program linked to this, as well as social workers, and I can say that we are also currently building one of the first and major programs enabling the survivors of cancer to deal with their problems, which has long been neglected in Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“   Our main decision there was to bring radiation oncology into the hospital so that all lines of service were combined.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the concept of nature-based learning?<br></h4><p>The most important thing for Doğa Schools, and all other schools, is education, and having education models that are differentiated from our rivals. One of the most important things for us is our model of education, something that we first discovered in Turkey in 2002, in our first year. We opened that first school in a green, natural area; we were surrounded by nature and trees. We began opening more schools within cities, and, again, they had the same “Doğa" philosophy. We put this mindset into all of our branches. Our students started to grow up and, as the years passed, we grew up as well. Later, we thought about what else we could do for high school education. Doğa Schools' specialty is to be innovative, because innovation is crucial in this business. We began to look for something new to offer high school students. Then, the t-MBA occurred, which is an MBA for teenagers. To create the t-MBA table, we needed legs. One of these legs is student councils, another is foreign languages, and another is international projects and activities. Later, we saw that everybody was very interested in this project and they needed it, truly. When families send their students to our schools, they do so because of our education models and content.</p><h4>What is it about your model that makes it so unique?</h4><p>None of the other schools have a unique education model of their own. In the history of Turkish education, no other unique education models have been developed, neither private nor state; everything is classic. In the morning, students come to school and have their lessons, and in the evening they go back home. If they want to go to a better school, they must do well on government exams. Everybody's success is determined according to these exams, both those of the students and the schools. It is nonsense; this cannot be a determining measurement. For those that do not do well, they cannot enjoy real success in life; there is no true balance because the classical education model is the wrong education model. We have solved this problem in Doğa's schools. Doğa started in 2002 and, until that year, none of the schools had advertisements, PR, brand names, or anything. The private school sector had never been done properly. There were a few schools, and they had students, but it was not a big volume. We created a relationship with our international partners for the first time in Turkey. At the same time, we explained to everybody that this sector is a management sector. And as we grew, we created our rivals. In the end, we have contributed many things to this sector and now we are the leaders. We have 50,000 students currently, and every year we have 20,000-25,000 new registrations. In 2014, we will again be the leaders, and we will have the same number as the other 10 schools. Half of our students will come from state schools, and the other half from private schools.</p><h4>You have one school in Canada and one in Northern Cyprus, but what are your plans to spread Doğa Schools further internationally?</h4><p>We have formed a partnership with a school in Dubai and the area has been designated for the first school. We are also having meetings with in some European countries, but we have more on our plate than just international branches. We created a t-MBA organization with more than 1,000 members, and more than 1,000 schools in the world are implementing this model, from Sierra Leone to Puerto Rico. With this model, Doğa Schools is opening itself up to the world. Schools in Dubai know our model because they are implementing it, so when we go there people will already know us as the ones who created it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As one of the largest airline companies in the world, what are some of the unique opportunities and challenges you find in the Turkish market?<br></h4><p>The Turkish market is booming. There is incoming business that we expect to keep on growing thanks to the government's continued investment in tourism infrastructure, and also due to the fact that Turkey has a wide range of historical sites of interest to visitors, so it offers alternative types of holidays besides the fabulous beach holidays. Turkey is rapidly industrializing, and exports will continue to grow, which means that they will have to send engineers and after-sales services overseas as well. That is another business that we at Lufthansa Turkey are targeting.</p><h4>Germans were the largest single nationality of tourists coming to Turkey in 2013. How is Lufthansa handling this heavy traffic from Germany to Turkey?</h4><p>We work closely with German tour operators that are sending tourists over, and on top of that we are also providing additional capacity during the German high season, with additional flights to Antalya in the summer, for example. In 2014, for the first time, we will also have a weekly flight to Bodrum, as this is one of the most rapidly-developing tourist hubs in Turkey. Flights from Munich to Bodrum will begin in June 2014. Also, we fly directly to Ankara and Izmir, which our central European competitors do not do.</p><h4>Why did you pick Istanbul as your regional headquarters?</h4><p>Istanbul is becoming more of a hub for the region, which is why it is a great place to be located. That being said, Istanbul is a smaller center for us than our main headquarters in the region in Dubai. However, Istanbul is more convenient geographically, as you can get to almost anywhere from there, and it has a high standard of living, as well as a well-educated and skilled citizenry. Many people also speak German, so I think Istanbul has the potential to become an alternative to Dubai. Turkey is also playing a stronger role in the region, which makes it a good place to be.</p><h4>What effects will the third airport in Istanbul have on the aviation sector in Turkey?</h4><p>It should accelerate the development of the aviation sector in Turkey, and also lead to greater growth for domestic Turkish airlines as well. It is definitely needed, and when you plan to build an airport from scratch, you have the chance to connect the airport to the city as efficiently and as beneficially as possible. As an airline, we are of course always looking at the most cost-efficient solutions, and we think this airport can offer a beneficial environment for us, with additional parking options and runway capacity, along with larger terminals.</p><h4>What is your general outlook on the medium-term future of the Turkish aviation sector?</h4><p>It is a growing market, with some great new players that are expanding quickly, airlines such as Pegasus and Atlas. This makes it a challenge for airlines like Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa. There is room for all of us to grow, especially considering the new players in the domestic market. We will also see more and more tourists coming to Turkey, and outgoing tourists will increase as national income grows. We want to grow at least on par with market growth. Our number one position among central European airlines will help us in this endeavor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Currently, less than 1% of Turkey's exports are carried via rail. What potential do you see for rail exports in the medium term?<br></h4><p>Upon the completion of the following planned and ongoing projects, TCDD will be a logistics bridge between Asia and Europe. With the commencement of freight transport on the Marmaray and the finalization of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) project, we intend to carry 6.5 million tons on this line per year. This project will allow for uninterrupted block train transportation between Europe and China through Turkey. The Viking Train is a significant combined transport project between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The Viking Train will provide a connection to the Mediterranean basin, Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia via Turkey. The completion of Nusaybin-Cizre-Silopi-Habur Railway Project, which will provide a connection to Iraq, will considerably increase rail transport toward Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. When the Kars-Nakhchivan-Iran and Van Lake Crossing Projects are realized, there will be a substantial increase in the volume of rail transport toward Iran and the Middle East. A significant amount of rail transportation services will be carried out from Filyos Port, which is planned to be commissioned in 2016 and have a capacity of 25 million tons per year heading toward Russia and European countries. In total, 88 runs, 94% of which account for exports, have been performed on the Samsun-Kavkaz Ferry Line. The Derince-Tekirdağ Rail Ferry Line will make a great contribution to exports by rail to Europe via the Aegean and Marmara regions, and vice versa. Additionally, international rail transport will increase when 19 logistics centers become fully operational and block train transportation is improved.</p><h4>The Minister of Transport has dubbed 2014 the year of high-speed rail. How will 2014 be a milestone year in this regard?</h4><p>In the Investment Program of 2014, TL4 billion has been allocated to our enterprise. As the Minister expressed, high-speed line projects are the leading investments to be made with the funds allocated for the rail sector. Within this scope, the construction of the Eskişehir-Istanbul section of the Ankara-Istanbul High Speed Line Project has been finished and test runs have started. Upon completion of the test runs, Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey's two biggest cities, will be connected by high-speed line this year. The Yerköy-Sivas section of the Ankara-Sivas High Speed Line Project, which constitutes the East-West corridor of our country, is under construction. The tendering processes and construction works are ongoing for the Kayaş-Yerköy, Kayaş-Kırıkkale, and Kırıkkale-Yerköy sections. Upon completion of this project, the travel time between Ankara and Sivas, which is currently 10 hours, will be reduced to two hours, and it will take five hours to travel between Istanbul and Sivas. Works on the Ankara-Izmir High Speed Line, which will decrease travel times between the two cities from 14 hours to 3.5 hours, will continue through 2014. Likewise, the Bursa-Bilecik Rapid Railway Line Project, which will reduce the travel time between Ankara-Bursa and Istanbul-Bursa to 2 hours 15 minutes, and the Konya-Karaman and Sivas-Erzincan Rapid Railway Line Projects, are under construction.</p><h4>How is the TCDD cooperating with international entities to increase the effectiveness of the country's rail network?</h4><p>Our cooperation with the International Union of Railways (UIC), which is the largest organization with around 200 members on five continents aiming to improve the cooperation among railways across the world, is successfully continuing in the fields of high-speed operations, the production of railway vehicles and accessories, security, safety, signalization, and communication technologies. On the other side, TCDD takes part in the activities executed by the Intergovernmental Organization for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF), which intends to create a single legal regime, implement and improve it in the rail transport sector among member states. TCDD participates in activities organized within the scope of the Convention Concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), which was drawn up by OTIF.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for Turkey's retail real estate sector?<br></h4><p>With an unprecedented 3.7 million sqm of shopping center space under construction, Turkey is currently Europe's most dynamic retail market and one of the world's most engaging real estate stories. Turkey was Europe's most active shopping center development market in 2012 and 2013, and is set to take the crown again, beating the likes of Russia, Spain, Ukraine, and Poland. The total size of the retail sector (organized and unorganized) in Turkey reached $320 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow annually by 10% between 2013 and 2017. In 2014, the Turkish shopping center sector represents, over 9.4 million sqm of gross leasable area (GLA), with 332 shopping centers and 1.5 billion visitors per year. Over 3.7 million sqm in GLA is also currently under development. This incredible story has a growing economy at its heat, but it is also a story of entrepreneurship, growth potential, and courage.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of interest in Turkey's real estate sector from foreign investors?</h4><p>From a macro-economic perspective, Turkey has strong fundamentals and a very dynamic outlook to become one of the top 10 economies in the world by 2023. Over the last 10 years, Turkey's government has taken a pro-active and strict stance on its budget deficit. From an unwieldy 11.9% of GDP in 2001, Turkey's budgetary deficit has been reduced to a healthy 1.2% in 2013, and is expected to stay in similar territory over the next five years. Bearing in mind that the Maastricht criterion is 3% of GDP, Turkey is way ahead of most of the European pack. The coming decade will be a very promising and exciting time for the Turkish retail and shopping center sectors as the growing stock of prime offices, quality hotels, and luxury residences help the country attract international firms and visitors. The quality and attractiveness of such assets, and particularly their management, will be key to distinguishing them from their competition.</p><h4>How has í†rium's experience in opening new markets benefited its operations in Turkey?</h4><p>A key factor of our success in Turkey and other markets lies in providing high standards and integrating all the different stages of asset, property, and development management from the bottom to the top, whilst creating high efficiency and, above all, value and results. You can't just be a foreign investor; you have to consider yourself as an active, local player in the country. Key factors of success include being close to the community, customers, and partners, and directly controlling your marketing, leasing, and management teams. Following the fallout from the financial crisis and the debt crunch, our industry has undergone a structural transformation, enabling í†rium to identify clear trends and opportunities in specific markets and sectors, into which we placed all of our efforts and focus. This has resulted in a very successful investment and development strategy over the past 10 years in Western Europe and also emerging and developing markets such as Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey.</p><p>With long-term experience and a proven track record, í†rium is one of the major foreign investors in the Turkish retail sector today. It is a pan-European real estate investment manager specialized in commercial properties with over $8 billion assets under management across 12 countries. When we started to invest in Turkey in 2005, our strategy was to become a long-term investor. We were one of the first global funds to enter the market, investing in the Carrefour malls portfolio as well as in CEFIC, a leader in Turkish property and leasing management activities since 1994, in a joint venture with Simon Property and Ivanhoe. With a team of over 100 people and over $800 million in assets under ownership and over $1 billion under management for third parties, we are one of the leaders of the shopping center sector in Turkey. Over 600,000 sqm of mixed-use projects, representing over $3 billion in asset value, are also under the development process for the next five to seven years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Köksal cater to foreign clients?<br></h4><p>We created our firm specifically for foreign investors, for whom there are multiple conditions to consider when coming to Turkey. More accurately, they face certain obstacles to overcome before they can invest here. The most important of these is finding a quality consulting service. And then there is the language issue. Although most foreign investors conduct their business negotiations and complete their agreements in English, they prefer their own language when it comes to speaking with advisors. Once they are past this first obstacle, they face the problem of finding tax and accounting advisors who speak their language. Investors locate them either through advisors in their home country, through chambers of commerce, or their consulate. It is advantageous if the consultant here also has offices in their country. Either way, it is important for the consultation office to have a solid grasp of foreign languages, which is our specialty. We have an office in Munich, and are in the process of opening one in Berlin. In this manner, German investors can easily access us in their own country, providing an extra level of confidence. A second advantage, in addition to our attorneys being fluent in a foreign language, is that we also place great importance on their being highly educated; most hold Master's degrees. We also support those who pursue their Master's and PhDs while working. Our third advantage is that we provide accounting services and advice, enabling the synchronization of their accounting systems with accounting systems here. We can also act as interim management for a limited period.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current regulatory or legal environment for foreign investors in Turkey?</h4><p>The laws of Turkey are modern laws adapted from other countries. For example, our trade, business, and criminal laws are practically a translation of German laws. When speaking to foreign investors, I give this example, which they like very much; our traffic laws are based on those of Germany, at least on paper. Our laws are fine, and all are modern; however, their implementation can be stressful. We take the traffic laws from Germany, but we apply the traffic patterns of Italy. Meanwhile, we have regulations specifically devised for FDI. Turkey has also signed international agreements, which protects foreign investors. Those familiar with Turkish culture and business practices should not anticipate any issues. Köksal Attorney Partnership is a bridge between foreign investors and Turkey. In general, Turkey's rules of law are in accordance with those of the EU. Investors are often concerned about, or have questions in reference to, legal security. For example, the Title and Trade Registers are very secure.</p><h4>What advice would you give to a foreign investor considering investing in Turkey?</h4><p>First, if they want to work with a Turkish partner, rather than talking business at their first meeting, they should instead have tea. In addition, they should not leave their tea half finished; they should absolutely finish the entire cup. This is more important than it may seem. They should be aware that the results of any discussion not made in the presence of the owner of the company are subject to change. Therefore, there is no need to put anything in writing at the first meeting. If the meetings reach the high-level decision makers, this is an indication that the Turkish partner is serious. From that point on, you can begin talking business. My second recommendation is that all written agreements be completed in both languages. For example, if one party speaks Turkish and the other German, the agreement contract should not be in English. Agreements should always be in their native language. Taking into consideration that Anglo-Saxon law and European law differs, they identify the differences in Anglo-Saxon terms. Turkey is a wide market. There is no doubt that the economy will continue to improve. This is not related to the elections. If investors are careful about these situations, they should not have any issues at the outset. Investors also need to be wary of using tax and legal advisors that are acquainted with the general management of the Turkish firms with whom they are doing business. This way there will be no conflicts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Istanbul as the location for such an innovative project?<br></h4><p>We were looking for a country that lacked specialized children's hospitals, and that had a young population, a relatively high GDP, economic stability, and the opportunity to enter into a joint venture with a government or a government-related agency. There were few countries in emerging markets that ticked all of those boxes. Turkey was, therefore, the best choice, as it has a government that intends to implement healthcare reforms, and one that is keen to bring in cutting-edge technology through foreign groups and to amend legislation where required. We submitted the project to the Housing Development Administration (TOKİ), which engages in massive towers and large-scale social housing projects. We wanted to further engage TOKİ in smart and aesthetically beautiful constructions. For our project, we needed 2 million sqm of land; TOKİ had to make deals with many small owners and swap land with them. Once we had all of these elements aligned, we went to the international markets to raise funds. Our aim is to make Bio Istanbul the showcase of a typical smart city of high international standards. To summarize our vision, go to a campus in Cambridge, Harvard, or somewhere in Switzerland; you have a university, sometimes a hospital, students, and research facilities—it is a vibrant community. Then you add another layer to it, namely real housing for a real community, and through this you create a city where people can actually live, go out, eat, and spend their weekends. We provide leisure facilities, as well as such amenities as restaurants, hairdressers, a butcher, a bank, and a spa; in short a full range of services. In addition, ecological sustainability and technology are crucial elements in our design. It costs a lot less to design and make a smart building from scratch than to transform an existing one. We source all our materials locally in order to minimize the waste and cost of transport.</p><h4>How will the children's hospital and research center change the health sector in Turkey?</h4><p>There are no specialized children's hospitals in the country. There are general children's hospitals and there are specialized units for children in other hospitals. It will cater to the more complicated cases and serious diseases. It is going to be dedicated to the comfort of children because parents will be able to stay close to them. We believe that it is better for children to recuperate in the natural environment of a science park amid nature, as opposed to being in the middle of the city with its noise and pollution. Our international affiliations will be an important element of the hospital; exchanging students and doctors and applying certain new procedures and manuals will affect the sector profoundly. Ours will be a teaching hospital with teaching and research units, with the hospital being separate from the research center; researchers will be invited from abroad to train their local counterparts. What is most important is how you update your functional program based on new discoveries and methods of treatment, mainly stemming from the US. There is a large Turkish diaspora with researchers and medical doctors throughout Europe and the US.</p><h4>How do you plan to encourage their return?</h4><p>People will return if the right infrastructure is in place. Government backing and a strong academic framework will allow people to keep doing research and work on serious, complicated cases. Integration with international universities and the unhindered transferal of credits will be another important attraction. The quality of doctors and researchers you attract is determined by the funding available for research, infrastructure, the projects themselves, the availability of government support, and a long-term vision. These professionals need to be sure that if they undertake serious research, it will at least see initial clinical trials. And this is the challenge Bio Istanbul is trying to address, because we are privileged in having firm relations with the government. We would like foreign nationals to come, but our main objective is to reverse the tide of departed nationals. This cannot be achieved on a promise alone.</p><div class="quote">“Government backing and a strong academic framework will allow people to keep doing research and work on serious, complicated cases. "</div><h4>What is your schedule, and what is the future of Istanbul after bio-cities?</h4><p>Overall, 2014 is set to be a very exciting one as all designs and the planning phase itself will have been completed, which means it will be time for the ground breaking. We will have completed work on the first residences and the hospital by the end of the year. Ours is a massive project, which we have divided into three phases. We also have three steps to the initial phase because we cannot source $1 billion at one time. The project will include approximately 650 units, the first phase of the hospital, a number of innovation campus buildings, and some of the retail and lifestyle components; it will become a livable space by the end of 2015. That is our plan for Turkey, but the remaining phases will unfold until 2020. We are four years into the project and have seven to go. We are also targeting Saudi Arabia, which has great potential, along with China.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you become one of the main players in the insurance sector here in Oman?</h4><p>Obviously, the main insurance products that are being sold are similar in nature. Therefore, what sets each company apart is the way you provide your services and the way the client sees you. Over the last three years, which is what we have been focusing on, I am happy to say that there has been quite a turnaround and the company has grown. We have managed to take a lot of corrective measures in the company. From a loss-making entity in 2011, we are now very profitable and all the past losses have been wiped out. Falcon Insurance is now joining the big-league players.</p><h4>What is the composition of your portfolio?</h4><p>Like all insurance companies, motor is the single largest portfolio. If you look at our target for 2014, around 38% of our projected premiums are from motor, while another 18%-20% are from the life and medical areas. Almost the same again, 16%-18%, are derived from property and energy. The engineering class forms about 8%-10%, and the rest is marine, liabilities, and others, which makes up the balance. Our major thrust has always been SMEs. We are a small-to-medium size insurance company, meaning we aim to insure SMEs. We prefer that we service clients across all their insurance requirements, from motor to medical, to group, life, and property. That is how we try to sell; in large portfolios. We are also expanding equally into the retail segment, which, until now, has not been a main thrust. Our major portfolio business is still corporate. Falcon Insurance currently only has three branches; however, we are looking to expand to one or two more and add on some alternative channels of business to improve the company.</p><div class="quote">“By nature, the insuring public here is quite price sensitive, which keeps up pressure on insurance premium levels."</div><h4>With 22 companies present in a market of less than 3 million people, the Omani insurance market is totally beyond saturation. How do you respond to the high levels of competition in the market?</h4><p>The market is extremely overcrowded with players, not only for insurance companies, but also for brokers. This makes it a very competitive market. By nature, the insuring public here is quite price sensitive, which keeps up pressure on insurance premium levels, which is not very healthy for the insurance market. This becomes starkly visible during years when the investment market performs poorly. When the investment market performs well, companies get good investment returns, which camouflages the negative results of their insurance operations. In the years that there is a negative investment market, the problems become more obvious. The last two years have been reasonably good for both segments. Motor is a business that is on the balance sheet of almost all the companies, meaning the impact of losses hits them much more than the other segments. In 4Q2013, we signed an agreement with Bank Muscat to provide life coverage for all the individual borrowers of the bank. This is a massive policy in terms of size, meaning that was a major win for us. In the 15-20 years prior to that, there was only one insurance company to achieve this. We are a major player in the life market, and this is clearly reflective of the fact that the market is now recognizing Falcon as an equally able provider. Fortunately or unfortunately, we ended up having to pay the biggest banking sector claim. Again, the professionalism of Falcon Insurance and the auditing reinsurance behind it has led this claim to be fully settled. The market is very appreciative of the fact that this was done in such a short time. It was almost a $38 million claim, and was fully settled within a few months.</p><h4>How is takaful changing the share of the business in this market?</h4><p>It hasn't changed anything as of now. The decision to allow takaful came in 2012. Al Madina Insurance was set up with the underlying principles of takaful and, as such, it was always ready. When the decision to allow takaful came, it wanted to convert its business. As of January 2014, it formally converted into a takaful company. Therefore, there is only one company operating in the takaful market. The second company is a company called Takaful Oman, which has launched an IPO. The company is in existence; however, it hasn't quite started operations yet. How much of an impact it is going to have remains to be seen, but like any other new insurance company, it is going to eat into the existing market. If somebody told me that Islamic-based insurance is available, and now that Islamic insurance companies are in operation, there is going to be new business, I would be quite skeptical. People simply move from conventional to takaful. And usually, they move because they find it cheaper.</p><h4>What has to be done to increase insurance penetration in the country?</h4><p>Like all countries in the region, Oman has a very low insurance penetration rate. As a percentage of GDP, it is very small. From that much, if you remove the refineries and big spenders, what remains is very little. Actually, personal insurance is negligible. Awareness is slowly increasing from the Insurance Association, which is still quite new. In the last two or three years, we have seen a slight improvement in minimum salary levels. People are slowly picking up on the plus points of savings-based insurance, such as life and saving for children's education. Probably in five to eight years' time, we will see a fairly big jump in these kinds of insurance. In terms of medical insurance, as of now, a substantial portion (over 90%) of insurance is for medical coverage for corporates, for their employees and their dependents. Insurance taken by the families themselves is not really happening. Some professionals do this, but it is still very few. As has happened in Dubai and Bahrain, maybe the government will slowly move toward compulsory insurance, at least for expatriates. That would create an upsurge in the buying of medical insurance. With regard to the other standard motor, property, and so on, it will just follow the general economic improvement of 3%-5% growth. Medical savings-based life policies will see a much faster growth over the years as the economy grows and salary levels go up.</p><h4>How would you rate the Omani insurance regulation compliance compared to other countries in the GCC?</h4><p>Oman has a very high level of regulatory framework. Corporate governance is insisted on by the regulators, fairly stiffly. In fact, it is insisted on so much so that sometimes companies feel that they are over regulated. In the last five to eight years, the regulator has become more active, and it is getting involved in studying companies, warning them, and guiding them. It has a larger team now, too, than in the 1990s. Now, the insurance regulating department is about 30-40 people. In 2014, it got an international firm to helping study and comment actuarially on the life side operations of all the companies. It is very active.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Noor Bank is regarded as an icon in the region in terms of innovation and quality of service. In light of your recent rebranding campaign, what have been your milestones over the past year?</h4><p>Noor Bank has now recorded three consecutive years of profitability. As we continue to recover, along with other banks, from the effects of the 2009 financial crash, we see significant growth across all sectors of our business. At the same time, we are delivering increased efficiencies, by innovating our business model, whilst remaining focused on the fundamentals of capital and liquidity management. In the past 12 months we have launched two new businesses: Noor Trade, which has a focus on the important SME sector, and Noor Home, which will provide home finance for the growing number of residents and overseas buyers wanting to own a home in Dubai. Other similar initiatives are in the pipeline. We also continue to roll out our digital platforms, which are increasingly popular with customers who want the convenience of banking when and where they wish. In addition, at the start of 2014, we unveiled our new brand identity, which is reflected right across our businesses. The rebranding has given us a fresh perspective, the simplicity of which appeals to existing and potential customers, especially among the younger generation. The new brand will also make it easier for us to expand into other markets.</p><h4>How is your portfolio evolving and which segments will you be focusing on?</h4><p>Our asset base has grown from AED18 billion to AED25 billion over recent years. Our processes are maturing and our customer base is maturing with us. Our customers have stayed with us for a long time, and our relationship with them is reflected in our strong customer retention rates, our robust growth, increasing profitability, and the diversity of the organization. We have developed a new focus on the SME sector under Noor Trade. We have also introduced Noor Home, and we have plans to launch other segment-specific initiatives in the future.</p><h4>What role will Noor Bank play in Expo 2020?</h4><p>Noor Bank is ready and willing to help fund the large infrastructure development that will be necessary in the run up to Expo 2020. We have the liquidity and we have significant experience in funding large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Bluewater project that will feature Dubai's answer to the London Eye and the Singapore Flyer Ferris wheels. We also have experience of funding large-scale real estate projects. So, I believe, we are well positioned to play a large role in preparing Dubai to host Expo 2020.</p><h4>What is your opinion of Dubai becoming a global Islamic finance capital and how do you see Noor Bank helping Dubai achieve this goal?</h4><p>Dubai is the natural home for the Capital of the Islamic Economy initiative, which is the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. It is the birthplace of Islamic finance as we know it today. The first Islamic bank was established here. And much of the innovation in Islamic finance is being driven by the country's Islamic banks, including ourselves. But the Islamic economy is not just about finance. It is first and foremost about trade, particularly intra-OIC member state trade, which today is minimal. Dubai is ideally situated to bridge the gap between the Islamic economies of the East and the conventional economies of the West. No other city in the Middle East has the logistics infrastructure and connectivity, by air, sea, and land, that Dubai has. And its business friendly environment, coupled with its strong commercial legal framework, makes it very attractive to FDI. Businesses want to come to Dubai because it is a secure and profitable place to do business, and they see the huge growth opportunities it provides access to, including the Islamic economy.</p><div class="quote">“Noor Bank is ready and willing to help fund the large infrastructure development that will be necessary in the run up to Expo 2020."</div><h4>From a regulatory point of view, what can be done to further accelerate the development of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>There is still much work to be done. The issue of standards is quite broad and complex. There always have been, and always will be, differences of opinion between sects and between schools of scholars. What is needed is a minimum agreement on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. The industry needs to drive this and not leave it to the regulators. I have said before that it is the industry's responsibility to challenge the regulators, whoever they may be, with new thinking, new ideas, and new products. This is as true at the local and regional level as it is at the global level. An agreement on acceptable standards would leave room for different schools of thought to add their own twist on them. I believe this is a realistic approach and one that is achievable.</p><h4>Is there a need to educate people in terms of the peculiarities and benefits of Islamic finance?</h4><p>Yes, there is a real need to educate people about Islamic finance, from an ethical perspective, and about specific products and services. Even amongst Muslims there is confusion about the differences between Islamic finance and conventional finance. In the wake of the banking scandals that have plagued conventional banks, people are demanding a better way of banking. Islamic finance can meet that need. But in order to do so, as an industry we need to address two challenges. The first is the lack of Islamic banking skills within the industry. Many of the people in Islamic banking have come from a conventional banking background. The industry needs to provide these people with the knowledge and understanding that would enable them to sell Islamic banking to the world. And, that leads directly to the second challenge. How do we make people aware that Islamic banking offers a better way to bank? The industry, as a whole, is fragmented. There is no global body to regulate, or promote, Islamic banking. Such a body would be a major step forward for the industry. Why can't we have a World Islamic Bank charged with taking Islamic banking to the world? Such an organization would provide a badly needed focal point for the industry and be a catalyst for the change that is needed to make Islamic finance a realistic alternative to conventional finance.</p><h4>Noor is becoming a point of reference in terms of e-banking and the technology associated with it. How are you developing technology associated with the modern way of doing banking?</h4><p>If Islamic banks are to compete with conventional banks, the industry must embrace the latest technology, which can deliver efficiencies of cost and service. I believe the industry is beginning to recognize and understand this. But there is another dynamic at play, which makes it imperative that all banks, not just Islamic banks, embrace technology. The next generation of customers has grown up with computers, tablets, and smart phones. They socialize, shop, and entertain themselves online. It is natural that they expect banks to offer mobile and online banking services, from opening a bank account to managing complex financial needs. I foresee a time, in the not too distant future, when the traditional bank branch is a thing of the past, replaced by the bank branch in your hand, or on your desk, at home, or in the coffee shop. That is why we prefer to invest in the latest technology, rather than bricks and mortar. Our spending on online and mobile banking services has increased substantially over the last two or three years. This is part of a deliberate and planned digitization of all our services. Yes, it is a work in progress, but I believe we are a leader in the field of e-banking.</p><h4>What major plans do you have for Noor Bank in 2014, 2015, and beyond?</h4><p>I do not believe in changing things for the sake of change. So we will continue to focus on the fundamentals and go where the business is, including actively seeking new opportunities in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and Turkey. At home a key focus will be on strengthening the bank's foundations by diversifying revenue streams and client base. I also expect everyone at the bank to deliver on our customer-centric values and create and implement innovative solutions to meet customer needs. We will also support Dubai's and the UAE's economic interests as an emerging global trade and logistics hub.</p><h4>How is your expansion into Turkey developing?</h4><p>We continue to be the largest provider, from the UAE, of multi-currency, Islamic syndication, and capital markets solutions to Turkish institutions. In 2013 alone, we successfully executed more than $1.8 billion of Islamic syndications, sukuk, and capital market mandates to various clients in Turkey. We enjoy excellent relationships with Turkey's participation banks and have built up significant expertise in leading and arranging cross-border, multi-currency financing mandates. Turkey is, and will continue to be, an important international market for us. As the Turkish economy grows and the demand for corporate funding increases, I am confident Noor Bank will expand its footprint in Turkey.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Suriname holds the pro tempore presidency of UNASUR for the 2013-2014 period. Which of UNASUR's objectives have you made your priorities?</h4><p>Having been isolated on the continent over the past 400 years because of our colonial history, being a member of UNASUR today means that we are working tirelessly to integrate into the South American community in all sectors, and thereby contributing to the strengthening of its unity. During our pro tempore presidency we continue to encounter challenges in the process of unification. As an organization we try to overcome these by focusing on democratic principles and a shared vision about our joined future, through dialogue. This demonstrates the level of maturity of the integration process. At every UNASUR meeting, it is noticeable how all heads of state are permeated with the significance of their mission. And I am so proud that Suriname was able to not only chair the organization, but also share some of its virtues with the rest of the continent. UNASUR is a young organization and I see a lot of similarity associated with the stages of development present in our own young country. At this stage it is necessary to reach higher levels of coherence, as well as greater political convergence, in order to build our path to sustainable development in harmony with mother nature. Among the strategies we are implementing are a renewed vision on the use of natural resources, the strengthening of our democracies, and the establishment of South America as a nuclear weapons-free zone. Suriname offers the world a unique example of how a multicultural people can live in harmony, by unifying around common interests and adhering to tolerance toward each other's differences. I also remain committed to my views as expressed at the last CELAC Summit, namely that inclusive and equitable social and human development is pivotal for the whole of our region in order to eradicate poverty and to overcome inequalities. Therefore, the issues pertaining to culture, social development, and inclusion, as well as health issues have been high on the agenda of my presidency. One of the goals of UNASUR that I am passionate about is achieving stronger participation from young people. After all, our generation is taking decisions today that will for a large part shape our youth's perspective for tomorrow. I strongly believe it is a logical step to involve our youth in the South American integration process, so that they may start building their own future. We are therefore very pleased with the First UNASUR High Level Youth Exchange, held in Paramaribo in November 2013, in which both CARICOM and UNASUR youth leaders participated. It is necessary that we continue to take new initiatives that promote the interaction and cooperation between our peoples. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is an ongoing process of shared responsibility, whereby success will always be the result of the shared commitment and input of all member states.</p><h4>Colombia was chosen to head the South American Defense Council (CSD) with Suriname as co-chair for one year. What is the importance of this collaboration between Colombia and Suriname?</h4><p>Cooperation among UNASUR member states is further implemented through councils. For the first time in the history of the union, Suriname and Colombia hold the chairmanship of the UNASUR Defense Council simultaneously. One of the key issues that the co-chairs have focused on is the protection of natural resources. It is widely known that the South American continent harbors a vast amount of the world's natural resources. UNASUR has a clear vision about utilizing its natural resources for the wellbeing and welfare of its peoples and the achievement of national development goals. The co-chairmanship of the Defense Council with Colombia has proven useful already. Through the process of consultation required on a constant basis, which results in frequent communication on a wide range of issues and the sharing of knowledge, more information about Colombia now exists. Insight into the interests and circumstances that are underlying Colombia's policies is aiding to increase the collaboration between the two nations in other sectors as well, such as health, energy, and finance. The cooperation between Suriname and Colombia within the Defense Council is conducted on the basis of complete parity. As co-chairs, both Ministers of Defense chair the meetings and are very much aligned. It is inspiring and revealing to observe that two countries with such disparities in their histories of national defense—and subsequently, different national security needs—have been able to apply themselves in such a way so as to support and achieve a common security policy for the region. Meetings at the technical level have been concluded, and it is expected that proposals with regard to the protection of natural resources and cyber crime will be presented at the ministerial level by the end of this year.</p><h4>During the first CELAC-EU summit, held in Chile in 2013, Suriname's Minister of Foreign Affairs thanked Colombia for the technical assistance offered for training in the Spanish language for Surinamese officials. Why is this project relevant to Suriname?</h4><p>Our native language is Dutch, with English as a second language. Anticipating our chairmanship of UNASUR as of August 30, 2013, and with a view to the strengthening of our South American relations, the training of government officials in the Spanish language was of practical importance to encourage smooth communications between Suriname and our sister nations. Suriname gratefully accepted the offer of the Directorate of Culture of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia to appoint the Centro de Espanol para Extranjeros of the Universidad Externado de Colombia to develop and teach a special Spanish language course for Suriname. Subsequently, five Spanish language professors were dispatched to Suriname, who were able to train 123 participants. Because of the success of these courses, we are now, together with Colombia, working toward follow-up training. I was delighted, also, to learn that the classes have stirred general interest in the Spanish language in our country so much so that my government is currently researching the feasibility of reintroducing Spanish language classes in our primary schools.</p><h4>At the same meeting, the governments of Colombia and Suriname also spoke about the common interest in connecting both countries by air. How is Suriname advancing toward better air links with its Latin American partners, and with Colombia in particular?</h4><p>Improved air connectivity is of utmost importance to our growing economy. In 2010, Suriname deliberately chose to no longer focus on two singular destinations due North, but to broaden its horizon both politically and geographically. We started by increasing our existing connections with direct flights to Belem, Miami, Cayenne, and (via Georgetown) New York over the last two years. In addition, Suriname has embarked upon creating better connections with Latin America by presenting draft Air Transport Agreements to Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela; negotiations with Ecuador and Chile are well underway. Given the importance of improved connectivity for its integration in the Latin American region, Suriname is doing its utmost to secure the signing of the final version of an Air Transport Agreement with Colombia in 2014. In the meantime, our own International Johan Adolf Pengel Airport is undergoing reconstruction to increase services to the traveling public. The first phase, constructing a new arrivals terminal, is already finalized and the departures terminal will be next.</p><div class="quote">“At every UNASUR meeting, it is noticeable how all heads of state are permeated with the significance of their mission."</div><h4>Why is Suriname an attractive destination for Colombian investment, and where would you like to see stronger collaboration between both countries?</h4><p>Suriname is strongly focused on both diversifying and balancing its economy. The country is known for its abundance of natural resources, and now that we are truly providing for ourselves, we are striving for a more balanced economy with the objective to attain greater sustainability in our development. Suriname is also the guardian of some of the purest parts of the Amazonian rainforest, earning us the title “the greenest country on Earth." That is something to treasure, both for our peoples and the world. It plays an important role in our investment policies through which we want to meet the needs of all segments of our population, undertake an accelerated exploitation of some of our non-renewable resources, and fulfill our duty toward preserving healthy ecosystems. Balancing these three objectives will be key. Recently, we have registered some interesting developments in our private sector regarding Colombian investors. A Colombian cement production company has invested in a joint project in Suriname and is now producing quality cement for our booming housing sector. Also, the State Oil Company is on the brink of cooperating with Ecopetrol to explore and exploit oil, one of the main commodities of our economy. In addition, we are striving to become a hub for the region, both through our air and sea connections. Noteworthy is that after major investments by Dubai's DP World, Paramaribo's port actually won the CSA Port Award three times in a row. In short, at this stage Suriname is intentionally investing in the extractive industries in order to gain returns that can be invested in the more sustainable sectors like agriculture, tourism, and services.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-the-beginning]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Compañí­a Internacional de Seguros is the oldest insurance company in Central America. What role has the company played in shaping the sector?</h4><p>We're very proud to be the oldest insurance company in Panama. It was founded by the same people who fought for the separation of Panama from Colombia. Therefore, the founders of the company were the founding fathers of our nation and members of Panama's first cabinet. Thus, our history is intertwined with the history of the country itself. We were the only insurance company in operation when the Panama Canal was being built, and for more than a century we have had an intimate relationship with the country and its economy, having survived two world wars, an economic depression, and the burning down of the city of Colon, after which, being the only insurance company, we paid for most of the damage on private property so as to enable businessmen to resume operations. So we're proud to say that we're not only the oldest company in Panama, but also the most quintessentially Panamanian company. To this day we have been completely independent and have never been part of any global enterprise. Our stockholders are now the third generation of the company founders. We truly believe in Panama and in our economy, and feel a strong sense of pride in being a Panamanian company providing services to Panamanian businessmen. The company name does include the word “international," which may seem ironic, but the founding fathers had the vision back in 1910 that the company would ultimately unite and serve not just Panamanians, but people from the US, the Caribbean islands, and Africa. Most people in Panama at that time were Colombians. So originally, this insurance company would undertake business that wouldn't be limited to Panama, but would also be connected to the wider world. Up to this day we've only had operations in Panama. We have realized business beyond Panama as well, but in the capacity as partners of other insurance companies in Central America, Ecuador, and Argentina.</p><h4>The company provides a wide range of services in both its personal and business lines. What are your most in-demand products and how has your portfolio evolved over the last decade?</h4><p>We cover property, casualty, bonding, auto, life, and health. We believe in every line of business, and that's why we rank among the top four in every line of business in Panama among 33 companies. We view each line as a profit center, and believe that each plays its own role in the economy. We therefore make sure that every line of business has what it takes to be aggressive in the market, while at the same time being profitable. The largest line of business in Panama has traditionally been auto, which is the case for us, too. However, our health portfolio has, over the past eight years, gone from being our fourth line of business to the second biggest as of last year, just behind auto. We also decided to join forces with Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is an umbrella association of independent insurance companies, and created what is called the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Panama. All our health products are now marketed under the name of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Panama. This has given us great public acceptance, not only because Internacional de Seguros is behind it, but also because Internacional de Seguros Blue Cross and Blue Shield cardholders can enter any of the million health service providers in the US and be treated as a local patient, be it in a hospital, clinic, or at a doctor's surgery. So wherever you are in the US, the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield take care of everything, after which we reimburse the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Panama is a country with a very close relationship with the US, and many Panamanians travel there regularly.</p><h4>How important are reinsurance services for your business activities?</h4><p>This is a vital part of our business. We're continuously taking risk from all our insurers. So in order for us to survive in the long term, especially where natural disasters are concerned, we cannot retain all the risk. In the event of a massive earthquake or flood, for example, the cost would be prohibitive. Therefore, property insurance companies opt for reinsurance when it comes to catastrophic losses. Our company is big enough to retain our normal day-to-day coverage without the need for reinsurance. We have a $140 million capital base that provides us with enough financial strength to cover our losses. Yet large losses as a result of natural disasters require reinsurance. That's what gives us the stability to be able to survive as a business and take on massive claims, as we had to in Colon in 2013.</p><div class="quote">“We believe in every line of business, and that's why we rank among the top four in every line."</div><h4>How would you describe your financial performance in 2013, and what are your expectations for next year?</h4><p>Our performance in 2013 was extraordinary, as we broke records not only in sales, but also in profits. We were the first and only company in Central America to write over $200 million worth of direct premiums, and we've been the number one in the Panamanian insurance sector for the past five years, excepting 2013.</p><h4>Last year your company received an A rating from AM Best. What significance does this have for you?</h4><p>We're very proud indeed, as AM Best exclusively covers the insurance sector, rating, and classifying companies according to international standards. Other ratings agencies merely compare you to your national peers. The A rating is the highest ever given to a Latin American company, and while a few others also have it, no other Latin American company has received a rating above A, namely A+. We received this rating for our financial strength and consistently strong results over the years.</p><h4>You have been at the helm of the company since 2005. What have been your most memorable achievements over the past decade?</h4><p>We went from being the third largest insurance company in the market to becoming the market leaders. That is the main accomplishment and speaks for itself. That being said, we owe much of that to our excellent team of brokers. Over 95% of sales in Panama are done through brokers. We provide them with all the tools they need, investing much time, effort, and technology, and providing them with the greatest accessibility of any company, with 24/7 web, and increasingly, smartphone access.</p><h4>Internacional de Seguros is strongly committed to the development of the communities in which it is present, as in Los Pueblos. How important is corporate social responsibility for your company?</h4><p>Being a local company with a history so intertwined with that of Panama, nobody values this as much as we do. Each of our branches has the freedom to undertake work and support initiatives that they feel the community requires. Los Pueblos, in the eastern part of the city, is a good example, where we stage Christmas activities for the disadvantaged. Our branch in Chorrera has also adopted a school, which we visit every year. Last year we rebuilt the canteen, and the previous year we provided their kitchen, raising the roof to provide greater ventilation. Year after year we undertake different activities depending on the needs of the school and the local community. We have also sponsored the rebuilding of historic quarters in Panama, including the reconstruction of two historical buildings, one a fully functional house that was burned down by the pirate Henry Morgan, and the other a building that will become an interactive museum. So for us, social responsibility is the reason we're here. Our responsibility is not only to our stockholders, but also to the community, the country, those who pay the premiums, pay our salaries, and make us a success story.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations as you celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The Turkish people have made every effort to strike a good balance between history and the challenges of modernization, while valuing their traditions. We who come from a country with long-established traditions on the eastern edge of Asia understand well the great efforts of you who stand at the western edge. May Turkey and its people enjoy everlasting greatness and good fortune.<br></p><p>Today, on this propitious day marking the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Republic, you have finally realized the dream of a century and a half of connecting by railway the strait that separates Asia and Europe, a dream that you have held on to steadfastly since the first plans were drawn up in 1860. I really wish to congratulate you heartily on achieving this. When I met Prime Minister Erdoğan in May 2013, Tokyo and Istanbul were vying with each other to host the Olympic Games. At that time, we promised each other that no matter which side was victorious, we would be the first to congratulate the winning side.</p><p>On September 7, 2013, in Buenos Aires, when the decision was made for Tokyo to host the Games, Prime Minister Erdoğan came straight to me before anyone else with a congratulatory embrace. I was profoundly impressed by the courage and friendship he demonstrated at that time. It is now my turn to congratulate you, Mr. Erdoğan. In May of 2013, he leaned forward and told me how important the Marmaray Project was and what a long-cherished wish its completion has been for Turkey. He urged me to come to the opening ceremony, and I consider it an honor to be able to fulfill the promise I made to Prime Minister Erdoğan.</p><p>I understand that there is not a single precedent anywhere of constructing an immersed tube tunnel at a depth of approximately 60 meters. I have also heard that even the experts had said that construction would be “close to impossible" due to the strong currents affecting water flow, depending on the depth of the water.</p><p>A man named Mr. Fumio Koyama of the Taisei Corporation is one of the people who directed the construction of the tunnel. When asked what the secret for success was, despite these hurdles, he answered, “Never giving up." He said, “Our staunch determination was both the first step and the last step toward our success." I think Mr. Koyama's words really say it all about how difficult the construction has been.</p><p>For Turkey and Japan, and all those who have been involved in this construction project, the world is applauding your creation. I would like to express my appreciation once more for Turkey selecting Japan and Japanese companies to be its partner in this historic major undertaking that will be passed down over the generations and remain on the map forevermore.</p><p>Let us next share a dream in which Shinkansen “bullet trains" depart Tokyo for Istanbul and connect Istanbul to London. Turkey, which has now achieved a robust economy, and Japan are partners in the G20. In May of 2013, our two countries pledged as strategic partners to deepen our dialogue, and of course our diplomatic cooperation, but also in security and economic matters, and to work together for the sake of the world. Turkey and Japan, which are working to bring peace and stability to the world, are the two wings that support the vastness of Asia from East and West. This image has recurred to me time and again as I set foot in the great city of Istanbul that connects East and West on this day on which you have realized the dream held for 150 years.</p><p>Bringing peace to Asia, as well as prosperity. Turkey and Japan are the two wings that will make Asia soar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KlimaPlus was recently acquired by Mitsubishi Electric. What were the main factors behind this decision?<br></h4><p>KlimaPlus was established in 2004 as the Mitsubishi Electric distributor in Turkey, and I have represented Mitsubishi Electric as distributor from the outset. In our partnership, I am both the General Manager and a Partner. As Mitsubishi Electric developed, additional business lines were added. In 2012, Mitsubishi Electric decided to increase its growth, support, and investment in Turkey, opening offices here. Other enterprises include satellite R&amp;D—Turkey's first satellite was recently launched. Additionally, Mitsubishi Electric has become a solution partner on the Marmaray Project, which is the world's deepest undersea tunnel, and has seen the acquisition of an industrial automation systems business. Mitsubishi Electric opted to include us in its expansion plans and offered to purchase us. The process should be completed shortly, whereby KlimaPlus will continue as Mitsubishi Electric Turkey Corporation.</p><h4>How will your business activities change after going from being the exclusive distributor of Mitsubishi Electric to being owned by the company?</h4><p>The influence you yield in the competitive arena is very different when you are the manufacturer, rather than the distributor. It allows you greater proximity to the market to better identify its needs. Turkey works in conjunction with the energy regulation standards of the EU. We present many goods identical to those of Europe. In a land where Western and Eastern cultures intersect, there are at times variances in needs. Behind us is Eastern culture and before us, the direction we are facing, is Western culture. There is a difference between Japanese and European products, even between Chinese and Indian products, because the needs and lifestyle of different regions can vary. In order to better understand market needs and develop products accordingly, Mitsubishi Electric recognized the potential of moving forward arm in arm with us.</p><h4>As the regulations for energy efficiency in this country incorporate those of the EU, how do you see this affecting the market domestically?</h4><p>Currently, Turkey's energy consumption system is not completely on par with European standards. At Mitsubishi Electric, we have already applied seasonal efficiency criteria and implemented them in our air-conditioning units. The energy efficiency of appliances is rated in terms of a set of energy efficiency classes, from A to F, with Class A being the most efficient, and Class F the least. A decade ago, goods that were at much lower energy efficiency levels, some even in the E, F, and even G Class, were being sold. When we started operations, R-22 gas and other gases harmful to the ozone layer were still in use. Around the same time, we penetrated the market with our products, which were produced with ozone friendly R-410 gas at a higher quality. At the time, local manufacturers and most competitors continued to manufacture and sell products that contained R-22 gas, and about 98% of the market was operating at that level. We realized that our preferred path was developing faster. The importation of R-22 for use in consumer goods was subsequently banned. The proportion of Class-A goods increased, and inverter air conditioners became more popular. This entire structure is evolving; soon the minimum energy efficiency performance will be Class A. In many ways, A+, A++, and A+++, will be the new standards, with A+++ being the most energy efficient. Income levels are a factor in this. Incomes in Turkey are increasing, as are investments. Turkey has a young population, the average employee age at our company is 30 years of age, and consequently our environmental awareness is high.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within the past four years, bilateral trade between the US and Turkey has surpassed $20 billion. How would you assess the current state of US-Turkish commercial relations?<br></h4><p>What you described in terms of volume is fairly accurate, except that it hasn't increased in the past year. US exports to Turkey were flat, while Turkish exports to the US grew. These numbers are acceptable, but if you look at the total trade volume in the US and that of Turkey, these are tiny fractions of what they ought to be between the world's number one and 16th largest economies. My message to US and Turkish traders is to look more carefully and more seriously at the opportunities that are not being prioritized in both countries with respect to the products and trade in which people are interested. Americans and Turks have not found each other in terms of available trade in the same way that Europe has with Turkey. There is still a substantial educational effort required, which is why such things as the NASDAQ deal with Borsa İstanbul are important, as this creates opportunities for Turkish business.</p><h4>Which sectors have the greatest potential for growth between the US and Turkey?</h4><p>I believe that Turkey remains extremely competitive in a high quality, high-end textile industry, where it has the skills, the production capability, and the design instincts to compete better globally. The entire IT industry and various IT partnerships have enormous potential here. Unfortunately, Turkey continues to be looked upon as an inferior country for technology, which is simply not the case. You have probably seen that Turkey has invested heavily into the FATİH Project, an educational scheme to provide school children with tablets for enhanced education, and American industry has been interested in this.</p><h4>On the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), would it benefit the US and Turkey should the former be included?</h4><p>On the contrary, there is a risk that this would penalize trade between the Turkey and the US because of the way the Customs Agreement with the EU is structured. The US would reap all of the benefits and privileges to result from the agreement between the US and the EU. We need to be alert about the potentially negative consequences for bilateral trade and do our best to see that this does not occur. Turkey pressed hard when the Prime Minister was in Washington, DC in May 2013 for parallel negotiations to be undertaken, but in the end they did not agree on this.</p><h4>There has been extensive cooperation between the US and Turkish defense sectors. How would you now assess the level of cooperation?</h4><p>Cooperation is good; there is a broader understanding of the benefits and partnership between the two industries. A significant change here has occurred on both sides, and part of this is the substantially increasing capabilities of the Turkish defense industry. By mid-2014, we will finally see the completion of a deal with Sikorsky. This helicopter would be built for Turkish consumption, but also for third-country sales. There is a substantial component not just for this helicopter, but also for all of Sikorsky's helicopters, made by Alp Aviation in Eskişehir. Meanwhile, there is a solid record of jet engine production and maintenance capabilities through General Electric's partnership with TEI in Eskişehir. In 2013, I was disappointed by the government's decision to opt for a Chinese air defense system, for which it is currently engaged in negotiations. From my perspective, there is no doubt about the net consequences for Turkish industry changing from US partners to Chinese partners, but they made that choice themselves.</p><h4>For 2014, what do you hope to achieve on the Council?</h4><p>We are a membership business organization and promote broader relations between Turkey and the US. We pay much attention to political and economic developments and the national security dimension. We need, right now, to protect the relationship so that somewhere down the road we can get back successfully into the business of promoting it. The government continues to function and provide stability. The investor community has looked at the issues of the currency depreciation and current account deficit and understands that these have important economic dimensions. But they haven't panicked, and they haven't packed up their portfolios and gone home. This shows that, for most part, American investors are committed to Turkey for the long term. The goal for 2014, therefore, is to reinstill in our members confidence that the opportunities and benefits of partnership relations are genuine and the objectives of increased sales and increased returns on investment realistic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the focus of monetary policy in 2014?<br></h4><p>The main objective of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) is to achieve price stability. The CBRT is closely monitoring the recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. It is envisaged that factors adversely affecting inflation will keep inflation indicators considerably above the 5% target for some time. Against this background, the CBRT has underlined that it would not tolerate any deterioration in price stability in the medium term. To this end, it opted for strong and front-loaded monetary tightening at the interim meeting of January 28, 2014 to prevent deterioration in the inflation expectation and pricing behavior. A tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook, while the liquidity policy may be tightened further if deemed necessary.</p><h4>How will the US Fed's decision to taper its quantitative easing program by $10 billion per month affect Turkey's economy, and how will the CBRT respond in 2014?</h4><p>Capital flows into emerging economies remained weak in 4Q2013. The Fed's announcement that it would maintain its exit strategy from quantitative easing was influential in this development and outflows continued, particularly for portfolio investment. Since most of the re-pricing in financial assets was done in the early days of the announcement of the exit strategy, price movements were more limited during the initial implementation. Although this development shows that uncertainty over global monetary policies has partially faded, ongoing risks to the pace of global economic recovery in the upcoming period feed into uncertainty about the quantitative easing exit process and other monetary policy components, such as forward guidance. Following the domestic developments of 4Q2013, Turkey has slightly diverged from other similar economies. In this period, compared to economies with similar economic conditions, Turkey's exchange rate depreciated more against the US dollar and its relative risk premium indicators increased. In response, the CBRT implemented strong monetary tightening to contain the negative impact of these developments on inflation and macroeconomic stability. Tightening monetary policy under current circumstances will not only contribute to price stability, but also support macroeconomic stability through a reduction in exchange rate uncertainty and risk perceptions. The CBRT is aiming to contain the volatility led by capital flows on the domestic economy. One of its specific objectives in 2014 is to decrease volatility in domestic markets. Increasing the predictability of monetary policy would be helpful amid weakening capital inflows.</p><h4>How can Turkey reduce its vulnerability to the withdrawal of foreign capital?</h4><p>Various instruments have been devised and used in response to a changing global and domestic economic conjecture. These instruments include the asymmetric use of the interest rate corridor, the reserve option mechanism developed by the CBRT, and other lira and FX liquidity management tools. Turkey's high current account deficit (CAD) makes its economy particularly sensitive to cross-border capital flow volatility. Therefore, one of the crucial aspects of the CBRT's new monetary policy framework has been a reduction in the cyclical component of the CAD, and hence mitigation of the accumulation of macro financial risks that would arise in case of a sudden stop in capital inflows. This policy naturally complements other structural policies that would reduce the CAD in the medium term. Therefore, macro-prudential policies by the CBRT and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) must be seen in the context of reducing the sensitivity of the Turkish economy to capital flows that may be prone to excessive volatility arising from purely external monetary and financial conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[simply-amazing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year was the first full year for Odeabank in Turkey. How did it go?<br></h4><p>As you know, we launched in October 2012. In the last three months of the year, we actually achieved all our first-year plans. In essence, we were quite ready for the challenges 2013 brought in terms of infrastructure. For 2013, I think we have achieved what we wanted and we are happy with the results in all aspects. I think the first challenge was to expand in corporate and commercial banking, while the retail banking side would be developing physically in branches. And all the infrastructure for mobile banking, direct banking, and internet banking also needed to be completed because there were certain stages and levels to that. Of course, we made some offerings like credit cards. We launched a credit card brand, called Bank'O Card Axess, in October. Before that, we had our own unbranded card, which was basically a Bank'O Card without a loyalty program. It was a good start for us and we learned from it. In the first six months, we reached 150,000 cards. We want to grow, but we want to also do it wisely. An example of that would be 2013, when we had TL16 billion in assets, TL11 billion in loans, and TL13 billion in deposits, which makes us probably the top bank in terms of a favorable loan-to-deposit ratio. Basically, 2013 was a year in which we exceeded our expectations. We entered the retail market strongly, and we continue to capitalize our corporate and commercial banking.</p><h4>What is Odeabank's strategy when catering to Turkey's vibrant SME sector?</h4><p>We help SME businesses, which is a sector worth billions. It is as big as our retail-banking portfolio. Actually, we see this as one of our biggest potential growth areas, and we want to develop more in this area on a much more structured basis as we have done with retail. In retail, we cover 200,000 customers, and in commercial we have 10,000 customers. But the second phase that we are now working on is SMEs. There are about 2 million SMEs in Turkey, and they represent strong potential for us. It would not be wise for us to be involved in the retail and commercial areas, but not the SME sector, especially when we already have the necessary infrastructure for it.</p><h4>How is Odeabank's current progress going toward its 2017 goals?</h4><p>We believe that in order to be sustainable and not marginalized in the banking system, you need to reach a certain size in terms of financials, physical size, and customer numbers to make this profitable for shareholders. At Odeabank, everything is done with satisfied customers and shareholders in mind. We now seem to have a flow of satisfied customers and we also want to make our shareholders happy. We believe that this would require at least the doubling of our asset size to $15 billion to $20 billion, while we're currently at $8 billion. As I always tell my colleagues, there are two basic pillars of success. One of them is a committed shareholder who is willing to contribute capital, and the  other is the quality of the people and the teamwork they are doing. That is our real success. We have got the best people on our team and this is not coming from me, but from our customers. We have the luxury and talent to put these best practices into one system. There are actually few countries in the world other than Turkey that would allow you to grow your assets to $8 billion in one-and-a-half years with 1,200 people, 42 branches, and 200,000 customers. There is potential here. In that respect, if there are a few more banks to come, they would be welcome. We like competition. We have been in competition with other banks, and they are still doing fine, just like us. From a banking perspective, and from a financial services and market dynamics perspective, the system is healthy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What were the main factors behind this success?<br></h4><p>Awareness of the participation banking system has been increasing, as has our branch network and penetration. We increased our branch numbers by 30% over a 17-month period. In 2013, we had 250 branches, and today we have 259. In 2013 alone, we opened up 30 new branches, and in the year before that we opened 38. Moreover, the product range has been increasing. These three factors—awareness, presence, and product range—had formerly been the basic areas of complaint regarding the performance of participation banking. Türkiye Finans is the leading new product generator amongst participation banks. One product we have introduced, a card, is a credit scheme called “Finansör." Finansör is, basically, a credited debit card; a pre-paid, pre-credited card. We also have a product geared at individuals and another at SMEs, that is, small companies with a turnover of up to TL2 million. And as a result, individuals and small corporate clients alike benefit from a common platform. Therefore, product range, presence, and awareness, once again, have helped us increase our market share. Moreover, Türkiye Finans has been increasing its market share both in participation banking and the banking sector in general. In terms of credit market share, we rose from 1.5% to 1.7% over a two-year period. We also gained over a 2 percentage point market share among participation banks. Along with branch numbers, employee numbers have reached 4,000.</p><h4>Which innovative products is Türkiye Finans launching in the short term?</h4><p>In 2013, we were the second largest contributor to the Turkish treasury in terms of sukuk issuance at $500 million in May. Also, for the first time, we borrowed a Turkish lira sukuk that was real estate based. Ever since the regulation emerged, we have been pushing to offer funding as well as borrowing via sukuk instruments. This year, we are the first participation bank to issue sukuk funding to a corporate with just a three-year maturity. It is significant that in a climate like the current one, we have loaned about TL30 million worth of long-term debt, in what was a first of its kind. Our Turkish lira sukuk issuance, which is publically listed, is offered to the general public and not to business entities. The one that we funded, though, was institutional in nature.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on Türkiye Finans's plans regarding sukuk?</h4><p>We plan to issue a US dollar-denominated sukuk and another denominated in Malaysian ringgit, which would be a first of its kind, as well as a larger Turkish lira sukuk. We are also keen to introduce another product to the market, namely long-term local currency funding. For example, our Turkish lira sukuk had a six-month maturity given the economic environment and the US Federal Bank's sudden tightening policy. Otherwise, we would have opted for a one-year issuance, which is a very long-term instrument by our standards. And be it denominated in Malaysian ringgit or US dollars, all funds raised are specifically channeled to SMEs, followed by commercial entities, and finally the individual loan portfolio. Meanwhile we have a 1.7% share of the loans market, and a 3% market share in SME business in Turkey, making the segment our strong point.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2014?</h4><p>I have two targets. One is to exceed TL30 billion in asset terms, over TL25 billion in loans, and over TL20 billion in deposits. This is my number one target. The second target is to outperform market growth by 20%. Today, we are at 1.7%. Our budget plan is designed around this extra 20%; however, if market growth outperforms our expectations, we have to exceed that figure, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AK Asset Management has won awards in Turkey, and is a market leader in most of the areas in the sector. What are the main drivers behind this success?<br></h4><p>AK Asset Management is one of the leading active asset managers and the trendsetter in the industry. Our main strength is a combination of our consistent and superior performance, investment process, our innovativeness, and our people. As of today, we manage total funds of around $5 billion. We are the market leader in pension funds, with a 22% market share, with an approximate value of $3 billion. We are also the market leader in discretionary portfolio management, with a 26% market share. In addition, we have a very strong position in mutual funds. We have had many firsts in the market. We launched the first gold fund, the first capital-protected fund, the first commodity fund, and the first international equity funds in Turkey.</p><h4>What are some of the innovative products that you have planned for near term?</h4><p>The total value of assets under management in the industry is about $30 billion, which represents roughly 3.5% of GDP. This is set to grow faster due to the new regulatory environment of the capital markets. Regulatory amendments have created greater flexibility for innovative products, such as absolute return products, hedge funds, private equity funds, and real estate funds. There will also be an open platform held in 3Q2014, where funds will be listed for clients to buy directly and easily.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles facing Turkey's young asset management sector?</h4><p>Interest rates are still high in Turkey, and were they to remain at the single-digit level for a couple of years, the asset management sector would grow. Secondly, financial education and investment culture has to be developed among the general public, as Turkish investors have traditionally opted for tangible investments such as real estate or gold. This is an important problem for us; however, I still believe that as our assets generate greater returns in the long run, demand will increase. When these points come together our industry will have a CAGR of over 30% within the next five years. Turkey's capital markets, such as its equity market, are also young. The total number of stocks trading on the Borsa İstanbul (BİST) is approximately 400. By comparison, South Korea and India have more than 1,000 listed companies. The average free float of Turkish listed companies is at about 30%, and therefore an increased number of listed companies and free float is the key to the development of the Turkish capital markets. The market cap per GDP of the BIST stands at just 35%, whereas the target needs to be between the 60% and 70% level. Of Istanbul's top-500 companies, only 83 of them are listed.</p><h4>Where do you see the asset management sector within five years?</h4><p>We predict that 2014 will be a transition year, as numerous factors are changing to which the industry is trying to adapt. Following this transitory period, the industry will have the capacity to reach funds under management of approximately $70 billion in five years. The important factor here is the asset management/GDP ratio, currently at just 4%. In South Korea or Brazil, this ratio is over 20%. This said, growth has already begun, and under the right conditions will be sustainable. In the mutual fund segment, I am quite positive about the sector's future and believe that new international players will enter the Turkish fund market soon. The pension funds play a significant role in increasing the savings rate, and we believe that assets under management will approach $100 billion over the decade. Turkey has one of the lowest savings rates among countries with a GDP of over $100 billion. Today, active direct investment accounts in equities on the BIST number just 250,000 and with the help of pension funds the investors' number can increase to 5 million to 10 million indirectly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Istanbul also has very ambitious plans to become a regional or even a global financial hub. How would the partnership with NASDAQ help you achieve this?<br></h4><p>First of all, it would provide us with the most critical element of the exchange, which is infrastructure. When we incorporate the NASDAQ brand into our logo, it will inspire greater confidence among other parties. Thanks to the latest technology, and in addition to the know-how and creation of a market-friendly environment, the already-high liquidity of the Turkish market stands to increase further. We will also expand our institutional investor base. And, as a result, Borsa İstanbul will be more financially integrated with the global financial network. Also, for exchanges in the region, the location, hosting, and data center services will be more attractively offered up by Borsa İstanbul.</p><h4>This year, despite many impressive gains, there is still some way to go to reach your stated goal of an 80% market cap to GDP ratio. What is your strategy for reaching this target?</h4><p>The second half of 2013 in particular was a difficult period from many perspectives. It was difficult for developed economies and emerging markets alike, although I think that we have now reached a more satisfactory position when considering the surrounding environment. I am still confident that our ambitious target is achievable because, when I look at what is taking place in banking on a global scale in terms of the regulatory framework, and especially in light of the US Fed's tapering decision, financing organizations through banking will no longer be as easy as it once was. This was especially true during the 2008-2013 period. Credit will become more expensive, especially given the capital liquidity provisions of the regulatory framework. It will become even tougher to borrow and those corporations that need to expand their operational base or increase their market share will become more competitive. This is exactly the current situation of Turkish corporations, which will need to rely more on the capital markets, a trend that has already begun. While corporates are not currently large players in the liquidity market, we are observing more of them utilizing the corporate bond markets, or even the sukuk market. This is the partnership that we plan to sign with the World Bank regarding the opening of the first ever center for Islamic finance in Istanbul, of which Borsa Istanbul will be the host institution. This will contribute significantly to the development of this segment of the capital markets. I am also sure that after a certain threshold of awareness, the opportunities presented by the capital markets on the issuer-side, including interest from the company side,  will increase further. This will bring them to the liquidity market as well, whereby we will achieve our target of 80% of GDP within a period of five years.</p><h4>How would you assess investor confidence in Istanbul today?</h4><p>Certain elements merit closer analysis, such as the leverage ratio, both for the public and private sectors. When I consider the fiscal outlook for the Turkish economy, I am amazed. I should point out that Turkey has the strongest fiscal outlook among the non-commodity exporters of the emerging markets; we are the first by far. The budget deficit is less than 2% of GDP, and the country is running a primary surplus, thanks to which the debt-to-GDP ratio is declining continually. For 2013, we expect it to be below 35%, rendering it a key element of the evaluation. In the private sector, the household sector is not leveraged at all, compared to any international measures. The leverage of Turkish households remains very low, which lends further credence to our evaluation. More importantly, Turkish households are inclined to the long position, which contradicts many other emerging markets where the households are in effect indebted. A glance at the banking industry reveals a high level of financial preparedness, and an acute knowledge of risk management, as well as robust capitalization. Meanwhile, the industry's capital adequacy and liquidity ratios constitute further strengths and provide another anchor for the Turkish economy. And so, in terms of leverage, I think this business discipline is the most advantageous and competitive aspect of the Turkish economy. One particular risk related to the current account deficit (CAD) concerns the low level of domestic savings. We note that Turkey imports almost all of its energy needs. All in all, when I look at the fundamental indicators, such as productivity, labor market conditions, demographics, and the investment environment, as well as other macro indicators, such as the fiscal outlook, financial service industry resilience to external shocks, and the leverage level, they all imply that the Turkish economy will be much stronger in the future. Therefore, confidence is already present, and we observe this in the approach of global investors as well. Moreover, the fact that we, as Borsa İstanbul, can strike a partnership agreement in 2013 amid market volatility is a clear indication of the high level of confidence in the Turkish market.</p><div class="quote">“  The budget deficit is less than 2% of GDP, and the country is running a primary surplus. "</div><h4>And finally, what is your outlook for Borsa İstanbul over the next five years?</h4><p>Within five years, Borsa İstanbul will definitely be the center of this region, including Southeastern and Central Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We will establish strategic links and partnerships with highly respected global players, and we have already begun with NASDAQ OMX. We will have a more vertically integrated system, a state-of-the-art business model for the capital markets, and an efficient, effective, fast, confident, and secure market place both for domestic and global investors. I am confident that we will reach all of our targets.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-bit-of-the-unconventional]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The concept of participation banking in Turkey has been around for quite a while, but has not really seen significant growth until quite recently. Why have we witnessed such growth over the past decade?<br></h4><p>It is one of the oldest banking systems here, but did not see significant growth until 2006. Before that, there were private financing houses that were limited in function and did not have the status of banks. These were not allowed to operate in certain areas that were associated with conventional banking. In that year, regulations related to banking laws were changed, and these financing houses were compelled to become commercial banks. They can now operate in any field, and became especially popular in retail banking, pushing a range of products such as credit cards and online banking systems into the retail channels. We first started working with one of those private finance houses in 2003. It was the first time in Turkey that an Islamic bank introduced its client's investment products and services.</p><h4>What are the advantages of investing in interest-free or participation investment products compared to more conventional products?</h4><p>There was no alternative previously. If an investor wished to invest on the basis of Islamic principles, or did not wish to receive interest, he had no alternative before these Islamic-compliant products became available. For participation banking clients, this is the major advantage. These funds are pretty much comparable to conventional ones. Islamic investment funds have the same aim, namely to earn more return with less risk, so actually they compete within the same environment. Islamic funds majorly invested in equities because there was no alternative, and equities were in fact the investment products offering the highest return in Turkey. That was another advantage for the investors because before, when interest rates were high, people usually did not want to invest in equities. Now, in this environment, equity investment is more popular and has started growing because of the decrease in interest rates and the emergence of a more stable economy. Since the majority of our portfolio constitutes equity investments, on average our investment fund returns have been much higher compared to conventional ones.</p><h4>Regarding BMD's position and special relationships with all participation banks in Turkey, how will your role change as new banks enter the market?</h4><p>There are four participation banks today. One of them established its own investment institution this year so some of its clients are now transferring to it. We observe these developments and have a wide spectrum of investment products and services available, which will help us to address increased competition.</p><h4>How does innovation play a part in BMD?</h4><p>We are the only group in Turkey that allows our clients to manage their sukuk online. We are also the first in Turkey to use digital signatures when opening an account. However, innovation is difficult, and is a risky area that depends on scale. We have created some value-added products like Islamic exchange traded funds (ETFs), and in the near future we plan to establish a portfolio management company. There is considerable confusion regarding Islamic products in places like Malaysia and the Gulf region. We filter through what exists already, take the best, and provide value-added and profitable products in order to service participation banks and conventional banks simultaneously. BMD is not only a brokerage company or investment institution, and we also perform some corporate finance business such as IPOs and M&amp;As in addition to different types of consulting. In fact, most of our revenue is currently coming from corporate finance, and not the revenues of participation banks. Innovation is crucial for the country. With major infrastructure projects, sukuk offers the best opportunity for borrowing money. Were we to predominantly focus on second-hand sukuk operations in Istanbul and establish some liquidity, it would be easy for both domestic and foreign investors to invest in these products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role of the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation (TAFF) in the defense sector?<br></h4><p>The first steps of the Turkish defense industry were taken in the 1970s, the period when the importance of using national resources to meet the requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces was first recognized. During this period, in order to improve the warfare capability of the Turkish Armed Forces, land, naval, and air force foundations were established through donations from the noble Turkish nation. These three foundations merged based on Law No. 3388 and TAFF was established on September 26, 1987, with the mission of improving the national defense industry, developing new defense industries, and improving the warfare capability of the Turkish Armed Forces. Since its foundation, TAFF has been working to strengthen the solidarity between Turkish citizens and the Turkish Armed Forces through its services. TAFF also effectively manages real estate and cash donations. The total net sales of TAFF subsidiaries in 2012 were $1.8 billion, which was 39% of the total net sales of the Turkish defense and aerospace industry. The total exports of TAFF subsidiaries in 2012 totaled $711 million, which represented 56% of the total exports of the industry. In 2013, the total net sales of TAFF companies reached $1.9 billion and total exports reached $681 million.</p><h4>How is TAFF contributing to the modernization of Turkey's Armed Forces?</h4><p>TAFF has also been contributing to Turkish Armed Forces modernization projects by funding a portion of the defense and systems needs of the Turkish Armed Forces over its yearly income. TAFF subsidiaries specifically focus on R&amp;D activities not only to meet the requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces, but also to gain competitive advantages in the world defense market. Every year, TAFF companies allocate significant amounts of R&amp;D expenditure from their own and external resources. In this context, our subsidiaries made $509 million in R&amp;D expenditures in 2013. R&amp;D incentives provided by the Turkish government also constitute a considerable amount of total R&amp;D expenditures. Aselsan, TUSAÅž/TAI, Havelsan, and Roketsan have a total of five facilities in technology development zones and nine R&amp;D centers, where they employ a total of 4,488 R&amp;D engineers. Aselsan, TUSAÅž, and Roketsan were chosen as the best R&amp;D centers by the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology in 2013.</p><h4>What is your general outlook on the future of Turkey's defense and aerospace industry?</h4><p>The Turkish Armed Forces had a local content ratio of 37% in 2006, which increased to 54% in 2012. Over the last 10 years, this ratio has increased considerably as a result of focusing more on meeting the needs of the Turkish Armed Forces with indigenous products and systems. TAFF's subsidiaries, in 2012, accounted for 39% of the net sales, 56% of exports, and 71% of the R&amp;D expenses realized by the whole Turkish defense and aerospace industry. TAFF played a significant role in achieving this success. TAFF will continue to provide the biggest support for increasing this ratio in the future, also. With serial production coming after the completion of major R&amp;D projects in the upcoming decade, a huge portion of the Turkish Armed Forces' needs will be met by indigenous products and systems. On the other hand, following the use of these indigenous products by the Turkish Armed Forces, our competitive position will improve and our group will be able to export these products more easily and effectively. As a result, our group's backlog will exceed $20 billion in the short to medium term, which will have a positive reflection on local subcontractors, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Turkish defense sector recently surpassed $1 billion in exports, with an estimated annual figure of $1.4 billion. How much of that belongs to FNSS?<br></h4><p>Our annual exports were around $100 million in 2012, and will also be at that level for 2013. According to official Turkish records, exports merely take into account all goods exported out of Turkey, which fails to account for services provided and businesses run beyond Turkey that generate revenues returning to Turkey. Thus, while discounted, the figure of $100 million-$120 million refers to everything including those services and businesses. If you were to calculate the physical goods exported alone, it would account for about $70 million to $90 million a year. Over the coming years, and as of 2015, we plan to reach the $200 million-$250 million range. Two contracts we have on hand—one with Malaysia, and the other with Saudi Arabia—in addition to another large contract we plan to sign at the end of the year, will take us to the $250 million figure.</p><h4>Does your partnership with BAE Systems help with your global export reach?</h4><p>FNSS' partners, such as BAE Systems or Nurol, have always left FNSS free to conduct its own internal operations and exports, and we have been able to remain independent of both. Of course, there are areas where we seek assistance, and we receive this assistance when needed. BAE Systems is a relatively new partner compared to Nurol, and has experienced impressive growth over the past 10 years, mainly through acquisitions. It took the company a while to notice FNSS' achievements, but now that our value is recognized, in many ways they see us as an example of successful market penetration, not only in Turkey, but in other parts of the world, too. This is a good example of a healthy partnership. We are also looking at other areas of cooperation with BAE Systems and Nurol, apart from land systems. Both partners are looking for new venture possibilities, and we should have a solid project within a few years.</p><h4>Your last two indigenous projects include the armored amphibious bridge and the armored dozer. Are there any other indigenous projects you're working on now?</h4><p>Yes. Those were very niche products required by the Turkish army, so we took the responsibility and produced these products for it. But we're also working on more widely used products, such as a tracked weapon-carrier system project that should be finalized next year. There is also a study on future Turkish amphibious combat vehicle (ACV) requirements, and we are working on a new generation of ACVs. We are also working on our Pars family of wheeled vehicles. We're developing the AV8 for Malaysia, and have also had a couple of opportunities in the Middle East, where we'll be developing the Pars range, probably with the new generation. The vehicle will see a constant evolution, which is how it is in this industry, where you design and develop something over the next decade, and then as soon as it is released you start working on the next generation versions and models of that product. Technology develops very fast in this sector, particularly on the electronics front, and there are many systems that need to be incorporated into the vehicle, which takes a lot of systems integration and design work.</p><h4>You have finalized an agreement with Indonesian company Pindad to produce its new medium tank. What are your expectations from this partnership?</h4><p>In May 2013, there was an agreement between the Turkish and Indonesian ministries of defense. We thought government involvement and support from both ministries would facilitate the development of the program, and we limited ourselves to the design and development of the medium tank at this stage, rather than serial production. It will probably take another two to three years to  develop the product.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What growth potential does TPAO see in Turkey?<br></h4><p>TPAO certainly has further room for growth, and we plan to be worth around $50 billion to the state by end-2013. We are looking to transform the company and become more flexible in quick decision-making. This requires a partial overhaul of Turkey's regulatory environment. Firstly, however, we must be perfectly clear about what we could do to improve, and only then approach the government regarding its own responsibilities in the equation. Over the past 10 years, GDP has risen from around $250 billion to approximately $800 billion. In parallel with this growth, TPAO's total investments and total revenue have jumped to $8.2 billion and $18 billion, respectively, over the past decade. What's more, only around 15% of potential offshore reserves have been explored, which is negligible. For instance, TPAO holds the most licenses in the Mediterranean Sea, which is an area of approximately 150,000 square kilometers, as well as owning 40% of the Black Sea coastline. There is also great potential in this respect, both conventional and unconventional, especially in the southeast and the Thracian region of Turkey, where our colleagues from the exploration department are currently working. A small team is set to commence drilling in the Thrace Basin in early 2014. Turkey, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), has a production potential of 20 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of shale gas and oil, indicating that this area deserves very some serious attention.</p><h4>What makes the Black Sea an attractive opportunity for foreign oil companies?</h4><p>The Black Sea has many sound leads and prospective indices, as well as robust oil and gas infrastructure. Basically, it is an attractive region simply because of its sheer core potential. We want to cooperate with other companies in the region to fully develop it. There is also notable potential in the Black Sea region. So far, only five deep-sea wells have been drilled. In the North Sea, the full extent of oil reserves was only discovered after drilling 35 wells. Turkey has spent around $400 million gaining seismic data from the Black Sea, subsequently inviting multinationals such as Shell, ExxonMobil, and Petrobras to offer their opinions. We have developed lasting relationships and begun work on wells. We incurred a capital expenditure of $250 million on one well, while the other participating companies accounted for the remaining $1.3 billion.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance for Turkey to partner with foreign investors?</h4><p>We have developed a number of solid projects with Shell in the Western Black Sea, and also close to Antalya on the Mediterranean coast. We are also working solo on a project near Iskenderun, where we have started drilling, and are planning around 10 wells in the Mediterranean over the next four to five years. In the past we drilled a number of wells near Iskenderun and Mersin, at the time having seen some oil and gas potential, but we are keen to revisit the area to reassess the feasibility of production. Meanwhile, we are also working on the licensed blocks of Northern Cyprus. Israel, too, has made discoveries in Southern Cyprus and in 1Q2014 offshore development is set to commence. We have a very sound partner in Shell, and want to work together on the transportation of gas through Turkey. Participation in this project could also serve to improve our relations with Israel. It would also further relations with Cyprus, especially in terms of water and electricity. In this context, we may also talk of Iraq, where we have four firm ongoing projects, with two apiece in oil and gas. The technical conditions in that market are challenging, but we have committed to a significant investment of $6 million.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the leader of Shah Deniz II consortium, how do you see this project, and the Southern Gas Corridor, affecting Turkey and its role in the regional energy sector?<br></h4><p>Turkey has a key role in the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor, which will provide gas directly from the Caspian to Europe for the first time in history. It is one of the largest energy projects in the world, and from end-to-end will require an investment of more than $45 billion. The pipeline network will be over 3,500 kilometers. The “first mover" of this massive project is the Shah Deniz II development in Azerbaijan. Gas from this field, developed by BP and its partners, is expected to provide 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of gas to millions of consumers in Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, and Italy. This is enough gas to meet the needs of every capital city along the Southern Gas Corridor more than twice over. The first gas delivery is targeted for late 2018, with supplies to Georgia and Turkey, while gas deliveries to Europe are expected just over a year after the first gas is produced offshore in Azerbaijan. Shah Deniz II gas will be transported in and across Turkey through the new Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), which will be a key part of the Southern Gas Corridor. BP expects to exercise its option to take 12% equity in TANAP in 2014. The Southern Gas Corridor is an important project for energy security and diversity in both Turkey and Europe.</p><h4>What are BP Turkey's goals and targets for 2014?</h4><p>Our priorities include growing our downstream businesses in Turkey, such as our fuel value chains, lubricants, and aviation fuel, as well as working with our partners on the upstream side to implement improvement projects on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, and enable the realization of massive projects, such as the Southern Gas Corridor. Our fuels business has a steady growth agenda, opening new retail stations and entering new provinces. BP's lubricants business also currently has a leading market share in automotive lubricants with its Castrol brand, and we have plans to strengthen this. Our lubricants plant in Gemlik currently exports Castrol and BP lubricants to 11 different countries. On the aviation front, Air BP has increased its footprint in Turkey, having a presence in 11 airports in the country. On the BP-operated BTC pipeline, we are implementing several major projects that will sustain the life of the pipeline for decades. And on the Southern Gas Corridor project, we are now in the execution phase, which means we are moving from sheets of paper to sheets of steel. We have started the construction works, with detailed engineering, drilling, and preliminary construction activities already underway.</p><h4>BP recently celebrated its 100th anniversary in the country. What is your long-term vision for BP Turkey?</h4><p>We have been in Turkey for over 100 years, contributing to the country's economy and energy sector. Our vision is to be here for many more years, continuing to make a difference and meeting Turkey's energy needs. Future demand for energy is growing globally, and even faster growth is forecasted for emerging economies such as Turkey. Our investments will continue. The BP-operated Shah Deniz field currently meets around 15% of Turkey's gas demand and, with Shah Deniz II, this could rise to 25%. Development of the new TANAP will bring substantial investment and up to more than 10,000 new jobs to Turkey. By increasing Turkey's capability to transport affordable, secure, and sustainable gas, Shah Deniz II and TANAP will support the development of Turkey as Europe's southern energy hub and a significant provider of European energy security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the recent completion of the Iraqi Kurdistan to Turkey pipeline affect Genel Energy's operations in the area?<br></h4><p>The construction of the additional pipeline, which links up to the existing one between Iraq and Turkey, was unthinkable just a few years ago. It is now complete and will initially carry oil from our Taq Taq and Tawke fields with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day. When compared with the past, we can see that there are more companies in the region now, most of which are making rewarding discoveries. The rate of exploration and production (E&amp;P) growth in Kurdistan and the prospects therein have seen a wave of oil majors move into the region. Therefore, we will be witnessing more small players being replaced or partnering up with large players. When we talk about our company, Genel Energy, having increased the number of assets from five to seven, we are today the largest holder of reserves in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). In addition to our best-known oil assets, we have two huge gas assets from which we intend to deliver gas to Turkey by the end of 2017. Genel is the first company to supply gas to local power plants in Kurdistan. Currently, gas is being delivered to Duhok power station. Additionally, conceptual design studies on a gas export pipeline are in progress in the Miran field.</p><h4>How do you see these energy deals between Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) affecting Turkey's role in the regional energy sector?</h4><p>The most outstanding development in 2013 is the signing of an Energy Framework Agreement with the KRG in March followed by a set of contracts between KRG and a recently established Turkish state-run company, TEC. In the meantime, a brand new crude oil pipeline was fully commissioned by the KRG. The infrastructure is ready. In January 2014, oil started to flow through this new pipeline connecting into the existing ITP to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Today, there are about 1.5 million barrels of oil stored in Ceyhan. Three-way mediations are ongoing between Ankara, Erbil, and Baghdad. I am fully confident that problems will be solved sooner or later. As one can easily predict, contractors in the KRG are looking forward to a lasting solution as they have been investing billions of dollars in this region for a decade now. Therefore, it is essential that they enjoy a stable and amicable business environment in Iraq. Let us not forget that any contract in this region would reflect positively on Turkey's energy sector. We are especially talking about a vital gas play in our immediate neighborhood. Nonetheless, we can highlight KRG and other East Mediterranean, Caspian, and Asian reserves to the East when the energy security of Turkey and even Europe is considered.</p><h4>In March 2014, two additional Genel Energy wells became operational. What are your expectations for further drilling during the remainder of 2014?</h4><p>We have two very important producing fields in the region: Taq Taq and Tawke. The Taq Taq field is currently producing 130,000 bbl/d, but by the end of the year we will have increased this volume to 200,000 bbl/d. In Tawke, our maximum capacity is 130,000 bbl/d, and we are planning to increase this to 200,000 bbl/d—300,000 bbl/d is expected to be produced from the Tawke and Taq Taq crude fields overall.</p><div class="quote">“  We are building a high impact portfolio in challenging geographies. "</div><h4>Genel Energy recently acquired the exploration rights for fields in Angola. Could you please elaborate on your expectations from this deal?</h4><p>We are known as the pioneer of the E&amp;P sector in the KRI because we have been actively engaged there for more than a decade. Things are a bit different today because we are now a public company and are perceiving the need for diversification. This underpinned our decision to invest in the Mediterranean, especially the western Mediterranean, mainly Morocco and Malta. The decision to become involved in the rest of Africa was made about two years ago, and now we are taking the steps to implement those decisions. The Angolan contract that we recently signed, as well as Morocco, Somaliland, Malta, Ethiopia, and the Ivory Coast, are merely a continuation of our growing forward policy. In most cases, we are looking to geographies where we become the pioneers and have the chance to duplicate our success in Kurdistan. The Angola deal is particularly different because our technical team has found out that the geology is directly analogous to that of offshore Brazil. As a result, the expectations on numbers in this concession are huge.</p><h4>How are the Turkish roots of Genel Energy defining your business activities abroad?</h4><p>Until 10 years ago, Africa was known as a continent of hunger and poverty, whereas today it is regarded as a potential economic and political partner. Turkey's intense engagement with Africa is interesting thanks to the government's new foreign policy. New Turkish embassies in African countries have resulted in increasing interest for commercial entities in the continent. With Turkish roots and an experienced British CEO, Tony Hayward, it is worth mentioning that we are building a high impact portfolio in challenging geographies such as Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Genel Energy's success so far has paved the way for other entities in Turkey to follow the same path, and today we see new companies active in neighboring countries in the E&amp;P sector. We can, therefore, position ourselves as one of the pioneers in this sector.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2014?</h4><p>For 2014, we definitely have higher goals and expectations. We are aiming to boost our production capacity in Kurdistan and concentrate mainly on the delivery of gas to Turkey. Regarding the remaining assets in Africa, we are expecting to post new exploration successes in all the concessions we have.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Prior to joining Orange, he established his own start-up company, TouchLocal, which became the UK’s fastest growing local business search and practical social networking site (per Nielsen Net Ratings) in 2003-2006.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of Turkey to Microsoft?</h4><p>Our growth is double that of the addressable market in Turkey, which grew at 9% on average. We have grown at about 21% annually on average over recent years. With that, Microsoft Turkey's prominence has increased in the Microsoft network. As a result, Turkey is now categorized in the emerging cluster, which also includes China, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India, and Mexico. More Microsoft resources have also started coming into the country. Microsoft then started to evaluate different R&amp;D opportunities in Turkey, especially in the education arena. We have already invested in Koç University's R&amp;D center, ATOM, and several other university projects. Also, we have an innovation center in our Microsoft Ankara office, where we support start-ups with our technologies. We believe that the FATİH project, an initiative to get more technology into public education, also creates R&amp;D opportunities focused on education. With 20 years of experience in Turkey, Microsoft has a strong presence in the country through its partnership network, and currently has around 11,000 technology partners, both small and large. These businesses then utilize our products to reach their potential, improving their sales, cost structure, and infrastructure. In that sense, Microsoft's ecosystem is worth approximately $7 billion, which is quite a large number if you consider that it represents about 55% of the total market. Compared to other technology players in the market, we are significantly larger. Microsoft is viewed as an innovation leader in the market. As part of our investment in Turkey, we launched Turkey's first online and free app development program, called Open Academy, two years ago. Currently, Open Academy has over 130,000 registrants and more than 5,000 graduates who have already published theirs apps on Windows Store.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind this growth in Turkey?</h4><p>There are two main drivers. Number one is that Microsoft Turkey has a very large consultancy business. We employ architects that go to companies and can basically implement the most sophisticated technology initiatives that the companies want to implement. When I first arrived, I saw it as a great asset to be able to go to companies and then move them into much different areas. The architects that we employ are the crí¨me de la crí¨me—top of the market professionals. By doing it that way, we became very mission critical in the companies that we operate. The second driver has come about through our pro-active work. I went to 14 cities in Turkey, and in each I selected around 50 companies, five sectors, and identified about 700 target companies. Out of those 700 companies, we went to those that have a high turnover and low EBITDA and helped them to increase their bottom line by using technology, which changed the conversation. By adding more value to their products and becoming more competitive, Turkish companies have a much better chance of competing in international markets. That part of our business has been growing by 47% every three years, which is a huge number.</p><h4>Microsoft globally invested $3 billion in cloud computing in 2013. Where does Turkey figure into plans to grow the cloud?</h4><p>We see four megatrends in the next 10 years. One is cloud computing, another is mobility, followed by big data, and finally social media. All of our strategies operate around those four megatrends. Cloud computing is at the core of the whole thing because, for mobility to work properly, we need the cloud. We have been adapting to the cloud much faster than anybody else has within the sector. The cloud is more accessible because you pay for as much as you use. It gives you the latest, most advanced technology at your fingertips. Therefore, when we go to a company, they can take that technology, plug in to wherever they want, and immediately improve processes. Our customers start seeing the return on their investment immediately.</p><div class="quote">“  The architects that we employ are the crí¨me de la crí¨me—top of the market professionals. "</div><h4>What are your plans to expand your mobile division in Turkey?</h4><p>Mobile smartphone penetration in Turkey is a very big strategy for us. Smartphones represent 57% of total phones sold here. There is a major migration toward tablets and smartphones. It is a very important strategy for us, both on the commercial and consumer side, to get involved in that industry.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2014?</h4><p>We have grown in terms of turnover. In 2014, we are looking to bring more Microsoft assets into Turkey, develop our staff, and give back to society. The Microsoft Turkey Open Academy program will also grow. We are working with the Minister of Education to turn it into a curriculum for high schools. On the industrial front, the migration of cloud computing is a priority. Companies completely understand the benefits of technology and can compete better in foreign markets. The country has very good fundamentals, a young population, and more. Hopefully, we will grow and shape the future of the country with the better usage of technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For foreign companies to get established in the Turkish market, what are the advantages that only GODE Istanbul can provide?<br></h4><p>We have a highly creative team and an extensive network, including stakeholders and successful business partners in advertising. In addition to this, our rate of staff turnover is low, and we have retained our talent within the agency. However, most importantly, we have solid relationships with the media. For brands that want to establish themselves with strong and widespread roots in the Turkish market, it is necessary to work with an agency that can trigger the local powers and opinion leaders to meet their clients' objectives in the Turkish market. GODE Istanbul fulfills this need very efficiently.</p><h4>How has the global perception of Turkish brands changed over the past decade?</h4><p>Not only has the standpoint of Turkish brands changed, but also the brands themselves have changed notably. For instance, the concept of corporate identity and standardized or regulated operations in the past were largely the preserve of foreign companies and brands. However, Turkish brands today are in a transitional period, having become corporatized, both in understanding and operation. Therefore, they are increasingly speaking the same language as global counterparts, in turn making the Turkish market a more responsive, emergent, successful, and flexible one.</p><h4>What are your expectations for new digital advertising agencies?</h4><p>My expectations are high because the digital advertising sector is growing extremely fast. It is not a mature environment yet, as many brands are not familiar with what it entails. What you can do ranges from basic services such as a digital campaign that only includes a banner, right up to a digital advertising strategy that has an inbuilt synergy between all digital platforms, not only for digital advertising, but also for business development. Digital advertising helps brands to grow their business by linking to the wider world. It is a highly influential tool in terms of customers, and we want to utilize it as best as we can.  With this intention, in 2013 we established our second agency, HAWAII Digital Works, in order to provide more concentrated service in terms of digital advertising.</p><h4>Where is the advertising and marketing sector in Turkey headed?</h4><p>I think the journey has just begun. Before the 1990s, Turkey was solely a producer; however, today we have become a seller, too, where services, marketing, and advertising have become essential. We are becoming marketers, advertisers, and service providers. When you look at the breakdown of services and production in Turkey's GDP, you note that 10 years ago production accounted for 60% of the economy, yet today the opposite is true. We generate the bulk of our revenues from services, and now the entire Turkish market is aware of the importance of advertising, branding, and marketing. During Turkey's economic crisis of the early 2000s, the first business cut would be made to the advertising budget. Now, businesses are aware that it should in fact be one of the last to be cut; this required a paradigm shift in business mentality. Advertising budgets are growing annually and many foreign advertising brands are keen to establish a foothold in Turkey. I believe there is a very bright future, because we have many local talented advertising professionals who are well educated and are globally aware of what is going on. Foreign brands should take advantage of this to entrust their most precious brands to Turkish hands in full confidence for a successful outcome.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A decade ago, when my party, the Justice and Development Party, better known by its Turkish acronym, AK Party, embarked on its journey to govern Turkey, it announced its democratization and development program. The key element of this program in relation to economic policies is a continuous and sustainable economic growth strategy. An integral part, among others, of our strategy has been attracting foreign investment, acknowledging its contribution to economic development. As we have not only included foreign investment in our economic program, we have also implemented effective reforms that have turned Turkey into an attractive destination for foreign investment. Moreover, we have reinforced our economic policies with political stability. In a politically and economically volatile region, Turkey has been an island of political stability and economic confidence.<br></p><p>This hindsight vindicates that our economic policies and reforms have yielded results. During our administration over the past decade, the Turkish economy has grown robustly with an average annual real GDP growth rate of 5%. In the meantime, Turkey attracted more than $120 billion of FDI. Our sound economic policies and reforms have also strengthened Turkey against economic shocks and crises. During the global financial crisis in 2009, many banks had to be bailed out by governments in the US and Europe, whereas not even a single bank required monetary or administrative support from the government in Turkey.</p><p>Again, while the recent sovereign debt crisis has engulfed many economies in Europe, Turkey's public finance indicators have been impressive; Turkey drastically reduced its gross public debt from 74% of GDP in 2002 to 36% in 2012. That is why, though belatedly, Turkey has recently been upgraded to investment grade by major credit rating agencies. Turkey has been the only economy that has been upgraded several notches since the onset of the 2009 global financial crisis. While the crises have caused many economies to struggle with increasing unemployment, Turkey created around 3.5 million new jobs between 2009 and 2012, whereas total employment in the EU-27 countries decreased by 1.5 million.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey has been the only economy that has been upgraded several notches since the onset of the 2009 global financial crisis."</div><p>While the above and many other figures have altogether been a test for our economic policies, the real test for them has been our people's trust in and approval of our policies. My party won the last three consecutive general elections with landslide victories, increasing its votes in every one of these elections. This approval by our people has encouraged us to implement more reforms and further improve Turkey's investment climate. As long as we have a political mandate from our people, we will continue to serve them through sound economic policies and reforms. As such, Turkey will continue to be a safe haven for global investors where they can find strong economic confidence backed by genuine political stability that is supported by the will of the people of Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important aspects and regulatory changes from the new Capital Markets Law?<br></h4><p>The previous capital markets law dates back to 1982, meaning the new capital markets law brings us up to date with all the changes we have seen both in the global and local capital markets over the last 30 years. The new law also harmonizes our regulations almost 100% with those of the EU. Furthermore, during the preparation of the new law we took into account the lessons learnt from the 2008 global financial crisis. Another reason is that while the last decade saw huge growth in the Turkish banking sector, the capital markets had lagged quite a way behind. This new law adjusts our capital markets to the times, as it were.</p><h4>The law has been in effect since early 2013. What changes have you seen in terms of asset management in Turkey?</h4><p>The new law brings about a fresh regime that is fully aligned with EU regulations. Immediately after the new law came into force, we commenced work on the enactment of sub-regulations. All of the secondary regulations that will lay the groundwork will be in effect as of July 1, 2014. Regarding the institutional investors and the collective investment schemes, the three most crucial regulations are those that set the rules for the investment funds, the portfolio management companies, and the depositories. As for the mutual funds, assets under management (AUM), as of September 2, 2013, are approximately $15.6 billion. Generally speaking, money market funds have been dominating the Turkish mutual funds industry. However, due to the recent limitations we imposed on the total expense ratios of mutual funds, there has been a decline in the proportion of money market funds' portfolio size since 2012. With their growing number in the market, hedge funds are becoming an attractive investment alternative.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the state of investor confidence in Turkey?</h4><p>Six of the past 10 years were spent in the midst of a global financial crisis; yet, not a single bank or company in Turkey required government intervention or subsidies to stay in business. This has also had a positive effect on foreign investor confidence in the Turkish economy. Whether it be FDI or portfolio investments, I don't think you will find a single foreign investor who was unhappy with their investments in Turkey over the past decade. Our government's approach to investor protection is similar to their attitude toward protecting Turkish citizens' rights. With respect to international investor confidence in our markets, there is draft legislation on international arbitration currently being considered in parliament. In addition to this, we are working on courts that will solely be dedicated to capital markets issues and financial disputes, aiming to shorten the time period of judicial processes.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2014 and beyond in terms of increased savings?</h4><p>In the first 10 months of 2013, 1 million people joined the new private pension scheme, and we expect public interest to sustain the momentum. By 2023, our target is to reach 10 million participants. We aim to have a GDP of $2.5 trillion by 2023 and the AUM in pension schemes to comprise 5% to 10% of GDP, thus between $125 billion and $250 billion. We believe these mid- to long-term targets are reasonable and attainable when our current status is compared with other emerging market economies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Public-private partnership (PPP) projects in Turkey are receiving increasing attention. What is ISPAT's approach to PPPs?<br></h4><p>The national and local authorities in Turkey have been implementing numerous investment projects through PPPs, and are also keen to realize further opportunities in education, energy, defense, healthcare, transportation, and other public services. Similarly, opportunities are also available in privatization projects. While Turkey's privatization efforts totaled more than $50 billion over the last 10 years, there are still several more areas to be privatized, such as infrastructure and energy generation, which have been partly privatized. Considering Turkey's growing demand for energy, which requires more than $100 billion of investment over the next decade, there are lucrative opportunities for energy companies. Turkey has set specific targets to achieve by the year 2023, the centennial celebration of the foundation of the Republic of Turkey. The PPP model will be crucial to achieve Turkey's grandiose targets ranging from health to economy and from defense to education. In order to utilize this potential, ISPAT is pro-actively promoting Turkey's PPP projects abroad. We have organized roadshows and seminars for specific projects or sectors, with valuable contributions from governmental organizations, such as the Privatization Administration (ÖİB) or relevant ministries. ISPAT will keep promoting and facilitating PPP projects, as it did in the past.</p><h4>The share of FDI in Turkey's GDP has perpetually grown since 2009. What are the main features that make Turkey's economy attractive for a growing number of investors?</h4><p>Turkey has been one of the fastest recovering economies in the world, expanding by 9.2% in 2010, followed by 8.5% in 2011. Similarly, FDI inflows to Turkey dramatically went up over this period. We received $16 billion in FDI in 2011 and $13 billion in 2012, up from $8.5 billion and $9 billion in 2009 and 2010, respectively. When it comes to Turkey's attractiveness to investors, we can show plenty of factors. First and foremost, Turkey has been a natural bridge between the East and West, as well as North and South. Turkey's strategic location provides access to multiple markets of 1.5 billion people, a combined GDP of $25 trillion, and more than $8 trillion in foreign trade, which corresponds to around half of total global trade. The Customs Union between Turkey and the EU has been in force since 1996. In addition, we have free trade agreements (FTAs) with 23 countries, most of which have been signed with surrounding countries. FTAs with 25 countries including the US, Japan, Canada, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia are either in the official negotiation process or pending official negotiations. Current FTAs and the Customs Union enable investors to access multiple markets of $20 trillion in GDP, 780 million people, and $3.5 trillion in imports. That is to say, when you invest in Turkey, you can easily export your products to different destinations. So, it would not only mean investing in Turkey, but also in the entire region. That is why many global companies have either established their manufacturing bases in Turkey or moved their regional headquarters here. In addition to its strategic location, a large and rapidly growing domestic market, a young and qualified labor force, a business-friendly environment, and a strong finance sector are the key elements for Turkey's attractiveness for investors.</p><h4>Which sectors of Turkey's economy do you consider as having high potential and interest from foreign investors?</h4><p>The share of the manufacturing and energy sectors in total FDI has been on an upward trend in recent years. This means Turkey is now able to attract more qualified and value-added FDI. For example, FDI figures in electronics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and energy are on the rise. Abundant investment opportunities are available in many sectors, ranging from energy, finance, automotive, ICT, food and beverages, agriculture, renewable energy, and iron and steel to petrochemicals and real estate. More opportunities will come with the realization of Turkey's challenging targets for 2023. In the energy sector in particular, we are making efforts to attract more foreign investments to Turkey, as there is a huge need for investment in this field. As the economy is growing, the demand for energy is increasing as well. In order to meet such rapidly increasing demand, investments worth tens of billions of dollars are needed in our country. Over the last 10 years, the Turkish electricity market has become one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Between 2002 and 2012, electricity demand in Turkey grew 6.2% annually on average. According to recent projections, our electricity demand is expected to grow with an annual average rate of 7.5% until the end of 2020. As investments are being made in order to meet this huge demand, we are also working to decrease our dependency on fossil fuels. Consequently, renewable energy has a crucial place in our energy strategy. Particularly in wind and solar, we are very confident that our country will develop its capabilities and reach its potential over the next decades. Our government's energy strategy aims to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 30% by 2023. In addition, it is a national target for Turkey to make Istanbul an international finance center. Having been tested by the global financial crisis, Turkey has one of the most solid and promising financial sectors in its region. The government's International Finance Center (IFC) project offers global companies a chance to run their financial operations in the region through Istanbul thanks to various incentives, a skilled workforce, and a global, cosmopolitan city with a vibrant local economy. Hence, the financial sector could be seen as one of the most promising sectors in Turkey. In automotive, another sector of great importance for Turkey, we expect significant new investments. Turkey already has a broad experience in this sector and the capacity is being improved both in quantity and quality. Our government's vision is to make Turkey the manufacturing base of Eurasia in the medium- and high-tech industries. To this end, our investment promotion strategy is aiming to attract more technology-intensive investments to Turkey. The incentives that our government provides are also in line with these goals. Thanks to the improving investment climate in technology-intensive industries, I expect related sectors such as biotechnology and ICT to continue to rise in the future.</p><h4>What are ISPAT's FDI goals for 2014, and what is your strategy for achieving them?</h4><p>Turkey's main traditional investment partner has been the EU for many years. The EU still accounts for the lion's share of Turkey's total FDI. However, at the current global conjuncture, Asian economies are also emerging as new sources of FDI. China and India, in addition to Japan, are becoming increasingly important in terms of their potential to invest. Accordingly, similar to the export strategy of our government, we are now diversifying our target economies for FDI promotion in our investment promotion strategy. For example, China's outbound investments amounted to $77 billion in 2012 and $90 billion in 2013. This is expected to be around $100 billion in 2014. However, the share of China in FDI inflows to Turkey is very limited for the time being. In order to increase Turkey's share in this field, we have named China as one of our target economies, in addition to India and Japan. On a sector basis, ISPAT focuses on the manufacturing sector, aiming at high-tech and value-added industries. Investments in products not yet produced in Turkey are one of the most crucial aspects of ISPAT's targets. Our aim is to attract more technology-intensive investments in the manufacturing sector, in order to ensure more technology transfer to Turkey. With our sector and country strategies, we are practicing pro-active promotion activities, including roadshows for target sectors and company visits. We are also monitoring target sectors in certain countries and specifying target companies that we consider to be potential investors. Subsequently, we contact these target companies with value proposals. We have had many positive results from this strategy in the recent past, and I hope it will keep serving our country by attracting more investments in 2014.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the current state of Turkish and US relations?<br></h4><p>Turkey and the US have a long history thanks to NATO. The relationship is firmly constructed, and there is a military relationship that goes hand-in-hand with the political relationship as well. That is why President Obama started referring to this relationship as a “model partnership" in 2009. One part that is still not as developed as we would like it to be is the commercial angle of this relationship. Turkish American Business Association (TABA-AmCham) is one of the organizations responsible for developing that angle. In the last decade, we have been able to effectively quadruple trade flows between Turkey and the US. When measuring these trade relationships, I think there is too much of a focus on just trade flows; what I believe is equally important is mutual investments. Not only did we increase the trade flow four times up to a figure of about $20 billion, we have also managed to get more mutual investment in the past six or seven years than we have in the past 50 years. These two developments are important. Many companies such as Eczacıbaşı, Borusan, Sarkuysan, and, more recently, Denizli-based Er-Bakır, which is making a $70 million investment in a copper manufacturing facility, are becoming ambassadors for investing in the US. We see all of these developments going in the right direction.</p><h4>Which issues would you consider as a priority for TABA's lobbying efforts?</h4><p>Of course, we are a business organization, so we care less about the political issues. Although we do not lobby directly on political issues, our commercial lobbying has allowed both sides to realize that the relationship is creating economic value on both ends, which is an incentive to keep the political spirit high. We do lobby directly on economic issues like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which is a hugely important issue for us. That is probably our flagship issue now. A large part of the lobbying process is about creating awareness of its importance. President Obama, Vice-President Biden, and Secretary of State Kerry have indicated that they understand and support Turkey being part of the TTIP. More recently, we had a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland, and she said that the TTIP can be considered as the economic arm of NATO. If that is true, then Turkey deserves to be part of it, no doubt.</p><h4>What kind of growth are you expecting for US and Turkish trade over the coming decade?</h4><p>It is important to note that the US is the number one economy in the world, and Turkey is the 17th, but is growing rapidly. It is growing faster than most of the other 16 countries that are above it. I expect US-Turkish trade matching the political relationship over the course of the coming decade. Our two countries agree on most principles, and the political relationship has proven resilient. There are no structural reasons why trade should be $20 billion today—it is low if you look at the potential, and there is nothing keeping us from making at least $100 billion. In 2001, Turkish exports were about $20 billion, and we set a target of $100 billion, which we achieved even faster than we had planned. Today, our target for 2023 is $500 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges facing Turkey's privatization process, and what are the Privatization Administration's (ÖİB's) strategies to overcome them?<br></h4><p>Economic conditions directly affect the performance of privatization implementation. For example, the contraction in credit facilities may limit the financing abilities of buyers, while the rise in interest rates could increase financing costs. Regulatory changes during the course of a tender are also among factors that affect the potential investor appetite. In response to these risks, the ÖİB has put in place responsive stipulations for tender specifications where necessary, such as modifying payment and installment schemes. To be able to overcome possible challenges, we are also working closely with potential investors and welcome their feedback on the privatization process. We consider our approach market friendly, aimed at achieving open, transparent, and competitive privatization at each tender. However, despite rather volatile market conditions, 2013 was a record year in Turkey's privatization history. Revenue from privatizations amounted to $12.5 billion and we managed to finalize 259 tenders.</p><h4>ÖİB has found success in recent years in the energy sector. What further room is there for privatization in this area, and what other sectors are on your radar?</h4><p>Privatization of the electricity sector has been a particular success story. We have managed to privatize 18 distribution companies with the goal of minimizing distribution and operating costs. From these privatizations, approximately $13 billion in revenue has been accrued. Meanwhile, we continue privatizations in electricity generation that we are confident will also prove successful. The tender process has already begun for the Çatalağzı, Yatağan, Kemerköy, and Yeniköy thermal plants, with bidding deadlines set for April 2014. There are also other sectors of potential. For example, the privatization of marinas and ports is on the horizon. We now have the Fenerbahçe-Kalamış Marina in our portfolio, which is Turkey's largest marina. The process has started, and the bidding deadline is May 12, 2014. We also have port projects, namely Izmir Cruise Port, Izmir Container Port, Derince Port, and Tekirdağ Port, for all of which zone planning and preparatory studies are ongoing. As a newcomer, Inebolu Port will soon be included in our portfolio, and we will proceed with its privatization. We also announced the tender for the National Lottery, or Milli Piyango, and the bidding deadline is set for May 20. We are also planning to privatize eight motorways and two bridges under a renewed model. Another major project for the year involves the privatization of winter sports facilities in Erzurum.</p><h4>How would you assess the attractiveness of Turkey's privatization tenders to foreign investors?</h4><p>Turkey has become attractive to foreign investors thanks to its strong macroeconomic fundamentals and demographics. Furthermore, the country has a relatively low unemployment rate, solid banking system, dynamic domestic market, excellent infrastructure, and improved credit rating. Given these solid growth prospects, Turkey is a promising investment address, and boasts a pro-business climate with strong international credentials. In 2012, FDI reached $12.4 billion and the total number of foreign companies hit 33,081. Turkey is not only present in the MENA region, but also has strong ties with Central Asia and the Balkans. We stringently pursue the principles of transparency and accountability in all privatization processes. Furthermore, there is no general limitation on foreign investor participation at tenders. Indeed, almost 35% of our closed deals have seen foreign involvement. The high international standards we utilize are also recognized by international organizations like the OECD and the World Bank.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Turkey's export performance in 2013?<br></h4><p>Our export figures reached $151.8 billion in 2013. Regional increases include 6.6% to the EU, 5.2% to Africa, and 5.% to the Far East. Within this period, the largest export sector was the automotive industry, which had an export volume of $21.3 billion. The sector's exports increased by 13.6%. The chemical segment ranks second, with a total of $17.4 billion, and the apparel sector ranks third with an increase of 8.3% to $17.3 billion. In 2013, the biggest export market for Turkey was Germany with $13.3 billion, while Iraq ranks second on $11.8 billion in exports, and the UK ranked third at $8.6 billion of exports. These top countries are followed by Russia, Italy, France, the US, Spain, China, and the Netherlands. It was a challenging year for world trade in terms global demand for goods; however, due to the improving signs in global trade since 3Q2013, we are expecting improvements in the short term. Therefore, as a result of this recovery, we expect a more favorable export performance from almost all industries in 2014.</p><h4>How is Turkey working to increase value-added exports and the level of R&amp;D in the country?</h4><p>The share of R&amp;D spending to national income in Turkey is 0.92%, while it is between 2% and 3% in developed countries. Our Assembly continuously emphasizes the importance of R&amp;D in the process of transformation underway in Turkey, giving support to investments in these fields. We believe that Turkey will move toward its 2023 export targets through value-added exports and the momentum provided by R&amp;D investments. Hence, Turkey has set an R&amp;D spending budget target for 2023 of 3% of GDP. On November 28-30, 2013 in Istanbul, we organized Turkey Innovation Week with over 26,000 participants and welcomed the leading entrepreneurs and creative minds of Turkey and from all over the world. Over these three days, we hosted valuable speakers and experts in science, technology, marketing, design, urban planning, business, industry, and energy, and they shared their knowledge and experience with all the participants.</p><h4>How is the Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TİM) working to improve the strength of Turkish brands abroad?</h4><p>To hit Turkey's export target for 2023, we expect to create 10 global brands. With the support of the Ministry of Economy, we are implementing the Turquality project, which will support the ongoing development of these national brands. This project supports 104 brands from 92 firms. We are hoping to support 125 firms up until 2023.</p><h4>How would you assess Turkey's current progress toward its 2023 goals of $500 billion in exports?</h4><p>Developing countries' share in world trade is increasing day-by-day, and Turkey is advancing toward a much brighter future through the great efforts of dynamic exporters. In order to catch up with the dynamism of the era, we are focusing on innovation, IT, R&amp;D, entrepreneurship, and, most importantly, skilled human capital. To provide sustainable exports, we are focusing on increasing our market share in current markets, on the diversification of new countries and sectors, on reaching target markets with high potential, and on medium- and high-tech products. Turkey is aiming to reach a GDP of $2 trillion and $500 billion in exports by 2023, potentially emerging as one of the top-10 world economies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you explain the need to develop the barter system in Turkey?<br></h4><p>We believe that we need to have alternatives to the main existing financial system in the world. Our Prime Minister has also touched on this issue, mentioning the “interest rate lobby" recently. Across the world we find a global economic system based on the increase and decrease of interest rates, and banks are the main players. However, we see this system as being prone to making dire mistakes, which we have become all too familiar with over the past few decades. These dominant financial institutions do not work in the interest of the people, or for the country; they work for their own interests, supported by various governments. While banks should base growth on existing deposits, aiming to build on those deposits, we find instead that they seek to generate massive amounts of wealth based on credit, through easy loans, various financial instruments, credit cards, and the like. The future of the dollar and the euro is being debated. The world will be unable to survive more of these crises. These affect governments, countries, and states adversely, leading to turmoil. This can't go on. We need systems that enable everyone to grow, prosper, and expand together, and I think the barter system is an important alternative in this sense. The necessary legal framework and regulations are being established for this. The barter system has to become regulated, legal, and widespread.</p><h4>Is there an international barter regulatory committee?</h4><p>Yes, International Reciprocal Trade (IRT). In Turkey, however, there isn't one. Unless you establish the regulations and necessary legislation first, you won't get the players. This is what Turkey needs to do.</p><h4>How many member companies do you have now?</h4><p>Three years ago, we had 5,600 member companies, and now we have more than 7,000. These companies come from all sectors of the economy, and we expect this number to grow.</p><h4>Which sectors are performing the best for Türk Barter?</h4><p>The barter system develops based on supply and demand. Wherever there is demand for some services or products, it works for us.</p><h4>How many branches do you have?</h4><p>We have 10 branches in various cities.</p><h4>Can you tell us about innovation in bartering?</h4><p>We are looking to launch a barter credit card, which will have no interest charges, obviously. You can also use a barter check.</p><h4>How is barter making the Turkish economy more efficient?</h4><p>Before any company is able to join us, we perform our due diligence and investigate them. First, we make sure it has its finances in order. Then, we prepare special projects to establish financial balance, and then we work with companies. That way, we help create healthier companies, companies with better finances, and this directly contributes to the Turkish economy. The more we do to add SMEs with balanced and accountable finances to the Turkish economy, the better and healthier the economy will become.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For a huge global company like Allianz, what is the importance of the Turkish market, and what are your expectations?<br></h4><p>In today's globalized business environment, companies should have a strong presence in emerging markets in order to maintain sustainable growth. Since Turkey is one of the so-called MIST countries, its relevance is clear to us. The Turkish economy is showing the most dynamic growth in Europe, and it is one of the continent's largest economies with a fairly young population of 75 million people. The opportunities in the Turkish insurance sector are shaped by the dynamics of a growing middle class, favorable demographics, and low penetration rates. We see rapid progress in Turkey along with an attractive economic landscape and stability in the physical, regulatory, and economic infrastructure. The acquisition of Yapı Kredi Sigorta by Allianz is the biggest investment made in the Turkish insurance sector, and it definitely underlines Turkey's position as one of the key markets. This is how we see Turkey in a nutshell and why we are investing in this country. Turkey is clearly one of the key markets where growth potential is seen, and where we observe that growth can be captured without losing focus on profitability. We are subscribing to double-digit growth over the next year, and also plan on double-digit growth in profitability over the coming years.</p><h4>How do you expect the merger with Yapı Kredi to change your role in the market?</h4><p>We are becoming the market leader in Turkey in non-life, life, and pensions. We have a combined market share of 15.6% in non-life and 20.4% in pensions. In terms of life protection, we rank third following a number of company mergers. Furthermore, we have taken the lead in the health branch with a market share of 33%, which is around 19 percentage points ahead of second place. Our plan is of course to maintain our market position, but we will never do so for the sake of market share alone. We are always focused on sustainability, which means that if we cannot maintain our market share with a return on our risk capital, we will forego it. The sustainability of growth and profitability is always our top priority. Our mission is to serve the Turkish population because, as a market leader, what you feel most is a responsibility to society. Turkey is growing, emerging, and transforming into a developed economy, but as yet the assets of Turkish wealth on a global scale are rather low and need to be protected from any downturn. At Allianz, we are aware of the emerging needs of the market, to which we have brought our global expertise. On the one hand, we are utilizing our global knowledge and expertise in Turkey, while on the other benefiting from our local experience.</p><h4>How does the new private pensions law change your outlook on the growth potential of private pensions in Turkey?</h4><p>Pension savings have been supported with state contributions, which is a major milestone in the development of savings in Turkey in general. Again, looking at it from a macro perspective, it was an extremely smart move from the government. When we consider the level of the current account deficit, increasing the local domestic savings quota is crucial. As of October 2013, the contribution of the state to the pension funds was around TL700 million. We are talking now about a sector worth TL24.2 billion as of October in total pensions volume, of which TL700 million comes from the state. This was a major milestone in the development of Turkey as an economy, and for us as an insurance player. It was crucial in that we are now in a position to gain scale. Pensions' profitability margins are quite low, for both insurance and asset management companies in Turkey. To have an asset management culture, to grow funds, and to intensify savings in order to establish a professional sector is the only sustainable plan, and with the current margins this is going to be difficult.</p><div class="quote">“  We have a combined market share of 15.6% in non-life and 20.4% in pensions. "</div><h4>As awareness and participation in the insurance and private pensions system grows, what effects will we see on a macro level in Turkey's economy overall?</h4><p>It is important to increase the savings quota in Turkey. Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan's announcements mark a rise in savings in 2013, and I believe that pensions do play a role in this. In Turkey, we have a problem of high and growing private debt, and this will become a problem in due course. I would even go so far as to say that we might already have an asset bubble. As insurance players in Turkey, we need to do a better job of communicating and convincing all related stakeholders, i.e. customers, the government, regulators, peers, and also connected sectors like banking, into making a story of it. Insurance is a fundamental need for societal development, and we have to leave the foundations in the hands of those who are in a position to manage them. The government, regulators, peers, and banks have to communicate this together to our customers. It will be a great development for Turkish society and the country's long-term growth because we will become more resilient against external shocks, and one strong way to buffer a downturn is insurance. That is something we need to communicate better, and here again Allianz, as the market leader, will play an important role.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The US has been a vocal supporter of the Southern Gas Corridor. What is the importance of Turkey to the project, and the US' regional energy strategy?<br></h4><p>Turkey is recognized as an important transit country for energy resources. The Southern Gas Corridor will bring additional supplies and price competition and bolster both Turkey's and Europe's goal of a liberalized, competitive market for natural gas with greater choice and lower prices for consumers. The December 17 signing of the final investment decision (FID) for Phase II of the Shah Deniz natural gas production project was a tremendous milestone in realizing the Southern Corridor project. I want to underscore the strategic importance the US places on the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor. We believe this is a critical project that will improve the energy security of Europe, Turkey, and Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How is the US working with Turkey in the renewable energy and clean coal sector to increase its energy efficiency and long-term sustainability?</h4><p>We are building partnerships between academic institutions and our national laboratories in the US and Turkey to conduct joint research in the area of cleaner coal to ensure that coal is produced and burned efficiently with the least possible environmental impact. The US also recognizes that coal-fired power is increasing in Turkey, driven by its fast-growing energy demand and domestic coal reserves. This fact opens up numerous possibilities for the sharing of information between our two countries to ensure the minimization of the environmental impact of coal-produced power and to investigate new clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. This year we began a research exchange program with the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), the leading agency for management, funding, and research in Turkey, to work on developing cleaner ways to utilize coal for energy. Turkey is also fortunate to have solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and other resources. The Turkish government is committed to generating 30% of its energy from renewable resources by 2023. This is part of Turkey's efforts to enhance its energy security by diversifying its sources of supply through the development of domestic and renewable resources.</p><h4>What is Washington's view on the Turkish-Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) oil and gas deal that could send Iraqi oil to world markets via Turkey?</h4><p>The US wants to see Iraqi oil from all parts of that country—north to south—reaching global markets in a manner that reinforces regional energy security and allows markets to function optimally to support economic growth. However, oil and gas must be exported and marketed in a way that fulfills all parties' international obligations, and which reflects a constitutionally acceptable agreement between the government of Iraq and the KRG. Our position on energy trade from Iraq has been consistent and remains unchanged. The US does not support oil exports from any part of Iraq without the appropriate approval of the government of Iraq. The US supports a constitutional solution to resolve disputes over the management of Iraq's hydrocarbon resources. Maintaining a united and federal Iraq is a top priority of the US, and we are encouraged by the renewed dialogue between the KRG and the government of Iraq to work out their differences on energy policy. The US does not take sides in Iraq's internal disputes, but encourages both sides to come together in a way that allows all Iraqis to benefit from the country's rich natural resources. We are encouraged by signs of enhanced dialogue between the Turkish and Iraqi authorities in recent months. We are hopeful, too, that the two countries will continue to strengthen their cooperation on energy policy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's first indigenous medium-altitude, high-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the ANKA, is about to enter mass production. What are TAI's future plans regarding UAV development?<br></h4><p>The ANKA medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) class UAV was designed by Turkish engineers and manufactured with the contribution of local industries. The UAV platform and all related subsystems are customized in accordance with Turkish Armed Forces requirements, and it is ready for global market opportunities. A serial production phase agreement for the ANKA program was signed between SSM and TAI on October 25, 2013. Despite being a serial production contract, there are changes in the ANKA design, making it more attractive for local and international customers. Currently, there is interest from a number of countries, and we are keen to take a share of the $45 billion worldwide UAV market over the next 10 years (of which 33% is expected to be spent on MALE UAVs). TAI's key target markets could be listed as countries in the Middle East and the Gulf, as well as North Africa, the Asia-Pacific, and South America. To expand exports, TAI is seeking further opportunities with its allies. Industrial cooperation is becoming increasingly important in global market development activities. We are open to discussion with all interested parties.</p><h4>TAI's rising exports account for roughly half of Turkey's total exports in the defense and aerospace sector. What are your current primary export destinations, and which markets do you plan on entering in the future?</h4><p>The aerospace and defense industries are capital intensive, but create a high level of value-added for the Turkish economy. Between 2005 and 2012, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of Turkey's total exports was 9.51%, whereas Turkey's defense exports rose 17.95%. In 2012, Turkey's total exports were around $150 billion, where close to $1.3 billion came from the defense and aerospace industry, and TAI plays a key role within this framework. In line with our vision of becoming “…a world brand aerospace company with indigenous products and global competitive power," our main export strategy is to penetrate the international market through high-value indigenous products such as the ANKA, Hürkuş, and ATAK.</p><h4>What are your export plans regarding the new Hürkuş training plane?</h4><p>Hürkuş is a program that we are particularly proud of. It represents the ingenious development of a basic trainer, something like the PC-21 class of the Swiss Air Force, the T-6 Texan II in the US, or the KAI KT-1 for the Koreans. However, the one we have has a more powerful engine. At 1,600 hp, it is more powerful than our competitors; only the Swiss have a similar level of power. One of the features of that aircraft is that we have developed it under the aegis of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). And we purposely pursued certification to have the export option. Its development is complete, but the flight tests are ongoing. We expect that with the interest shown by several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and the Turkish government's order, it will become a popular aircraft. I want to emphasize that the standards of the Turkish Air Force are very exacting, whereby any platform that you develop for the internal customer is a good benchmark for international counterparts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your international partnerships influence your business?<br></h4><p>IHS, with over 120,000 clients, mainly has two divisions: cloud provider and systems integrator. We have many strategic partners in both divisions. With each new technology partnership, IHS develops new business channels and opportunities. Strategic partnerships have especially had a great impact on the growth of our systems integrator division. IHS currently works as a systems integrator for various financial institutions, telecoms firms, and large enterprises in the Turkish market.</p><h4>How do these collaborations change the way you work in the market?</h4><p>Cloud service offerings are our core business, and being a dominant cloud provider in Turkey, IHS' client base is already large enough for the market presence needed by a systems integrator. But there is no question that this isn't enough to succeed in the system integrators field. The key to success is vision and quality of service. Being a visionary company, IHS always exploits competitors' lack of innovation. That made IHS a trendsetter in the system integrators field. We usually partner with start-ups, and they are always visionary companies. Giants like IBM soon acquire most of the companies we have partnered. This, of course, has both advantages and disadvantages, but has helped us to position IHS as a reputable, visionary systems integrator in the Turkish market. We maintain our position by investing in new partnerships and the quality of services we offer.</p><h4>What are your main competitive advantages?</h4><p>Vision and quality are, simply put, our biggest advantages. In the systems integration business, high quality can only be achieved with highly qualified engineers. That's where IHS comes in. We have extremely qualified homegrown engineers, while most of our competitors don't. The IHS Cloud can be considered huge, with a 10% local market share in Turkey. It has a very complex design in the scope of engineering and utilizes any available IT technology, as well as the in-house technologies that our engineers have developed. IHS' cloud division acts as an IT academy for our quality workforce. Our engineers, running such a complex architecture, have broad knowledge and expertise on networks, application, and security layers. IHS Cloud supports over 120,000 clients, and our engineers solve more than 1,500 client issues per day. Our elite team is capable of handling very complex integration scenarios, and hence IHS easily differentiates itself from other systems integrators with the quality of work done.</p><h4>How are you expanding your activities in Turkey?</h4><p>The IHS cloud division already has organic growth of 30% per year and, soon, we will be investing in a new 1,000-sqm data center facility in Istanbul. Our systems integration division's growth is mainly related to market trends, client needs, and the scale of projects. For the past two years, IHS has run several mobile device management projects, and in 2013 we completed very large fraud detection and prevention projects for certain banks. In 2014, we will be heavily investing in our big data and business intelligence; we have nine events on our roadmap dedicated to big data. We expect to increase big data awareness and recognition in Turkey.</p><h4>What is your 10-year outlook?</h4><p>In the technology business, a 10-year outlook is not realistic. Forecasts must be made every couple of years because trends change at lightning speed. In 2015, we expect most banking transactions to originate from mobile devices. In that respect, we have positioned ourselves to develop mobile banking security products and solutions for our clients. On the other hand, in a few years, value-added cloud service demand will be on the rise in Turkey and become the de facto strategy for any sized company to completely offload their IT overhead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which sectors of the Turkish economy do you perceive the greatest potential for Güneş Sigorta?<br></h4><p>Every line of business has potential in Turkey because the economy continues to grow and, therefore, the insurance sector grows along with it. Furthermore, the Turkish insurance sector remains under-penetrated, which leaves much room for expansion. There are many large foreign players in Turkey today, all having recognized the country's true potential. This makes for an environment of stiff competition. The motor insurance line is, of course, the main driver, meaning mainly third party motor liability, which, being compulsory, is easy to sell. This said, we're actually decreasing our market share in that area due to the considerable loss it entails. It's simply not a profitable line. Instead, we're increasing our market share in lines such as fire, engineering, marine, bank insurance, and also health. There's a lot of growth potential in those lines, and we've doubled our figures across the board.</p><h4>As the market becomes more competitive, can you elaborate on the advantages Güneş Sigorta has over the newcomers?</h4><p>Our private agency distribution channel is one of our key advantages. Also, our bancassurance channel remains underutilized. VakıfBank is one of the largest banks in Turkey, and Güneş Sigorta is one of the biggest insurance companies. In the past, we didn't need to work together extensively as our private agency distribution channels were performing well. Yet today we recognize the advantage of cooperation with VakıfBank to expand our distribution and sales channels. We have integrated more and have many common projects. This has already resulted in 60pp growth in bancassurance, and we still see considerable room for more. VakıfBank has many retail customers, as do we, and so we can—and have—come together, and are now working on the customer relationship management (CRM) process. So by refocusing our main attention to bancassurance lines, we can take advantage of having a wide bank network to work with, thereby maintaining an advantage over newcomers. At the end of the day, all of the insurance companies essentially sell the same products, and mostly at the same prices. What differentiates one over another is the extent and quality of its distribution channel. If you have that and can manage it well, you have the advantage.</p><h4>What regulatory or legal changes need to be made to further realize this potential?</h4><p>I don't think substantial changes are required. Being candidates for EU membership has already brought our regulatory framework in line with European and international standards. There are new laws regarding insurance, which are in place today. For example, the Treasury now audits the sector, and we have tougher regulations than even the EU. However, some problems remain in terms of claims management, and with the judicial system, but I believe that we'll shortly have financial courts in place. The new law for that has been approved and is on its way. These financial courts will help significantly, especially in motor and third-party motor liability cases, which can drag on in the current court system. Spain has done this, and we will have a similar system. It is estimated to be implemented during 2014. Other than that, there's no need for further regulations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are international projects such as the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) and the Turkey-KRG pipeline positioning Turkey to become an energy hub?<br></h4><p>TANAP is a crucial project both for Turkey and Europe. TANAP is scheduled to carry 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz II field in the Caspian Sea, one of the world's largest gas fields. Energy-hungry Turkey will receive 6 bcm of natural gas, while 10 bcm, approximately the equivalent of 1.5% of Europe's total consumption, will flow to Europe. The Turkish section of the pipeline will stretch approximately 1,800 kilometers and require approximately 2 million tons of steel pipes. Six of the 18 steel pipe suppliers involved in the project are from Turkey. TANAP will, therefore, create 5,000 jobs across 21 of our provinces. The TANAP project is slated to be operational as of 2018, having created employment in the cities it passes through, as well as for the participating domestic steel pipe manufacturers. Additionally, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) gas pipeline projects hold great importance in terms of Turkey's status as an energy hub. Likewise, the Turkey-KRG pipeline project holds much promise for Turkey. Dependent on expensive energy imports, Turkey is trying to secure and diversify energy routes to keep its steadily growing economy moving forward. We are determined to become a regional energy hub by leveraging both our strategic and geopolitical position. To this end, we will rapidly continue endeavors toward transportation of Caspian, Middle Eastern, and Middle Asian energy resources to Europe and the world market.</p><h4>It has been estimated that Turkey's energy sector will require annual investments of $8 billion to $10 billion for the next decade to meet energy demands. How can Turkey increase the investment attractiveness of its energy sector to reach this target?</h4><p>Turkey is committed to an energy investment of $100 billion over the next 10 years. The Ministry is set to invest over TL1 billion in coal-fired plants within the framework of environmental investment. Moreover, renewable energy is highly important for Turkey and, by 2023, we aim to meet 30% of domestic electricity demand from local renewable energy sources. As the government, we have implemented the necessary legal framework for the energy sector to reach the status it deserves. We would also like to see foreign firms investing in Turkey across the energy spectrum.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's medium-term privatization goals?</h4><p>The energy sector saw a successful privatization period in 2013. We completed the sale of electricity distribution services smoothly, whereby Turkey earned $13 billion from the privatization of 21 regional electricity distribution grids in total. In 2014, we will focus on the privatization of electricity generation plants and expect to earn the same level of revenues.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Turkey's energy sector for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>Turkey has enjoyed strong political stability over the past decade and has solid opportunities in the energy sector. Indeed, those keen on investment in Turkey can expect to receive government support.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-liberalized-generation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the liberalization and privatization of Turkey's energy sector?<br></h4><p>The liberalization of the Turkish power markets began in 2001 with the introduction of the electricity market law, while we launched our own investments in this sector at the end of 2006. When we began to invest, we had expectations in terms of the further liberalization and privatization of the market. The Turkish power sector is moving ahead into a fully liberalized scheme; however, there are steps that remain to be taken. An important step has already been included in the revision of the electricity market law, approved by parliament in spring 2013, which is the establishment of an energy exchange. This exchange will enable the trading of futures and derivatives, which will bring the Turkish market to a European level in terms of liberalization. This power exchange will be established with private sector participation. This is also an important step as it will be a joint public-private entity. This will contribute to the transparency of the market and secondly to providing references for future pricing in the market, which is important from an investor's perspective in terms of visibility of the market's future. All distribution in Turkey is already in private hands, and the privatization of the large-scale state-owned generation assets began in 2013. There are also a number of important thermal power plants, which have already been privatized. Now, there are four further projects on the agenda, which will also contribute to the liberalization of the market. Ownership-wise, the state share of generation is at around 40%, which is an excellent achievement. On the supply side, the state market share is still at 60%, which needs to decrease to spur competition. We started our investments in the generation segment in the expectation of a competitive, liberal market, and we are clearly getting there. Today, Turkey has the capacity to cover its power demand. The fundamental characteristic of the Turkish power market is increasing demand. In 2013, for various reasons, such as the weather, the demand for power decreased. In the meantime, the Turkish sector has achieved an installed capacity that covers demand for 2014. Historically, over past decades, Turkey has always faced electricity shortages due to a capacity shortfall; however, the liberalization of the market attracted such investment volumes that we do not face this problem today. Turkey annually requires around 4,000 MW to 5,000 MW. With the necessary investments into transmission network and so on, this is roughly an investment need of around $10 billion a year. In order to secure this, the market needs to liberalize and privatize further.</p><h4>What has to happen to attract the necessary investment levels?</h4><p>Any investor looks for a growing market. There is also new capacity coming online in Turkey, both in thermal energy and renewables. And it is increasingly efficient; we are a pioneer in this. Our existing combined-cycle plant is the most efficient in Turkey. Our coal plant, set to become the most efficient among its peers, will come online in 2015. With regard to our hydro and wind plants, we are aiming for the highest efficiency possible. New technologies will render us more competitive in this growing market. Nowadays, there is an overcapacity in the market, which pressures profitability. However, in a growing market, overcapacity is a problem for a year or two before supply gets tight again. Pursuing further liberalization steps is essential in order to sustain secure and competitive growth of the electricity market.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Enerjisa?</h4><p>This company is, and will remain, one of the leading players in the Turkish power market in terms of size. Beyond our 5,000 MW target, which we will have up and running by 2017, we target a capacity of 7,500 MW by 2020, which will then respond to more or less 10% of overall generation. We already cover 10% of the Turkish market with our sales and supply, but not with generation alone. We are also aiming to have an IPO of Enerjisa probably in the second half of 2016, although this depends on prevailing market conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's defense sector had a record-breaking year in terms of exports in 2013, but there is still some way to go before achieving the $5 billion export goal for 2023. What efforts are being made by the Ministry to help reach this target?<br></h4><p>First of all, reaching the aforementioned goal requires long-term effort. We are expecting much more over the coming years. Our major platforms, such as the Altay main battle tank (MBT), the MİLGEM combat ship, the ANKA UAV, the T-129 ATAK helicopter, and the Hürkuş training aircraft, will shortly reach full-scale production, and we expect these major platforms to play important roles in reaching our 2023 targets. In addition to reaching these targets, we are confidently moving forward by placing more of an emphasis on cooperating with universities, R&amp;D centers, and the Turkish Council for Scientific and Technical Research (TÜBİTAK), and accelerating technology generation, as well as developing cooperation between industries and universities. On the other hand, to promote our defense industry and capabilities, as well as penetrate new markets, we have been opening defense industry contact offices in Riyadh, Washington, DC, Astana, and Brussels. We are also planning to activate a new office in 2014 in Addis Ababa, where we value the important potential for our defense and aviation industry. Moreover, we study financial tools in order to promote export mechanisms, working with TÜRK EXIM Bank to create a defense industry credit mechanism. Governments will then be able to apply for credit when procuring Turkish defense industry products. In addition, the Undersecretariat for the Defense Industry is also drafting a new law to facilitate government-to-government sales of defense and aviation products and services.</p><h4>How has the nature of joint ventures and partnerships between local and foreign defense companies changed over the past decade?</h4><p>International joint ventures are becoming increasingly popular in the business world to reduce the risk associated with major procurement programs. Due to recent developments in the Turkish defense industry, product- and technology-based ventures became more possible for both Turkish and foreign companies. These ventures are viewed as a practical vehicle for knowledge and technology transfer  from multinational expertise to local companies. Such knowledge transfers can contribute to the performance improvement of local companies. Licensing collaboration and joint ventures will continue to grow in importance for the production of major weapons systems, especially for the first-tier producers.</p><p>With the growth of technology and costs, contractors are likely to increasingly turn to licensing collaboration and joint ventures, thereby stimulating the further internationalization of the industry. The changing nature of demand will continue to lead changes in the structure of the industry. Companies will need to restructure further across borders in regard to joint ventures and partnerships with international companies. While defense companies rely on domestic procurement and support for exports, they are likely to continue internationalizing, particularly in their supply chains.</p><h4>Which international markets do you consider have high export potential for Turkish defense products?</h4><p>The MENA region and Central Asia are at the forefront due to geographical proximity, high demand, and historic and cultural ties. The South Asian region also represents some of the world's most significant defense buyers. In addition, Sub-Saharan African countries' budgets rose in 2013, and present long-term opportunities for defense companies. Therefore, there is a business opportunity for competitive defense products in these markets. In the long term, we can also foresee Latin America as a market where most nations seek partners other than conventional US and EU defense manufacturers. Therefore, there is huge potential in this region as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What plans does Zorlu Energy have in relation to Israeli gas?<br></h4><p>We signed a gas purchase agreement (GPA) with EMG during the construction of the Dorad project, which was supposed to bring gas from Egypt, and this is how we undertook the construction. Subsequently, however, the security situation in Egypt deteriorated and gas exports were limited. By that time, Israel had developed a new field, and we signed the first gas agreement with Tamar Partners. While we were in negotiations with the delegation, experts discovered Leviathan, the second major field. Once the LNG terminals are ready in the US, the initial target is to send the gas to Japan to reduce prices. As Japan shuts down its nuclear power stations, it will need a huge amount of gas and that should come from the US, where the commodity is cheap. Over the coming years, gas prices in Japan will decline because of the US and Australia. In that regard, I do perceive a market for an LNG contract.</p><h4>Would you say that Turkey is the best market for Israeli gas?</h4><p>Our government does not object to bringing in Israeli gas, because it will diversify risk and further liberalize the market. Currently, the market is controlled by five different companies, with which there is limited scope for negotiation. Therefore, Israeli or Iraqi gas entering Turkey would create a more competitive environment. There are some who oppose this idea, but from the commercial perspective it benefits both sides. Like others, we are in talks with Delek Group, but have yet to sign on the dotted line. Currently, there is no way we can bring the gas from Israel to Turkey because we lack an import license. Anyone with a connection to this issue will attempt to be a part of this deal. It is truly huge because Delek Group and ExxonMobil also own Cyprus Gas. It obtained all requisite licenses in that area, but only explored one site and is undertaking additional exploration. The company talked about a possible 10 bcm, but this could probably be doubled, or even rise to 30 bcm.</p><h4>Which areas are ripe for hydrocarbon exploration?</h4><p>We have certain licenses in this area, especially in Anatolia, and have obtained a new license in the East of Turkey. We have the potential to rise to 300 MW to 400 MW over the next three years, which is significant. Turkey's energy watchdog the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) has also stated its target of 600 MW by 2023, the 100th anniversary of the Turkish Republic. I think this could rise to 1,000 MW over subsequent years—Turkey could consume half of this capacity itself. It is a small but niche market, and a highly technical field. Some companies make mistakes, and initial exploration bears huge risk if proven to be fruitless, although the potential to generate huge revenues is there. As of today, we hold three licenses; one is active for 100 MW, the second is in the area of exports, and the third is in the East of Turkey, where we still need to explore. We will have received the seismic results by late 1Q2014 and will then decide whether or not to sink a well. We believe that we have the know-how and would like to use it not only in Turkey, but also abroad. The regulatory framework is critical in any such undertaking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is MKEK collaborating with institutions, such as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), to modernize the Turkish Armed Forces?<br></h4><p>Over the last 10 years, investments in R&amp;D have boomed in both public and private companies, mainly due to the government's support for R&amp;D and a massive pile-up of data. In the previous 30 years, Turkish researchers would get trained overseas, whereas now there are over 180 universities spread all over the country. R&amp;D is time-consuming. You need to train the right human resources and keep them up-to-date with recent international experiences and advances in R&amp;D outside the country. Turkey doesn't boast oil and gas reserves that would speed up the economy, but the country has been extensively investing in human resources over the last 20-30 years, and in education in particular. This has enabled the collection of data to be applied for the further development of the economy. Investment in R&amp;D is not as high as in South Korea or the US, but it is growing year by year. MKEK invests around 2.5% of its annual profit into R&amp;D. Apart from that, R&amp;D is supported financially by the government and a few other organizations. Roughly $100 million has been invested in ongoing R&amp;D projects supported by the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM), the Ministry of Defense, and the government. It is essential to move forward to meet the forthcoming challenges and keep up with the industry, because the global defense market is narrowing and competition is getting fierce. In a way, it is necessary to become a major global player in the defense and aerospace market to ensure we can provide for the Turkish Armed Forces. R&amp;D is of vital importance for the defense sector.</p><h4>What are your strategies to maintain or expand your position globally?</h4><p>To secure a leading position in the global market, it is necessary to collaborate with other companies in the sector and cooperate with the government. We work in close collaboration with TÜBİTAK. Some time ago, most of our products were designed overseas and produced under license. But it is no longer possible to rely on this method to set production targets. We have worked hard to expand our R&amp;D budget in the past 10 years. We are open to international partners and are currently working with companies of strong reputation. These partnerships are potentially beneficial to the Turkish defense industry.</p><h4>What are your main export markets, and which others do you see as having high potential for your products?</h4><p>If you consider numbers, our main target area is the Gulf region, the Far East, Africa, and Central and South America. Lately, we have started prioritizing the Northern America region, too. Obviously, the defense market in Europe is shrinking and all of our European competitors focus on the Gulf region. Turkey has maintained strong ties with the region throughout history due to cultural connections. This gives us some remarkable advantages over our European competitors in the Gulf region and in the Turkic-speaking countries as well. Moreover, MKEK is a government company. Therefore, we speak on behalf of the government when negotiating contracts. Our Asian and Middle Eastern partners prefer to deal with a reputable and grounded company whose products are not only exported, but also used within the home country. We never export products that are not used in our armed forces.</p><h4>What are your targets and goals for the end of this year?</h4><p>We are looking to improve our position in North America, and in the US, in particular. For quite a long time, we were not paying enough attention to the US civilian market. The civilian market has been growing parallel to the shrinking of the military market. We must take the advantage of this and take our chances in these circumstances. The quality of our products has been acknowledged, and we are planning to reach $70 million in exports in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were Savronik's main accomplishments over the last few years?<br></h4><p>Savronik is a company established in two major sectors: one is defense and the other is transport. We were originally founded in 1986 as a defense company, and we started growing quite rapidly in the transportation sector around 2004. In the defense area, we have started to achieve steady growth, and in 2011 our revenue in the defense sector was around TL13 million. That increased to about TL22 million in 2012 and in 2013 we reached about TL31.5 million in the defense sector. This has been quite a record of growth over the past three years. In 2014, we hope to achieve an additional 34% growth compared to that.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities in Turkey's defense sector for a company like Savronik?</h4><p>Turkey is going through a record military modernization process that began in the mid-1990s, and there are still new major programs, especially related to naval systems and aerospace, which will probably keep the industry busy through to 2023. Of course, that is the centenary of the republic. Much of this business will be to do with communications, which is a significant business line for Savronik. Also, Turkey has started to successfully produce some weapons systems, which will continue to generate profits for the companies that participate in their production, not only in Turkey but also in the export markets for these products that have started to grow, albeit from a low base. Therefore, my expectation is that we will see over the next 10 years, at least, a very similar rate of growth for the Turkish industry. Despite the fact that the industry is performing well in increasing exports, at its current pace this will not be sufficient to offset the drop in local demand. The challenge will be to utilize these years to penetrate international markets with innovative products.</p><h4>How have your export relations with the US developed over the years?</h4><p>We were one of the first Turkish companies to apply to the Turkish Ministry of Defense for an export license to the US, which began in the early 1990s for intervalometers for the F4 aircraft. We still sell that product occasionally to international customers still using the F4. Currently, we aim to conclude agreements in the near future with some US companies for the export of military communications-related technologies that we have been designing. Hopefully, by the end of 2014 you will hear us announce some of these deals.</p><h4>As a country, Turkey has an ambitious 2023 defense goal of reaching $25 billion in exports. How will Savonrik contribute to this?</h4><p>Some of that will be achieved indirectly, because many of the products are subsystems to main weapon systems. Therefore, as the leading Turkish defense contractors for which we are an important supplier increasingly become more export oriented, we will become more export-oriented through these relationships. I think that much of that export growth will be associated with G2G relationships. That will be part of the equation, but the other part of the equation is what we have to do on our own. Our strategy there is to take the example of the development of the Turkish defense industry, which is based on the strategic requirements of the Turkish military to source critical technology locally. Recognizing that other countries will have similar needs and also view the defense industry as strategic, and obviously with the permission and coordination of the Ministry of Defense, we envision setting up international partnerships including elements of technology transfer and local set-ups. This will provide us, we believe, with good leverage vis—í —vis our international competitors that are less willing to share their technology with other companies and countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What programs or initiatives from the Ministry to increase the country's technological capacity have seen the most success?<br></h4><p>Our Ministry is determined to support and improve R&amp;D and innovation activities as its duty and prime field of activity in order to develop the technological capacity of the country. These activities are being supported by the many programs we have implemented. In this context, our Ministry is actively carrying out support programs such as technology development zones (TGB), an industrial thesis program (SAN-TEZ), R&amp;D centers, a techno-entrepreneurship capital support program, and other support programs aimed at increasing visibility and encouraging marketing. Our Ministry not only provides infrastructure support for TGBs, which are established within or nearby universities as a platform-hosting collaboration between the university and industry, but also provides support and exemptions for the companies, entrepreneurs, and academics operating within the TGBs. A project contract is signed between the Ministry and the companies that carry out projects within the scope of the SAN-TEZ, which is implemented with the aim of institutionalizing public sector-industry-university collaboration and increasing R&amp;D performance in the country in case the project is considered eligible for support by the Evaluation Committee. While projects are supported within the scope of the program at a rate of 75%, the cost of the remainder is covered by the enterprises themselves. Enterprises that perform R&amp;D activities within the country carry out their innovation programs with a defined subject, duration, budget, and personnel requirements and employ at least 50 R&amp;D personnel, becoming certified as R&amp;D centers by the Evaluation Committee. These enterprises also benefit from the incentives and exemptions stated in law. We have launched the techno-entrepreneurship capital support program in order to transform the business-related and technology- and innovation-oriented ideas of qualified young people into enterprises that create value-added and have the potential to create qualified employment, thus stimulating the culture of entrepreneurship. We grant a maximum TL100,000 a year to entrepreneurs considered worthy of gaining support within the scope of Law No. 5746. We also provide support for local enterprises in our country within the Technological Product Advertisement and Marketing Program in order to introduce and market the technological products that are developed as the result of R&amp;D activities.</p><h4>How would you assess your current position in the country's ongoing e-transformation process?</h4><p>An e-transformation generally enables information and communication technologies to be used more intensively in the exchange of information, services, and goods between public institutions and organizations and individuals and enterprises, while providing faster, more productive, and cost-efficient works and transactions. For a successful implementation of the e-transformation process, it is important to collect all public data at a single center.</p><h4>How would you characterize the level of foreign interest in Turkey as an R&amp;D base?</h4><p>Economic growth and a positive environment have triggered an increase in foreign investment. Many of these investments have been made in the field of R&amp;D. Within the scope of Law No. 5746, companies that carry out R&amp;D activities in the country, employ at least 50 full-time equivalent personnel, and fulfill several other requirements, are certified as R&amp;D centers. These enterprises also merit other incentives and exemptions. This law also directly aims to attract foreign investment to the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the World Bank's most successful programs in Turkey in recent years?<br></h4><p>Our partnership with Turkey dates back many years;the first loan was extended in 1950, and since then we've been involved in numerous different projects. If you're looking at things that stand out as successes,we've had quite a good run in the energy sector, including working with the regulator and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. We have supported the renewables sector and energy efficiency among industrial companies and SMEs with credit lines,and have worked with transmission company TEİAÅž to upgrade the backbone of the transmission system. Now we are working on a smart grid project with TEİAÅž and our colleagues from IFC are doing their own part by supporting private power sector investments. If you put all of that together, you get an idea of how the Turkish energy market has developed over the years, and we have been there every step of the way.We also worked with Turkey on its health reforms, which were so successful in ensuring universal access to healthcare that we are now using the Turkish case as a model for other countries to learn from. We also supported Turkey more than a decade ago in its highly successful banking reform and stabilization program and have assisted the development of the sector ever since through the provision of long-term financing.Of course, we do more than financing; we perform substantial analytical work and, perhaps, one of our most interesting and exciting projects in recent times has involved working together with the newly established Ministry of Family and Social Policies to get more women into the workplace. This is a clear business matter. You could argue that Turkey is only flying with one and a half wings as only 30% of women participate in the labor force.This contrasts with the 53.02% average in the OECD.Our estimates suggest that if you close the gap between male and female labor force participation,which countries like Sweden have done very successfully, Turkey's GDP alone, as a result of that measure, could increase by 30%, which is significant.</p><h4>There has been significant growth in the Turkish economy over the past 10 years, but what are some of the key challenges that you see facing the Turkish economy in the short and medium term?</h4><p>In the short term, emerging markets are facing the normalization of global monetary conditions. This isn't happening at perhaps quite the pace people thought in May 2013, but nonetheless interest rates will certainly rise at some point in the US and quite possibly in the eurozone, too. And, for a country like Turkey, which is so reliant on external financing, high interest rates are likely to dampen growth prospects. In the short term, there is not much room for macroeconomic policy to support growth. Policy makers have to be a little careful about pressures on the exchange rate and on inflation and probably need to accept lower growth. But if Turkey uses this as an opportunity to tackle the underlying structural reasons as to why it is so reliant on international finance, it may actually be a good thing. The structural issues around the current account deficit are relatively independent of global economic conditions. Turkey doesn't save enough; it needs to boost its competitiveness and attract more long-term financing, particularly FDI. And why does Turkey not save enough? There are a number of reasons for this and the government is dealing with some of them, particularly on the consumer side. But, on the corporate side, some Turkish companies, particularly SMEs, are not profitable enough to save. And that's related to not being sufficiently competitive. If you want to be more competitive, you need to upgrade technology, and for that you need to invest more, and for that you need to have access to long-term financing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How vital is Turkey's involvement in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) for the future of the economy?</h4><p>Approximately 45.2% of Turkey's total exports ($68.6 billion) and 41.8% of its imports ($105.3 billion) was represented by trade with TTIP members as of 2013, meaning that the country's involvement with the Partnership is crucial. The TTIP process is thus expected to be a game changer in global trade. Moreover, with the TTIP being described as the “NATO of the economy," its members are some of Turkey's main strategic and political partners in terms of its foreign, economic, and trade policies. However, what distinguishes Turkey from any other country wanting to be a part of the TTIP is the Turkey-EU Customs Union and its Model Partnership with the US. In fact, due to the Customs Union with the EU, Turkey will be directly affected by the TTIP not only in commercial, but also in legal terms. According to WTO rules and the Turkey-EU Customs Union, both sides are required to conclude parallel free trade agreements (FTAs) with third countries for the proper functioning of the Customs Union. Therefore, Turkey is willing to conclude a parallel FTA with the US. Otherwise, the absence of such a parallel FTA would not only create asymmetry in the Customs Union, but also contradict WTO rules since the EU and Turkey would apply different preferential regimes toward the US. Moreover, without such a deal, players in Turkey and the EU would not benefit from different market access opportunities in the US market. More specifically, Turkish operators would face unfair competition and less advantageous market access conditions compared to their EU counterparts in the US. Furthermore, this asymmetric structure always runs the risk of trade deflection for Turkey. The principle of free circulation of goods in the Customs Union allows goods imported from FTA partners to benefit from the preferential regime as well. Consequently, products originating in the US would be able to freely move into Turkey through the EU. On the other hand, within the margin of our relations with the US, an FTA between Turkey and the US, in conjunction with the TTIP, will establish an essential concrete legal framework for our economic relations based on the Model Partnership. Turkey strongly believes that an FTA will serve up mutual benefits since it is eligible to craft better market access and investment conditions for both sides through the establishment of a concrete legal basis for bilateral economic relations. Such an FTA will also mutually guarantee and consolidate bilateral market access requirements under legal terms, and that will increase predictability and transparency for bilateral trade. With regard to its prospective political ramifications, an FTA between a significant global player like the US, and a regional one like Turkey, will definitely contribute to prosperity and stability in the region. All in all, concluding a comprehensive FTA with the US would not only bring about dynamism and a new dimension to our strategic relations with the US, but also for our political and economic relations with the EU. Furthermore, the FTA is expected to create a similar effect that the Customs Union, which entered into force in 1996, had on the Turkish economy, considering its transformative potential and dynamics in line with modern global economic systems and needs.</p><h4>In 2013, Turkey's CAD rose by $16.5 billion over the 2012 figure. How is the Ministry working to reduce this gap in 2014?</h4><p>The Turkish economy is still in a phase of transformation. The technological content of manufacturing and product diversity has been increasing, but it is a gradual and long-term process that requires a structural shift. Turkey faces difficulties in maintaining sustainable growth without increasing the CAD due to the import dependency of production and exports. Low savings rates and a high trade deficit are the underlying factors of this structural problem. In 2013, developments in the gold trade also played a significant role in the widening of the CAD. When non-monetary gold trade is excluded, the CAD decreased by 1.8% in 2013 compared to 2012. In addition, import demand was fuelled by domestic demand in 2013. In order to resolve this structural problem in the long term, the Ministry of Economy is developing policies to reduce the trade deficit with an overall perspective on the investment-production-export chain. The measures aim both to increase exports and to reduce imports and the growth rate of imports. The Export Strategy of Turkey for 2023, the Export-Oriented Production Strategy, the Input Supply Strategy, and the New Investment Incentive Scheme form the basis of our policies. By 2023, on the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, the strategic goal for foreign trade is to increase the share of Turkey in world merchandise trade and to expand merchandise exports to $500 billion. We aim to ensure sustainable growth in exports, improve Turkish exporters' competitiveness, and increase domestic value-added in tradable industries by implementing new policies.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to further increase the economy's FDI pull?</h4><p>FDI is one of the most important factors in boosting the growth rates and welfare levels of countries by supporting investments in economies experiencing savings gap problems. On top of that, FDI provides host countries a healthy channel for technology transfer, new employment opportunities, and extended market access for local production. These expected outcomes encourage developing economies to attract more FDI. As you know, we have observed a decline in FDI flows in the world economy in recent years. According to UNCTAD's 2013 World Investment Report, the negative influence of the current fragility and uncertainties in the world economy on FDI is forecast to continue over the coming years. And while the negative effects of global fluctuations have been perceived in many economies, Turkey has been able to manage these fluctuations successfully. According to the UNCTAD report, in 2012, Turkey ranked 24th in the world in attracting FDI, moving two places up on the previous year, also ranking first within western Asia and 14th among emerging economies. Having attracted cumulative FDI of only $15 billion prior to 2002, Turkey has received over $136 billion over the last decade. In accordance with Turkey's 2023 targets, FDI as a share of Turkey's GDP is currently close to 1%, with 3% being the target.</p><div class="quote">“FDI provides host countries a healthy channel for technology transfer, new employment opportunities, and extended market access for local production."</div>]]></richbody1content>

How has the company specifically achieved this in Turkey?<br></h4><p>For us, sustainability is a balance—if even one element is missing, the solution won't work. In 2013, we went on a world tour to promote sustainability, and the final stop was here in Istanbul, which really shows how important we consider Turkey for our future corporate development. We believe that we all have to change our consumption habits. And, very often, if you want to really come to a completely new level of sustainability, chemistry is an enabler. On the topic of solar energy, chemicals are needed to build new types of batteries that have a higher storage capacity, and wider applications. We conduct work of great complexity in the industrial sector, including the automotive segment. The automotive industry is in fact a prime example; the trick is to make vehicles more lightweight so they consume less energy or fuel. To improve the quality of fuel, we also have gasoline and diesel additives that help engines to get the most out of it. That is just one of many smart solutions we offer. We are also looking into solar cells on cars that capture light and produce energy; thus, reducing fuel burn. And this means that we need to enable our clients to find better solutions. In sustainability terms, it is important to look at the value chain, and that means that we are in constant discussions with our suppliers to reduce their environmental footprint. We also talk to our customers, again, starting on the supply chain side, then move on to applications and solutions. Here, we find ourselves in the driver's seat.</p><h4>In late 2013, BASF created an Emerging Markets division, with its headquarters in Istanbul. Why was Istanbul selected as the location?</h4><p>At BASF, we are constantly enlarging our local presence and becoming one of the most attractive companies in the country—both as an employer and as a business partner. That is why we decided to re-locate our headquarters for the region CIS-Middle East-Africa from Germany to Istanbul. From Istanbul, directly connected with Europe and Asia, we can arrange a vast and complex emerging region covering more than 80 countries. Turkey is also a good example for the increasing importance of rising economies.</p><h4>How would you assess Turkey's R&amp;D potential for BASF?</h4><p>R&amp;D appears as an important aspect in terms of sustainability, not only for the innovation of our existing products, but also for developing new products. Our main R&amp;D laboratories are in Germany, China, and North America. In Turkey, we have some laboratories that focus on the “D" side of R&amp;D, to adapt to market needs and regional habits. We have two laboratories in Kocaeli, where we have a technical lab that helps in product development and in formulating technology together with our customers to reach new solutions. Then, we also have experts with a deep understanding of customer industries. Manufactures in Turkey are facing new challenges, one being the cost of energy, which is quite high, and the other fragmentation. This is all being compensated for by the deep skills of local engineers who run manufacturing and optimizing processes. Yet, to create something wholly original, two things would have to change. Turkey has to move toward a more knowledge-based society, and the key to making this happen is the English language. The other aspect is related to R&amp;D as an investment for the future. Turkey needs to generate margins that allow it to deploy resources into this area.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the chemical sector in Turkey?</h4><p>BASF produces numerous strategies as a guideline for advancement, and that always ensure a long-term outlook. We are in discussions with industry associations to transform the chemical industry in Turkey and render it more competitive. That means overcoming fragmentation, which in turn means developing preferred areas of investment with world-class infrastructure. This will certainly take time. We also need investment security, which is vital, not least for a chemicals company, where investments are made with a 30-50 year lead-time.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your contribution to the development of the financial sector in Mexico, and what is the significance of the Mexican market for your brand?</h4><p>Volkswagen Leasing has been in Mexico for more than 40 years, and Volkswagen Bank for more than six. During that time our companies have significantly contributed to the expansion of the automobile financing sector, as well as to the sales of the Volkswagen Group in Mexico. Since we opened our doors, our main focus has been the satisfaction of our clients; this includes the brands of the group, the dealers, and the final customers. We have always cared about developing the best variety of products for our clients, namely products that not only are innovative but also greatly customer oriented, and our performance in the Mexican market shows that we are succeeding; in 2013, we sold over 75,000 financing contracts, and in 2014 we are planning to sell around 80,000.</p><h4>What new products are you launching in this market?</h4><p>Innovation is central to our strategy. Volkswagen Bank, as the first direct bank constituted in Mexico, is a great example of this. It is in the same vein that for both, Volkswagen Bank and Volkswagen Leasing, the design and launch of innovative and customer-oriented products is essential; these products set a real difference in the market. For example, we recently launched a program that embodies our sense of responsibility toward the environment; “Think Blue Finance," and that does not have equal in Mexico. This program considers complete financing packages with additional benefits for the customers that buy an environmental friendly car. This program was created in Mexico and is considered as a best practice for Volkswagen Financial Services worldwide.</p><h4>What is the extent of your social commitment?</h4><p>For us, establishing an ethical and social connection with as many levels of the country as possible is crucial. Therefore, we aim to behave as an excellent corporate citizen. Toward the outside of our organization, we have established partnerships that allow us to work effectively in contributing to improving the conditions of several vulnerable groups and the opportunities of society as a whole in what we consider as two pillars of human development: education and culture. And toward the inside of our organization, we are deeply concerned to be great employers, providing a context full of opportunities for our human capital—in fact, this 2014 we earned the distinction as a Great Place to Work.</p><div class="quote">“For us, establishing an ethical and social connection with as many levels of the country as possible is crucial."</div><h4>How do you develop local talent?</h4><p>Training and education are important issues for us, as the success of our companies relies on our human talent. In that line, we work in close cooperation with the best universities in Mexico; we approach these institutions to train our staff and, also, to connect with current students and offer them opportunities to enhance their knowledge of the sector and their professional development.</p><h4>What will be the focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>We will continue strengthening our position in the Mexican market because of our unique focus on the client and the quality of service that we provide. We want to grow together with the Volkswagen Group's brands, and we are creating the conditions to make it possible; we continue increasing our share in their growth. Currently, of every 100 cars from the VW Group that are sold, we finance 40, and although we are in quite a good position, we have to keep improving that number.</p><h4>How do you perceive the potential of the market in general, and what trends can you identify?</h4><p>We perceive that, for our client, a financing contract is no longer enough; customers want an entire package of solutions for their needs. Because we have identified this trend very early, we have been pioneers in developing programs and services that truly embody the concept of total mobility. Our financial solutions can be accompanied by a variety of products and services; the insurance of a vehicle and its maintenance, for example. Regarding the economic setting of Mexico, one important element to consider for us in our visualizations of the future has been the financial reform. And we recognize its possible positive impact in the market's competitiveness, by obliging all its participants to improve their offering of products and services.</p><h4>How do you perceive the future of the automotive sector in Mexico?</h4><p>We see that many companies are establishing production plants here—Audi's will be opening soon, just 60 kilometers away from our facilities, for example. This speaks about the importance of Mexico for the global automotive industry. This country is no longer considered because of the possibility of finding cheap labor, but because of other differentiators, such as quality and logistics; they play an important role in the manufacturers' decisions to set up business here. Recently, Volkswagen celebrated 50 years of presence in Mexico, and our Group's CEO referred to the importance of the country for Volkswagen. And indeed, we still see a big growth potential in this market, and we trust in it. Puebla, for instance, has the second-largest Volkswagen production plant in the world; we are proud because we are contributing, even more, to the growth of the already great presence of Volkswagen in Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Parsifal Partners differ from its competitors?</h4><p>Parsifal Partners is a three-year-old consulting and strategy firm designed to do three things. The first is to provide consulting services. Through this, we provide strategy, business plan development, turnaround assistance, business-process engineering and re-engineering, supply chain management, and revenue assurance. Our target sectors for these services include the following: financial services, manufacturing, energy, real estate, and infrastructure. We have also taken on a few assignments that have allowed us to broaden our scope to include technology and agriculture. Our choice in target sectors is important, because we believe much of the future opportunity for this country lies within these. Technology, in particular, is very interesting because it allows you to leapfrog your problems—just look at what happened in Asia. Our second service is our advisory business, which is basically financial intermediation. We match needs for capital with sources of capital. We help businesses to access the right form of capital for their needs. There is a large market for that here, because, unlike more developed countries, the breadth of capital sources, though growing, is still limited. The third aspect of our business is origination. Here, one of our first initiatives was to establish  a wealth management firm, Fiducia Capital. There's a bit of history behind the name but, in summary, Fiducia is translated from the Italian word for trust. Fiducia Capital is an SEC-registered portfolio and fund manager. Ike Onyia leads this aspect of our business, having garnered the relevant experience and track record in that industry, including starting two successful firms from scratch. This combination of consulting and financing has translated, for our target market, into a compelling case. We also pride ourselves on the intellectual capacity of our faculty to engage in finding solutions for our clients. Furthermore, we provide senior-level, hands-on commitment on our projects, which is a key differentiator.</p><h4>What is preventing Nigeria from fully adopting a strategic vision when it comes to business?</h4><p>There are several answers. Decision-making is influenced by our country's historical and cultural circumstances. For a long time, we largely operated on a short-term basis, as reflected by our planning methodology (three-year, short-term rolling plans). This was also reflected in our financing sources, whereby three-year financing was deemed to be long term in nature. This is all changing now. First, we have enjoyed some form of political stability having undergone four electoral processes since 1999. These all assist to enshrine democracy, and you can see the results in the evolution in the planning methodology of most public institutions; the federal government and Lagos State in particular all are developing and implementing long-term visions. Next, we need to understand that the profile of several institutions in Nigeria is entrepreneurial and these individuals are approaching a natural stage whereby decisions of reinvestment in the business and/or succession are predominant. When you reach this point, you're forced to think long term. The spate of reforms is also contributing positively to the reorientation to long-term planning. For example, with the reforms in the power sector, the various actors are all planning long term; the federal government has developed a detailed road-map and some states like Lagos have pushed the envelope with even more aggressive plans in this sector.</p><div class="quote">“Political stability provides the peace of mind that stimulates demand from the populace."</div><h4>How do you see communications between the federal government and Lagos' state government? Are they harmonic?</h4><p>There are issues, but they are no different than you what you would find elsewhere. On serious issues, they tend to agree. On issues such as security, sovereignty of the country, and safety of citizens, there is no doubt that the federal and state governments agree. Of course, political influences emerge once in a while. It also helps that, despite existing challenges, we are dealing with a more stable environment. Democracy, as a form of governance, re-commenced in 1999, and one of the first challenges was to successfully transition from one democratic government to another. As democracy matures, so will relationships between different arms of government.</p><h4>How does government stability influence your sector?</h4><p>It influences the consulting and investing sectors in several positive ways. Political stability provides the peace of mind that stimulates demand from the populace, such as the demand for improved products and services. This in turn provides the right type of pressure on the elected officials for them to perform. Once you are in this situation, there is adequate scope for seeking professional assistance such as ours. Political stability also provides the platform for innovation, which is a key driver of development. Nigeria is at that point in its development whereby there is a congruence of high demand for products and services, low infrastructure base, positive reforms, and a growing awareness, particularly among the majority younger members of the populace. It's a challenge but a positive one that Nigeria and our sector can take advantage of.</p><h4>Is there any particular sector that is in particular need of foreign investors?</h4><p>In spite of the well-known need to diversify the economy, the energy sector remains critical to Nigeria, particularly oil and gas. The industry's value chain comprising upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors requires a significant injection of capital. The scale of capital required, on an ongoing basis, is best obtained from a variety of sources, local and, clearly, international. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), when passed into law, will help to define the fiscal regime, sanctity of contracts, and essentially facilitate access to long-term capital commitments by all stakeholders. The recently promulgated Nigerian Local Content Act has already provided one of the pillars to ensure the swift development of this sector and Nigeria as a whole. The speedy passage and implementation of this legislation will provide the other key pillar and should herald much-needed investment into this sector. If you stretch the definition of energy, you will also want to include the power sector. Nigeria has recently been rebased as a $500 billion economy. This has been achieved on a government-generated output of 3,000 MW of power for 170 million people—power is produced privately and inefficiently through private generators. Imagine if we grew to 20,000 MW. The size of the economy could easily be worth upward of $750 billion. The energy sector is also attractive to foreign investors because it  has the full support of the government, hence the reforms. This provides comfort for investors. Furthermore, some of the economic fundamentals are all in place; strong and growing demand. Consulting firms like ours provide invaluable local knowledge for players in this sector. In terms of other sectors, we think agriculture is also a big one. Because of our demographics, food security is going to be a major issue, as it is globally. The Agriculture Ministry has done a lot of work in providing the framework that investors can and are taking advantage of.</p><h4>Does this also provide for employment generation?</h4><p>Exactly. The development of each of these sectors provides for several layers of employment opportunities across each value chain.</p><h4>Nigerians are known worldwide for their peculiar entrepreneurial-minded spirit. But many, especially among those living in rural areas, are still not aware of the opportunities available out there. How can financial inclusion and literacy be achieved?</h4><p>A number of attempts have been made by the regulators to broaden the spectrum of people included in the financial services universe. For example, the cashless economy initiative, designed, for example, to promote the use of debit cards in business transactions, is gaining momentum. The concept of mobile money transactions is catching on here as well. There is a lot of effort being placed on financial inclusion. Around 60% of our population is below the age of 50 years old, and they are very tech savvy. Whether they are educated or not, they know how to use a phone, which could be a platform for achieving financial inclusion as happened in Kenya.</p><h4>How can the regulatory framework be improved to suit your business and the people's need?</h4><p>With the appropriate monetary and fiscal policies  in place, regulators in the financial services sector can provide guidelines to encourage a variety of service providers to include providers of long-term capital. Right now, short-term lending is readily available through the commercial banks and, perhaps, to the high end of the market. Financing requests below this tier experience challenges in obtaining even short-term loans. SMEs drive and determine economic growth, therefore financial intermediation has to broaden, and appropriate institutions such as investment and merchant banks, microfinance banks, and private equity and venture capital have to emerge. These institutions are appropriately structured to support the capital demand of both large and smaller businesses whose activities will develop the economy. I think we are heading in the right direction, because it is almost like a chicken and egg situation. The early asset-divestment programs generated transactions that initially struggled to obtain local financing. While there were costs borne by those transactions, the finance sector—both local and foreign—learnt valuable lessons. As this practice has evolved into broader reform programs, there's now more appetite for financing and this is reflected by the profile (local) of several of the successful bidders for privatized assets. However, there's still need for more adequate capital sources, e.g. private equity and venture capital. We're also encouraged that this segment of the financing sector in Nigeria is also growing. We just need for it to develop faster.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are the greatest strengths of Abu Dhabi's financial services sector?</h4><p>There are several strengths. Number one has to be the solidity of Abu Dhabi in terms of capitalization. It is secure and nonpolitical. It is a country that you feel is business driven. And it is growing around you and building a sophisticated platform to allow you to do business. With the right laws, technology, infrastructure, and geographical position, you can only succeed. This is what Abu Dhabi offers and these are its strengths.</p><h4>Did these factors draw you here initially?</h4><p>The solid nature of the market attracted me. As a trader I know that clients just want to worry about their position; they don't want to be worried about the government going bankrupt, or whether the company they are trading with is about to go under. We have one of the highest capitalizations in the world in terms of brokerage houses, and this is important for credibility and sustainability.</p><div class="quote">“We have one of the highest capitalizations in the world in terms of brokerage houses."</div><h4>What are the other competitive advantages that ADS offers?</h4><p>The advantage ADS offers is unprecedented in the region. It is a fully fledged investment and financial institution with all the services that a financial institution needs to have—brokerage, online trading, fixed income, and the global market. We offer liquid products that provide traders in the region and abroad with the opportunity to generate profits. The geographical position of Abu Dhabi is also important. When we are awake here and tracking the markets at 7.00 am, it is 3.00 am in London. At 3.00 am, the London chief dealers are asleep. In any market in the world, if the chief dealer is not awake, there is no market. This is where we leverage our geographical position to our advantage. When we first opened, no one believed that we would succeed. Yet today, we are trading billions of dollars in volume, and clients are opening accounts here every day, trading, and using our services. This proves that Abu Dhabi has a geographical position that people want to use, and that it can be a price producer. I want Abu Dhabi to be a market maker. Whether you want to sell Turkish lira, euro, dollar, or the Brazilian real, there will be market makers in Abu Dhabi to take this business. The region will bridge the trading between Asia and Europe and make sure that there is always a good price for all over-the-counter (OTC) products. The announcement of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) puts the laws in place that allows this to happen. People can do business here, just as in London, Geneva, or New York.</p><h4>How does technology improve your services?</h4><p>Anywhere in the world, clients can open an account with us. We have offices here, as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong, and have teams covering all the main financial markets. You can deposit funds, download your platform, and trade. We have a major research department. We have invested heavily in research and information that allow you to have precise information on the markets. ADS representatives appear regularly on regional and international business channels to let traders know how markets are behaving. On the technological side, we have developed our own new generation proprietary platform. This is a first for the UAE and the Middle East. Nonetheless, you can have the best technology, but it won't work alone; you need to have a good price and, above all else, excellent service. You need to support and invest with your client, because only then can you claim to run a company.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

While it is true that trade between our countries has increased over recent years, the total amount in 2012 stood at just $785 million. Nonetheless, we are optimistic because the current context of our economies and our vast similarities allow for increased trade and investment. Firstly, our countries are strategically located within their respective regions and are willing to serve as bridges between vast markets. Turkey is a vibrant, fast-growing economy, and Mexico now has an opportunity to benefit from this renewed relationship in order to expand and consolidate its economic presence in the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa.</p><p>Similarly, Turkey has a new partner in America. Mexico is endowed with a highly skilled and growing work force and is one of the most open and dynamic economies in the world. We have a strong domestic market and a network of 10 free trade agreements (FTAs) with 45 countries. Furthermore, Mexico's position in the world's value chains makes our country an ideal base of operations to access the North American, Latin American, and Caribbean markets.</p><p>To take full advantage of these favorable conditions, Turkey and Mexico have signed important agreements to protect investments, avoid double taxation, launch direct air services, and promote tourism. For instance, ProMexico and Invest in Turkey, as well as Bancomext and Turk Eximbank, have signed instruments to boost reciprocal trade and investment. As a firm believer in free trade, I reason that these innovative agreements will enhance development, promote sustainable growth, and create well-paying jobs in both countries. Furthermore, Mexico is undergoing major structural transformations to become a more competitive nation. In order to unlock our country's full economic potential, my government has signed into law vital reforms to transform the education, telecommunications, finance, and energy sectors. These changes are the result of a major consensus-building agreement among the country's main political parties. Through their implementation, we will promote productivity across sectors and enhance our economic growth. Furthermore, education reform will increase the quality of learning by focusing on teachers' professional development and performance evaluation. Meanwhile, telecommunications reform will expand coverage, reduce consumer prices, and improve the quality of digital services. As for finance-related reform, it will enable financial institutions to grant more loans at more favorable rates; small and medium-sized businesses will have the means to grow and prosper. Fiscal reform will guarantee sound public finances and promote growth by increasing public investment in infrastructure, education, research and development, and welfare services. And finally, energy reform is crucial in increasing our energy security and economic growth, since it allows for greater private investment in the energy sector, while guaranteeing Mexicans' ownership over their vast natural resources.</p><p>By allowing more open markets and leveling the playing field, we seek to increase productivity and ensure that companies operating in Mexico have access to strategic inputs. Mexico is also actively pursuing a complementary foreign policy strategy. In this context, I believe that both Turkey and Mexico can continue to play an active role internationally, as members of the G20 and MIKTA. Comprised of Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, and Mexico, MIKTA can serve as a common platform to exchange opinions, articulate shared policy strategies, and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. Through increased cooperation, our emerging economies can play an increasing role in future global growth, as many analysts and investors already foresee. For these reasons, my government will continue working closely with its Turkish counterpart to encourage forward-looking and innovative thinking, and identify areas of collaboration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has your Ministry played in Ecuador's economic development in recent years?</h4><p>Ecuador's economy is doing well right now—you can see many new infrastructure projects such as roads, airports, and hydroelectric plants being built across the country. By 2016, we will have eight new electric plants operating in Ecuador thanks to the largest investment ever made in the country's history. The situation has changed so much that we even foresee Ecuador exporting electricity to the region by 2016. Some seven years ago, many areas in the country suffered from daily blackouts. The efforts of the public and private sectors to transform the energy system in the country have made this possible. We plan to become one of the leading producers of electricity in the world by 2016, and 93% of this electricity will come from hydroelectric plants. Also, it is important to mention that we already started the tender process for the first highway in Ecuador—the Santo Domingo-Esmeraldas highway. Regarding airports, as many as 21 have been renovated. One such infrastructure project that we can highlight is the Galapagos Airport, which is the first airport in the world to be run completely on renewable energy. On top of all this, we have to praise the political stability the country has achieved in the last few years, because it has made possible the implementation of all these projects. We have also achieved the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the country, being one of the lowest in the region, too. Ecuador currently experiences growth rates above the average in the region and we have controlled inflation.</p><h4>What role does the Production Code introduced by this government play in its efforts to change the production matrix in the country?</h4><p>The 2008 Constitution brought in the new Production Code, a regulatory and legal framework for productive industries in the Ecuadorean economy, which has also boosted the diversification of the economy, the country's export profile, the value-added of those products manufactured in Ecuador, and the inclusion of the private sector in the country's overall productive chain. Investments such as the Refinery of the Pacific, as well as in productive areas such as metal and steel, energy, and shipbuilding, are ongoing efforts to change the productive matrix in the country. These have helped to bring the public and private sectors in Ecuador closer; there are over 400 companies that have stated their interest and willingness to increase production volumes and expand their export profile to contribute to such strategic efforts. There are both large- and medium-sized enterprises among these companies I mentioned. For example, three years ago Nestlé made the commitment to invest $450 million in Ecuador in the next five years. It wants to make Ecuador its operational base for exporting a wide range of local produce to other regional markets. We have seen interest from many multinational companies in establishing local production in order to reduce imports. In the next few years, we will also, for example, boost the consumption of ethanol as a fuel source for vehicles. To that end, we plan to increase sugar cane production to 36,000 hectares across the country, which will create increased job opportunities in the agricultural sector.</p><div class="quote">“The experience of the so-called Asian tigers in transforming their own economies can be useful for Ecuador."</div><h4>How have you been working with the automotive industry to boost local production?</h4><p>We have been holding talks with many companies for this purpose, and we have seen interest from foreign companies planning to establish production operations in Ecuador. I believe that in the next few years we will have many more vehicles available in the market made with parts that have been produced in Ecuador. We want to increase efforts to introduce electric cars in Ecuador, and we have held talks with companies like Nissan to take advantage of our energy matrix and gradually incorporate electric vehicles into taxi fleets for example, as well as encouraging private consumption among the population. This first stage of a broader strategic plan would be followed by a second one in which we would assemble electric batteries in the country, and a third one in which we would actually assemble entire electric vehicles in Ecuador. The implementation of the second and third stages are subject to the success of the first stage. There are many more projects we foresee in this and other economic sectors over the medium term that are envisaged to contribute to the reduction of imports and the increase of exports in sectors and segments where the country has strong potential. We have to keep in mind that we are already a leading exporter of cacao, bananas, shrimp, wood for rafts, and many other products—most of them primary products.</p><h4>What role will innovation and projects such as Yachay play in the future development of Ecuador?</h4><p>Innovation will definitely play a major role, and the City of Yachay project is an important step toward the development of our R&amp;D capabilities. We hope to see the project taking important steps forward during 2014, a year in which we hope to attract investment to this area of our economy by sharing risks with those willing to invest. This would be a way to show our confidence and our conviction that what we do will definitely succeed. The City of Yachay will considerably improve our R&amp;D and scientific capacity in the near future; however, we expect the project to contribute in particular to fields such as nanotechnology and biotechnology. All in all, these initiatives are aimed at transforming the economy of Ecuador and boosting local production by generating greater value-added.</p><h4>What are the challenges that still face Ecuador in its efforts to transform the productive matrix?</h4><p>The challenges are many; however, we have started out on the right path. The experience of the so-called Asian tigers in transforming their own economies can be useful for Ecuador. We are convinced that we will continue to attract foreign investment into Ecuador, which should be another key driver in this process. However, as a challenge in this context, we have to make sure that these foreign investors promote the transfer of knowledge in their operations. Another challenge lies in ensuring that we properly reinvest the profits from Ecuador's natural resource wealth into the development of technology and human resources. We welcome all foreign investors, and invite them to consider the comprehensive list of incentives and the clear legal framework we have in place for their benefit. In this context, we are in a good position to become an entry point for Asian companies looking to expand into Latin America.</p><h4>What role can SMEs play in the transformation of the productive matrix?</h4><p>SMEs already play a hugely important role in our economy, and I believe this will only become more relevant in the near future. We have always said that nobody will be left aside in the transformation of the production matrix. In this context, the government is trying to provide an array of tools to aid their development. We are working to strengthen the ties between SMEs and the public sector in order to do this.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is MADA's mission in Qatar, and what activities are you engaged in to meet the needs of people with disabilities and integrate them into society?<br></h4><p>MADA has a really simple mission, which is to connect people with disabilities to technology, regardless of age, aspiration, or setting. Our mission is to help people with learning, visual, hearing, and physical disabilities to use technology for whatever purpose, and to increase their opportunities in terms of education, employment, quality of life, and social inclusion. We start by assessing clients and offering advice on their own personal technology needs. Having selected a technology, we provide that tool, be it hardware or software, and give the individual the training and technical support needed to utilize it. That's done on an individual basis, and sometimes in small groups. Another significant role of ours is building accessible digital Arabic content, which relates to our final area of activity, which is R&amp;D. We have invested in companies, consortia, sourced technology, and co-proprietary software to bring Arabic-assistive technology to the region. The key consideration is that now we are seeing other organizations within the GCC and elsewhere starting to develop solutions, which allows MADA to shift toward supporting Arabic innovation and creativity, rather than simply transferring existing software.</p><h4>How do your partners, such as Ooredoo, QNB, and Microsoft, help you to achieve these objectives?</h4><p>We consider our role in this system as being that of a trusted intermediary. The concept is that people with disabilities trust us to provide independent advice, while companies and organizations equally trust us to represent the disabled and their needs, as well as to explain how those needs can best be met. In return, those companies provide services and products that can be delivered to people with disabilities and special needs. With Oooredoo and Vodafone, we worked well together by starting an initiative called connected, where both companies offer discounted tariffs, handsets, and accessible web information to people with disabilities. QNB did some really nice work in facilitating the process of purchasing accessible ATMs. Microsoft products are available throughout Qatar, and we make sure people are aware of the accessibility features that such companies have built into their products. We try to make sure that companies exploit the technology they already have for the benefit of all their employees, before they go out and invest in new systems.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the R&amp;D activities of MADA?</h4><p>A number of us had come from assistive technologies backgrounds in other parts of the world, so we had a very strong sense of what was possible. We realized that simply translating those technologies failed to recognize specific linguistic and cultural needs. We also realized that there was no sense of there being a disabled community here. Our R&amp;D function initially looked at the best products, and we approached companies and seed funded the development of those products to support Arabic language and culture. At the time, there were few companies—other than those serving the blind community—that did anything in this area, or even in the region. Mostly, they were either re-sold Western products, or in the case of the blind community, there were one or two products that were specifically designed for Arabic language speakers. Firstly, we built a market within the region. We can now start our own research and development function by examining the gaps. We've partnered the Qatari Computer Research Institute (QCRI) in addressing some of these issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[it-needs-standardization]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the IT sector in Qatar, and how do you see it evolving in the near future?<br></h4><p>The sector is currently experiencing robust growth, amid the emergence of developments. As far as the government is concerned, it is looking for new technology, which is in high demand by construction and infrastructure projects in Qatar. Cyber security is also emerging as a crucial issue for the world and for Qatar, and the IT sector will increase its focus on this area over time. ITQAN is in the business of providing unique solutions, and we attempt to work in parallel to the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of the IT sector in Qatar?</h4><p>While there are numerous new technologies available, they require a public vision and a standardization of the policy and procedures in terms of implementing more advanced security measures. I believe all entities need to be under a single umbrella, and as I understand the Qatari government has indeed started looking to the ministries to play this role. In developing technology, we need to focus on end users too. For example, some people send administration passwords by email, which renders them vulnerable to hacking, while elsewhere CCTV cameras are poorly used. We cannot depend on the end user, meaning developments need to be made in the technology to counter these issues.</p><h4>How do you plan to educate people and avoid these potential security breaks?</h4><p>ITQAN is one of the leading centers in Qatar, and has a huge capacity to provide different training programs. With the Ministry of the Interior, we began providing certification for CCTV controls and the operators and technicians of such systems. I am pushing for all operators using a system, regardless of the brand, to become capable of monitoring and reporting without the support of the technology itself. Wholesale dependence on technology is occasionally prone to failure.</p><h4>What else does your portfolio include?</h4><p>ITQAN is a comprehensive IT and security company. We are partially owned by the government, having been established four years ago. You can be unique by taking a turnkey solution without going to subcontractors. We are doing this step-by-step, and endeavor to innovate across a range of unique areas. Then again of course, we operate our regular IT businesses.</p><h4>How would you describe the trends and the market for IT in Qatar?</h4><p>The market is growing substantially today, and income levels are clearly a major consideration. The population is also rising and salaries are increasing, while retail prices in Qatar remain the same, again fuelling demand. And what's more, the people here like their gadgets. While some countries replace technology every two or three years, this country changes every six months.</p><h4>How do you work with Ooredoo to deliver its products?</h4><p>We provide 90% of the telecommunications services Ooredoo delivers. This range includes bill processing, issuing numbers and SIM cards, and also the corporate side of leased lines and other related services. We want to use a disaster recovery plan with contingencies for some centers using existing services instead of establishing new ones.</p><h4>How do you perceive the future for ITQAN?</h4><p>Our goal remains to deliver a project successfully, and then provide a crucial after-sales service. We are creating an R&amp;D department to mitigate the purchase of technology from external vendors. Over the next five years, we foresee our facilities entering into production. We will also be engaging in discussions with universities, and I am hopeful for projects in this field. Moreover, we are involved in ongoing cooperation with the French government, and this fruitful partnership will shortly encompass a university.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), and what was the strategy behind its establishment?<br></h4><p>QNRF was established back in 2006 as the enabling arm for research within the Qatar Foundation. Since then, there has been a paradigm shift in educational institutions in the country. Qatar University, which used to pride itself on being an educational institution, now considers itself both a research and educational entity. Research is also taking hold in the health sector; the logo of Hamad Medical Center reads, “health, education, and research." This is thrilling for us because people are now recognizing the role of research in the development of the country. This also reflects the vision of HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the Chairperson of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science, and Community Development. All of this is based on the realization of transforming Qatar's economy from a resource-based to a knowledge-based one, with research a crucial pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Without the research component, you cannot transform the country and diversify the economy. Another important aspect is that QNRF has taken the research culture down to its roots, whereby we have introduced research programs to high school students and undergraduates to instill interest.</p><h4>What are some of the successful projects that QNRF is funding, and what wider implications do they have?</h4><p>From my perspective, all grant recipients are success stories. So far, QNRF has committed over $500 million in grants, at all levels. Every researcher or key investigator to have received a grant from us has worked very hard, having earned their grants on a competitive basis—only one out of five applicants receives one—so, from a global perspective, they are all success stories for us. What makes QNRF unique in the region, and arguably the world, is that we are open to international collaboration, meaning that we do not limit our grants to Qatar; we open the door to applicants from beyond the country, creating an excellent collaborative atmosphere and research environment. Initially, more than 50% of applicants came from beyond Qatar, with researchers  keen to take the opportunity of the funding opportunities we offered. This said, we also placed conditions on external applications. We also made sure that a minimum of 50% of the funded research, measured in man-hours, should be made available within Qatar.</p><h4>What evaluations do you carry out to ensure that all sectors in Qatar are explored in terms of R&amp;D?</h4><p>A huge effort undertaken in 2012 culminated in the release of an important document: the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS). Simply put, this strategy states that Qatar should concentrate on four pillars: energy and the environment, healthcare, computer sciences and ICT, and social sciences, humanities, and the arts. For these pillars, we now have national institutes: the Qatar Environment &amp; Energy Research Institute (QEERI), the Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), and the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI). For each pillar, we identified the most compelling challenges faced by the country. Through QEERI, we looked at how to enhance oil recovery, which is crucial as national revenues remain predominantly generated by the petrochemicals sector. We also face environmental challenges, because of Qatar's high carbon dioxide footprint. This is because it is a small country with a large petrochemical industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past decade, Qatar has made incredible strides in education. How have these reforms collectively furnished students with tools to drive Qatar forward?<br></h4><p>From the outset, Qatar University (QU) has embraced the reforms and harnessed the goals outlined in its national vision geared at developing a well-educated population. In our academic research and community service initiatives, we are guiding our students toward acquiring critical knowledge and experience, as well as interpersonal skills and competencies that reflect the needs of the labor market and of society. We spare no effort in this commitment—as the country's national institution, we are proud of our role as a leading partner in the national education reform strategy, and our growing reputation as an institution of academic quality and excellence is testament to this.</p><h4>A number of acclaimed foreign universities have settled in Qatar's Education City. How do you see QU's role within the diverse educational options in Doha?</h4><p>We see ourselves as part of a growing network of partners and collaborators that are committed to fulfilling the goals and values expressed in the national vision and development strategies. This includes universities at Education City as well as government, industry, business, civil society, and regional and international academic institutions. The diversity of educational options can only be a good thing in a country that is in itself welcoming to nationalities from all over the world.</p><h4></h4><h4>QU signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell in June of 2013 that strengthens the partnership the two organizations share through a battery of programs. What plans exist for further affiliations of this kind?</h4><p>As always, we are pleased to strengthen our partnership with all sectors in Qatar. The MoU with Shell was very much appreciated, as it has been a stalwart supporters of QU for many years. These partnerships are important to us, and we have a number of agreements that have resulted in chair positions in areas such as the environment, ICT, Asian studies, railway education, sustainable development, and supply chain, to name a few.</p><h4>How do you balance the international need for strong English skills with the desire to maintain an academic tradition in Arabic?</h4><p>In 2012, we reinforced Arabic as the language of instruction at QU as per SEC decree. QU has always prided itself as the standard-bearer of Islamic values and Arabic culture and traditions. We continue to provide our students with a teaching and learning environment that is very supportive in balancing Arabic and English Language skills so that our students are assured of a quality education that upholds the Arabic academic tradition, while enhancing their literacy in English as they prepare to enter Qatar's fast-growing, globalized society.</p><h4>QU has a farm that grows a variety of plants. What is the university's role in sustainable development as the country moves towards its Vision 2030 goals?</h4><p>QU Farm houses a host of projects, one of which is date palm research—currently we have 19 varieties of date palm from Qatar and the rest of the Gulf region. It is also the site of the first-ever hedgehog-tracking project in Qatar, which is a student-led initiative that has gained wide international interest. The farm will also be used in the final year of our groundbreaking biofuel project; specially designed research waterbeds will scale up growing the cultures that are being prepared for use in the project. We offer courses such as environmental science and engineering, marine conservation as conducted by our state-of-the art research vessel Janan, chair positions in sustainable development and polymers, and green activities that are undertaken in constructing our new buildings, to name a few.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies (QFIS) strive to achieve its vision of becoming a focal point of dialogue and intellectualism?<br></h4><p>We work on a number of fronts simultaneously, starting with the types of degree that we offer. It is the diversity and the structure of the degrees themselves that reflect what is achieved. We open doors to students from all over the world, which in itself is a manifestation of this mission. We have over 40 nationalities among our students, and if you add to that faculty and employees we cross the boundaries of 50 nationalities; the interaction is already there. In our faculty, we collaborate with scholars from all over the world, as well as visiting professors in addition to the permanent professors from some of the most distinguished learning centers worldwide. From the very beginning, we have had a target of linking ourselves with learning centers spanning from North America to Southeast Asia. As such, we have entered into a series of memorandums of understanding (MoUs)—many of which are already active—all over the world. The final front that we are working on is a series of symposiums, seminars, and conferences, whereby once again we interact on topics of interest to a wide range of audiences. The participation reflects international interest in our activities, which determine how our voice is heard and our mission fulfilled.</p><h4>Islamic finance is becoming increasingly important all around the world. Is this reflected in the number of students that are taking courses in Islamic finance?</h4><p>There is no question about it. Students taking Islamic finance represent about 45% of our total. Islamic banking, insurance, and finance companies have developed and are expanding; therefore, we are seeing higher demands for those courses.</p><h4>What makes QFIS stand out in Education City?</h4><p>We were the first post-graduate school in Qatar, and thus pioneered the provision of post-graduate studies. We are the first homegrown institution among some of the top universities in the world to have branches here. There is only one choice; if you cannot be ahead, then you must at least be at the same level, quality wise. That is what we have tried to establish, and what we are trying to maintain. Of course, there is also a wide spectrum of collaboration between these branches and our institution.</p><h4>How does the faculty stand worldwide in terms of Islamic studies?</h4><p>From the very beginning, we thought of creating something that would compliment and fill what we perceived as an area that merited addressing, rather than repeating other legacy models as there are already great Islamic studies schools. We are fortunate to be different, in terms of our offerings; not that we are breaking from tradition, because we have kept that. We receive requests for collaboration from a number of schools that are very happy with what they see in us. We already engage in active collaboration having signed agreements with institutions of the caliber of Oxford University in the UK, HEC Paris in France, and Carleton University in Canada. We are also working with Durham University and Copenhagen University in addition to others in the region. In Spain, we are actively exploring various types of collaboration, and are now trying to extend our arm to Australia. Internationally, we have been invited by the World Bank to participate in its latest symposium on law and development, which allows me to believe that in the global arena we are already doing well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What Strategy led to the development of Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q)?<br></h4><p>WCMC-Q is a medical school that is a part of Cornell University. Cornell University has a medical school in New York City, and we are a branch campus. The strategy of Cornell University is to enter the global education business, and it has been quite active in pursuing this objective. The strategy was to come here and establish a medical school for the first time beyond the US, and offer US degrees. That was very exciting both for Cornell University and the leadership of Weill Cornell in New York. Their vision fit quite nicely with that of the Qatar Foundation, which wanted to attract top-rated US branch campuses here. The parties signed a contract in 2001 and our classes began in 2002. We offer a unique six-year program, including two years pre-medical, which we use to prepare students for admission to the medical school by using the Cornell granted courses, and then we prepare them for the medical school admissions so they can take the MCAT and other medical school admission tests.</p><h4>How would you assess the success of the first decade here?</h4><p>During the first phase of WCMC-Q's development, three of our major achievements included establishing the first American medical school outside the US, maintaining the same high admission and educational standards of WCMC in New York, and achieving a historic first by awarding Cornell Doctorate of Medicine degrees to successful candidates in Qatar. We graduated the first class in 2008. Then, in 2010, the college entered its second phase with the new five-year strategic plan being realized today that will lead to the establishment of world-class translation and clinical research here, which is what I came here from Stanford University to do. The strategic plan will create centers of excellence in certain areas: research, education, clinical excellence, and focus research on diabetes and cardiovascular disorders.</p><h4>What role does research play in your medical school?</h4><p>No medical school can be considered first rate or world class without research. It is important for students to get involved. Immediately after admission to medical school during the summer, selected students are sent to New York City for two months and almost every student who is here (even if they don't go to New York) participates in research projects right from outset at our labs under the guidance of mentors. Qatar Foundation funds around 10 research programs through the QNRF. The key faculty members are also always involved in research to remain current. If I am teaching medical students, it is much easier for me to teach through real-world examples that I have dealt with recently, as opposed to two or three years in the past. Hamad Medical Corporation is our clinical affiliate. It provides around 80% of healthcare in the country, which means a large diversity of cases from an educator's point of view. We also work closely with the Supreme Council of Heath.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans in Qatar?</h4><p>Our medium-term plans revolve around our second affiliate, Sidra Medical Research Center. We are working very intensively on this at the moment, and our goal is US accreditation, known as ECGME-I, and relating to what we call a residency program or post-graduate training programs. We just received accreditation for Hamad Medical Corporation with our colleagues, and we are now poised to receive accreditation for Sidra. That means our graduates, once they become doctors, don't necessarily have to go to the US; they can receive the same standard of post-graduate residency training here. We are also working with the American Board of Medical Specialties to have exams held here. We would be able to train world-class physicians and have their specialty programs here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does one teach journalism, filmmaking or other communication arts in a region known for censorship?<br></h4><p>One teaches journalism in the same way one would anywhere; there are certain universal values about gathering news and information, and certain data that must be checked and verified. From time to time, there are issues; for example, when an official does not want to be quoted, or something similar. You try to work through that in an amicable way. Sometimes there are issues of censorship or of not being able to publish certain things. If one is teaching journalism in this region one has to respect the culture and the society, while at the same time trying to pursue the truth. Usually, however, it is a process of negotiation and more about your style of operating than the substance of the topic. It is difficult to get information from public and business leaders anywhere in the world, but here it is even more difficult, as there are legal penalties for doing certain things.</p><h4>How do you think that the growth and prevalence of Al Jazeera has changed the way we look at news, especially here in Qatar?</h4><p>Al Jazeera has been an enormous success story, and I think this is primarily due to the quality of its reporting. Its DNA comes from factual reporting, detailed coverage, and the commitment of substantial resources to cover the news. At times, Al Jazeera has been critical of governments and covered the Arab Spring, in general, with distinction. It is expanding today to the US, the UK, France, and Turkey, and has become the largest newsgathering service in the region.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the challenges you face and measure your successes over the past five years of NU—Q's existence here?</h4><p>Our challenge is to help the country produce a talent pool of qualified people who can work in media and communications enterprises, and we are making good progress on that. We have graduated two classes of students who are taking up important jobs, both in Qatar and abroad, and that is very gratifying. We are able to expand our training now and offer more specialized courses in Middle Eastern Studies, and we are launching new programs that cover media and politics, business, and education. Our students have been able to cover stories of global significance, as well as local stories, and they have done it with relative freedom. We have been able to produce films, documentaries, and other visual material too.</p><h4>What kind of exchange programs do you have with the home campus?</h4><p>Starting in the Fall of 2014, we will have students from the home campus coming here to study for a full term. Our communications students currently go to the Evanston campus in their junior year and usually spend one semester there. We have had a constant flow of students moving campuses in both directions for weeklong programs. We also have the NU-Q Ambassador Program in which students go to the main campus and talk about problems in Qatar and the region.</p><h4>Would you say that having the campus in ­Qatar helps students in the main campus understand the Middle East better?</h4><p>Yes, there is tremendous misunderstanding of the Middle East in the West in general, and the US in particular. Having the campus really helps to create discussion and to share knowledge and ideas. When there is a controversy here, it often gets covered on the home campus in the student newspaper. I would call it an ongoing conversation between the two sides. At the same time, we have people from the US and other parts of the world giving Qataris a better sense of what the West thinks and why. It is a very powerful bridge. On the new campus, we will have a beautiful new building that will be inaugurated in 2014. It is designed by internationally distinguished architect, Antoine Predock.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of UCL's first year in Qatar?<br></h4><p>It was extremely interesting to see the diversity of the students that we attracted. We offer three different Master's programs, with 29 students participating. We had originally hoped for 24 students, with eight in each program, so when we took on almost 30 students we were particularly satisfied. These students come from 14 different countries; nine are Qatari, and roughly one-third are from elsewhere in the region, and others from even further afield, such as Europe and the US. As it was our first academic year, certain programs have required adjustment to adapt to the market needs and realities of the country. An example of this is technical and scientific training in our MSc in Conservation, a new course for the country that relies heavily on chemistry and material science. For this you need sophisticated laboratories and chemicals, and because a license is required for everything in Qatar, we had to adapt to accommodate these limitations. It has, therefore, been a learning curve for us, although we are happily entering our second year, with student recruitment almost twice what it was at the same time in 2012. Recruitment is working well through word-of-mouth and advertising, as well as through our collaboration with museums and international organizations. Real-world work experience is a crucial part of our programs, and we make sure that the students gain practical experience from their work placements. In addition, many of the placements take place in Qatar.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the development of a cultural atmosphere in Qatar?</h4><p>The Qatar National Vision 2030 states that people need to understand cultural values and develop an awareness of this in order to shape their own national identity. It also spells out the need to attract highly skilled expatriates to come and work in Qatar and to make them feel genuinely comfortable living here. Perhaps we can play a part in this by providing and organizing enlightening public lectures and events, and by contributing to the dynamic museums environment. This is a booming region with many large museum projects underway. They need good content and outstanding exhibits, but they also need a strategy for interacting with their societies. We have a dual role: to help make Qatar a more attractive place for skilled expatriate workers, and also to help the country develop its own national identity. We operate an intensive program of ongoing professional development that we deliver specifically for the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA), with six or seven of their staff reading for MA programs with us. We are partnered equally with QMA and Qatar Foundation. Our teaching includes visiting lecturers from UCL London who deliver intensive courses, providing more academic diversity than our nine faculty members could alone.</p><h4>How would you like to see UCL expand in the short term?</h4><p>In addition to the MA in Archaeology, the MSc in Conservation, and the MA in Museum and Gallery Practice, we have launched an MA in Library and Information Studies, and a Diploma in Academic Research and Methods with the first students enrolling in late 2013. The latter is aimed at well-qualified candidates of notable potential. It is a six-month program that serves as a pre-Master's preparatory course. We hope to continue welcoming a practical number of students to each course. We will also attempt to expand further and respond more fully to market needs. Qatar finds itself increasingly at the forefront of academic knowledge and education with the goal of developing a knowledge-based economy. We can assist in this by providing advanced technical methods for studying the past and the interaction between people and their environment. Many of the sites that are being studied today are in the waters around Qatar, with the water level having risen over time. I think that the study of these settlements and attempts to understand how people treated the environment and moved around is particularly important for a country like Qatar, which contributes significantly to climate change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overview of the Qatari education sector?<br></h4><p>The post-secondary branch campus model has worked for Qatar, and it is seen as a leader in the region in post-secondary education. We need to recognize that the education system is really a continuum from K-12, college, and university. The college and university components of that continuum were formed through the branch campus model and, therefore, were established with the standards of the parent campuses. The K-12 sector, on the other hand, is not as well defined and requires considerable work in terms of teacher preparation and professional development, accreditation, and curriculum development and standardization. In order for the education system to truly work as a continuum, one of the next issues to be addressed is the transferability of credits among post-secondary institutions. Overall, I think the Education and Training Sector Strategy provides a key framework for improvement in the system, and we will see as a result of implementing the projects prescribed in the ETSS. When we opened in 2002, we had the first co-ed campus in the country.</p><h4>How would you rate Qatar's progress in its transition from a resources-based economy to a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>From the education sector's perspective, we have to service the development of a workforce that, currently, is predominantly in a hydrocarbon-based economy. However, that said, any economy these days has knowledge-based components, and that is what is happening in the workplace, where technology is permeating, particularly in the oil and gas and healthcare sectors. They go hand in hand; although, as we still have a hydrocarbon-based economy, the oil and gas sector has tremendous technology needs, which can only be addressed through education and training and, as we provide highly skilled, technologically competent workers for today's workforce, we automatically lay the groundwork for a transition to a knowledge-based economy.</p><h4>What programs and certificates do you offer students?</h4><p>We offer two-year and three-year college diploma-level credentials to our students. That is probably one of the primary issues here in Qatar; the diploma still being an ill-understood credential. However, we have to educate our public because our Engineering Technology Diploma takes three years and contains 50 courses, and though it is rigorous, is not perceived as being quite as prestigious as a degree. We have four schools, the School of Engineering and Technology, the School of Information Technology, the School of Health Science, and the School of Business Studies, and we also have a very large School of Language Studies and Academics, because currently, 52% of the students that come to us need remedial English or remediation in Mathematics and Science.</p><h4>To what extent does CNA-Q partner with the State of Qatar and with the community?</h4><p>By definition, a college is responsive to the sectors it serves, so we are joined at the hip with the State of Qatar through business, industry, and government partnerships. Every program we offer is here because there was an identified need in the community. When this college was first launched, it was mainly providing business and engineering programs, because companies like QP required those skill sets and every program that has been added since then has met an identified need. We engage the community to find out what their needs are and if the need is great enough, we launch a program, which could be one that already exists at our parent campus in Canada, or else one we need to develop.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the success indicators seen in local healthcare provision of late, and what innovations can we expect to see in the medium term?<br></h4><p>The National Health Strategy (NHS) has grown over the past two years, and with this growth has come more detailed planning, as well as a 27% rise in outputs. The NHS is building the foundations for long-term sustainable change in the health sector. Better governance, a comprehensive primary care strategy, the initial phase of social health insurance, the establishment of the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners, and a strategy for laboratory integration and standardization are some of the main landmarks of our efforts. We will shortly launch a public appointment system, open 18 new health centers, increase the number of rehabilitation beds available across Qatar, and open a new 200-bed physical medicine and rehabilitation hospital in 2015. We are also due to publish a national mental health strategy. Finally, a strategy for community pharmacies will improve patient access to pharmaceuticals at a wide range of convenient locations.</p><h4>How will the new approaches to healthcare in Qatar attempt to address lifestyle issues?</h4><p>The establishment of clinical guidelines for Qatar based on international best practice is also something people can expect to see, as we move from a curative approach in healthcare to a preventative one. In that regard, a national action plan for tobacco will target smoking and enhance the enforcement of the new tobacco law when decreed. Similarly, we are developing national dietary guidelines to encourage healthy nutrition. We are also planning the development of robust occupational health and safety guidelines to mitigate related diseases and hazards. For parents, there will be a breastfeeding and complimentary feeding education program to support new families. Finally, Qataris can also expect to see more effective patient advocacy services, as well as the establishment of e-health services.</p><h4>How is the Department of Research of the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) helping the country become a center of research excellence?</h4><p>Qatar has embarked on an ambitious research program to allocate 2.8% of its GDP to research, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. The SCH plays a central role in setting forth the research governance framework within the health R&amp;D ecosystem in Qatar. This framework aims at the coordination of research activities, the allocation of funds, and the development of a stakeholder exchange mechanism across the spectrum of biomedical research, clinical research, public health research, and public policy. The Department has developed a number of policies and regulations for conducting research on human subjects, the use of stem cells and gene transfer in humans, and also clinical effectiveness research, a fact recognized by the publication of BMC Medical Ethics 2012.</p><h4>How is the Ministry helping to increase awareness of family planning and the prevention of endemic diseases?</h4><p>There are no endemic communicable diseases in Qatar. We have one of the lowest incidence rates of HIV and malaria, and we are working to strengthen tuberculosis control. In terms of endemic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), we do have a high prevalence of diabetes (17%), high blood pressure (32.9% for adults aged between 18 and 64), and other risk factors, such as obesity (more than 40%) and smoking (16.4% for both sexes). As more than 60% of deaths are due to NCDs, SCH is working on different awareness programs targeting nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, and smoking cessation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ooredoo has become an international communications company with a global customer base of more than 92.9 million people. What strategies have fuelled this transformation?<br></h4><p>Since announcing our rebranding to Ooredoo in February 2013, we have delivered on a number of initiatives that advance us to the next level as a leading community-based communications company. Each of our markets has a customer experience program driving advances in our products, services, stores, and network. These programs aim at forging deeper and stronger relationships with our customers. Our organic growth is fuelled by the connection with our customers, built upon strong levels of service and the reliability provided by the best networks. Here in Qatar, we have launched ultrafast 4G services in 2013, and continued to roll out our nationwide fiber network. Meanwhile, our award-winning rewards program, Nojoom, is now the most popular of its kind in Qatar. Looking ahead, we see great opportunities for growth in data. With the International Telecommunications Union predicting that by the end of 2013 one-third of all mobile subscriptions will be mobile broadband, we aim to develop our network to meet growth in demand for data services.</p><h4>What do the recent changes to the company mean for Ooredoo and the customer?</h4><p>The new brand has added vigor to our operations, increased our global recognition and won us international acclaim. On the international front, we continue to improve our visibility and community engagement through initiatives such as “Play for Dreams" and mobile health clinics in partnership with our global brand ambassador Lionel Messi and the Leo Messi Foundation. We recently announced our sponsorship of the Paris Saint-Germain football club and launched community-coaching programs across our footprint to provide life opportunities for young people. In Qatar, market awareness of Ooredoo has reached 100%, and brand equity has steadily grown as customers welcome our human growth message. We have launched life-enhancing services, such as the 4G Mobile Broadband, Ooredoo Fiber, Business Fiber, and the Ooredoo App, and we will continue supporting our customers pursue their dreams and aspirations.</p><h4>What benefits has Ooredoo seen since the new Mobile Number Portability (MNP) regulations came into place?</h4><p>We were the first operator in Qatar to offer our customers MNP services, which we launched in January 2013 under the direction of the Supreme Council of Information and Communication Technology (ictQATAR). The free service has made it easy for customers to retain their existing mobile numbers when switching operators in Qatar. We have seen an incredible response and people switching to us have cited our superior network, greater value, and higher level of customer service than our competitors as the primary deciding factors in their choice.</p><h4>What role is Ooredoo playing in building Qatar's knowledge-based economy and working toward the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>It's quite simple really. Qatar Vision 2030 draws its strength from human resources, which is why we are highly focused on people and the development of their skills. Becoming a knowledge-based economy is all about creating the right leadership skills. We are also building a network that enables companies to develop their knowledge-based services. Ooredoo launched the first and only 4G service, delivered Fiber-to-the-home and supported the best and most reliable network in 2013—this is the foundation that companies, schools, universities, and NGOs can all use to extend their reach and enhance their online resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IHG has a strong and growing presence in the GCC. Where does Qatar fit into your regional strategy?<br></h4><p>There are currently three IHG hotels in Doha: InterContinental Doha, InterContinental Doha — The City and Crowne Plaza Doha — The Business Park. As Doha's market matures, we are diversifying our portfolio to cater to business and leisure travellers who are looking for alternative locations and services from hotels. We opened Qatar's first Crowne Plaza in August 2013 to cater to the city's thriving business district and, in April 2013, we also announced plans to open Qatar's first ever Holiday Inn hotel, Holiday Inn Doha — The Business Park. The 347-room, new-build Holiday Inn will be located just two kilometres from Doha International Airport in The Business Park's precinct, the heart of the capital's business district, and will sit next to Crowne Plaza Doha — The Business Park, which is also owned by Trans Orient Establishment.</p><h4>IHG plans to almost double its current hotel number in India, the Middle East and Africa. How do these plans reflect your long-term strategy?</h4><p>IHG has a long heritage and extensive presence in India, the Middle East, and Africa, with 112 hotels operating under six brands across 21 countries, and employs approximately 25,000 people at our hotels and offices in the region. Over the next three to five years, we will open 81 hotels in our development pipeline across the region. IHG will grow by around 34% in the Middle East over, this period as we open the 27 hotels (7,671 rooms) in our development pipeline. Of this pipeline, 93% is in the GCC (25 hotels), where we continue to leverage our strong heritage and presence, especially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Luxury and upmarket brands continue to play an important part in our expansion strategy, with 24% of our GCC pipeline made up of InterContinental Hotels, and 16% of Crowne Plaza. However, the extended stay and mid-scale segments are playing an increasingly significant role, with Holiday Inn and Staybridge Suite properties each accounting for 28% of our GCC pipeline.</p><h4>The National Vision 2030 calls for sustainability across all sectors of the economy. How does IHG take this concern into consideration?</h4><p>All three of our hotels currently operating in Doha are part of IHG's innovative sustainability effort, Green Engage, which utilizes an advanced online tool that measures the day-to-day environmental impact of the hotels. IHG's Doha hotels are investing in energy efficient technology and encouraging correct employee behaviour, and future targets include the reduction of electricity consumption by 9% and water consumption by 5% in 2014. IHG's hotels have pioneered recycling processes in Doha including the segregation of aluminium cans, plastic bottles, glass bottles, food, paper and cardboard waste. Collectively, the hotels recycle around 2,500 kilograms of cardboard per month, saving 30 trees from destruction monthly, and approximately 1,500 liters of kitchen oil each month. In guestroom corridors and public areas, the temperature is set to 24°C to reduce energy use.</p><h4>What role is IHG playing in Qatar's continuing economic diversification?</h4><p>Our diversifying portfolio of hotels in Doha, which will provide variety both in terms of geographical location and upper-upscale to mid-scale accommodation, will support the city's maturing leisure and business travel industry. Our recently opened Crowne Plaza, and planned Holiday Inn are both positioned to support the city's growing business and banking district.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overview of the first three years of Vodafone's activities in Qatar and how it managed to break the monopoly of QTel (Ooredoo)?<br></h4><p>Telecommunications was one of a number of sectors where the Qatari leadership decided to liberalize and create more competition. What we have noticed in Qatar is a concerted effort to create an industry with a move from a monopoly to a competitive environment. There was a license auction and Vodafone in partnership with the Qatar Foundation won a tender to set up operations in 2009. We are government regulated by the Supreme Council of Information and Communication Technology (ictQATAR), under the leadership of Dr. Hessa Sultan al-Jaber. We are really pleased with the way things have panned out regarding the creation of genuine competition and an environment where operators can really thrive and succeed, while at the same time giving customers a different level of service because of that competition. We currently hold 30% of mobile revenue in the market, which by any industry benchmark is a good performance. Our progress is driven by the environment in which we operate, which is a well-structured industry. It is also driven by the fact that the population and the overall economy of Qatar are growing considerably, and as a mass-market consumer business everybody owns a mobile; therefore, we grow in step with the population.</p><h4>What makes Vodafone stand out here in Qatar?</h4><p>We are a well-known global brand, and much of the population of Qatar originates from countries where Vodafone is already strongly established, which gives us a solid starting point. We have been able to come up with a way of serving customers and providing value for money that is significantly different to what customers have experienced here in the past. And because we are part of the Vodafone Group, we are able to offer international products, international calling, and roaming services at a lower cost base, and, therefore, at a lower cost to the customer than our competitors. Many of our customers are expatriates spending their disposable income on calling home, for whom low cost becomes important. We have been improving our network quality, adding international coverage and a high-speed data network, and we have been able to attract higher value customers with our post-paid service, which was launched in 2012. We are now pleased to be moving into profitability. It shows that we have a growing business, but also a well-structured cost base and profit margin.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the telecommunications sector here in the short term?</h4><p>We are optimistic about the prospects for Qatar; we do not see any significant clouds on the horizon. Rather, we see a very strong economy that has an excellent incentive with the World Cup to move quickly and to get the overall infrastructure of the country moving fast, which is going to bring people to the country. We see it continuing to grow at a relatively stable rate, yet in a competitive two-player market, with the establishment of a fiber-optic, fixed-line environment that really drives capability and business, and at the moment that does not exist. It is mostly a case of slow copper-based internet infrastructure, which can be frustrating. We are optimistic, and we see it continuing to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Qatar Airways normalized since the return of the Dreamliner to the skies?<br></h4><p>It is still not normalized, as the aircraft were grounded for such a long time that we had to retrain all of our cabin crew and pilots. Qatar Airways had not been operating the Boeing 787 for a long time before that, meaning the experience level of the crew was such that we could not put them back on board without retraining. It has also caused significant disruption, vis-í -vis our expansion plans, our network, and the planned increase of frequencies to current destinations. In the first month alone, we had to downgrade 2,500 flights, and also delayed four new destinations because of a lack of aircraft. We were also affected by the fact that other 787 deliveries did not take place. There was a huge capacity shortage.</p><h4>How will Qatar Airways' new cargo fleet help position it as one of the leading cargo carriers in the Middle East, and internationally?</h4><p>We want to be a major player in the cargo business. We will have a large fleet of Boeing 777-200 freighters, and we are also looking at a substantial number of feeder aircraft, which will either be the traditional Boeing 777 or Airbus 330 freighters. We are now in the process of taking on one more aircraft, which is being delivered from Seattle in the coming days.</p><h4>Qatar Airways was a pioneer in being one of the first Gulf airlines to join an alliance. Why was oneworld chosen?</h4><p>We received an invitation from oneworld, and we accepted it graciously. We fit very well into the oneworld alliance, which provides us with the right type of exposure for expanding our network. We feel that oneworld is the most flexible and most liberal of alliances. We, as part of oneworld, will still be able to codeshare with airlines outside of the alliance, which is not permitted with the other alliances.</p><h4>What percentage of your passengers use Doha as a hub, and how will the new Hamad International Airport cement Qatar's role as a hub?</h4><p>Currently, 70% of our passengers use Doha as a hub. This will decrease as Qatar's tourist infrastructure develops. Hamad International Airport will be one of the most modern, sophisticated, and passenger-friendly airports in the world. The passenger experience will be second to none. It will offer world-class, duty-free shops, a five-star hotel within the building, and a spa, as well as other facilities. Of interest, Hamad International Airport is the first airport to have been designed by an airline. We will also have the best selection of restaurants, airport lounges, duty-free areas, spas, hotels, and a swimming pool.</p><h4>What steps is Qatar Airways taking to differentiate itself in an increasingly competitive market?</h4><p>The answer is simple: we are the only five-star rated airline in the region.</p><h4>What regions are you specifically focusing on for further expansion of Qatar Airways?</h4><p>We are interested in all regions of the world. We are set for expansion in the North and South American regions, as well as Africa, the Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Europe.</p><h4>What are your medium-term strategic plans and goals for Qatar Airways?</h4><p>My main priority is to get Hamad International Airport up and running. My second is to realize the network expansion that I have in mind over the course of the next three years. And my third priority is to satisfy the economic needs of my country by keeping Qatar Airways at the top of the airline league.</p><h4>With this large-scale, rapid expansion, and other plans for the future, what is the secret of your success?</h4><p>The secret is very simple; we are absolutely focused on where we want to be, and everybody works in that direction. Nobody pulls in the opposite direction; everybody follows the same strategy, which comes from the top. When everybody works together in this manner, you can make decisive gains and be successful as a business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering your complete offer of logistics solutions, what is the core focus of DHL's activity in Qatar?<br></h4><p>Our core focus in Qatar and in all our markets is to offer express solutions that meet customer expectations. We have a strong network, which is in fact the largest in the world, and our know-how and skill help our customers grow their business. These express solutions come down to a commitment to providing our customers with fast, efficient, and secure delivery for all types of goods, accompanied by the ability to track shipments from point of sale (POS) to delivery and arrival at the point of destination. Over the past three decades, we have established a truly diverse customer base dealing with every industry that operates within the country.</p><h4>What does Qatar represent for a global company such as DHL in terms of market and presence in the MENA region?</h4><p>The country's diverse portfolio of businesses represents the various industry verticals that we service. And as the country continues to grow, and its businesses flourish, so too does the demand for reliable and efficient logistics services. In fact, Qatar continues to enjoy high GDP growth and the oil and gas sector have given it the world's highest per-capita income, while it also boasts the lowest unemployment. Proven oil reserves in excess of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for 57 years. Meanwhile, proven reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, accounting for more than 13% of the global total, and ranking third largest in the world. Lastly, the country's preparations for hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup have led to a raft of major infrastructure projects, such as the Doha Metro, Lusail Light Rail System, and many others.</p><h4>Considering the rapid development of Doha, and of the entire nation, from what sectors are you seeing increased demand?</h4><p>Qatar has positioned itself as the Middle East's fastest growing economy. The government's implementation of its Vision 2030 has not only fuelled its progress, but has also paved the way for every operating industry to strive for excellence and help drive rapid growth. As the country grows, it also develops an accompanying demand for connectivity—and this is where DHL comes in. We support local development by connecting local projects, industries, and companies with the rest of the world through our efficient and hassle-free logistics services. And again, as the State grows, so too, do our services. To date, we are seeing strong demand from the oil and gas segment, as well as from construction and the hospitality sector.</p><h4>In light of the strong emphasis placed on the environment and sustainability, how do you integrate green policies into your business?</h4><p>DHL takes its responsibility toward the environment very seriously by focusing on initiatives that reduce climate changing CO2 emissions and the environmental impact of the transportation and storage of goods. In line with this, DHL has implemented an initiative called “GoGreen," through which the company aims to offer its customers a broad portfolio of green services designed to increase efficiency, while at the same time leaving a smaller carbon footprint; few such services are offered in Qatar. For example, there is our eSIGnature service, which provides increased shipment visibility and a convenient and seamless delivery experience. It also contributes to DHL's “GoGreen" initiative, as it does away with hard-copy delivery sheets and eliminates the need to print and post hard-copy point of deliveries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering Qatar's huge emphasis on infrastructure development in light of Qatar National Vision 2030, how would you consider the growing popularity of landscaping in the country?<br></h4><p>The popularity of landscaping is growing in the entire region, and especially in Qatar as the country gears up to host international events, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Every project requires landscaping in order to add that final touch of beautification. This trend has been growing since 2006, when the Asian Games were hosted here. With all the projects currently underway, there is a great need for more sophisticated landscaping, which is good news for us.</p><h4>To what extent is demand from public and private sectors balanced?</h4><p>Our services are universally popular. There are many private sector projects, although we tend to be involved in the larger, government projects.</p><h4>How are you positioned to serve the landscaping industry?</h4><p>The definition of landscaping has changed drastically over the past few years. A decade ago, landscaping was all about soft landscaping and irrigation, including the planting of flowers, other plants, and grass. Now, however, it is more about complete turnkey jobs. The definition of the business has changed and expanded, which is why we believe that we have created a difference between Al Nakheel Agriculture and Trading and the rest of the market. The word landscaping, in my opinion, is everything that you see when you go outside. People may well take it for granted, but they certainly appreciate it when they see it in terms of the quality it adds to daily life. We are more ready than ever to provide the right solutions.</p><h4>How do you factor sustainability into your work?</h4><p>There are many related issues to contend with on this front. First of all, we need to promote water conservation and implement irrigation systems that save water and make efficient use of it through automated irrigation systems. We also use materials that are locally sourced from this part of the world. There is a major trend in Qatar toward utilizing native plants that are easier to maintain and consume less water. We proudly believe that we have achieved a level of sustainability that surpasses the efforts of our competition.</p><h4>How is your portfolio expanding and what are your plans for future projects?</h4><p>We are proud of every project we undertake, and big or small, we put our heart into each one, as every client is important to us. This is a small country, so any failure would reflect badly on our reputation. That's why we are always on top of our game, and immediately rectify anything not absolutely to our high standards. We maintain efficient contact with our clients, consultants, and contractors to better serve them. And over the coming years, we will take on more projects related to World Cup developments.</p><h4>What importance does the human factor have for your company?</h4><p>It is at once the most important factor and the most difficult element of any business, but even more so in our business. Not many universities produce landscape engineers, and highly qualified individuals are hard to find wherever you are. Lebanon is one of the few countries in our region that is strong in landscape architecture. However, as we know, architects are one thing and landscape engineers another. Usually, the best among our engineers and project managers are civil engineers who have been fortunate enough to enter into our field and learn the business through hands-on experience. It is a challenging and constant struggle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Jazeera worked to embrace new media?<br></h4><p>Al Jazeera actually started using new media quite early on in this region. The management of Al Jazeera, with the support of our IT people and various other departments, has long acknowledged new media as the future of information dissemination. And when the Arab Spring began, the importance of new media became obvious. From a technological perspective, new media today allows us to obtain information, including data, pictures, and videos, from places that were previously inaccessible, and moreover in a broadcastable format. Social media has become fashionable and is now highly important, if not indispensable, for young people, who spend less and less time watching TV. Therefore, it is crucial for Al Jazeera to reach these potential users via their smartphones, laptops, and tablets. In our programs, even where they maintain a traditional format, you will notice components of new media. We understand that if you want to reach people, you have to speak their language, and social media is the language of the new generation. Even though they may not watch as much TV, they still want to access our content. We have multiple Al Jazeera products that go out online through our websites in both Arabic and English. Today, Al Jazeera America and Al Jazeera Balkans also have websites where people can follow our news content and enjoy streaming and live streaming video options.</p><h4>What ideas unite your products across all media?</h4><p>People like Al Jazeera for good reason. First of all, it commands high credibility. People know that if it comes from Al Jazeera, it is true. We don't manipulate the news, but ensure that everything we put on TV, online, and on other digital platforms is 100% factual. We have no agenda working for political, ideological, or commercial goals. Our purpose is to inform people with real information, plain and simple. We believe that knowledge is the way to empower people, and that's what we provide. Another factor of importance in our media is timeliness—we bring people the information as it happens. We believe that we are the voice of the voiceless, a platform, if you will, for those who have no platform. We care about people, human rights, democracy, and the right of people to be informed, which underpin all of these considerations. Therefore, we embrace freedom of the press and expression, which is what Al Jazeera is all about.</p><h4>What is the role of Al Jazeera in supporting Arab media as well as Arabic-language media?</h4><p>We are in the business of providing information and knowledge to the people. One of the objectives of Qatar is to help the media in both the Arab world and globally to flourish, remain professional, serve the people, and provide citizens all over the world the information they need. This information is a part of what we call soft power, and is important in the modern world. Qatar is providing the world with the valuable service of reliable information, which has earned it a trusted reputation. Significantly, this country has become very important in the mediation of peace due to its reputation for integrity. This is soft power at work. And if you have a strong economy, you also boost this soft power. The strong higher education arena also provides an intellectual base upon which a bright future can be built.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar Rail is currently constructing one of the world's most ambitious rail projects. How will the Qatar metro strengthen the nation's position as a regional and global transport hub?<br></h4><p>Transport is a very important sector in this country. The Qatar Metro will be one of the most state-of-the-art systems both in the region and the world, and will utilize new driverless technologies. The metro will change the shape of the city. Qatar's reliance on personal cars for transport is creating environmental and social problems, as it does around the world. There must be a substitute or an alternative means of transportation. The entire demography will change and reshape the city. I will want to live next to the metro, because my work and business is located just a few hundred meters from a stop. My intuitive estimation is that traffic is costing a 0.5% loss in the GDP because of waiting times. If we do nothing this could rise to 2%, which is too high. Qatar Rail will significantly increase trading between the GCC countries, and each train will remove around 300 trucks from the road. Between Dubai, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, just picture the number of trucks and ships on the move, and how trains will largely replace them. It will give each country access to the three seas: the Arabian Sea, the Gulf, and the Red sea. This will change trade completely.</p><h4>How does the metro fit in to the country's national vision?</h4><p>The national vision rests on four pillars: human, social, economic, and environmental development. The National Vision 2030 aims to transform Qatar into an advanced country capable of achieving sustainable development and ensure a continued and decent standard of living for its people. This means in transport terms ease of movement and access to business, education, and leisure facilities in a seamless way whilst respecting environment. On the economic front, GDP will benefit from reduced time lost in traffic. Teenagers too young to drive will be able to travel around freely without having to rely on drivers or chauffeurs. From a social perspective, a better environment will mean a better quality of life for citizens. Instead of having one million cars in the city, you will have 500,000. This means less CO2  and less of an impact on health. Additionally, the metro will provide jobs for many, and prove to be a major step forward for the nation in every aspect. Our vision is for Qatar to have one of the world's best integrated transport systems connecting people, places, goods, and services enabling economic prosperity and quality of life for all. We are proud to be undertaking this challenge.</p><h4>Your local portfolio in Qatar is robust. How do international and regional investments play into your strategy moving forward?</h4><p>Regional and international investments are important to us. We believe that when we engage in such schemes—we leverage our expertise here in the market. When you have a track record of building and delivering over QAR70 billion over the past six or seven years, you need to leverage that experience. Also, being available in the international domain will give us good exposure and connections with partners from abroad, which is a benefit to both parties. However, we are seeing that the majority of the opportunities exist here in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The United Development Company (UDC) group of companies has a portfolio spanning several sectors in the Qatari economy from industry to construction and the media. What strategies have led the group to diversify into such fields?<br></h4><p>We are focused on creating lasting partnerships in core sectors related to real estate, where our expertise revolves mainly around our Island development, The Pearl Qatar. It is a fully integrated mixed-use development that includes tenant services, hospitality, retail, lifestyle, marina management, and community living. In order to meet these business and service needs of our Island, UDC has, in recent years, expanded its operations into these core business areas that are tailored-made for The Pearl.</p><h4>Qatar recently introduced regulations that allow foreigners to own real estate and obtain residency permits in the country when buying into developments such as The Pearl. How do you feel that this change will affect the real estate market here in the country?</h4><p>Qatar has clearly raised the bar for the region's freehold real estate, tourism, and retail sectors, with The Pearl serving as an excellent example in this regard. As more expatriates build careers and raise families in Qatar, the span of their stay subsequently climbs. Although the Qatari real estate market is ready to meet the increased demands for housing, The Pearl Qatar's experience in freehold ownership will stimulate market confidence, and may lead to more comprehensive freehold regulations and responsible developmental policies. To this end, UDC's organizational structure includes an active environmental department.</p><h4>How do you feel the construction sector will cope with future demand in relation to Qatar 2022?</h4><p>For the next eight years, the real estate market is set to benefit from currently scheduled spending related to World Cup preparations. This means that as more expatriates move to Doha and make it their home, increased activities in the real estate, retail, and hospitality sectors, as well as greater competition over project delivery and adaptability to future residential or commercial preferences and requirements will ensue. The property market is expected to witness the emergence of more small- to medium sub-contractors, joint venture arrangements, and foreign franchises, all linked to balancing supply and demand in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for foreign investment within Qatar's private sector?</h4><p>Qatar welcomes foreign investors and is keen to promote projects involving the transfer of foreign expertise and technology to the Qatari economy. In addition to expanding the zone within which foreign investors can participate in the national economy, the new Foreign Investment Law confers upon foreign investors privileges not previously available to them. There is always room for investments that boast a strong competitive edge, such as niche products and services, and for competition over better quality, innovation, and technology that makes a difference.</p><h4>What is your overview for the investment climate here in Qatar?</h4><p>In the real estate residential market, the increase in population due to recruitment of personnel from beyond Qatar continues to drive demand for residential accommodation. This demand is largely focused on Doha. Likewise, Doha's commercial and retail market remains stable, with retail offerings divided between organized retail malls, high street showrooms, and Souq retailing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[un-faulty-towers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major milestones and achievements for you over the past decade? What challenges have you come across?<br></h4><p>Ever since the year 2001 when Hyatt Plaza mall was conceptualized, and then finally opened to public in 2003, we have been able to achieve tremendous success and growth in every commercial aspect. Hyatt Plaza's first and foremost achievement is that we managed to diffuse the huge competition. This is indicated by the fact that formerly we used to have about 800,000 people visiting the mall in a year. Today, the footfall is over 6 million in a year. This significant leap has been made possible because of the very clear vision of our stakeholders, and the retailers who shared that vision with us. We always believed in Qatar's huge potential for growth and development. We realized, and could predict that growth in population following the rapid development, would act as a catalyst, creating increased business opportunities. We took the step forward by opening the right mall at the right location. Yet, a mall is not just about creating a space for leasing out, and for it to be continually successful in business terms, it requires synergy with the values presented by the society at the given time. Business never takes off on day one. The operational cost for running such major infrastructure has to forego profit in the early years. The market in Qatar as also anywhere in the Middle East is very unique as it exhibits a very dynamic population that not just includes steep growth in numbers but also in diversity. We have different nationalities and cultures coming in who present a different set of demands and expectations from their shopping destination. It is extremely important to understand the psychographics of society, especially within the primary catchment area and to align business strategies accordingly. While we continue to cater to these demographic changes, we constantly strive to make Hyatt Plaza the most preferred family destination both in terms of shopping and for recreation.</p><h4>What business strategies put you in the lead in this competitive market?<br></h4><p>A careful in-depth study and business analysis of the market, customers, stakeholders, and competitors is important to stay ahead of the growing competition. It is essential to identify the gaps and find the right solution to fill them. We are a mid-sized mall as compared to some of the other mass market malls in the vicinity. To gain a lead and keep our business sustainable, we have focused on our strengths. Instead of viewing the competition as a threat, we took it as an opportunity to develop and create our niche in the growing market. Looking at the strong family values and needs of our target customers, we identified the need to create a place where they can spend quality family time. We directed our strategy to project Hyatt Plaza mall as a family-oriented shopping destination. We worked at making our customers feel comfortable with their surroundings vis-í -vis easy parking, easy access, and a great family ambience combined with retail outlets that fulfill all their shopping needs. Although we experienced an initial dip in footfall, we soon enough cemented our position as a place where families can visit to unwind. As our primary target market comprises the Qatari and Arab people, we worked our marketing strategy around their values. Our mall is also very popular with the family target group irrespective of nationality as they find everything here that a family would need in a soothing and comfortable environment. We also organize periodic entertainment events; we present temporary stalls from different countries that showcase their unique products. Our mall provides a wholesome experience to our customers and this is where we establish a real point of difference. The result is that in spite of cutthroat competition, today we can boast an 80% conversion rate, meaning the percentage of people walking in to buy something, as compared to the normal 35%-40% in the mall business. This high rate is possible because we have successfully converted our customers into destination shoppers, who know what they want and where to find it.</p><h4>What will be your focus going forward?</h4><p>For us, business also means adding tangible value to society. I believe that a business can be sustainable only in synergy with the needs and changes of that society. We strive to provide optimum service level, security, safety, ambience, and comfort, along with the right mix of shopping options in terms of category and brands, to our discerning customers. We have also significantly upgraded our entertainment segment. We present the state-of-the-art Family Entertainment Center (FEC), and the Jungle Zone, where the entire family can relax and enjoy themselves. For us, an understanding of the behavior, requirements, demands, satisfaction, and comfort of the customer holds prime importance. This is the key to achieving customer loyalty and a pivotal factor driving our future business policy.</p><div class="quote">“  Instead of viewing the competition as a threat, we took it as an opportunity to develop and create our niche in the growing market.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the opening of Roudha, given that society here is historically patriarchal?<br></h4><p>Research was conducted at Carnegie Mellon University over 18 months, the results of which revealed that around 46% of women were educated; however, they were not in the workforce. That means that they have disposable income, they have time, and they have the knowledge to open their own businesses, but were not doing so solely because of the cultural stigma attached. It is not easy for any woman to open her own business, and much easier for men to go to the Ministry of Business and Trade and get registered. We pitched our idea to several organizations, but it was rejected on the grounds of it being for the benefit of women only. We persisted with the idea, until we finally launched in July 2011. In the first year, we held 24 events, while 4,505 women engaged in our workshops and events; it was very revealing. We had different sessions on entrepreneurial topics, including telecoms and IT, and we even had people from Dubai coming who said, “This is the first time we have seen this many women in a room." We are an NGO and a non-profit entity, and are not under the large umbrella of people such as HE Sheikha Mayassa or HH Sheikha Moza.</p><h4>In 1972, only 10% of Qatari women attended university, while today the figure exceeds more than 50%. To what do you attribute this?</h4><p>First of all, the role model for women in the country is HH Sheikha Moza. She represents the women at this country,and their attitudes. We now have seven world-class universities here. We realized that the figure for male attendance of university was declining largely because of Qatar's oil and gas boom, which tempted many men to quickly enter the workforce, neglecting their education. Meanwhile, women, who did not enter the workforce, perceived study as an alternative means of educating themselves even if it didn't culminate in a career.</p><h4>What role can women play in achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Every four years a new strategy is devised. The Qatar National Development Strategy 2012—2016 (QNDS) for Human Development is one of these strategies. The aim is to increase the number of women in the workforce, which is currently at about 32%, but should rise to 42% by 2016. We can only take it step by step in order to realize the vision. Another objective related to women is to increase their number in workplace leadership roles, because that figure is less than 4% today. We hope to see Qatar's first female minister soon, and I think women would consider that inspirational.</p><h4>How is Roudha's work funded?</h4><p>We started initially with funding from our founding partners, Al Ansari &amp; Associates, as well as Silatech and  Sheikha Hanadi. Currently, we are trying to persuade more board members to contribute funds toward our operational expenses, and are reliant on sponsorship to run our programs. Sourcing funds for women is an extremely difficult undertaking, although one might think that for a non-profit organization it would be an easier undertaking. Yet in actual fact, it is more difficult, and should be offered from a social responsibility perspective, which is not something that is historically part of our culture, and perhaps another aspect that we should be touching upon. If one compares Qatar to other GCC countries, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not well established here. Dubai has come a long way because of the sheer number of multinational companies that comprehend this concept. In Qatar, there are few multinationals and CSR is largely dependent on the decision-maker's stance, since relations play a major role.</p><h4>What is your medium-term vision for Roudha?</h4><p>Within five years, I want us to have our own physical center. It would be a complete one-stop shop featuring a banking section and ministries, among other services all in the same building where women could complete all their paperwork under one roof.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ezdan Group has traditionally targeted middle-income buyers. Why has the group recently begun targeting high-income individuals?</h4><p>Ezdan Holding Group has been able, over long years of investment in the real estate sector, to achieve much, resulting in large-scale projects that have helped to revitalize the real estate market and meet the considerable needs of the Qatari population. We have continuously provided large numbers of units for middle-income people in order to meet demand from this category. At the same time, the provision of high-end units to meet the needs of high-income people and ensure their wellbeing has led to the establishing of a number of residential complexes opened in recent months at the heart of Doha. These integrated residential complexes offer residents welfare and a range of facilities, including swimming pools, nurseries, restaurants, financial service centers, high-speed internet, and sophisticated security systems.</p><h4>What investments has the group made domestically, and do you have any plans for overseas expansion?</h4><p>Ezdan Holding Group owns a huge portfolio of real estate assets in addition to existing projects, in addition to a huge portfolio of local stocks that vary according to several different sectors. We offer towers and residential complexes in the Al Wakrah and Al Wukair neighborhoods, which have become havens for thousands of people wishing to have a quiet and distinctive home. The Group also boasts a series of residential units in Doha, with 914 apartments at a total cost of QR1.1 billion. These units are spread over eight towers near the Souq Waqif neighborhood and the corniche. Ezdan Holding also owns the Ezdan Mall Gharafa, which opened in mid-April 2013, and Ezdan Mall Al Wakrah, which is expected to be open for business by mid-2014. In the hotel sector, the group owns Ezdan Hotel in the West Bay area of the Dafna region, one of the largest hotels in Doha that offers a variety of services and integrated features, with 3,100 rooms and suites. Ezdan Hotel Al Shamal is expected to open in 4Q2014, with a capacity of 220 rooms and suites. The second part of the Group's investments is in the financial sector, confirming that Ezdan Holding Group is actively contributing to the state's renaissance at all key levels. The group is engaged in the banking and financial sector, health, industrial, insurance, and media. The Group is a major shareholder in many leading bodies, including Qatar International Islamic Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, Al Rayan Bank, Medical Care Group (Al Ahli Hospital), Qatar Islamic Insurance, and Qatari Investors Group (QIG), as well as several investments in the media sector. In general, the vision of His Excellency Sheikh Dr Khalid bin Thani al Thani, the Chairman of Ezdan Holding, aims to focus on domestic investment to serve Qatari society and participate in achieving the goals of Qatar National vision 2030; this is in addition to the State of Qatar's favorable investment atmosphere and the development of a wide array of sectors. The overall group strategy is to dissociate from the real estate sector over the next five years, and during this period there will be many developmental projects aimed at achieving the maximum return for the group, and by extension for Qatari society itself. The emergence of a large number of companies can contribute to filling the gap that Ezdan will leave after its dissociation from the real estate sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development bring to Qatar's booming real estate market?<br></h4><p>Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development has always been a regional player in the real estate sector, having brought some of the most iconic projects in the region to Qatar. Soon, hopefully, we will become an international company too. We have investments in Qatar, the UAE, and Lebanon, and are also exploring other opportunities both regionally and internationally.</p><h4>What is your vision for the Seven Zones Trade project?</h4><p>Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development has identified the need for an area that Doha currently lacks, namely the construction and building materials market. With all the construction that is happening and will continue to happen in Qatar for FIFA World Cup 2022, and in order to realize the Vision 2030, we believe that a one-stop shop for all related materials is needed. We have studied the market and decided to construct a professional, well-planned shopping mall for the construction industry, with the possibility of residential and personal use, too. Since I came on board, we have decided to add another community-focused aspect to the project, with showrooms located downstairs, and architects, engineers, and design offices upstairs, as well as an area dedicated to students and locals without a platform to establish their own firms. I am working with both government agencies and universities to bring this about.</p><h4>On that same point, how else does Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development contribute to human capacity in Qatar, seeing as this is a crucial part of the country's future?</h4><p>I am working very closely with the universities, and we plan to hold a competition to establish the logo for one of our projects, using the Qatar Foundation as a platform on which to do so. I am also talking to certain universities about students participating in our projects over the summer break.</p><h4>Going forward, how do you foresee demand for residential housing in Qatar?</h4><p>Residential demand in Qatar is increasing. Actually, demand in Qatar has always been steady; it has not declined, and that is thanks again to the government's vision. The government has managed the crisis and the supply and demand situation well. As the government expands its infrastructure and construction projects, there will be an increasing demand for residential units.</p><h4>Beyond your regional presence, do you have plans for international expansion?</h4><p>Actually, one of my mandates when I joined Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development was to take it to another level and become an international player. My experience in international business tells me that Mazaya Qatar Real Estate Development can do well in that area. We are now studying opportunities in the region and further afield, and whether these projects come about or not will be a question of due diligence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have a number of business ventures in Qatar. Could you give us some idea of their scope of activity?<br></h4><p>In Qatar, we are heavily experienced across a variety of fields, including engineering, finance, and real estate, as well as representing international companies. Since 2000 the focus has been on real estate, and in 2007 engagement in government work was discontinued, whereby the focus exclusively shifted to our own real estate developments. Our every business decision reflects potential and demand. When I construct a compound, the user is the primary consideration, and the same applies to the construction of commercial space; it is fundamentally important to imagine oneself in the occupier's position. This approach allows for the creation of memorable and successful projects of long-term occupancy because they have been built for a clearly defined purpose.</p><h4>What changes have you witnessed since you started the company in 2000?</h4><p>Back in 2000, prices in Qatar were in the range of QAR60-70 per square foot. In 2003, I mentioned in an interview that I could imagine a rapid appreciation to QAR300. Within two years they were at QAR300-400 per square foot, in 2006-2007 jumping to QAR800, and are currently at QAR1,400. Therefore, had you invested QAR70 million in 2000, you would have QAR1.4 billion today. Of course with major projects on the horizon, demand was very high, as were the payments made. This allowed for a higher rental volume, and caused land prices to rise. Today, sellers calculate how much you will buy, construct, and rent before naming a price. Many things have happened in Qatar, and it has become much less unpredictable over time.</p><h4>What are your current projects and what do you have in the pipeline for the coming years?</h4><p>We prefer to construct smaller buildings rather than towers, and today we are engaged in developing a set area of two-bedroom apartments. The plan is to provide a lobby, or communal living space on each floor, and a small studio to serve as a shared reception area. In this space, residents can watch TV and mingle as an alternative to being exclusively in their homes. We are therefore developing our own type of building based not on what is always done, but on what can be created with a fresh approach.</p><h4>What role can such innovation play in the Qatari market?</h4><p>It is largely a question of how you build, and not just what you build. We acknowledge the fact that many are constructing large towers and specifying high-quality materials, but what about the end user? Do these schemes have a well-studied layout? Ultimately, choices will be made because this is in the nature of real estate. In our humble opinion, we see ourselves building for tomorrow, and not for today.</p><h4>Are you pursuing business ventures beyond real estate?</h4><p>We have been building a women's gym. And while there are hundreds of such gyms in Qatar, we approached the concept from another angle, by bringing senior professionals into the business. Ours is not for everyone, but available to just 100 women, and so we're essentially talking about an exclusive club of limited membership. We will fully meet their needs right down to the last detail. The project has two floors and a fully equipped sauna, and offers massage and self-defense classes.</p><h4>Does anyone else offer what you do in terms of the gym and your approach to quality?</h4><p>The need to turn a profit is a business given, but should be part of wider targets. Profitability should provide the scope to invest in enhancement of service and quality. It is a question of knowing how you approach people, grasp their requirements and respond to that as fully as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar Foundation (QF) has been an essential part of Qatar's rise to prominence. What changes will your leadership bring to the organization's strategy?<br></h4><p>I have been closely involved with the operations and building of the QF since 1995. I believe that my experience and intrinsic understanding of the unique needs of my nation, its youth, and the vision and mission of QF will be vital in carrying forward the legacy of success and prominence that has been established by Qatar's wise leadership and my predecessors at QF. My role as the new President of the QF is part of the natural evolution that takes place within a maturing organization. Our ongoing aim is to promote a culture of excellence in Qatar and to advance it by developing sustainable human capacity, as well as social and economic prosperity that can benefit the local and international community. In my earlier role as Vice-President of Capital Projects and Facilities, I worked alongside an energetic team to ensure the effective planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all QF buildings and supporting infrastructure on its 15 million sqm campus. The site today has the biggest collection of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified buildings in the Middle East, which is an unprecedented achievement.</p><h4>Becoming an R&amp;D hub is one of Qatar's key goals. What additional steps is the QF planning to take to achieve this in the coming years?</h4><p>Qatar Foundation Research and Development (QF R&amp;D) is spearheading this national endeavor as a world-class hub for technological innovation and prominent research institute operating at the frontier of science. QF R&amp;D recently launched its first PhD program, entitled the Qatar Foundation Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Energy Sciences. This competitive doctoral program is a collaboration between QF R&amp;D and Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU), the first to join the program, and will provide its graduates with an excellent platform for a successful career in the field of energy sciences. Through the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)—a member of QF—we run a number of funding programs aimed at providing opportunities for young researchers. QNRF recently launched the Graduate Student Research Awards (GSRA), a new funding program that will help to develop human capital in research for Qatar, and stimulate PhD programs within the country. At this year's Annual Research Conference (QF ARC'13) ,we will once again be engaged in problem solving by bringing together renowned researchers, academics, and scientists with the aim of finding solutions to challenges outlined in the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS). Crucial themes will be explored and addressed, among which are the protection of Qatar's cyber infrastructure, the development and deployment of solar energy solutions, the ensuring of sustainable food supply, and the support for Arabic culture, arts, heritage, media, and language.</p><h4>Qatar Foundation has made extensive use of joint ventures and partnerships in past years. How effective has this strategy been, and how will you develop this approach in the future?</h4><p>This approach has served us well, and we intend to continue collaborating with like-minded partners to advance the objectives outlined in Qatar National Vision 2030. Thanks in large part to the steadfast commitment and support of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of QF, we have been able to develop the creative potential of our young people by collaborating and working with renowned institutions across the world. We actively seek to build new alliances and partnerships throughout the year by organizing networking opportunities, conferences, and gatherings that bring together academics, researchers, and experts from the public and private sectors. A few of our successful partnerships include the launch of an exclusive training program in partnership with the University of Oxford's prestigious Saïd Business School earlier in 2013, which has been designed to enhance the expertise of our top-tier managers. The program has been carefully tailored to suit QF's strategic objectives, and will help our leaders apply their problem-solving skills to address complex challenges. Our partnership with the Economist Group has also been fruitful, having flourished through a series of engaging discussion-based forums and events. Qatar Foundation's partnership with FC Barcelona has also encouraged people all over the world to follow their passions through the pursuit of excellence in sports and education.</p><h4>The environment is a major concern for countries across the globe, and the QF has made environmental sustainability central to its activities. How is the Foundation working to achieve a higher level of sustainability in Qatar, and what role will technology play in promoting it?</h4><p>In December of 2012, the QF launched a strategic partnership with the globally renowned Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), to set up the region's pioneering Climate Change Research Institute and Global Climate Change Forum in Doha. Some of the important research topics to be explored by the new institute include water systems, ecosystems, food production, public health, and sustainable urban development. The institute will seek to fill critical gaps in research on mitigation, adaptation, and climate resiliency for key regions, such as the tropics, sub-tropics, and dry lands. Furthermore, through the efforts of the Qatar Green Building Council—a Qatar Foundation member—we are striving to effectively integrate green building practices in all of our developments, which is a true testament to Qatar's growth and advancement in the field. The unique student complex at QF is a perfect example of sustainable living. It has been equipped with solar-paneled roofs and wind turbines that generate energy in 10-kilometer gusts or above. Its 12 buildings make up the highest concentration of independently registered platinum LEED buildings as acknowledged by the US Green Building Council, and the only student housing complex anywhere in the world to have achieved this benchmark.</p><h4>The QF is well-known today for its achievements not only in education, but also research, health, culture, and even real estate and construction. How will you ensure that the Foundation's contributions impact Qatar's economy and culture?</h4><p>The mission of our organization is to unlock human potential. Our main priorities have been designed to serve a national purpose and to have a widespread impact on Qatar's economy and culture. At QF, creativity, intellect, and critical thinking are uppermost considerations, and ensuring the development of human capital will remain our key focus. The transformation to a knowledge economy is progressing well, and we have made significant headway over the past decade. I believe that by equipping Qatari youth with every opportunity possible and offering them a wide range of resources to tap into their potential, we can ensure their increased participation in the workforce and in the development of the national economy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having taken the helm as Chairman of the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) in the recent past, what are your first thoughts on Qatar's tourism sector, and which areas have the most potential?<br></h4><p>One year on from being entrusted by His Highness the Emir with the Chairmanship of the QTA, we are progressing well toward our aggressive goals. Qatar's tourism sector is leading the GCC region in growth. There is potential all around, which is why we have undertaken a methodical review of the tourism sector in Qatar and benchmarked it against some of the leading markets, products, and offerings in tourism and hospitality worldwide. The result is the National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030, which will pave the way for a sustainable tourism sector in every sense of the word. In order to effectively take advantage of these new assets, Qatar is investing heavily in infrastructure projects, such as Hamad International Airport, Doha Metro, and the New Port Project. Once completed, we believe Qatar will have an unbeatable combination of assets that will vault us to new levels of international recognition among tourists and travel advisors.</p><h4>In what ways is Qatar marketing itself as a world-class tourism destination?</h4><p>Effective marketing requires telling an authentic story. Luckily, we have significant material to work with in terms of the products and services that visitors can experience in Qatar. The National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 aims to position Qatar as a world-class hub with deep cultural roots. The QTA promotes Qatar as a safe and welcoming destination that offers authentic experiences, business facilitation, and family-focused recreation. In addition to promoting MICE, culture, and urban products, the QTA is looking to position the country as a family-friendly destination and an ideal place for wellness vacations with a focus on culture, the natural environment, and outdoor pursuits.</p><h4>How is the QTA coordinating with Qatar Airways and other stakeholders in promoting Qatar as a tourism destination?</h4><p>The QTA works in partnerships to plan, regulate, and promote the development of a sustainable and mature tourism sector that contributes to Qatar's future and positions the country as a leading tourism destination. The National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 was created and will be implemented with other stakeholders from the public and private sectors. Through my board membership in Qatar Airways, we ensure that the QTA and the national airline are aligned on national objectives and goals to be reached. We have and will continue to collaborate on several national projects, which will undoubtedly bring value to the destination.</p><h4>How has the opening of the Qatar National Convention Centre altered the landscape for the MICE sector here in Qatar, and what strategies are you following in order to increase the attractiveness of the MICE sector?</h4><p>The business tourism sector continues to lead growth in overall tourism numbers to Qatar. Supporting this increase are the world-class venues on offer to MICE planners, including the Qatar National Convention Centre. Looking ahead, there is excitement for the launch of the new Doha Conference and Exhibition Centre. In addition to the venues, we continue to work with event planners in the region and globally, attend leading conferences, and ensure key industry stakeholders are informed about the offers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Qatar's tourism sector in the short term?</h4><p>The National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 ensures quick wins as well as long-term goals and sustainable growth. The outlook is bright, but we must be realistic in focusing on the promotion of the products on offer today. That's why the strategy focuses on promoting MICE, urban, and cultural products in Qatar. The total number of tourists is set to rise to 7 million tourists by 2030, from 1.2 million in 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatari Olympic Committee (QOC)?<br></h4><p>The QOC was founded on March 14, 1979. The first participation of Qatar was at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada, where Qatar was represented by an administrative delegation. In 1980, the QOC officially joined the International Olympic Committee (IOC) followed by our first participation in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles by our football and athletics teams. Since then, Qatar has participated in various Olympic Games, as well as at continental and regional games. Until now, Qatar has won four medals at the Olympic Games. London 2012 also represented the first time that Qatar sent female athletes to participate.</p><h4>What other initiatives are being made to encourage women to participate in sport?</h4><p>Female participation has always been strongly encouraged in Qatari sport, and we have fully committed to supporting the universal movement in promoting women's participation in sport by establishing the Qatar Women's Sports Committee. Since its inception in 2001, programs and initiatives to promote women's participation in sports have been carefully planned and implemented, and we have noted a significant increase in the number of women that participate in these programs as well as consider sport as a professional career. In the past, the Qatari delegation has been represented by female athletes at regional and international events such as the 2006 Asian Games, the West Asian Games, the 2011 Arab Games, and the 2012 London Olympics, to mention a few. We are certain that these athletes inspired others to get involved in sport activities, and soon we will have more women who will consider sport on a professional basis.</p><h4>How have initiatives such as National Sport Day propagated a deeper understanding of sport among the local community?</h4><p>In 2012, declaring February 2 as National Sport Day through an Emiri Decree implied a very strong message regarding the government's support for social development, mandating citizens, organizations, companies, and the authorities to practice sport. We have witnessed a tremendous increase in participation by the citizens in 2013 and an encouraging rise in the level of awareness in sport. We have also witnessed the collective engagement of all national federations, sports organizations, public authorities, and private companies in conducting a number of programs, activities, and initiatives. Awareness and engagement has been remarkable, with even more promising involvement of the public in sport activities following the National Sport Day events.</p><div class="quote">“  Sport plays an essential part in putting Qatar on the world map, as it aims to become a global sporting hub. "</div><h4>What efforts is the QOC focusing on in order to promote sport amongst the Qatari youth?</h4><p>We have identified several initiatives and strategies to carry out our mission of promoting sport among the Qatari youth. We created the Aspire Academy for Sports Excellence with special sport programs supervised by some of the best experts in the world to discover talented individuals and elevate their performance. We adapt the “Sport for All" approach in developing world-class sporting facilities, such as the Al Farjan Playgrounds. In cooperation with Qatar Museums Authority, a dedicated Olympic and Sports Museum will open its gates in the coming years, while temporary exhibitions related to the Olympics and sport have already started with a satisfactory social impact. This will enable our youth to appreciate the history of sport. Also, we have our successful national program that involves all schools in Qatar—the Schools Olympic Program. In this program, Qatari youth and other students take part annually for six months through competition in individual and team sports.</p><h4>How has the sporting environment evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>We have seen the sporting environment rapidly evolving in Qatar. We have hosted a number of major sporting events including the 2006 Asian Games, the 2011 Arab Games, and other international sporting events. This has had a great impact on the development of our sport industry and the society at large. In 2013, we registered a record of 81 sport events, with 50% being at an international level. A number of major events bids have been successful, and we are looking forward to their completion.</p><h4>What other international sporting events are you planning to host in the coming years?</h4><p>We have developed a 10-year sport event strategy that includes bids for major sport events based on carefully selected criteria. Based on this plan we are proceeding with bids in coordination with the local federations and in cooperation with other partner organizations. We managed to successfully secure the rights to host major sport events, namely the 2014 FINA Swimming World Championships (25 meters), the 2015 IHF Men's World Handball Championships, the 2015 World Boxing Championships, and the 2016 UCI World Road Cycling Championships. Currently, we are preparing the infrastructure for the 2015 IHF World Championships and other requirements are in progress as planned.</p><h4>What role does sport play in putting Qatar on the world map?</h4><p>Sport plays an essential part in putting Qatar on the world map, as it aims to become a global sporting hub. Winning the rights to host several international world-class events has certainly reinforced our international reputation.</p><h4>Moving forward, what are the medium-term strategic plans and initiatives that the QOC is focusing on?</h4><p>We are currently on track with the implementation phase of the 2011- 2016 Sport Sector Strategy, which form part of the 2030 National Vision. We are paying attention to our grassroots programs in order to nurture sporting talent. Also, we are focusing on elite sports and in securing the rights to host major sporting events. We will continuously review and evaluate our current programs through a centralized plan that takes care of sport at all levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Qatar National Vision 2030 shaping the 2022 World Cup project, and how are you working to ensure that it is a sustainable undertaking?<br></h4><p>The four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 underpin the projects that the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee and our stakeholders will deliver for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the post-tournament legacy. All projects will realize tangible and substantial human, economic, and social benefits. A lasting legacy of new sporting infrastructure for schools and communities, with combined sports development, education, and health benefits will be created. To be able to fulfil the 2022 FIFA World Cup's potential to stimulate growth, though, it is our responsibility to engage with the people of the region to ensure they benefit from these varied opportunities. A nation-building project of this scale requires the best talent. This talent needs to be identified and then continuously developed. One of our main initiatives in this regard is the establishment of a center of excellence, hosted in Qatar. The objective is to focus on developing promising young local and regional talent. The center of excellence will have an initial focus on skills relating to the sport industry, in tourism and hospitality. Our idea is to ensure that people from all over the Middle East are represented at the center of excellence. We are also looking into volunteering schemes that will ensure that the young people of Qatar and the region play a visible front-line role in hosting the FIFA World Cup. They will be our most important ambassadors for the region in 2022.</p><h4>How will Qatar and the region benefit from the tournament, and why is football important here?</h4><p>The Middle East is an untapped market of enormous potential for FIFA and global football. I believe that the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar will act as a catalyst for positive change in a whole number of domains. This is a region with a young and vibrant population, which has a real passion for football. Also, Middle Eastern and Asian football is on the rise. Three out of the eight teams in the quarterfinals of the 2013 FIFA U20 World Cup in Turkey were from the Middle East or Asia: Iraq, Uzbekistan, and South Korea. Our FIFA World Cup will be the first time that a sporting event of such magnitude is hosted in the Middle East, and we are convinced that it will result in a long-term positive impact on the region as a whole. The sport industry is growing rapidly and according to a 2011 AT Kearney study is valued at an approximately $625 billion, with the bulk of growth coming from new and developing markets. These developing markets—including the Middle East and North Africa—have an expected annual growth of 7%. Moreover, according to a study commissioned by the Qatar 2022 Bid Committee and undertaken by Grant Thornton, the value of the hospitality and tourism sectors in Middle Eastern countries alone is approximately $655 billion and contributes 8.6% of GDP—this is set to grow to around $2 trillion­—increasing the contribution to as much as 10%. The FIFA World Cup provides this region with the opportunity to take on responsibility and leadership in these growing industries. It provides a platform for using the power of football to foster knowledge and understanding toward the region and to break down social barriers and misconceptions, thus opening up international opportunities and dialogue. Through football we can foster mutual cooperation and build lasting partnerships. And because of the emphasis we have placed on innovation in our hosting concept, greater economic diversification is to be expected as a result of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The period between now and 2022 will incorporate extensive preparation and intense economic activity and development that will result in a boost for the entire region, and especially for the region's people. We can contribute to a better social, cultural, and economic future for our people, for Qatar, and for the region.</p><h4>How will infrastructure and organization avert unnecessary problems during the tournament, and how will Qatari society directly benefit?</h4><p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar will bring people together, united by a shared love of football. The tournament will be hosted by Qatar, but will very much showcase the best of the Middle East and North Africa to the rest of the world, providing visitors the opportunity to appreciate the region's unique mix of cultures. This will be the world's most compact FIFA World Cup. All matches will be held within 60 kilometres of central Doha, with easy commutes between attractions. The whole FIFA Delegation (delegates, officials and the Local Organising Committee) will work and reside in a single, dedicated FIFA cluster for the duration of the tournament. Advanced transit systems will reduce travel times, lower travel costs, and allow fans to see two matches in one day. Fans will be able to participate in more events, socialize, interact with sponsors, and experience local culture. In addition, teams will stay in one Team Base Camp, or in high-quality hotels within easy reach of venues, for the duration of the tournament.</p><h4>What efforts are being made to reduce the negative environmental impact of the World Cup?</h4><p>Throughout the process of design and construction, focus will be given to the promotion of environmentally sustainable development and to comprehensively reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the tournament. Proposals are being developed for a visible post-tournament legacy, based on passive, integrated design and onsite renewable energy generation. We are committed to delivering a carbon -neutral tournament, inclusive of international air travel emissions. We committed considerable resources during the bidding process to prove that the cooling technology (which will cool open-air stadiums, training grounds, and outdoor fan areas) works. The technology has already been in use since 2008 at Al Sadd Stadium. During the bid, we demonstrated that this technology could be powered by renewable energy. Our commitment to forging ahead with implementing and developing these technologies is grounded in the legacy it will offer to Qatar and countries with similar climates. It will enable sports to be played 12 months of the year. The application of this technology is not limited to stadiums or sports venues. It can be applied in public spaces, so outdoor life can be enjoyed by countries near the equator all year round, regardless of climate.</p><div class="quote">“  The Middle East is an untapped market of enormous potential for FIFA and global football. "</div><h4>Is there a strong tradition of football in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar is a young country, but we have a football tradition, which we are proud of and aim to build on in the coming years. Our past successes include finishing runner-up in the 1981 FIFA U-20 World Cup, beating England and Brazil in the quarter and semi-finals respectively, before losing to a strong West German side in the final. We then also reached the semi-finals of the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championships in Italy (in the U17 category), before translating that success to the grand stage during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Our golden generation of players, including legendary striker Mubarak Mustafa, led Qatar to the quarterfinals in Barcelona, and a regional Gulf Cup triumph later the same year. We then hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1995, and continued with our regional successes in 2004 and 2006 by winning the Gulf Cup and the Doha Asian Games.  Our country is currently making giant strides in the world of football for a country of its size. Al Sadd, a Qatari club, won the AFC Champions League in 2011 and finished in third place in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan in the same year. We already have an excellent array of sporting infrastructure in place, and we are placing an emphasis on youth development to ensure that the next generation of Qatari players can compete at the highest level in 2018 and in 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the importance of sport, tourism, and education as a part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, and the role of Aspire Zone within that context?<br></h4><p>The Qatar National Vision 2030 addresses major challenges facing Qatar, and its wise leadership has foreseen the long-term benefits of investing in diversity. Sport has the ability to empower individuals. It can encourage people of all ages to become more physically active, provide opportunities for recreation and personal development, build self-esteem, and foster positive social connection with peers. This aspect of sport as a tool for development is central to the Qatar Nation Vision 2030, as sport will realize all four of the development pillars for Qatar. The Aspire Zone Foundation (AZF), since its inception in 2003 as the Sports City project, is committed to carrying Qatar to the status of a true knowledge-based society by offering the country an empowered and healthy population working toward the goals of 2030. AZF has evolved, and today works to develop sports champions, promote healthy lifestyles, and galvanize the sports economy of today—and of the future—through a network of member organizations: Aspire Academy, Aspetar, and Aspire Logistics. Some of the important programs and initiatives include Aspire ACTIVE, Aspire Football Dreams, and Step into Health. Furthermore, Qatar is now home to over 175 nationalities. AZF harnesses the universal popularity of sport as a social connector and brings people and communities together.</p><h4>How important is the legacy of the Asian Games in preparations for future international sports events?</h4><p>The Asian Games 2006 signaled Qatar's arrival on the global sports stage, as over 10,500 athletes from 45 countries around the globe participated. The opening ceremony alone, held at Khalifa International Stadium, welcomed 50,000 spectators. In addition, the 15-day event drew a television audience of 1.5 billion viewers. This country has a long and proven track record of hosting world-class sport events. From the cycling Tour of Qatar, to annual tennis championships, and Golf masters, Qatar sees a bevy of sport activities all year round. Today, Qatar is synonymous with such global brands as FC Barcelona, 2022 FIFA World Cup 2022, Paris Saint-Germain, the Al Kass International Cup, the prestigious ASPIRE4SPORT, Doha GOAL Forum events, and more. As curators, hosts, and organizers, we at AZF are experiencing some of our busiest years in recent memory as we gear up to further capture the imagination of the sporting world. Because of AZF's critical role on Qatar's sporting map, we will not simply be the home to one of the 12 stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but we will also watch eagerly as an entire generation of some of our Aspire Academy graduates take to the field and compete against the world's best.</p><h4>What is Aspire Zone's role in attracting tourism to Qatar?</h4><p>From Aspire Dome, credited as the world's largest indoor multipurpose dome, to Aspire Park, acknowledged as one of the most inspiring parks in the Gulf region, Aspire Zone is an ultimate haven for enthusiasts of sports and an active lifestyle. Of course, AZF has been so successful because Qatar is the economic superstar of the GCC, as well as an authentic bearer of the Middle East's rich culture. Any stay in Doha is filled with new experiences to be shared with friends and prospects from across the five continents. Consequently, Qatar has become an international hub for conferences and exhibitions and, over the past few years, has played host to an array of world-class events, including the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 18, and the World Innovation Summit for Education. AZF is also home to two five-star luxury hotels, Grand Heritage Doha Hotel and Spa, and the Torch Doha Hotel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Qatar's economic growth?<br></h4><p>The National Vision 2030 is leading the country along a path of economic diversification. Hospitality is regarded as one of the strategic drivers, and this entails investments in Qatar in addition to investments in tourist areas abroad. Hospitality is part of the infrastructure needed to support the organic development of the country. As for the development of the tourism industry in Qatar, we need facilities and services that go beyond a portfolio of hotels. The new Hamad International Airport is a world-class facility that will greatly enhance the passenger experience. That said, Qatar's infrastructure is developing at a rapid pace and, subsequently, the entertainment offering also diversifies year by year. From high-end shopping malls and traditional souks, world-class museums and cultural hubs, to parks and unique outdoor recreational facilities alongside an increasing portfolio of hotels and food and beverage concepts, Qatar has something to offer residents and tourists alike.</p><h4>The tourism sector is becoming increasingly important in Qatar, with 85,000 new hotel rooms set to reach the market by 2022. What role does Katara Hospitality play in these plans?</h4><p>Today, in terms of current room supply, Katara Hospitality was ranked the market leader during a recent benchmarking exercise conducted by Ernst &amp; Young. We have recently launched a new project in the Marina District of Lusail city. With an architectural design inspired by the seal of Qatar, the Iconic Towers in the Marina District are set to become a hospitality landmark for the industry. The crossed swords of the national seal have been architecturally translated into twin arched towers that rise gracefully from the podium level, while the landscaped gardens and sea promenade symbolize the ocean and the palm trees. The complex will host a luxurious five-star hotel that will cater to discerning business travelers and a lavish six-star hotel to meet the needs of those seeking sophisticated luxury accommodation, while branded apartments will accommodate permanent residents looking for the utmost comfort. This complex will include a total of 614 units. State-of-the-art entertainment and recreational facilities, including specialized boutiques, VIP movie theaters, exquisite signature restaurants, and a private cigar lounge are to be complemented by exquisite banqueting and conference spaces, as well as office-dedicated areas. Another hotel development is currently under study on a plot of land we acquired in the Foxhills district of Lusail city. In terms of our existing properties in Qatar, many will undergo major renovation works in 2013.</p><h4>How would you characterize the five-star sector in Doha?</h4><p>The five-star hotel sector in Qatar showcases a variety of hotel concepts, from hotels that have shaped the hospitality landscape over decades to new entries addressing niche markets. The domestic properties under Katara Hospitality portfolio marked several firsts in Qatar: the hotel currently known as Doha Marriott Hotel was the first five-star hotel; the Sheraton Doha was the first internationally branded property; the Ritz-Carlton Doha was the tallest building in Qatar at the time of opening; Sealine Beach Resort was the first leisure destination in the country; and Sharq Village &amp; Spa was the first luxury resort on the market. We will continue to develop hospitality environments that are not only representative of our portfolio, but also emblematic of the country itself.</p><h4>What are some of the benefits and challenges of operating in Qatar?</h4><p>Katara Hospitality is primarily an asset manager. However, the development aspect of our business is closely related to and interconnected with our core expertise. We have always worked closely with international hotel operators and each development was a learning experience for us. We identified the growth potential of business tourism in the country and we created the Merweb brand to meet the needs of discerning business travelers. Merwebhotel Al Sadd was the pilot project in the development of the Merweb brand and it opened in late 2001. The hotel has received permanent recognition in the market for its services tailored to the needs of business travelers looking for affordable comfort. This year will see the opening of Merwebhotel City Centre. Directly connected to the City Centre shopping mall, the hotel is set to offer 362 units and a complete range of services tailor made to meet the needs of discerning business travelers.</p><div class="quote">“  The five-star hotel sector in Qatar showcases a variety of hotel concepts. "</div><h4>Which markets will Katara Hospitality focus on in the near future?</h4><p>Katara Hospitality's mixed portfolio ranges from historical palace properties to business and resort hotels—there is no prototype that we look for in an asset before investing in it. Our diversification and expansion strategy involves investing in properties suited to our ethos and style, aligned with the Katara Hospitality brand values, while considering the return the hotel is likely to yield. Katara Hospitality is currently evaluating investment opportunities in business and leisure hotels in Western Europe, North Africa, and the Arab Peninsula, as well as Southeast Asia and North America. Furthermore, as a government entity, we constantly find investment opportunities in emerging markets, following the directions generated by the country's foreign policy in supporting developing economies. By investing in emerging markets, we take the challenge of being pioneers that support the development of the tourism industry in future destinations. Katara Hospitality will introduce the first internationally branded hotel in the Union of Comoros—a project due for completion in 2015—while we recently signed an MoU for investing in a hospitality development in the Republic of the Gambia and for another project in the Maldives.</p><h4>What leads your decisions when planning to acquire a hotel?</h4><p>When engaging in a project, we seek out that something special that sets the project apart and adds an exceptional dimension to our business, while taking into account the return the hotel is likely to yield. Katara Hospitality does not focus exclusively on acquiring iconic properties. We also create hospitality icons or turn assets that were designed for other purposes into true hospitality gems. A relevant example here is the Tazi Palace in Tangier, which was designed to become a royal residence and was transformed into a luxurious palace hotel.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans for Katara Hospitality?</h4><p>We are planning to own 30 hotels by 2016 and 30 more by 2030. Katara Hospitality currently owns 26 properties, operational or under development, with 2011-2012 marking an important milestone in the company's development, as we practically doubled our portfolio by acquiring properties in strategic international locations. Our European presence is also strong, and 2013-2014 will see the opening of several iconic properties in key markets. With a solid presence in France, Switzerland, and Italy, we are looking for further investments in key European markets, including the UK, Germany, and Mediterranean countries. We are considering investments in North America. Our aim is to become one of the leading hospitality organizations in the world and the Vision 2030 creates the ideal framework to achieve this goal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Al Sulaiti Law Firm leverage its experience and reputation to provide the most innovative and expert advice for its clients?<br></h4><p>Al-Sulaiti is a local law firm with a regional reach and a global outlook. We are not subject to the prohibition on litigation imposed on international law firms. Consequently, we are able to offer our clients a fully integrated service that includes both non-contentious and contentious representation. On the non-contentious side, we work in a variety of areas, including corporate law, franchise agreements, lease and sale contracts, foreign investment, and mergers and acquisitions. On the contentious side, our litigation team has experience litigating all types of cases, such as labor, civil, criminal, administrative, and commercial law. By helping clients to define and realize their business strategy prior to the emergence of disputes, we are positioned to sensitize our litigation strategy to their broader business interests. Al-Sulaiti Law Firm is a founding member of the MENA City Lawyers regional network, which includes firms in Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Syria. This network allows us to assist our clients with discrete questions of foreign law and, where appropriate, rapidly give our clients feet and hands across the Middle East. Our firm includes lawyers from five countries, including Egypt, France, Italy, and the US. Our educational and experiential diversity allows us to quickly bridge the gap between our clients' legal traditions and the rules and procedures of Qatar. Moreover, we are able to work comfortably with contracts governed by foreign law. Our foreign clients often arrive in Qatar with a time-is-money mentality. They are often best served by, and most comfortable working with, a lawyer who shares their predisposition. At other times—particularly when informally resolving a dispute with a Qatari citizen—it is better for our clients to turn to my understanding of the social terrain and my patient, soft touch. We currently represent Qatar Football Association and have already developed a distinguished sports law practice, which will grow in importance as Qatar approaches the 2022 World Cup. In addition, we are currently collaborating with Tiefenthaler Attorneys, a globally recognized South African law firm, to further develop our construction practice.</p><h4>How would you characterize Qatar's legal framework, and what characteristics make it so attractive for foreign companies and FDI?</h4><p>Qatar's legal framework is based on those of France and Egypt. Its deeply rooted civil law framework is attractive to foreign investors because it is highly similar to those found in many of their own countries. Furthermore, Qatar continuously modernizes its legislation and institutions to attract investors. For example, the Qatar International Court and Resolution Centre, located in the Qatar Financial Centre, has highly experienced foreign judges and applies procedures similar to those in common law jurisdictions.</p><h4>What are some of the legal challenges that foreign investors should be made aware of?</h4><p>To do business directly in Qatar, a foreign investor must act through a locally incorporated entity, which means that Qatari corporate law should have a foundational position in an investor's strategy. In ordinary cases, Qatari citizens or other local entities must own a minimum of 51% of a local entity's capital. We work with our other clients to draft articles of incorporation and shareholder agreements to maximize their control over the local entity. But so long as this rule remains, the core solution is not creative drafting, but rather embracing the partnership. We assist our clients in identifying local partners whose backgrounds and temperaments will complement their own. We then guide them in using the articles of association to articulate a positive and synergistic mandate for the partnership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have made successful investments around the world in recent years. What overall approach do you take in investing abroad, and how would you characterize the current investment environment in emerging markets?</h4><p>At KBW, we invest in a diverse array of businesses around the globe, from established businesses in the construction industry to promising technology start-ups. The key is to select investments that align with the changing needs of a particular region. KBW was born out of the recognition that synergies do exist between diverse companies, and their growth can be greatly enhanced if their efforts are synchronized. This is true in both established and emerging markets. At the same time, I learned from my father to invest in companies that matter, looking particularly for those with a solid history and/or clear vision for the future. And of course, I invest in companies that I feel passionate about.</p><h4>The Brazilian market has been of particular interest to you, although some investors have retreated from the country over the past three years. How do you see the country's prospects over the next five years, and what sectors do you see as most promising?</h4><p>I've studied the Brazilian market closely over the past two years, and in that time have seen an increasing role for the private sector, particularly related to infrastructure projects. For Brazil to continue growing, it will need to invest in infrastructure such as railways, highways, and ports. That's why we have chosen to focus specifically on infrastructure projects, as well as oil and gas, logistics, and mining. In Brazil, I see the most promise in services that are pegged to the US dollar, such as oil and gas, and with product prices that are defined by international markets, such as commodities. As one example, KBW has invested in a $430 million infrastructure complex, namely Petrocity Portos S.A., which will serve the oil industry in Brazil and is based near one of Brazil's large new oil-producing areas. We have also supported Royal Minerals, which explores for iron ore, gravel, and granite, and Arcadia Engenharia do Brasil, a construction and engineering firm. Importantly, as we invest in Brazil, we are working closely with local and regional governments to understand what they need from the private sector. For instance, during my last visit to Brazil, I met with local and regional governments in Espirito Santo and Santa Catarina, where KBW's South American head office will be located. We had a firsthand look into what Brazilian local governments would like to see from the private sector, particularly in terms of private-public partnership (PPP) initiatives.</p><div class="quote">“One of my greatest ambitions is to see this next generation realize its full potential and entrepreneurial promise."</div><h4>KBW Holding has recently acquired Italian crane maker Raimondi. How will you develop that investment over the coming years?</h4><p>This investment is a response to the tremendous growth potential I see ahead for both Brazil and the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. KBW is working with Raimondi Cranes, a 150-year-old Italian crane company, to set up a manufacturing unit in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India. and Malta. These are regions of the world where we are seeing an explosion of construction, and as we know cranes are vital to that construction and ultimately to building new economies.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is showing very strong GDP growth and is investing billions in infrastructure and services. What ambitions do you have for the Saudi market?</h4><p>One of my greatest ambitions is to see this next generation realize its full potential and entrepreneurial promise. The young people of Saudi Arabia hold the keys to our future—but we must help them channel their creative energy in effective ways. Start-ups provide the energy, vitality, and dynamism essential to any growing economy. By supporting them, we can help bring greater opportunity to the youth of Saudi Arabia—and in turn, help their success become the country's success. Investing can help, but we also need to work together to build a supportive environment that sets innovative thinkers up to succeed. That means making it easier for start-ups and budding entrepreneurs to be creative, to start new companies, and even to fail sometimes in the process. For example, the King Abdullah Scholarship is vital to helping entrepreneurs succeed. However, the vision that King Abdullah and his advisors have for this amazing program needs to be supported with actual opportunities for young graduates to go out and stand on their own two feet, instead of being chaperoned constantly. They need the opportunity to try, and even to fail, in the real world. You only learn from your mistakes.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see KBW Holding in five years in terms of its size and portfolio?</h4><p>A private equity portfolio consisting of the assets of a variety of different companies has many variables that impact the overall result, so this is not an easy question to answer. Simultaneously, there are a number of decisions that will impact our size. For example, something we are discussing within the firm is whether or not to accept new investors. It's a decision that will inevitably bring changes, specifically in the regulatory aspect. So time will tell, but suffice it to say I am confident about our future.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Milaha's vision is “to be a globally recognized player in the shipping and maritime services sector, building on a strong regional foothold in transportation and logistics." What are your strategies to achieve this?<br></h4><p>Our strategy is one for the long term; we don't develop strategies on an annual basis. We have a clear idea of where we want to be in five to 10 years, and are working our way toward that. Of course, we will adjust mid course as circumstances dictate, but our vision remains the same. We intend to continue strengthening our presence in the region in various sectors, while targeting an increased presence in others on the global stage. Ultimately, shareholder value creation and alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030 is our guiding principle. More specifically, Milaha is looking to grow organically in areas where we already have a significant presence and strong foundation. We will seek to acquire in order to add a larger footprint beyond our current markets or expand our service offering. We are actively seeking to partner with other established companies that can bring complementary capabilities or innovative business models that allow us to compete more effectively and sustainably. Internally, as part of our transformation efforts, we have, and will continue to significantly invest in our people, processes, systems, and capabilities, which will lay the foundation that takes us to the next level as a group.</p><h4>Milaha reported a 30% jump in net profit to QAR574 million in the first half of 2013. What do you attribute this success to?</h4><p>Milaha's ongoing internal transformation initiatives, along with improved market conditions, drove strong performance. Externally, volume growth, combined with increased efficiencies, resulted in a continued upward trend for Milaha's port services unit. Container shipping and logistics results also improved significantly over 1H2012. Deployment of two new vessels, combined with significantly higher utilization of the offshore fleet, led to robust improvement in Halul Offshore's results relative to 1H2012. Milaha's investment portfolio posted strong results, mainly driven by dividend growth, revaluations, and market trading activities. Our internal efforts over the past couple of years to restructure our organization, capabilities, and processes have also played a role in the improved results.</p><h4>How does Milaha cement Qatar's role as the largest LNG exporter in the world?</h4><p>Milaha plays a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in Qatar's LNG sector. The group has a 30% stake in Qatar Gas Transport Company (QGTC), which is the state LNG transportation company. Milaha also has varying ownership stakes in nine LNG vessels, which are under long-term charters to Qatari gas producers and exporters. In 2012, Milaha increased its ownership in two of the joint-owned LNG vessels, and also began to operate these vessels commercially. These vessels were renamed Milaha Ras Laffan and Milaha Qatar. Gulf LPG, a 50-50 joint venture between Milaha and Qatar Gas Transport Company (QGTC), was formed in 2008 to own four Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs). The vessels are engaged in the transportation of LPG cargoes worldwide, and these include loading LPG cargoes from Qatar. Our offshore subsidiary, Halul Offshore, is the single largest provider of offshore supply service vessels to Qatar's oil and gas industry, while also holding the largest diving services contract anywhere in the world. So you can see this is a critical sector for us and we are continuously looking for ways to enhance our capabilities to play a larger role across the supply chain in this sector.</p><h4>Qatar is aiming to position itself as a leading exporter of petrochemicals. To what extent is Milaha involved in the shipment of these products?</h4><p>At this time, Milaha is a key transporter for petrochemicals exports from Qatar. We are involved in the transport of ammonia using our gas carriers, which are time-chartered to Muntajat, the newly formed petrochemicals marketing company of Qatar. In addition, Milaha is feedering, on an exclusive basis, Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) from QAPCO, Q-Chem, and Qatofin, from Mesaieed to hub ports in the Gulf. We are currently positioning ourselves to expand our offering in this critical downstream segment. Given the anticipated growth in exports from Qatar over the coming years, we are evaluating ways to build a long-term relationship with Muntajat, and bring new tonnage to this sector.</p><h4><br>In 2011, Milaha took over operations and management duties at Doha Port. What were the strategic decisions behind this, and how has it increased the efficiency of port operations?</h4><p>Milaha has been a provider of stevedoring services at Doha Port since the late 1950s. As part of our strategic direction setting in 2010, and in alignment with Qatar's National Vision 2030, Milaha renewed its focus on supply chain-related businesses, and was awarded the contract to fully manage Doha Port in 2012. Since then, the port services unit has embarked on a comprehensive operational excellence program, which targeted, but was not limited to, health and safety, training, operations, management, and administration. We are undertaking a process of continuous improvement to achieve internationally recognized operating standards. Milaha is currently executing a ten-point plan in Doha Port to increase throughput capacity to a minimum of 750,000 TEUs, which will be completed on schedule during 2013. Through process improvement and better utilization of equipment, Milaha has increased net vessel productivity from 10 to 15 moves per hour. Restructuring of yard and operational process has reduced truck turnaround time from 16 hours to three hours, inclusive of customs inspection procedures. Milaha has also installed the Jade Mastercare Terminal Operating System (TOS), which benefits Doha Port and the entire port community.</p><h4>Who are Milaha's main customers in Qatar, and how do you intend on expanding your customer base?</h4><p>The group is focused on providing solutions and filling critical gaps in the supply chain for three core customer segments, including the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors; non-energy customers; and shipowners and operators. Milaha is playing a key role in the offshore oil and gas industry value chain, from supporting early stage exploration and production activities to transporting end products globally. Milaha also provides integrated freight and logistics solutions for Qatar-based customers. Our 3PL services include freight forwarding, warehousing, and land transport, complemented by ocean transport services. Milaha additionally operates a shipping agency, representing 50 different ship owners, which have regular services operating to Qatari ports. The company's port management unit manages Doha Port, the main commercial port in Qatar, as well as a dedicated container terminal at Mesaieed Port, the base for the downstream industries sector in Qatar. Our long-term strategic plan is built around expanding our capabilities and services in each of these segments to become a partner, collaborator, and solutions provider of choice to our customers.</p><h4>As Milaha is one of the leading companies in its field, do you intend to expand operations regionally or internationally?</h4><p>Looking to the future, we believe that Milaha will be able to leverage its reputation, capabilities, and strong financial base to grow its footprint in Qatar, the region, and beyond. Our aim is to expand our participation in the supply chain in Qatar through careful development of capabilities and assets, and thereby continue to play an important role in Qatar's expansion over the coming years. In the medium term, we hope to expand Milaha's global presence. We want to leverage our capabilities to build a greater presence in ocean transport, particularly in gas and clean petroleum products. We are also actively expanding our strong offshore support capabilities into neighboring markets, and exploring opportunities beyond the region. This is a time of enormous change and opportunity. We have a new vision and a fresh focus to capitalize on the benefits of having a much larger and financially strong company. There is no time like the present to leverage our strong foundation to take the company to the next level.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Finance Minister of the Year for Emerging Europe in 2013, what accomplishments were you most proud of?<br></h4><p>First of all, policymaking is a team sport. Therefore, I am proud to accept this award on behalf of all of those who have worked hard along with me on moving Turkey forward through structural and macroeconomic reforms. As a team, we have managed to make our nation's economy far more inclusive and take the country to a higher level of development. Our reforms also provide a great pathway for sustainable growth over the coming decade. In our success story, fiscal discipline has played a great role. Historically, Turkey has suffered chronically from high budget deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. Our general government deficit, which stood at 10.8% of GDP when we took office in 2002, declined to just 1% in 2013. Turkey's fiscal deficit in 2013 was just one-fifth of the average deficit recorded by OECD member countries. As a result, our public sector debt fell from 74% in 2002 to 36.3% of GDP in 2013. If you look at that performance in the context of the Maastricht Criteria that apply to the countries in the eurozone, our debt-to-GDP ratio is just over half of the eurozone's 60% target set in the treaty. In fact, in the eurozone itself, only three small economies—Estonia, Luxembourg, and Latvia—perform better on that score than Turkey.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Finance's strategy to fight against Turkey's informal economy, which stands at roughly 26.5% of GDP?</h4><p>Significantly reducing the size of the shadow economy is of great importance to me. An informal economy leads to unfair competition, limits economies of scale, and, hence, hinders innovation and economic development. It also stands in the way of a properly functioning social security system. Since we took office in 2002, we have made great strides in reducing the size of the informal economy. Strengthening our country's tax audit capacity and increasing voluntary tax compliance are among our top priorities. I also believe the new Income Tax Law that I submitted to the Parliament in 2013 will be instrumental in incentivizing a switch to the formal economy. With the new law, we have combined the Income Tax Law and Corporate Tax Law into a single piece of legislation. This will enhance the simplicity, clarity, and the efficiency of revenue collection. It will also help to improve voluntary compliance. Through our investments into human resources and technology our tax audit capacity can now identify taxpayers and activities that are subject to tax by means of on-the-spot electronic inspection and audit. All of these measures boil down to one truly significant number. We have managed to reduce the share of informal employment within total employment from 52.1% in 2002 to 33.6% in January 2014, an 18.5% decline. However, more needs to be done. At 26.5% of GDP, our informal economy is still larger than the average 18.4% in the EU. Our main goal is to reduce informality to converge to the EU average over the medium term. In the long term, we aim to have an informal sector that accounts for a low share of GDP, similar to countries such as Germany. The Ministry of Finance is very pro-active on this front.</p><h4>What income tax reforms are priorities for the short term, and how will they affect Turkey's economy?</h4><p>We intend to simplify our tax code and create greater transparency and equity, while at the same time protecting taxpayers' rights and broadening the tax base. Therefore, our first priority is the approval of the new Income Tax Law, which was drafted with these objectives in mind. We submitted it to our parliament, the Grand National Assembly, in 2013. I expect the Draft Law to be ratified by the end of 2014. Additionally, we are now revising the Tax Procedure Law to harmonize it with our economic and social policies to make its provisions clearer and easier to implement. In addition to that, these reforms will lay the foundation for an effective, simple, and fair tax system to adequately fund our national priorities. These goals include sustainable development, an increase in our domestic savings rate, a reduction in the informal economy, and a lessening of regional disparities.</p><div class="quote">“  At the end of 2002, Turkish inflation stood at 68.4%, while by the end of 2013, the inflation rate had fallen to 7.4%. "</div><h4>How will Turkey's macroeconomic fundamentals prepare the economy for any shocks that the country may experience in 2014?</h4><p>There is no doubt that 2014 is shaping up to be a more complicated year for many emerging economies than most people expected. The combination of a reduction in market liquidity due to tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the simultaneous slowdown of the Chinese economy, the second-largest economy in the world, creates different challenges. Turkey's soft spot is its current account deficit (CAD). However, even there I expect significant adjustments in 2014. Surely, a major part of it will be because of the slowdown in domestic demand. Some of this was due to political uncertainty preceding local elections, some are due to tighter financial conditions, and others are due to the recent macro-prudential measures restricting credit growth. However, we expect that external demand will help lower our CAD with the recovery of the EU. The depreciation of the Turkish lira enhances the competitiveness of our exports. This comes at a good time, given a pickup of growth in the EU. The MENA region overall is also more stable now. Furthermore, gold imports are likely to fall and Turkey's tourism revenues will increase. With all these factors combined, the CAD will become more manageable. Furthermore, our flexible exchange rate and independent monetary policy will serve as automatic stabilizers. The depreciation of the lira reduces imports and makes exports more competitive, while higher interest rates increase savings, all leading to a lower CAD. Managing in a more crisis-prone global environment, we are also greatly helped by past reforms that have resulted in a sound and strong Turkish banking sector. It will cushion, rather than amplify, the external challenges that we are facing. For example, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of our banking system stood at 15.5% in February 2014. This ratio is nearly twice the required ratio of 8%. Finally, our strong fiscal position allows for room to counteract external shocks.</p><h4>Beyond the expected 4% growth rate, what other goals or targets does the Ministry of Finance have for 2014?</h4><p>In an environment of global volatility, contraction in global liquidity, and political tensions in some of our neighboring countries, preserving macroeconomic stability may be even more important than achieving our growth target. What is important is to reduce the CAD to manageable levels, keep the inflation rate at low levels (and in single digits), sustain the strong fiscal position, and raise savings. Combating inflation has been among our government's greatest success stories. At the end of 2002, Turkish inflation stood at 68.4%, while by the end of 2013, the rate had fallen to 7.4%. Our goal is to reduce it to the low-single digits. With fiscal discipline, we are giving leeway to the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) in its mandate to ensure price stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has influenced you the most in your career?</h4><p>My father has been my main source of inspiration in my career; another architect who has been very important is Luis Barragán. He has influenced me from the beginning in terms of simplicity. Today, my two sons are also a source of inspiration. They are in architecture now and are already here working with me. It is always the younger generation that brings in new ideas, and so you are always learning. It is important to have them here also because they are the only ones that tell you the truth.</p><h4>How has the family business evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was one of the best years in the history of the company. Since 1937, there hasn't been a year that we designed more projects than in 2013, while 2014 also looks outstanding. We have lined up some of the most interesting projects we've ever taken on. We are working a lot in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, and in other cities around the country. We feel that our situation has been exceptional. Although the economy is still not flying, everybody has high expectations for what is coming next.</p><div class="quote">“Before, shopping centers were just consumption traps, but not they are completely different in terms of their inspiration."</div><h4>Could you tell us more about the performance of these projects in the real estate area?</h4><p>We just opened Antea Lifestyle Center in Queretaro. Antea is the largest shopping center in Latin America, and it is one of the best designs that we have created. It has around 78,000 sqm of retail space. Up to today, we have opened around 60% of the shopping center. What is fantastic news for us is that we currently have around 10,000 cars pulling in every day on average—and it is not yet fully open. This means we are turning every parking space that we have in the shopping center 2.5 times, with only 60% of the retail space opened. We estimate that we will receive around 12 million people a year when fully open. We are also opening a fantastic shopping center in Veracruz, in front of the ocean with a beach front near the convention center in the city. Also, in Mexico City, we have started the construction of Picacho Lifestyle Center, which is a project like Antara Polanco but in the south of the city. We think that this project will revolutionize retail in Mexico; we have the most important brands and it has around 120,000 sqm of leasable area. There will also be four office towers at around 20,000 sqm each. We are very proud of the design. At this point in time, we are finishing El Toreo, which is a shopping center that is on the border of Mexico City and the state of Mexico. It is fantastic to work with some clients as designers, and we are very proud to include some new concepts in El Toreo. We have designed a park on top of the center of about 6,000 sqm. This will change the way people view greenery in shopping centers. It has a large-scale roof, which is going to be one of the biggestin Mexico.</p><h4>What is the significance of these new concepts?</h4><p>It is not only about architecture, but the whole experience. Before, shopping centers were just consumption traps, but not they are completely different in terms of their inspiration. Today, they can be a place where people would like to be, spend time, dine, shop, and walk. I wanted to create a spot that I would love to go and spend time. Since Antara Polanco, we have put together a whole different experience. We are also thinking of new ways of doing cinemas. We want to make cinemas with an open screen within the compound. The next trend that will be important is art in the retail space. It is more and more difficult to get people into cultural spaces because people enjoy the idea of shopping more. This way, we can get the best of both worlds—shopping and art.</p><h4>Is this new concept an answer to a growing need in Mexico, or are you starting a new trend?</h4><p>I think we respond to what the people are thinking and how they feel. People travel much more now, so they understand more. Every day the customer is becoming more sophisticated and relaxed. People need a relaxed atmosphere.</p><h4>You recently merged with the Spanish group Ortiz. How has that experience been?</h4><p>It's been great because we have encountered a partner that is really capable, has a lot of technology, and understands perfectly the Mexican way of doing things. We feel extremely comfortable with Ortiz. We were very successful with the shopping center in Queretaro. We finished it on budget and in time, which is always a challenge. We have made our partners understand the difference; you can really control the pricing and get good results.</p><h4>What is Mexico's architectural identity?</h4><p>Mexico has a very large border with the US, but it has always tried to keep its identity. I think that the country has its own traditions. We have many European roots; we have a mixture that has lead it to become one of the few countries that has its own architectural identity. In most of the countries in Europe, Canada, or the US, you cannot tell if a building was designed by a Frenchman or and Englishman. I think that having this fusion of cultures in Mexico has created a different language in architecture.</p><h4>What are the opportunities?</h4><p>In the future I believe that technology will revolutionize architecture. We will be changing and generating new experiences. The important thing is to be open to change. Mexico has a huge opportunity today due to all the new reforms. The energy reform will especially be a great success for the country.</p><h4>Are you thinking about going international?</h4><p>We are definitely looking to develop an idea in Spain. We are also looking at the US. The problem we have now is that we have so many projects here in Mexico that we haven't had time to go elsewhere. But, of course, we are always eager and we would like to go forward and expand internationally.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Tanzanian market for Serengeti Breweries?</h4><p>We are a substantial investor in Tanzania, which is the fifth largest beer market in Africa. GDP growth has been running at between 6% and 7% over the past seven years, in excess of 50% of the population is under 30, and we are likely to see significant growth of the middle class. All of these elements lead to a highly attractive market and we have strong brands at play. Currently, the market size is significant as, indeed, is the informal market. A number of opportunities present themselves as a result. We have invested strongly in our brands and in innovation. Clearly in the spirit market, we note that an emerging middle class will tend to gravitate toward spirit brands like Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Smirnoff. We are well prepared and confident in our potential to deliver in this market.</p><h4>How is Serengeti Breweries working to increase the level of local sourcing?</h4><p>We are hugely pleased with the progress we have made with our agribusiness in Tanzania. We have a dedicated agribusiness team who work with farmers to improve yields through an improved variety of seeds and agronomy and are proud of the results we have achieved with the many farmers with whom we work . Currently, we are working in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Our objective is to halve the level of imported raw materials and double our local production. To do this, we need to encourage and develop more barley farming in the country, and considerable work with farmers has been done on this front. Currently, we have 52 farmers engaged as partners with us, and we expect to yield between 6,000 and 8,000 tons of barley in 2014. It is an exciting project as it benefits both the farmers and our company. It is important that the government continues to support this type of partnership, which supports local production. We have our own local beer brands, such as Senator, Kibo, Kick, and Pilsner, which are made of 100% local raw materials. It is possible to reach 100% local sourcing for all of our beer brands. The current limiting factor is the crop yield from the farms. Therefore, providing that barley farmers remain competitive, there is no reason why our business shouldn't look to achieve 95%—100% beer production utilizing locally sourced raw materials.</p><div class="quote">“The branded beer and spirits sector in Tanzania is increasingly vibrant."</div><h4>What is the extent of government support for this initiative?</h4><p>We enjoy excellent relations with the Ministry of Agriculture and with the Tanzania Investment Center. We currently work with all relevant stakeholders and we are developing a significant barley sector.</p><h4>Is the domestic barley supply adequate?</h4><p>We would ideally need to double the cultivated area, so there is still a long way to go before we reap the crop's full potential. The challenge with barley is that it has to be grown at a particular altitude, and there are only specific regions in this country, such as West Kilimanjaro, that are suitable for this crop.</p><h4>How are the farmers responding to this move toward cash crop production?</h4><p>They have been receptive, despite the challenging transition from subsistence agriculture. We provide various services for selected farmers including seed and educational programs. This year alone, we have provided 300 tons of seed to farmers. We have one anchor agri-business manager supported by a team of advisors, but the main responsibility lies with the Ministry of Agriculture, which we partner with.</p><h4>What are your short-term targets?</h4><p>From a brewing perspective, we recently garnered three Monde Selection quality awards for our outstanding beers. We won a gold medal for Kibo Gold, a silver medal for Serengeti brewed at our Dar es Salaam plant, and two gold medals for Serengeti brewed at our Mwanza plant. This confirms our brands are of the highest quality and have been recognized internationally over the last two years. We have put a lot of investment into our business, and I am confident we now have a good base for future growth.</p><h4>How much of what you produce is exported?</h4><p>We are primarily interested in satisfying the increasing demand from our Tanzanian consumers. In addition, logistically speaking, exporting from Tanzania into neighboring markets is extremely challenging in terms of cross border movement. That being said, we do export beer to Kenya, and Serengeti can be found in select outlets in London.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the beer sector in Tanzania?</h4><p>The branded beer and spirits sector in Tanzania is increasingly vibrant, and I believe that this is a good thing for our industry. We have a wide portfolio of brands that will continue to satisfy consumers in every segment of the population. We believe that Tanzania presents untapped opportunities that we are well placed to exploit. As the market develops, I think we will see people trading up from cloudy to clear beer. That has been a pattern in most markets; as incomes rise, people trade up in qualitative terms. I also think that we will see a move into spirits, especially international brands, as people seek to drink better, but less. We are well placed to serve both of these trends. Moreover, we are invested in the long term. Therefore, we will build long-term relationships with suppliers, consumers, and government.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[something-different]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Khalifa University was originally set up as Etisalat College in 1989. How have the curriculum and the university adapted to the demands of a diversified economy?</h4><p>Etisalat was indeed the precursor, but Khalifa University is a very different institution to what Etisalat was. Rather than describe how Etisalat was, I will describe what Khalifa University is. Etisalat was mostly for telecommunications and was focused on training undergraduates for the future. What we have now, and we are currently planning a very significant expansion, is a broad-based engineering college that covers all fields: biomedical, electrical, computers, aerospace, nuclear energy, and telecommunications. We now have PhD programs in all these fields, too. So it is really very different. Etisalat continues to contribute significantly to the Khalifa University Sharjah Campus, especially in telecommunications and electrical and computer engineering. Khalifa University was created by decree to become the UAE's principal research university in engineering and biomedical sciences, as well as moving into natural and physical sciences. That will be the next major expansion—the creation of a medical school. We hope to have our first class there in 3Q2014. It will likely be a small class of about 24 students. Internationally, there are typically two styles of medical schools. There is what is called the American-Canadian style and there is the British-European style. The medical schools currently in the Middle East, with the exception of Qatar Cornell, are all British-European styles. This style of medical school is not as clinically and research focused as American-Canadian schools. Ours will be an American-Canadian style institution. This is a dramatic difference. Our expectation is that our students will become consultants and not general physicians. Our method to achieve this is to pursue our partnership with a major US medical research school. Our intent is to work very closely with the healthcare delivery system in Abu Dhabi. SEHA has been a major partner for us too, and has been a major help in developing our project. We will have a very close relationships with local hospitals. We are currently attempting to recruit faculty members, especially in the basic science department. In conclusion, our university has developed significantly in the past five years, and it started the first PhD level engineering program in the UAE. Our student population has also grown a lot, starting out at 400 initially and now we have approximately 1,300, while 300 of those are graduate students. The graduate student share will increase significantly in the coming years.</p><h4>How does Khalifa University work with other institutions around the world?</h4><p>Khalifa University has a strong relationship with Georgia Tech, which is a very large and prominent engineering university. In fact, we have recruited some of our leadership from there. We have a relationship with Texas A&amp;M University, and we are exploring connections with top, US-based universities that enjoy a track record of research in the areas of medicine. In addition, we have strong research relationships with Bristol University, and our relationship with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) is one of our longest. It is a requirement for our engineering students to do an internship abroad; therefore, we have a number of informal relationships to facilitate this. These relationships are critically important to us.</p><div class="quote">“Around 25 years ago, there were eight or nine universities here. Now, there are over 70."</div><h4>What challenges are you faced with when recruiting international faculty?</h4><p>Khalifa University offers an exciting and challenging environment for faculty and researchers. It's a great experience to work in such a diverse community. Today, we have faculty from the US, Canada, Korea, Europe, and the Middle East. Also, the type of research that can be done here is particularly relevant to some researchers. For example, diabetes is a huge problem in the Middle East. If people are interested in this area, then they will find exciting challenges here. Our facilities are state of the art and we are about to expand our Abu Dhabi campus significantly, by 250%, and this includes a huge expansion of the laboratory space.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the quality of higher education in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>It is quite varied, which is not at all surprising. The UAE is an incredibly young country. Around 25 years ago, there were eight or nine universities here. Now, there are over 70. The higher education sector in Abu Dhabi is still relatively new and there is certainly a lot of work ahead to improve it. It's refreshing to see the growth in the number of universities, and the government has put forward plans to improve quality. Khalifa University is considered one of the milestones with its unique offerings, and we hope that it will continue along the same pace and help Abu Dhabi achieve its goals.</p><h4>Is branding important, and could international brands expand their presence here?</h4><p>It is important that UAE universities are developed. It is nice that Sorbonne and NYU are present and are helping to develop the country; they definitely enrich the educational experience here. The presence of foreign partners is very valuable, but Khalifa University is a national university that will serve the Emirati population and always work toward catering to the needs of Abu Dhabi and the UAE as a whole.</p><h4>To what extent does your institution cooperate with local universities?</h4><p>Quite a lot. We collaborate a lot with Masdar in particular due to the nature of our relationship. Masdar is only for graduates, so we talk to each other about preparatory programs and library resources. We also run a range of student competitions, from aerospace design to solving different engineering problems.</p><h4>How is Khalifa University working with both the public and private sector here?</h4><p>Many of our internships are sponsored by different companies. For example, we have a group of students from aerospace engineering who are going to Boeing in June 2013. This program was paid for by Boeing. We have developed enough of a reputation in the past five years that Boeing and other companies want to see our students and are happy to sponsor them. In terms of research funding, this is where the majority of it comes from at present. We have our own budget at the moment, but a big portion is coming from these relationships. We also work with ENEC, Gasco, the Abu Dhabi Police, and Lockheed. The list goes on.</p><h4>To what extent are you encouraging your students to look to the private sector?</h4><p>Khalifa University works toward producing quality graduates. The skill set they carry makes them desirable in both the public and private sectors. Obviously, the government has immediate needs, so I suspect that most of our graduates will work with public institutions, but we are already seeing interest from private sector and we think that they will be a great addition to the nation.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Terranum established?</h4><p>Terranum was born when I returned to Colombia in 2004. We devised the idea of creating an integrated real estate platform based on what we had seen abroad in the US and Europe. We opted for the real estate investment trust (REIT) model. I had been working on REIT models in the US, and saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between the capital markets and the real estate sector. Pension funds were starting to grow and we had begun to look at alternatives to fixed-income instruments. Corporates had, until then, owned major real estate holdings and were starting to compete on a more global basis, which naturally required capital. The legal framework took us a couple of years to put in place, but since then we have seen that an integrated platform for the development of corporate real estate services encompassing the investment dimension has allowed us to offer clients a one-stop shop.</p><h4>What is the current state of your portfolio in Patrimonio Estrategias Inmobiliarias (PEI), the first REIT in Colombia, managed by your business unit Terranum Investment?</h4><p>We have Ps1.5 billion under management, and are currently present in Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Manizales. Roughly 63% of the portfolio is located in Bogotá, and the remainder between Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Manizales. Its business activity is roughly spread equally between office, industrial, and retail real estate, and has a diverse range of tenants. One of our business criteria is exposure to diverse sectors of the economy to ensure that the fund can withstand volatility. We are active in the financial, retail, and manufacturing sectors with 27 assets.</p><div class="quote">“Terranum Hotels develops, acquires, and operates hotels in strategic markets throughout Latin America."</div><h4>You have successfully completed your inaugural fundraising effort, through Terranum Capital, resulting in commitments of $235 million. Could you explain the investment philosophy of the real estate fund Terranum Capital, and the projects you are developing?</h4><p>Terranum Capital is our low-income housing initiative. The fund was closed in June of 2013 with $235 million through a wide pool of investors. These include institutional investors from Colombia, the region, and the US, as well as family offices from around the world. The target has been the housing deficit that we have in the region, which amounts to 20 million homes. The problem is that the deficit continues to grow each year. In that sense, we see approximately 10-15-years of opportunity for a fund like this to bring capital to a sector that needs it. It needs to grow more quickly to supply the deficit, and today we are active in Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. We have seven projects in Peru, five in Colombia, and two in Mexico. It's proven to be a very interesting and successful strategy, and hopefully there will be many more funds to come following exactly the same path.</p><h4>The Terranum Hotels division already operates two Aloft hotels, one in Colombia and another one in Costa Rica, with an additional one under development. What hotel projects do you plan realize in Colombia and Central America?</h4><p>Terranum Hotels develops, acquires, and operates hotels in strategic markets throughout Latin America. Thus, it has assembled a portfolio of internationally branded hotels, primarily in Colombia, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. Our partners include Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts and Marriott. In mid-May 2014, Grupo Terranum acquired Decameron Hotels &amp; Resorts. This acquisition included 27 owned, leased, and managed hotels in seven countries including Colombia (13), Mexico (3), Jamaica (2), Peru (3), El Salvador (1), Ecuador (2), and Panama (3). In September we will open W Bogotá, the first W hotel in Colombia, which is of course our flagship development in Bogotá.</p><h4>Your corporate property division focuses on creating bespoke office spaces designed according to the needs and image of your corporate clients. How is the CONNECTA project progressing?</h4><p>CONNECTA is a large office park with 250,000 sqm of gross leasable area (GLA). We recently completed the second phase, which features roughly 60,000 sqm of offices. These clients generally require schemes of a large area, and in fact most of our clients in CONNECTA have 5,000-sqm to 10,000-sqm spaces. We want to create a whole ecosystem there, catering to the full spectrum of client needs with a focus on sustainable development. In fact, all the buildings are LEED certified.</p><h4>We recently read that the Cadillac Fairview Corporation has announced a joint partnership with Terranum Corporate Properties. What is the importance of this partnership?</h4><p>It is very important in terms of confirming the appetite that Colombia is generating among world-class investors. Cadillac is one of the biggest real estate investors in the world, a part of the largest institutional investors in the world, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, and has committed $150 million to Terranum Corporate Properties to fuel our growth.</p><h4>President Santos has talked about the investment fund sector as being key to fostering trust in Colombia as a foreign investment destination. What role can companies like yours play in this?</h4><p>On the development front, we have been particularly active with foreign investors such as Equity International and Cadillac. Our REIT (PEI), from day, has enjoyed the participation of much of the local institutional community. The challenge is that PEI has performed so well that it hasn't made provisions to welcome international investors. This confirms a considerable volume of liquidity in the market. The real estate market is, after all, capital-intensive and, therefore, welcoming of foreign investment.</p><h4>What potential do you see in new regulations for Colombia for the fiduciary sector to grow?</h4><p>There is a lot of opportunity. Having clear rules is the key to giving confidence to investors. You should see a big boom in the asset management business here. There is liquidity, appetite, and opportunities. On the other hand, there is probably a lack of professional managers.</p><h4>In Colombia, the trust industry is an essential contributor to the economic growth of the country. Could you compare the Colombian fund industry with those in other countries of the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance will be a great success. We are working on several developments to take advantage of it, and there is going to be a lot of activity not only from Grupo Terranum but also other competitors. Other countries, in terms of the trust industry, have been transforming the landscape. In that regard, Colombia is still lagging behind, but it is not going to remain that way. More players will come and evolve, and we are able to become an asset class. Colombia needs more new products, stronger managers, and reliable regulations.</p><h4>What are your hopes for the real estate markets of the countries in which you plan to invest?</h4><p>The biggest opportunities are in Colombia and Peru. There is still much to be done; the inventory is obsolete, there is a lack of capital, but there is a lot of demand and growth. We are very active in both markets. Markets in Central America are a little tougher because they don't have the scale, but things are moving ahead. And I'm extremely optimistic about Mexico as it is a market that will outperform the rest for years to come. With regard to more established economies I believe it's a very different play. There are always opportunities but Terranum doesn't have an edge in these countries yet.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With over 6,000 kilometers of flow lines and pipelines and about 700 producing wells, the Shell Group is the pioneer and leader of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. How do you see Nigeria's production capability changing in the future?</h4><p>Nigeria is truly blessed with tremendous resources. There are not that many countries around the world with an oil and gas resource base that is as impressive as that of Nigeria. So the foremost challenge for Nigeria is not really technical in my view. It is mostly about having a conducive business and operating environment. There are and there always will be opportunities here. What the industry and the regulators need to do is to unlock these opportunities. Nigeria is a challenging place to operate, but it certainly has a resource base that allows some optimism for the future.</p><h4>What opportunities and challenges are there specifically?</h4><p>Nigeria is an expensive place to do business because of the security issues we face. Operating in the Niger Delta, both onshore and offshore, requires special precautions and measures that cost a lot of money. Because of that, the costs are higher compared to other places around the world. Another challenge is fiscal stability. What investors need is a sense of certainty. This is a business where investments don't generally provide a return in 12-18 months. Very often it takes up to 10 or even up to 20 years, so investors need predictability in terms of the fiscal environment. Broadly, I would say the economic environment we operate within is crucial in terms of having the confidence to continue to invest. If Nigeria can provide that, there is a lot of opportunity to be had.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance and potential of liquefied natural gas (LNG) resources for the Shell Group and Nigeria as a whole?</h4><p>It's very important. Nigeria LNG is one of the largest single LNG plants in the world. It is important for its shareholders, which include Shell, Total, ENI, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is actually the largest single shareholder in the venture. Today, the facility accounts for 8% of the global LNG market, and that's a very significant amount. Of course, the rest of the world is growing fast in terms of LNG capacity, for example Mozambique, but elsewhere, too. The world is looking for gas. It's a clean source of energy relative to some of the alternatives and tremendous growth is projected. There are currently six trains in operation at Nigerian LNG, and they want to potentially work on train seven. This could be a significant expansion as trains built today are larger than the ones built 10 or 15 years ago, meaning that Nigeria LNG may move from 22 million tons per annum to around 30 million tons if the conditions for investment are sound.</p><div class="quote">“Nigeria LNG is one of the largest single LNG plants in the world."</div><h4>How are Shell companies in Nigeria coping with local challenges, noticeably oil theft and pipeline sabotage?</h4><p>The biggest concern that comes with oil theft is the spillage and the pollution that it brings, and if we find a leaking theft point on our facilities, that is the main trigger for us to shut down our systems. We then fix the theft points, repair the leaking holes, and when we are sure it is safe, we get back to operations. We lose some production because people are stealing oil and, then, on the other hand, we leave a lot of oil in the ground because we have to shut down our facilities and wells while we repair the damage that has been done. That adds to the economic impact, both for us as operators but also for the government because of the money it would otherwise make through taxes and royalties and its share in the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV), a joint venture in which the government holds 55%. The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) holds a 30% share and is the operator of the SPDC JV.</p><h4>How do you see this joint venture going in the future?</h4><p>The SPDC JV is an unincorporated joint venture that SPDC has been in and operated for more than 50 years. SPDC as operator of the SPDC JV is a very important company in the Shell Group portfolio and is here to stay. SPDC is looking to continue to deliver value to Nigeria and to our shareholders while managing the business environment the best we can, and that's how we intend to take things forward.</p><h4>Despite the oil in Nigeria being of the highest quality and relatively easy to drill, many among the largest IOCs are currently retreating from the region and selling their Niger Delta oil fields. How can you explain this trend?</h4><p>I can only speak for Shell companies in Nigeria, and for us it is part of normal portfolio rationalization. What we are doing in Nigeria with some of the oil blocks that we've put up for sale is simply a consequence of having looked at our portfolio and made a decision that this is an area where other companies can also play. Some can perhaps add more value to it than we can. As with any other business, when that's the case, then that's when you consider divestment, so that's what we're doing. It's not a retreat. If you look at how much money the Shell Group is investing in Nigeria yearly, it's still at a very high level. We've got large projects like Gbaran-Ubie Phase II going ahead. We're looking to push forward on the deepwater, which has tremendous opportunity. We have a number of exciting deepwater projects, as well as some promising shallow-water projects that we may develop if conditions are right. As I already said, there are tremendous opportunities in Nigeria. We're concentrating on where we believe we can add the most value.</p><h4>How is the Shell Group assuring that its best global practices in corporate governance and social responsibility are always fully applied?</h4><p>The Shell Group doesn't differentiate from one country to the other in terms of the policies that are applied, although the legal requirements may differ and this is one reason why things may not always look the same. For Shell, the policies that are applied in Nigeria are what you would see in the UK or in the Netherlands, or anywhere else. We have a set of business principles that all Shell companies have to abide by, and we drive those very hard. This consistency of approach also helps make our business more efficient.</p><h4>Nigeria is currently striving to adopt an economic growth model that is less reliant on oil- and gas-related activities. How do you see this strategy affecting the Shell Group's future in the country?</h4><p>Shell companies in Nigeria are an important part of this change. What the country needs, probably more than anything else at the moment, is power. That's a huge multiplier because, if you have affordable electricity, you have affordable businesses that can then grow and multiply. Obviously, while power generation is not our core business, we are an important part of the chain that provides the gas that provides the power. So, from my perspective, I'm looking at domestic gas as something we want to be a part of. We've done a lot in the past in this regard. We have supplied domestic gas for a long period of time and we have built a power station near Port Harcourt that produces up to 650 MW a day, which is about 15% of the nation's current power generation. When it comes to domestic gas, we represent up to 20%-36% of the nation's supply. This is a great example of how an IOC like Shell can make a difference in Nigeria.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Main Reasons]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-main-reasons]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Copa Airlines' strategy over the last decade?</h4><p>We have followed the same strategy for over 20 years, which involves building a hub in Panama for intra-American connectivity. Our business model is very straightforward in a simple and effective manner. Over the last five years we have accelerated the airline's capacity growth, transitioning from four to six connecting banks at Tocumen Airport, the “Hub of the Americas," in Panama. We have also added close to 20 destinations in that same five-year period.</p><h4>Copa offers service to 67 destinations in 30 countries. Which routes are the most important for your business activity?</h4><p>By July 2014, we will be flying to 67 destinations in 30 countries, certainly the most complete and convenient connecting hub in Latin America. We have a very well-balanced network; therefore, I could not say that one market is more important than another. South America is, of course, the largest region that we serve through our hub in Panama. We connect most major cities in South America with Central and North America as well as the Caribbean.</p><div class="quote">“We operate an efficient airline with very competitive costs, approaching those of low-cost carriers."</div><h4>How does Copa contribute to the economic development of Panama?</h4><p>We have over 6,800 employees in Panama and around 8,700 worldwide. We really believe that we contribute in a significant way to every country we serve, since today's world is driven by connectivity and, especially, air connectivity. In regards to Panama, we are a major contributor to the country's GDP, second only to the Panama Canal. Our direct and indirect contribution to Panama's GDP is around 4%. Besides that, due to our hub, Panama is the most connected country in Latin America relative to its GDP. This unique connectivity is one of the main reasons why Panama has become a major business hub, tourism destination, and home for many multinational companies that have established their regional offices here.</p><h4>How would you describe Copa's financial performance over 2013, and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We had a very strong year in 2013; we grew our capacity by 14%. Our revenues also grew by 16%. We met or exceeded the market and analysts' expectations. For 2014, we expect to have another strong year, with capacity growth of 10%.</p><h4>How important is the concept of social responsibility for Copa, and what are the most successful achievements in this field?</h4><p>Social responsibility is an integral part of Copa's yearly corporate objectives. It starts with our own employees; therefore, we dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to make Copa Airlines the best place to work. We have a number of programs to help in the training and advancement of our employees, including training for skills such as language and computers, even if not needed in their current jobs. We also offer scholarships for their children. Maybe the most successful program to align our workforce with the strategy and growth of the company is our profit sharing program, which we have consistently paid for over a decade. Our social responsibility programs also work with the communities we serve and look to protect the environment. One example is our 3Rs program: recycle, reduce, and reuse. As well, we are founding members of United Way in Panama. Copa Airlines included, in its CSR strategy, actions to mitigate climate change with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint. Therefore, during 2012 and 2013, Copa accomplished a reduction of over 12,200 tons of CO2. By 2014, the goal is to achieve a further reduction of over 4,800 tons of CO2.</p><h4>What is the potential for low-cost carries for Panama?</h4><p>There are some low-cost services flying into Panama, although it remains a small market in terms of origin and destination traffic. Nevertheless, we operate an efficient airline with very competitive costs, approaching those of low-cost carriers, and feel confident in our ability to compete and succeed.</p><h4>Tocumen Airport is undergoing an expansion at the moment to increase its capacity from 5 million to 30 million passengers per year. What will be the impact of this expansion for Copa?</h4><p>It is very important that the airport is being expanded. Once this expansion phase is completed, we will have an additional 20 gates, which will allow Copa to continue growing. As can be expected, we are looking forward to the new airport terminal.</p><h4>What is the potential for Panama to become a world hub for aviation?</h4><p>Sitting in the middle of the Americas, Panama has one of the most unique geographical positions anywhere in the world. The country has been attracting a number of European airlines that have either started new services or increased their frequencies to Panama. Those airlines benefit from Panama's unique position as the best located and most connected hub in Latin America. As Latin America continues to grow and more airlines look to our region as an interesting market to serve, we expect Panama to continue growing as the premier gateway to our region. This should eventually mean more service from Europe and other parts of the world and, together with Copa's own growth in the Americas, contribute to positioning Panama as a truly world hub for aviation, as it is already for shipping and commerce.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Saudia Private Aviation (SPA) gone from being a part of Saudi Arabian Airlines to today being a separate company on the verge of privatization?</h4><p>Since the 1970s, there has been a strong relationship between global GDP and the number of passengers. Our industry tends to automatically move in line with macroeconomic trends. The aviation industry worldwide contributes approximately 3.4% to average global GDP. And this is around the same ratio that the aviation industry contributes to Saudi Arabia. Obviously, the Middle East's GDP growth is around 7.9%, most of which comes from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries in the Middle East. The industry employs roughly 300,000 people, directly or indirectly. The nice thing about our industry is the fact that it provides good jobs and a good quality of life for employees considering the fact that, with a high school degree, you can be a co-pilot or an aircraft mechanic with a very good starting salary. Basically, in terms of contribution to the economy, we generate about SAR53 billion per year. Private aviation has become a part of these statistics. There were 15,700 private aircraft worldwide in 2010 and that figure is expected to double, reaching 30,000 aircraft by 2020. That is a CAGR worldwide of about 6.9%. In the Middle East, out of that 15,700, there are roughly 400 aircraft, and 60% of those 400 are linked to the Saudi market. In that regard, the Saudi market here is considered to be a big player in private aviation. The private aviation business in Saudi Arabia consists of five key segments: the Royal Family, corporates, government officials, travel agents, and brokers. As far as privatization goes, we are one of the strategic business units of Saudi Arabian Airlines. The whole objective of having an investment business unit as part of the privatization project that took place at Saudi Arabian Airlines was to overhaul the company from an organizational and financial point of view, with the eventual objective of becoming fully efficient with a private company mentality. Eventually, we would like to go and participate in an IPO. SPA is not just a company, but the largest operator of Dassault Falcons in the region. At the same time, we have a good share of the domestic market via our small, six-seat aircraft. This aircraft addresses the dynamic lifestyle of the new businesspeople of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How will the new airports coming online affect your business?</h4><p>As a matter of fact, it will complement our strategy because, basically, infrastructure is considered to be the bread and butter of our business. SPA's new fixed-base operator (FBO) in King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah is a good example of this infrastructure. We have full-sized lounges and complete facilities that include a boutique hotel for flight crew. Infrastructure is a strong foundation for future growth. Likewise, the new King Abdullaziz International Airport, with all of its new facilities, will be very positive for all the operators around the airport. Airports usually come with highway and transportation improvements, and we are going to take advantage of this improved accessibility.</p><div class="quote">“The strategic plan is developed based on four key perspectives: financials, customers, processes, and our staff."</div><h4>What distinguishes you from your competitors?</h4><p>It all starts with the fact that we believe in ourselves and what we can offer to our customers. This is something I can say on behalf of every single member of the SPA family. From an IT perspective, we restructured completely. For example, we redesigned our website in order to improve usability. Users will soon be able to request a quote over the internet and receive our response quickly. We have also rebranded ourselves and our image. We have come up with a totally new loyalty program. We have introduced three tiers: silver, gold, and platinum. The silver tier is 25+ hours and targets customers whose travel behavior means they usually only move within Saudi Arabia, taking short-haul flights. For gold, we target clients whose average tends to be short-to-medium, and the platinum membership offers you all varieties from medium- to long-haul flights. And the story doesn't end there; there are a lot of things in the pipeline. We believe we have to keep renewing ourselves and our products to stay innovative and competitive.</p><h4>How has the governance structure within your organization changed since privatization began?</h4><p>We have seen the results at some of our sister companies, which were fortunate enough to start the process earlier than most. We have also seen how their culture and processes have changed. The transition from a government entity into a private entity takes a lot of courage, because you have to change your mindset and culture. Many aspects need to be adjusted to this new atmosphere. Our sister company's customers have noticed the changes, and the same can be said about us. We have noticed our efficiency rating improving, and we have become more customer-oriented and focused. We tend to develop all of our strategies around meeting customer expectations. The strategic plan is developed based on four key perspectives: financials, customers, processes, and our staff, who are the most precious asset in this organization. We try to develop our annual corporate plans with a clear mix of initiatives through different perspectives, and those initiatives are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs), where everyone from the upper and middle level management understand those KPIs and have clear targets. Internally, we have developed a dashboard through which we can log on and capture our revenue and cost in real time whenever we want. If it hadn't been for the privatization and this change of culture, this would not have been the case.</p><h4>Where do you expect to see the firm by 2020?</h4><p>I think our two successes are our customer satisfaction and the fact that we can meet our shareholders' expectations from a commercial point of view. Success, for us, is being able to grow with the market, being able to compete, and being able to adapt to change. I think we have geared up with a lot of analysis and a lot of groundwork taking place during the last several months to come up with a strategic plan that will ensure our position in 2020. Our strategic plan counts on our ability to diversify our revenue avenues. That includes maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO), ground handling, expanding the chartering business, aircraft management, and eventually providing elite shuttle services between key cities in Saudi Arabia and the region. That is very much in the pipeline at this stage, but it will be a semi-scheduled entity in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), the number of civil works grew by 18.6% and the construction of buildings by 24% in 3Q2013. What underpins this performance?</h4><p>Construction is definitely the key instrument of economic growth and the government's social policy, and Colombia builds 280,000 homes a year. President Santos' government has established a set of economic locomotives, the most productive of which, especially since his second year, has been construction. According to DANE, construction has two branches, namely civil works and infrastructure, and buildings. Put together, these categories account for 7% of GDP. But if you added to that all industrial and services activities related to construction, the number could reach 20%. That is why construction is so important as a political instrument and generator of employment and economic growth. So how do we arrive at the 20% figure? Whenever a bar of steel, a brick, an item of furniture, or a piece of pottery is made in Colombia, it is added to the industrial sector category when calculating GDP. And when a mortgage or insurance policy is provided, or when the wages on a trust are paid, it is added to the financial services subsector. When architects are hired to design a new building and are paid for their services, that value isn't added to the construction sector category, but to the services subsector. But were you to take everything related to construction and real estate from the services, industrial, and commercial sector categories and add them to the construction activities category, you could easily reach 18% or 20% of GDP. That is why this sector is so important, not least as a massive generator of employment.</p><h4>The pace of construction in the Caribbean continues to grow. What are your perspectives on the revalorization of the Colombian Caribbean? What other regions do you think it would be interesting to invest in?</h4><p>Real estate opportunities are the order of the day in Colombia. Booming entrepreneurial activity exists in each region, with important real estate developers, promoters, and construction companies claiming their share. That said, until 2012, half of the country's building activity, in terms of the value of real estate sales, was concentrated in Bogotá. Yet as a result of uncertainty surrounding the urban norms developed by the former Mayor of Bogotá, Gustavo Petro, developers with their core activity in Bogotá started looking for opportunities elsewhere, and found them. There has been a great opportunity in the development of malls, housing, and hotels in other cities of social and economic importance. That is the opportunity many construction companies and real estate developers have bought into to sustain their growth. This opportunity, in the specific case of the Colombian Caribbean, shows how Barranquilla—one of the cities with land available at reasonable prices and with good returns—has grown significantly. Cities like Cartagena also continue to develop immensely. In Barranquilla, new hospitals are being built, including a private clinic that supports retirees, foreigners, and the region at large. Santa Marta is also catching the eye of tourism and second-home investors. It has always been a popular destination for family vacations because of its climate and strategic location, but in past years it has been the star of real estate valorization in Colombia.</p><div class="quote">“Real estate opportunities are the order of the day in Colombia."</div><h4>What have been the group's milestones?</h4><p>Valor was founded in 1984 as Constructora Valor Limitada and later became Grupo Valor, and today we have a series of companies. Our real estate services company Estrategias Comerciales y Mercadeo SA is specialized in commercializing projects in blueprint. It has over 20 sales offices in Bogotá and showrooms that sell some of the best projects in the Caribbean directly from the capital. Another company is our investment bank, which has a private capital fund that lends financial services and draws in resources to leverage the capital markets for real estate development. As ordered by the Superintendence, we created another company to manage the fund and structure its projects, namely Sergio Mutis Caballero Asociados SAS. We have a company that works with public construction and social interest housing, called Tecnoconstrucciones SAS. And there is another project promoter constructing exclusively for the higher education community. Valor is a construction company that, over close to 30 years, has developed more than 100 residential complexes, participating as a partner and project manager. We began in Bogotá working on middle-class projects, mainly in neighborhoods like Cedritos and Chico, but subsequently developed projects in other cities. We began growing in Bogotá in that specific area; nonetheless, we have built hotels and commercial establishments, and have serviced contracts in all areas of construction. Chiefly, however, we have focused on building middle-class homes. Today, Valor's principle activity is focused in Bogotá, and this complements our activities in Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Bucaramanga, Cali, Buga, and in a number of cities in Cundinamarca. Valor's main characteristic is that it is fully attuned to the real estate market; its knowledge is comprehensive, and it is also linked to Estrategias Comerciales y Mercadeo SA, which enables it to perfectly gauge the market and act accordingly.</p><h4>What new projects are you planning for Estrategias Comerciales y Mercadeo and for your investment banking division?</h4><p>For Estrategias Comerciales y Mercadeo, we plan to expand a showroom we have built for rural housing in central Colombia. We have also recently struck an alliance with a chain of hotels to commercialize suites and fiduciary rights, which will have an important impact both nationally and internationally. Additionally, we want to maintain our leadership position in the commercialization of blueprint projects. Today, the value of the property commercialized by Estrategias Comerciales y de Mercadeo in Bogotá surpasses Ps300 trillion in sales. The prime projects of the country's foremost construction companies on the Caribbean coast are participating in this showroom alliance between Estrategias Comerciales y Mercadeo SA and a leading real estate company on the coast. Meanwhile, the investment bank is structuring a series of infrastructure and housing projects, some for third parties and others for our own use. It has a number of important projects in Barranca and in Buga, which are medium-sized cities. These are not the respective capitals of their provinces, but nonetheless present sound opportunities for entrepreneurial activity that generate employment and provide more housing for the Colombian people.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company performed in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Mazda launched commercial operations in Mexico in 2005, when we started selling cars through four distributors, two in Mexico DF, one in Guadalajara, and another in Monterrey. In our first year of operations we sold over 7,000 vehicles, and in 2013 we sold 33,000 vehicles, confirming very sustainable growth. In this context, our market share has grown too, and we closed 2013 on 3.1% of the domestic market.</p><h4>What are the company's expectations with the new production plant in Salamanca?</h4><p>The production plant is a project that dates back to 2010, when a commercial visit by our Japanese directors culminated a year later with the beginning of construction work on an investment budget of $770 million. After two years of construction, the plant started manufacturing cars in January of 2014. The first manufactured vehicles were destined for the US and Canada. However, the plant was officially inaugurated in February 2014, with President Peña Nieto attending the ceremony. In terms of expectations, we hope to close 2014 production on 140,000 vehicles, with the Mazda3 at the beginning of the year and toward the end of the year the Mazda2 model, as well. We expect the plant to produce around 230,000 vehicles per year when fully operational. At that point, it will have 4,600 direct employees—today, we have a staff of 3,800. These plans are envisaged to take place within the next 18 months. Salamanca is a rather small city, and we believe that the plant will bring a significant boost that will eventually change the face of the city, boosting employment among local people and serving as the key economic engine. Finally, there are other projects related to the plant, such as assembling and machining production, which will boost the national component of our cars, generate greater added value for the final product, increase investment, and create further employment.</p><div class="quote">“One of the main advantages is the free trade agreements (FTAs) that the country has signed."</div><h4>What competitive advantages led Mazda to establish a production base in Mexico?</h4><p>One of the main advantages is the free trade agreements (FTAs) that the country has signed with large and attractive markets; Mexico has access to 45 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, and the EU, which means a potential market of around 40 million vehicles. At the same time, Mexico has a very favorable geographical location for access to large markets such as the US. Mexico also enjoys an excellent logistics infrastructure, and labor costs are highly competitive. Meanwhile, the workforce is highly qualified and skilled. Finally, the automotive industry in Mexico is among the most competitive in Latin America. To top it off, Mexico's domestic market is large and growing, and over the past few years has become highly stable. All in all, I believe Mexico has become the main destination for automotive investment in the region.</p><h4>What is the size of Mazda's distribution network?</h4><p>Currently, we have over 2,200 employees in our distribution network, which has 44 centers, meaning that we are among the leading companies in the industry in terms of employment opportunities. Our production plant has staff of 3,800, a figure set to increase. We want to strengthen our position as a large provider of employment. We have also implemented a corporate plan that supports the professional and personal development of our staff, as well as provide the best possible service to our clients. In this context, we have our own academy to train professionals within our distribution network, as the after-sales satisfaction of our clients is a must in our strategy. I can proudly say that creativity and innovation are two defining elements of Mazda's mindset.</p><h4>What makes Mazda stand out from its competitors?</h4><p>Market positioning and penetration rank highly. In addition, and although some competitors also have it, we make use of Japanese technology, widely recognized worldwide. These elements combined form one of our greatest competitive advantages in Mexico. We should also keep in mind that our target market are those individuals who enjoy driving, rather than those that merely need to get from A to B. This is something the market has learned to value, and nowadays more people have come to value the distinction, especially as other brands pursuing this customer profile tend to be luxury European ones with higher price tags.</p><h4>How does Mazda contribute to the development of Mexico?</h4><p>We have very close ties with the local government of Guanajuato and the city's university, with which we have developed several projects. In addition, we send some of our staff to Japan for training. For example, in 2013 we sent 160 technicians and engineers to Hiroshima; they were there for several periods during the year. Such initiatives boost technology and knowledge transfers to Mexico. Moreover, our new production plant incorporates state-of-the-art technology. We also implement projects to protect the environment; for example, we transplanted all the trees from the area where the production plant sits today.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Mazda in Mexico?</h4><p>We ride the growing trend in both the commercialization and manufacturing segments. For example, by the end of 2014, we will have expanded our distribution network to 53 centers. We also expect to end the year with sales figures of around 38,500 units. Thanks to the new production plant, we will be able to reach more cities in Mexico and better meet the demand of the domestic market. All in all, we follow the growth of Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jubail and Yanbu are now responsible for 12% of the Kingdom's GDP, two-thirds of its industrial output, and 10% of the world's petrochemical production. The area is perhaps one of the world's best examples of an industrial zone. To what policies do you attribute this success?</h4><p>The success of Jubail and Yanbu as examples of some of the best industrial zones in the whole world can be attributed to many factors, among which are: unique government commitment and support; the application of state-of-the-art international construction and project management methods;  excellent co-operation and integration with our strategic partners, such as SABIC, ARAMCO, and the Ministry of Finance, which ties us together toward one unified objective; the implementation of the city management concept; and the dedication of our professional staff. All the above factors made our mission possible. The mission is to diversify the economic base of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>The Saudi economy is projected to continue growing at 5% and, in 2013, the non-oil sector grew at 9%. What growth do you expect at Jubail and Yanbu, especially in exports, since nearly 85% of products manufactured in the two cities are exported?</h4><p>As stated, we are now responsible for 12% of the Kingdom's GDP. We shall continue to be influenced by changes in the economy and we shall continue to influence this economy through increasing our share in GDP, and I am glad to inform you that we are moving toward a new stage of industrial development through the Yanbu Economic Plan, whereby the emphasis will be on downstream industries, especially non-oil products. This shall include, but not be limited to, iron, services, and manufacturing products.</p><div class="quote">“Jubail and Yanbu are, no doubt, shrines of industrial development in Saudi Arabia."</div><h4>The average growth rate in annual FDI at Jubail and Yanbu reached 20.2% in 2013. With infrastructure projects such as transnational rail, a major phosphate mine, and a large port maturing in the next five years, what opportunities do you expect to emerge for domestic and foreign companies in Jubail and Yanbu?</h4><p>Jubail and Yanbu are, no doubt, shrines of industrial development in Saudi Arabia. They both offer a complete platform of infrastructure and service, second to none, with very competitive land-use prices and excellent links to international markets. Jubail and Yanbu are very safe working environments, in a very stable country. What else could you ask for? This is, to say the least, what brought multinational companies like ExxonMobil and Dow to this land of opportunities. However, with our forthcoming economic plans, we hope to diversify our economic base in the two cities to include investment opportunities, especially in downstream industries. We shall be introducing new opportunities in the field of marine, shipment, packaging, iron, and spare parts, especially for power and desalination.</p><h4>In late 2013, the government announced $109 billion in alternative energy spending and, recently, Sun Edison signed a deal to undertake a feasibility study for a photovoltaic power plant in Wa'ad al Shamal. As energy demands rise across the nation and the region, how will the Commission fuel the development of alternative energy technologies?</h4><p>The Royal Commission is working with its strategic partners to meet this growing energy demand in several areas. The first area is optimizing energy consumption by using modern techniques such as district cooling systems and smart buildings. The second is utilizing state-of-the-art technology for industrial waste recycling such as plasma reactors, which produce hydrogen and electricity. The third is building photovoltaic power stations, and the fourth is concentrating on secondary industries, thus utilizing the outcome of primary industries as feedstock.</p><h4>Employment is one of the major challenges facing the Saudi youth, and when we spoke to Sheikh Saleh Kamel of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Dallah Al Baraka, he cited it among the Chamber's largest concerns. As the Saudi economy diversifies, how will you ensure that Jubail and Yanbu provide as many jobs as possible?</h4><p>In two months, the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu will be celebrating its 40th anniversary. Over four decades, the two cities have created quality jobs. We have also created a cluster of technical education colleges and institutions. Most of the process operators and lab technicians in the primary industries are our graduates. With every project expansion, and with every business opportunity, new jobs are created. Our concern at this stage is to increase the participation of women in the workforce to ensure better performance output. Moreover, we want achieve an 80% Saudization rate, at least in jobs related to operations and maintenance.</p><h4>By 2020, Saudi Arabia will have completed many of the megaprojects that it has undertaken. Where do you hope to see Jubail and Yanbu by that time?</h4><p>We have committed ourselves as per our strategic vision to be the major contributor to the Kingdom's development. This is a dream, and we like to follow our dreams and make them realities. I hope to see Jubail and Yanbu as a leading international example of how to transform a developing country into one of the top industrial nations, but with a human touch, care, and concern for welfare, not only for Saudis, but for the whole international community.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Automotores y Anexos (AYASA) contributed to the development of the country throughout its more than 50 years of history?</h4><p>AYASA is a company that in its origins had a capital of just $12,000, and we have always been extremely committed to the country and its people, which over the years has enabled us to thrive as a corporation in all senses. Ours is a very successful story; we currently handle sales volumes of around $220 million a year. AYASA has a sales point network with 27 branches, and each of these branches also has repair facilities. Today, we are one of the largest enterprises in the country with over 1,000 staff. We contribute more than $80 million in taxes every year, and overall we are one of the companies that contribute the most to the development of Ecuador by generating employment opportunities, income, and implementing several social responsibility activities.</p><h4>How has the economic transformation of the past decade changed the automotive industry?</h4><p>We are a company that believes in the potential of the country, which is why we implement investment plans every year. Over the last few years, we have focused on implementing better production processes to increase production capacity and become a more efficient and competitive company. For example, we have successfully maintained the leading position of our brands—Nissan and Renault—in the market. Also, we emphasized the need to improve the quality of our services. For example, AYASA currently reinvests 70% of its profits back into the country. These elements position our company as a leading player in the sector. On top of that, Ecuador has enjoyed a very stable political and economic environment, and the automotive industry benefited from this. The industry has also paid special attention to the post-sales service segment over the last few years, a segment in which we have positively grown. The future will follow such trends, and we believe we have plenty of room to continue expanding our activity in this segment in particular and the sector in general.</p><div class="quote">“We are a company that believes in the potential of the country, which is why we implement investment plans every year."</div><h4>How has AYASA adapted its business strategy in accordance with the government's new production goals?</h4><p>We are a very flexible and dynamic company, and we saw the new industrial production approach by the government as an opportunity in itself. For example, we have been closely working with the brands that represent Nissan and Renault in Ecuador to implement an electric car project. The government has already carried out research on the potential implementation of this ambitious project and its profitability, apart from the positive environmental impact of it. We have to keep in mind that Renault and Nissan have been worldwide leaders in the mass production of these vehicles for similar projects in northern Europe, and this is a competitive advantage for us, because we see there is huge potential in Ecuador for such a project. All in all, we align ourselves with the production policies of the government, especially in the segment of electric cars.</p><h4>What is the status of the electric car project?</h4><p>We have already conducted all the relevant studies on the mass utilization of these vehicles for fleets for public companies. In this context, some of these companies, for example, Correos del Ecuador, has already carried out tests with these vehicles. At the moment, the government has already taken the steps to set up the regulatory framework for the implementation of this project, and the importation of these types of vehicles. Additionally, several private companies have already shown their interest and commitment to implement such an ambitious goal. AYASA will very soon hand in the draft of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government and the brands we represent in order to take a step forward in this entire process. This is a very important opportunity to change the mobility culture in Ecuador and boost local production in the automotive industry through different stages—a battery recycle plant first, followed by a production and assembly plant. Future prospects foresee a potential market for electric cars of around 60,000 units per year.</p><h4>Does Ecuador have the level of human capital and technological expertise to implement such a project?</h4><p>In this context, Nissan has already offered to the Ecuadorean government to train local technicians on new technologies within the automotive industry, including electric technologies. I think the challenge could come from how to link such an offering with the development of the city of Yachay, because I believe that would be the ideal framework to make the offer come true. Renault has also made such an offer to the authorities, and we have to highlight that this offering does not only apply to research, but to the final consumer, too.</p><h4>How do you think projects like Yachay will contribute to boost human capital in technical areas in the country?</h4><p>The project is fundamental for the purpose of strengthening human capital in technological areas. However, I truly think that the overall success of such an ambitious project depends very much on the level of involvement of the private sector. There is no successful research if all the sectors are not involved in such activity.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which services and innovations will you bring to the Nigerian market?</h4><p>In terms of our subscriber base, Airtel is the fourth largest telecoms company in the world and has a major presence in India. In March 2014, Transparency International (TI) voted this the fourth most transparent emerging market in the world. In Nigeria, we are the second largest operator with over 26 million subscribers. Naturally, our ambition is to reclaim market leadership in the highly competitive Nigerian telecoms market and, already, we are renowned for our revolutionary approach. In December 2010, we took the market by storm when we launched the innovative 2good value offering, a mobile proposition designed to empower customers toward realizing the full potential of our network. It is also on record that we have the widest 3.75G coverage in Nigeria, and we were the first to complete a 4G LTE trial in the country. We also rolled out the high-definition voice service to deepen customer experiences on our network. It is very clear that the next main frontier in the Nigerian telecoms sector will be the data revolution, and we are taking steady steps to ensure we lead the market when it happens. In short, whenever someone thinks about internet or data, we want to be the first name that comes to mind.</p><h4>What are you doing to ensure transparency and best practices?</h4><p>We have been able to achieve that by ensuring there is no agenda that cannot be discussed. We offer equal opportunities for people to express their ideas as to whether things are working the way they should be. And on my side, I operate an open-door policy that allows me free interaction with staff, customers, consumers, regulators, and other key stakeholders. Everyone is able to engage with different levels of management to make sure that things are going the way they should be. Transparency is indeed key to everything we do.</p><div class="quote">“We have registered the highest growth in terms of data customers, which indicates customers desire to use our network."</div><h4>Are you the market leaders in Nigeria?</h4><p>According to figures published by our regulators, our performance over the last few months show we have registered the highest growth in terms of data customers, which indicates customers desire to use our network for their data connectivity needs. Currently, we are the second largest operator in Nigeria and it is our ambition to reclaim market leadership in the highly competitive telecoms landscape.</p><h4>How has consumer demand changed, and how will it evolve in the future?</h4><p>Years ago, the customer demanded SMS and voice, but now you see that the demand is strongly moving toward data. When you have a country where over half the population is under the age of 25, this doesn't come as a surprise. They use WhatsApp, Viber, and other messaging applications to communicate, which in effect has also changed the way we view customer behavior.</p><h4>How challenging is the competition, and what advantages has Airtel got over its competitors?</h4><p>Nigeria has four main GSM operators and, naturally, the market is characterized by pricing and competitive pressures. That aside, the major pressure on the industry comes from infrastructure, with the main challenge being insufficient power generation from the grid. Therefore, we end up paying heavy amounts for diesel to power generators to keep our network running. We are, however, looking at diversifying into solar energy now to ensure that we optimize our costs. We are also looking to the government to open up the environment for private sector power generation. I must say that the government is on the right track. It is going a little slowly, but I know there are efforts being made to privatize and make sure the power generating companies are up to the task.</p><h4>What improvements to the telecoms environment do you foresee? Should regulations further support the private sector?</h4><p>From the government's perspective, we need to step up the pace of energy-sector reform. On the regulatory side, we are working with the Ministry of Communication and the National Communication Commission (NCC) to reform the legislative landscape. For some reason, we are subjected to charges levied by different bodies—the federal government, state governments, local governments, communities, and others. Telecommunications is basically seen as a source of revenue, which in practice means that, periodically, we are levied arbitrary charges. We are working with Ministry of Communication and the NCC to formulate a more predictable environment. However, we are not shying away from developing local communities; we simply want a predictable and cohesive environment. Sometimes, we do not see any relationship between the rental charges we pay and the value we derive from those communities. At the end of the day, we are a business, hence I would like to see all the stakeholders come together to play a stronger role in addressing this issue. Another area of concern relates to the laying of fiber for our network. For fiber to be laid, one needs access to dig and lay the cable in the ground; a hugely difficult undertaking. If all stakeholders come together, we can work out a solution to these challenges to make it easier for Airtel and other players to achieve their ambitions.</p><h4>Where do you see the next challenges and opportunities?</h4><p>Nigeria is a blessed country with a population approaching 170 million people; quite large in relation to a relatively small area, which is a delight for any company or investor. It is not only the sheer size of the population that is of interest, but also its composition, with over 50% of the population less than 25 years old. These are the people who account for the bulk of consumption, and who drive growth in most sectors of the economy. We are beginning to see many Nigerians who had hitherto moved abroad returning home, and many skilled individuals returning with solid skill sets and know-how, which is changing the landscape of Nigeria. I think the best is yet to come.</p><h4>What advantages does the National Broadband Plan have?</h4><p>The National Broadband Plan was drafted by stakeholders and the government. There is no requirement for the commitment of any telecoms company; it is a voluntary project to create a connected society. This is a strong value-added service, and the government has avoided creating a sense of obligation as companies voluntarily contribute in the interests of the economy. At the end of the day, practically speaking, there is no option but to ensure broadband connectivity.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Cables Industry (OCI) developed over the last few years?</h4><p>OCI is a young company, as are most companies in this country. We are just 30 years old. We started off as a small manufacturing outfit, and we have grown year by year. We learnt that to continue growing in this industry, you have to provide added value. From the beginning, OCI took the innovation approach, meaning we focus on creating greater added value. This is how the company got to where it is today, being one of the largest industrial companies in the Sultanate of Oman.</p><h4>What are the key drivers that are supporting your growth?</h4><p>Continuous innovation and a focus on what we call operational excellence are at the core of OCI. Of course, you also need a fundamental and robust demand for cable products. Today, we export about 60% of our production, so we are not limited to the Omani market. We manage our industrial processes in a way that we apply and deploy the best practices in all fields. We also actively support the industrialization of the country, and there are many spin-offs for the local economy. This is part of our in-country value (ICV) approach. Still, Oman needs more innovation, and Omani companies need to focus more on added value creation so as to grow and remain competitive in the global economy.</p><div class="quote">“There are more than 30 cable companies in the GCC, of which we are among the biggest."</div><h4>How will the recent major infrastructure projects in Oman benefit your business?</h4><p>The infrastructure projects will benefit us greatly in general, and not only us but the whole industry and also the general economy of Oman. As OCI, we purchase a lot of materials. Perhaps around 500 containers a month arrive in the harbor here just for us, and another 600 trucks per month distribute our products. The container terminal move from Muscat to Sohar, where the facilities are much more modern, is an example of the importance of modern infrastructure. New infrastructure projects are implementing state-of-the-art systems to speed up the services.</p><h4>You recently brought online an advanced test laboratory. What is the importance of R&amp;D for Oman Cables?</h4><p>Cable manufacturing is a very competitive industry. There are more than 30 cable companies in the GCC, of which we are among the biggest. Not all of those companies produce high-quality products; however, we do, and that is our advantage. Hence, to maintain our quality advantage, we need to continue innovating, which entails R&amp;D. Our cables are not a consumable product that you use and dispose, so quality is key. Through our new test laboratory, we are assuring our clients that our cables have a very long lifespan of up to 30 years. We use quality materials, machinery, and skilled workers. The fundamentals are simple; the daily routine requires a strong focus on operational excellence.</p><h4>You recently signed a contract to supply cables to Saudi Arabia. Are you very active in the GCC and the wider region?</h4><p>Oman is our domestic market, but we consider the GCC our home market. We have offices in all the GCC countries, and I require my people to understand the Saudi Arabian market as well as the Omani one. We export to all GCC countries, although the Saudi market is the largest. Our exports to these countries are very balanced. Beyond the GCC, we have also decided to focus on further export markets as an area of potential market development. We are also looking at Iraq and maybe even Iran in the near future, depending on the political developments.</p><h4>How important is the growth of trade for Omani companies?</h4><p>It is essential. If Omani companies are only competitive in Oman, that is a problem. They have to be competitive internationally. This again comes back to innovation. In a commodity-driven economy, companies need to innovate and develop added value. When you consider the industries in our country, you are talking mainly about producers of commodity products with a high level of competition. Examples are industries producing steel, aluminum, wheat, tiles, and cement. If you produce, for instance, simple cables, you can think of developing special cables. If you produce the same products as a Saudi Arabian producer, you have no competitive advantage in that market. Therefore, you have to innovate to differentiate yourself and create niches where you have a comparative advantage that will set you apart from the competition. You need a product that is attractive to consumers in other countries. The focus on exports itself is not the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is to be competitive as a company, and that can be proven best by the fact that you are successful in export markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatar Fuel Additives Company (QAFAC) and what have the major milestones been so far?<br></h4><p>QAFAC is a joint venture that was first established in 1991 by the Emir's decree, and operations began in 1999. QAFAC's shareholders include Industries Qatar (IQ), with 50%, OPIC Middle East Corporation (OMEC), with 20%, International Octane LLC (IOLLC), with 15%, and LCY Middle East Corp (LCYMEC), with 15%. The company started by producing methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in the petrochemicals and chemical business. This is part of Qatar's vision to diversify its resources and increase downstream productivity. In 2012, we had our best year ever in terms of financial results; our revenue was $928 million. As far as major milestones are concerned, in 2006 we initiated a revamp of our methanol plant. We started to receive CO2 from our neighbouring company, Qatar Fertilizer Company (QAFCO). This CO2 helped us to enhance our methanol production from 2,500 tons to 2,950 tons per day. We also have the largest natural gas steam reformer in the world, with 960 tubes in our methanol plant. We are now proceeding with the installation of a high-tech facility that will help in the CO2 capturing process. This project will not only increase our capacity, but will help to create a healthier environment.</p><h4>How is QAFAC aiming to cement Qatar's role as a leading exporter of petrochemicals?</h4><p>Qatar currently produces 9.5 million tons per year of petrochemicals. By 2020, Qatar aims to produce around 23 million tons of petrochemicals and other chemicals. This is a huge increase in just a few years. Qatar Petroleum (QP) already has a project with Shell for a major petrochemical complex, as well with Qatar Petrochemical Company (QAPCO). Without question, we want to be part of Qatar's vision in expanding the downstream petrochemical and chemical industries. We are exploring to see if there are any areas for expansion in methanol and MTBE, because there are new refineries being built and they will need MTBE. We really want to be a part of, and contribute to, the Qatar National Vision.</p><h4>What efforts does QAFAC make in regard to sustainability?</h4><p>This is very important for us, and we are establishing a strong foundation for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. We are aligning this with the National Vision for 2030 and the Qatar National Development Strategy 2011-2016. We have a continuous effort to optimize and utilize Qatar's vast hydrocarbon resources, as well as produce and export methanol and MTBE in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. Our ultimate aim is to contribute to the social and economic development of the State of Qatar. Our strategy is really based on four themes: operational excellence, growth, value to stakeholders and shareholders, and the team. We have the QAFAC Carbon Dioxide Recovery (CDR) project, which is an innovative solution that will reduce QAFAC's total greenhouse emissions. Upon the completion of this project, the QAFAC CO2 recovery plant will become the first in the world to capture and utilize 500 tons of CO2 per day. We have no problem investing in projects to have a healthier environment. It is not only for us today, but also for the next generation in Qatar. We are introducing this project to the UN as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The State of Qatar could benefit from this through carbon credits. We also have flare management systems, as well as a leak detection and repair (LDR) program. We place a strong emphasis on social activities. QAFAC sponsors activities in schools and sports events. As we strongly promote sports, we have established a sports committee that runs various activities for the company and, with a great enthusiasm and passion for sports, we have established highly skilled cricket, volleyball, and basketball teams. As we have a rally car that uses 20% methanol, we have recently created our own rally team.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the petrochemical industry in Qatar?</h4><p>The outlook is bright. We are studying different scenarios, aiming to expand inside and outside Qatar. There are real opportunities for expansion outside and inside the country at the moment. Various industries in Qatar are exploring different opportunities to expand outside the country. We have the expertise in petrochemicals; we have the knowledge, skilled people, and the technology, so the opportunities are there.</p><h4>What is your vision and medium-term plan for QAFAC?</h4><p>Our vision is to be among the top-five producers of methanol, its derivatives, and butane derivatives by 2020. Being amongst the top five means we have to double our production or more. This is our long-term vision. For the short term, we have our CO2 project. This will increase our production to around 100,000 tons of methanol per year. We will begin production at this plant by the end of 2014. Also, there are new refineries coming and they will need MTBE. In conjunction with QP, we are looking into the possibility of expansion; however, this is only in the initial phases at the moment. Hopefully, we can go ahead and say that we need to expand in either 2013 or 2014. We have one plant right now, for methanol and MTBE, located at Umm Said, and we are also exploring possibilities with QP to expand in Ras Laffan Industrial City.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the rebranding of Alwaseeta represent a reinvigoration strategy for the company?<br></h4><p>The rebranding was a strategic decision that we adopted to give further momentum to the company in order to establish ourselves more prominently, and reinforce our objectives and strategy. Qatar Holding was too generic a name, and we felt it did not reflect our business or the company vision. Alwaseeta is an Arabic name meaning “intermediate," which is relevant given that our business is with intermediate industries. We want to recreate the company's vision at a higher level, fully in step with the National Vision, and our new strategy received the approval of the Supreme Council for Economics and Investment.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>Hydrocarbons are experiencing huge growth, especially in the downstream segment. Petrochemical derivatives are also a major business line, though everything depends on the economic viability of a project. In moving from primary to secondary industry, we have two or three sectors, such as the chemical clusters, and from those chemical clusters we develop other projects, and we can build on them further downstream meaning that the opportunities are unlimited in terms of moving even further downstream. We are working on expanding these operations, and are striving to fulfill our duties for the Qatar National Vision 2030. Qatar is also producing aluminum with Qatalum, and we plan to develop downstream opportunities in this industry through enhanced technological processes, such as rolling mills and extrusion.</p><h4>What role will investment opportunities abroad play in Alwaseeta's growing profile?</h4><p>One of our mandates as a company is to seek investment through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). We are interested in companies that can bring technology that serves our vision, strategies, or projects. Additionally, we are exploring M&amp;A opportunities with companies that can bring added value to us overseas and also enhance and consolidate our business in the domestic market. For example, if we develop a joint venture here in Qatar with a foreign partner, we will try to align with that company's other businesses. By acquiring shares and investing in their ventures abroad, we can consolidate and develop synergies in both marketing and product development.</p><h4>Does diversification figure in your strategies for the future?</h4><p>In our business plan, we have over 10 projects in the five-year cycle plan at different stages of development. Beyond our five-year cycle, we have over 30 diversified hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon projects. We assess the market and consider the value of a project, but have no preference for either hydrocarbon or non-hydrocarbon based projects, as each serves its own purpose. We wish to become a leading manufacturer and distributor of intermediate petrochemical and non-hydrocarbon products in the region.</p><h4>How does Alwaseeta contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>We have been part of that vision from the outset. QP was already present, and so we built a platform on it. We contribute by boosting the economy and supporting the development of Qatar's human resources—all of this is part of the National Vision 2030. We are dedicated to developing Qatar's human resources by refining their skills and education and empowering individuals to reach their full potential. Regarding sustainability, we aim to create products that are environmentally friendly. We will be looking into the country's waste management strategy as part of this in full cooperation with the Ministry of Environment. We are also bringing energy conservation technology to Qatar. We work in very close cooperation with Kahramaa in its program of conserving energy consumption within the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Qatar Steel and what have been some of your major achievements?<br></h4><p>Over the past decade, Qatar Steel has transformed itself into a growth-oriented business entity. Since 2003, the company has gone ahead with many expansions, increasing capacities at all its production facilities: direct reduction (DR) is up from 0.75 million tons per annum (mtpa) to 2.25 mtpa, the electric arc furnace (EAF) increased from 1.2 mtpa to 2.15 mtpa, and the rolling mill (RM) is up from 0.70 mtpa to 1.5 mtpa, thereby increasing the volume of saleable products from 1.00 mtpa in 2003 to 2.58 mtpa in 2012. The subsidiary unit in Dubai was upgraded with a new bar rolling mill with a capacity of 0.30 mtpa, increasing the capacity of the wire-rod and rebar-in-coil mill from 0.18 mtpa to 0.24 mtpa. Over the years, the company has built its reputation on sound operational and management practices in various facets of its business. We have also acquired a number of accreditations for product quality, and launched a new corporate brand identity in April 2007, whereby QASCO became Qatar Steel with the pledge of making steel matter. Qatar Steel was the first known Qatari organization to have initiated Balanced Scorecard implementation at the start of the millennium. A decade later, it became the first Qatari company to be inducted for Strategy Execution into Palladium's Hall of Fame, an international accreditation for excellence in strategic management practices. At present, Qatar Steel is the exclusive provider of steel to the State of Qatar, a source of national pride, and one of the major contributors to the non-hydrocarbon economy of Qatar. The company directly employs around 2,000 people across operating units in Qatar and the UAE, primarily providing long steel products to the regional market.</p><h4>What effect has the rise in prices of raw materials had on Qatar Steel?</h4><p>Input costs play a vital role in the steel industry globally, and not just for Qatar Steel. The metallic steel price movement makes a significant impact on the movement of finished product prices across the globe, being closely linked. For Qatar Steel, the oxide pellets that go in as a feedstock into our DR plant constitute around 60% of the cost of goods sold, such as rebar and finished products. Therefore, any volatile movement in these prices has a major impact on the bottom line unless the price escalation is well absorbed in finished product prices. The demand for construction steel in the GCC also plays a vital role in the finished product price movement in this region, which is historically higher than the global average. They have been supportive in absorbing increases in metal prices, excepting the recession period in the latter part of 2008 and in 2009, when demand dropped drastically. Finished product prices have been reasonably supportive. Qatar Steel also maintains its cost position as an integrated steel mill through operational excellence to derive competitive advantage in the market.</p><h4>What is Qatar Steel's target market?</h4><p>Qatar Steel sells its finished products predominantly in the GCC. Its primary market for rebar is Qatar, which constitutes around 65% of its total rebar sales in the GCC, while wire rod is predominantly sold in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The company maintains a market share of 13% to 15% in its core rebar business in the GCC, with a 98% share of the domestic market. The strategy has always been flexible with exports reflecting supply and demand dynamics. In essence, we maintain a presence in all export markets within the GCC with higher volumes of sales in major markets like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but with a lower market share and lower sales volumes in smaller import-driven markets, such as Bahrain.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the steel industry?</h4><p>Through constant innovation, Qatar Steel develops new technologies and processes, which result in increases in productivity, cost savings, and also significant reductions in carbon emissions and other pollutants. Qatar Steel's focus on innovation extends to its by-products, including slag generated from EAF molten steel processing, oxide fines produced by the DR iron plant, and mill scale generated from caster and RMs. Instead of discarding these by-products, Qatar Steel reuses them to maximize their value and sells them on to customers for further use. Qatar Steel has created an R&amp;D department to provide an impetus to research activities and to be pro-active in meeting market requirements as a leading integrated steel manufacturer in the GCC.</p><h4>What investment efforts is Qatar Steel making in “frontier" markets?</h4><p>Apart from fast-paced expansion in the operating unit in Qatar, we have also invested in a re-rolling unit in the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai since 2003 that is producing rebar, wire rods, and rebar-in-coils. We have gone ahead with prudent investments within the GCC and in the MENA region totaling in excess of $550 million. This includes a new joint venture in Algeria, to be 51% owned by Algerian companies and 49% by Qatar Steel International—50% Qatar Steel and 50% Qatar Mining—for Phase I with a 2 mtpa long-steel capacity.</p><h4>How do you go about developing the company's human capital?</h4><p>Qatar Steel recognizes its employees as the company's greatest asset, and as such it views employee engagement and Qatarization as a critical component of success. Under the “Organization Development Program," a number of initiatives are aimed at enhancing employee morale and introducing a corporate culture to create a spirit and sense of belonging.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the industrial sector in Qatar?</h4><p>The steel market in Qatar has been favorable over the past decade, especially during 2003-2008 when we saw an unprecedented construction boom. The outlook is positive with real GDP growth expected to come from the non-hydrocarbon sector in the coming decade. Qatar is making rapid progress with its formidable pipeline of infrastructure investments worth over $130 billion that will run through to 2020. These investments cover transport, logistics, and rail (Doha metro, long-distance rail, freight, and the Lusail people mover), as well as roads, new stadiums, hotels, and ancillary facilities. The impetus is on FIFA-related infrastructure development, and the steel industry will largely benefit through this period. Steel demand is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% to 6% during 2013-2022, with supportive government spending and Qatar Steel prepared to meet this growing local steel demand.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans and goals of Qatar Steel?</h4><p>It needs to consolidate its competitive position in the regional markets within the GCC. With no additional advantageous feedstock in Qatar in the medium term, the company will find new sources of growth and look for strategic investments by way of acquisitions and joint ventures in iron ore and steel-related products within the MENA region. We will continue to create value for our stakeholders through profitable growth from operating units in Qatar and Dubai and through our strategic alliances and investments.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the establishment of Qatar Industrial Manufacturing Company (QIMC) here in Qatar?</h4><p>In the late part of the 20th Century, Qatar's leadership recognized the need for national transformation from being a trading economy to an industrial one. There was a national need particularly for small- and medium-scale industries; however, businesses and individuals were still hesitant to invest in industry, which is why the State of Qatar launched a strategy to change the perception of the private sector and businessmen, as well as to encourage them to invest in the industrial sector. The visionary government led the way by investing in fully serviced industrial zones and establishing the Qatar Development Bank. They invited SMEs to invest in industry and established the Qatar Industrial Manufacturing Company. Thanks to the country's able leadership and the hard work of all our employees, we have been very successful, having stood the test of time. We now have investments in more than 16 small- to-medium-scale industrial projects, and so far, they are all performing very well. At the same time, we are pursuing our expansion and diversification strategy in earnest.</p><h4>QIMC has achieved a steady year-on-year rise in net profit. What do you attribute this to?</h4><p>This is the return on our diverse industrial projects that are already operational. These were undertaken with a view to sustaining growth and profitability. At the same time, we are fairly consistent in providing returns to our shareholders, in terms of dividend distribution, so that they enjoy both short- and long-term benefits. The steady market price that QIMC's shares command in the Qatari Financial Market is testament to the faith our shareholders have in us. We also have many new projects in the pipeline, and are always exploring new opportunities, as well as conducting feasibility studies for new technologies and projects. We work closely with our partners and the management team of all our subsidiaries and associates in shaping their strategies, which differentiates us from other companies that merely play the role of investors.</p><h4>QIMC and KLJ Organic of India signed an agreement in November 2012 to establish a paraffin wax manufacturing plant in Mesaieed. Can you elaborate on this new venture?</h4><p>KLJ has plants that produce chlorinated paraffin in India and Thailand. We reviewed all of its products, marketing, and technology worldwide, and found them to be the best technology partner for us. However, negotiations, legal formalities, and due diligence have taken longer than expected. We are participating in this joint venture with a partnership stake of up to 60%. Now that the project is moving on a fast track, we believe the plant will be commissioned at the start of 2015.</p><div class="quote">“We have many projects in the pipeline both in Qatar and the region. "</div><h4>What is your overview of Qatar's industrial sector?</h4><p>Qatar is a small market, which is both a disadvantage and a challenge. There are limited opportunities in the industrial sector, and even within that there is competition from all over. For example, formaldehyde, chlorinated paraffin, and sulfuric acid are supplied to the country from around the region, and even though we have our own group of companies producing these products, we still have to compete with international entities. Qatar is currently reliant upon its oil and gas wealth, although this will not last forever. Therefore, we need to diversify and pursue sustainable industrial development. And to do this, we need to understand what our resources are and formulate a strategy around our competitive advantage, which we can successfully execute. Of course, we must be conscious of the need for social change and active participation of the Qatari community in various areas, which is essential for the success of such a strategy. We are working hard, but I still think more needs to be done, particularly with regard to industrial zone infrastructure and the industrial sector as a whole, so as to encourage the private sector to focus more on value-added manufacturing using locally available resources. We currently export oil and gas; however, we have to look at value addition and sustainability, which are crucially important, and a priority for the State of Qatar. There are many positive developments, as in the case of the construction of the Ras Laffan industrial zone and new infrastructure such as the New Doha International Airport (NDIA) and the new port to support the country's resources. We have to utilize this opportunity. Qatar is focusing its efforts on making the necessary improvements, but I still think there is much more to do.</p><h4>What are your plans and targets for the medium term?</h4><p>We have many projects in the pipeline both in Qatar and the region. In April 2013, I visited Saudi Arabia, where we have two projects planned. We also perceive opportunities within Qatar in the years ahead, and hopefully this will rub off on our entire portfolio. Keeping this in mind, we have already embarked on expansion and capacity building in many of our group companies so that we will be ready for the much-awaited boom. At the same time, we must accept that the country faces huge challenges across all sectors to implement the projects planned for the coming years, such as railways, stadiums, and other infrastructure projects, while successfully managing the economy and not allowing inflation to rise to the point where it harms industry and the public. We need to look at how this will affect the country, the economy, manpower, and inflation, and how the government will manage the resources available to ensure success. This is a major challenge, and not an easy task. The projects need sound due diligence, which requires transparency and the availability of relevant reports in the public domain. This will boost the confidence of investors and the public at large. I fervently hope we don't see a repeat of what happened in 2006, with rents in the industrial zone skyrocketing and even small workshop spaces costing QAR3,000 per month. Also, a steep rise in residential rental prices would result in higher delivery cost. It is also important to ensure that there is a structured implementation strategy and a completion timetable for all projects, while keeping all macro economic parameters under control. I have full faith and confidence in the ability of the country's leadership in spearheading and guiding this challenging, yet exciting phase of development. They have already indicated that local companies, especially SMEs, will enjoy preference in the execution of these projects. And so we will ensure that the subsidiaries and associates of QIMC are ready to seize the opportunities and deliver to their fullest potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean to visit Abu Dhabi for business?</h4><p>In reality, there is an underlying message in where and how people meet each other. To meet in Abu Dhabi at this moment of tremendous change sends a very powerful message about the positioning of this region in relation to the rest of the world. The UAE is a success story by all measures, and this is its capital. It is also important that the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) meets in the Middle East, at a time when people are often nervous about the local situation. This is precisely why we feel it is an important meeting.</p><h4>How important is Abu Dhabi as a tourism destination?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become even more important still. We have learned from experience that the key element in the success of any destination is the political will to make it successful. It is not about what a destination has, but what its leaders do with the destination's existing resources. There is a clearly demonstrated will on the part of the government to make tourism work.</p><div class="quote">“Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become even more important still."</div><h4>How important is stability for tourism in the region?</h4><p>Stability is always important everywhere in the world. It is impossible to sustain a tourism industry without maintaining a minimum level of stability. However, for the Middle East, it is a long-term issue. The Earth has shaken as a result of events in the region. Nonetheless, we prefer to look at the mid- to long-term situation, and in that context these events have the potential to bring about positive changes.</p><h4>What effect do you think the rise of more conservative governments is having on tourism in the region?</h4><p>To reply with what I was told by the Prime Minister of Tunisia, who belongs to a party which is considered conservative, “there will never be a government in Tunisia that halts tourism, because it would have a catastrophic effect on employment for so many people." He was honest, and I believe that the benefits of tourism transcend ideology. Each country has to focus on its own strengths.</p><h4>How important would a single GCC visa be to tourism here?</h4><p>Very important, because it would encourage people to travel to more than one destination in the region. For visitors to be able to hop between different countries would be tremendous.</p><h4>What impact do you anticipate from the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar?</h4><p>The event will be great for the region as an opportunity for millions of people to experience live in the Gulf. It will be an opportunity for the region to show what it has, and hopefully dispel some of the prejudices and ideas about the Gulf that people in the world may hold. Any country that is able to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people for an event is a country with amazing capabilities.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your overall strategy to develop the health sector in the Emirate?</h4><p>We have established our strategy based on several important parameters such as geographical access, population growth, and the diversity of health services required. For the health sector, geographical distance and access play a major role. I believe that only a dynamic and flexible strategy can be successful. It should respond to challenges that arise as well as make use of any opportunity that comes up. This is the basic principle that we employ to meet demand, whether it concerns legislation, establishing a market, or collecting data that will eventually improve customer service. All of the departments within the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) follow this approach. We also use it in dealing with insurance companies and providers of healthcare services. Therefore, our goal doesn't change, but rather we adapt to change.</p><h4>How are you planning to attract investors?</h4><p>We are looking forward to genuine investors who require a safe environment for their investments. Therefore, we have set very clear health regulations that are in line with international standards and protect patient safety. The health regulation department also carries out inspections regularly to ensure high-quality health standards are being met. Meanwhile, we provide potential investors with the statistics they need for informed decision-making. We have a committee that includes members of both the public and private sector responsible for such research. In effect, anyone interested in investing in Dubai can count on receiving the best available data on the subject at hand, as well as diverse assistance in obtaining a license. We even coordinate construction projects with the local authorities.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that the role of the public sector is crucial here."</div><h4>What are the most important challenges that you face in realizing your vision and how do you plan to overcome them?</h4><p>There are quite a few challenges, one of them being human resources (HR), which we need to build up. It takes around one or two years to design an excellent hospital, and then a further three or four years to construct it. Yet, ensuring the right HR balance requires up to eight years. There is a growing demand for services, and the range available in the Middle East today is tremendous. Another contemporary challenge is the use of smart solutions, which requires a re-wiring of organizational culture toward the adoption of more comprehensive solutions that result in precise treatment, a lower number of human errors, and comprehensive data for R&amp;D purposes. But of course, in every challenge lies an opportunity.</p><h4>How do you plan to attract more Emiratis to work in the healthcare sector and retain them?</h4><p>First of all, this is not a matter of salaries as such, but of the working environment itself. If an individual joins us, they feel relevant to what we do, and we continuously try and provide a platform for further training. Within a one-year period a doctor develops more capabilities and skills, receives more training, and has access to R&amp;D facilities. We are creating what we call future health leaders. An institution like ours needs to pay well, but also needs to create a partnership with its HR.</p><h4>Dubai is trying to diversify its economic matrix. How do you foresee the sector playing a role in driving this process?</h4><p>There is an initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, namely medical tourism. This full service encompasses the airlines, airport, transport infrastructure, and shopping. We are upgrading our hospitals to the point where they can be considered hospitality facilities. Our guests come from both the East and West. Dubai offers excellence of health services especially in certain areas, such as cardiology, and we aim to capitalize this through the medical tourism initiative. For instance, the Nabadat initiative provides free surgery for children, Emiratis, and expatriates with congenital heart disease. It was launched in 2007 by the DHA and the HH Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Charity and Humanitarian Establishment. We invite our colleagues from the UK, Sweden, Italy, and other countries to work along with our specialists. This confirms the truly globalized nature of our business, and that we can help people no matter where they come from.</p><h4>What is the importance of sharing medical know-how and best practices with the international community?</h4><p>We are trying to set up a center of excellence to embody the idea that medicine cannot advance when localized, and must foster worldwide knowledge exchange. That is why Dubai hosts quite a few international medical conferences and exhibitions. For example, Arab Health has hosted a record-breaking 500 speakers and welcomed about 150,000 visitors at its last outing. Under one umbrella, there were 19 seminars being attended.</p><h4>What role do you see private-public partnerships (PPPs) playing in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>I believe that the role of the public sector is crucial here. We are in a dialogue with the private sector, even with manufacturers such as Siemens and Philips, to establish joint projects. We have two focal points at DHA, namely the patients and the service provided and we are keen to partner with the best in the world. Our criteria is quality, innovation, and a patient-centered approach when we look for international collaborations.</p><h4>In light of the new law regarding compulsory health insurance in Dubai, what impact do you foresee on the healthcare sector?</h4><p>I believe it will result in a considerable enhancement of services. Compulsory health insurance is an essential component of any efficient healthcare sector. It will facilitate healthy competition amongst healthcare providers, ensure universal access to basic healthcare, and thus help create a dynamic health sector. Presently, many cannot afford proper healthcare, and the new regulations guarantee universal access to essential services regardless of their financial circumstances. This legal change will therefore create health security through the provision of insurance.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy led to the founding of Muntajat, and what are the strategic goals of the company?<br></h4><p>The State of Qatar recognized the growing global demand for chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers, and the role its products can play in the marketplace. Through the creation of Muntajat, the State of Qatar has positioned its products to be more competitive in global markets through new more efficient processes. This will complement the fact that Qatar will invest around $25 billion up until 2020 in its chemicals and petrochemicals fields with an objective to support and further grow the industry as indicated by the Minister of Industry and Energy.</p><h4>What was the reason for breaking from the status quo as each company took care of its own marketing?</h4><p>Muntajat enables greater economies of scale for marketing and distributing Qatar's chemicals and petrochemicals than the individual producing entities could realize alone. This is good for Qatar, producing entities and customers who will benefit from investment in services. And in light of the growing global demand for chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers, it was needed. Muntajat will maximize value for our stakeholders by providing world-class products and services before and after sales.</p><h4>How have you been working with the current producing entities to ensure the best transitional plan?</h4><p>Since the consolidation effort began in early 2013, Muntajat has implemented a plan that makes the transition process as smooth and seamless as possible for customers. In addition to reaching out to individual customers to inform them about the transitions, Muntajat has welcomed into its team many of the employees of the marketing and sales departments of the producing entities. These employees, who have developed strong relationships with customers, will continue to serve the clients, bringing about a smoother transition than one of a traditional newly established company.</p><div class="quote">“  Qatar's petrochemical industry made a giant leap in 2012 by starting up two world-scale plants at Mesaieed. "</div><h4>What strategic markets is Muntajat considering for further expansion?</h4><p>The market for chemical and petrochemical products is global by nature, and nowhere is the growth faster than in Asia. To meet global demand and regional specificities, Muntajat is in the process of establishing a network of offices in key markets with a focus on Asia, including four offices in China and India alone, in addition to offices in Europe, the US, Latin America, South Africa, and around the Middle East and North Africa.</p><h4>How will Muntajat cement Qatar's role as a leading exporter of downstream products in the gas sector?</h4><p>With a current export portfolio of 10 million tons per annum of chemicals and petrochemicals and an investment plan of $25 billion up until 2020, Qatar has positioned itself as one of the world's rising chemical and petrochemical hubs. The establishment of Muntajat grants Qatar a more competitive position through new efficiencies and scale.</p><h4>How does Muntajat intend on aligning itself with the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>The diversification of Qatar's hydrocarbon value chain is one of the great strengths of the market as it contributes to building a knowledge-based economy in line with the National Vision 2030. As a Qatari company, we are proud to be contributing to these objectives and look to expand our support in the years ahead through community projects and employee development.</p><h4>What impact has the shale gas boom had on the dynamics of the market?</h4><p>The emergence of shale gas has unquestionably changed the market for certain products in the near term. The capital investment required for the downstream sector, however, has yet to fully materialize in these shale gas markets. In addition, we see increases in demand across the product range, especially in fertilizers as developing markets require these products to increase and secure their food supply. Qatar's petrochemical industry made a giant leap in 2012 by starting up two world-scale plants at Mesaieed: LDPE 3 and Qafco 6. Qatar also has two projects currently underway that are expected to be completed by 2018: the QP-QAPCO Petrochemical Complex and the QP-Shell Al-Karaana Petrochemical Project.</p><h4>What are your visions and goals for Muntajat in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>In the near term, the vision of Muntajat's management is to position the company closer to its global customers through a network of offices in key markets around the globe, as well as strategically located logistics hubs and warehouses to support marketing and distribution activities. Across its global network, the company will employ a multi-national workforce of more than 400 people; 250 based in its headquarters in Doha and 150 in its global marketing network. In addition to proximity to key customers, Muntajat is setting up an advanced supply chain program that will maximize efficiency, assure faster and improved customer service both before and after sales, reduce lead and delivery times, and decentralize distribution. Taken together, these developments will significantly improve efficiency in getting Qatar's chemical and petrochemical products to customers around the world now and in years to come.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As we approach the half-way point of the National Development Strategy 2011-2016, what would be your overview of the progress made so far?<br></h4><p>The goals and objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030 have ownership across all sectors of society, reflecting the broad participation in its preparation. The Qatar National Development Strategy 2011-2016 (NDS) is a six-year plan of action to steer the country toward these goals. First, we tried to make sure that everybody knew what development changes we were trying to bring about and how. We needed to build human and institutional capacities. Second, every agency has its own strategic plan aligned to the Qatar National Vision 2030 and NDS, so that everybody is moving in the same direction. Qatar National Vision 2030 and NDS are setting Qatar on a development path aligned to the requirements of sound social development. We aim to achieve the targets we set in the NDS by the end of 2016. Currently, we are monitoring the NDS implementation progress as part of a mid-term review. There has already been progress towards many of the targets and, following our review of the implementation progress, we will strengthen institutional and human resource capacities to help us achieve our targets. Some of the targets may not be attainable, so we will adjust them accordingly. Perhaps the most important progress achieved is the culture change and new mindsets. The move towards strategies and plans has begun. An outcome-based strategic planning model has widely been taught, explained, and used; for example, in preparing the NDS 2011-2016, itself. This marks a difference between the pre-NDS era and post-NDS period. Taking into account that most ministries and agencies often did not make strategies and plans before the NDS 2011-2016, the mere introduction and acceptance of the planning culture seems very significant. Also, performance and budgeting are now gradually being linked as part of a long process of replacing the whole chapter-based financial management systems that have prevailed to date. A good progress on the relevant capacity building has been made in this respect. Thirdly, the governance for the NDS has been set up and a steering committee representing all, or most, ministries and agencies is now supervising the implementation. The ultimate value is to have ownership and partnership cultures embedded in the public agencies' corporate behavior.</p><h4>How do the NDS 2011-2016 and the Qatar National Vision 2030 take into account the risks involved with having a hydrocarbon-dependent economy and a currency pegged to the US dollar?</h4><p>The risks of a hydrocarbon-dependent economy are clearly addressed by the economic development pillar of the Qatar National Vision 2030. It underlines the need to diversify Qatar's economy beyond the oil and gas sector by expanding industries and services with competitive advantages, promoting active private sector participation, and enhancing the knowledge-based component of the economy. The NDS 2011-2016 translates these principles into a comprehensive and inclusive road map that identifies targets, initiatives, and programs that will eventually lead to an economy that relies on sustainable forms of wealth creation. The link to the US dollar has served Qatar well, providing a robust monetary anchor for the economy. As a small economy with capital markets still in the process of development, the dollar peg continues to make a lot of sense.</p><h4>How adequately is each of the four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 being addressed, and what are some of the challenges that are faced?</h4><p>The NDS sets out national development priorities. We have programs and projects related to the goals of each of the four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030, as well as for modernizing public sector institutions. We prioritize objectives within each development pillar; for example, there is a huge focus within human development in national capacity building, to build and align skills to the needs of a knowledge-based economy. Our human resources are the key to our development progress. In the economic sector, there is a focus on the steps and reforms required to diversify the economy and encourage the private sector to be more efficient, innovative, and productive. Critically, we have to take into account inter-sectorial linkages and join-up initiatives; for example, by linking educational outputs to the needs of the labor market, or by linking health and environment. Getting a consensus on what the national development priorities are and aligning public sector institutions to work together to help meet these priorities can be challenging. Our limited human resources continue to be a challenge. We are in the midst of implementing Qatar's first NDS and we lack sufficient experience in project management, for example. There has been good progress across the public sector through several capacity-building initiatives; however, we are not yet where we want to be.</p><div class="quote">“As a small economy with capital markets still in the process of development, the dollar peg continues to make a lot of sense. "</div><h4>How important is increasing the amount of research done in Qatar to meeting the goal of developing a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>Qatar has made good progress in human development, such that it has raised the country's ranking in the UNDP's Global Human Development Index (HDI) to 36th, as reported in 2013, compared with 51st in 2000. The HDI combines three dimensions of human capacities: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Qatar's drive for sustainability and its diversification aims, along with the Qatar Foundation's sizeable investments in knowledge, research, and innovation, are beginning to pay dividends. A growing proportion—around 16%—of graduates are studying in Education City Universities, where the focus is on specializations required for a knowledge economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[more-roles]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Qatar Development Bank (QDB) support economic growth in the local economy?<br></h4><p>The bank provides various ways of supporting development in Qatar. One of the main tools that we use is subsidized lending. QDB provides direct lending to sectors and areas that are value adding, with an emphasis on manufacturing, tourism, education, livestock, and value-added services. The main aim behind providing subsidized financing is to encourage the private sector to invest more in these sectors. We do not deny other sectors, as long as they are value-added service sectors. The second tool we use to support the private sector is the partial guarantee scheme. Through this program, we provide guarantees of up to 85% to banks and financial institutions in Qatar. We guarantee up to 85% of the amount of the loans for entrepreneurs and SMEs in the country. This can go up to QAR15 million, and is the guarantee scheme with the highest coverage in all of the Middle East. The third tool that we use to support our private sector is export development and financing. Financial support takes the form of insurance against political and commercial risk in case of insolvency on the part of the other party. We also do bill discounting and factoring for our exporters. This non-financial support includes taking them to exhibitions and conferences outside of Qatar to showcase their products and perform matchmaking activities so that they can find new markets. We also provide advisory services and support to entrepreneurs and SMEs. We do this through direct advice on business plans and feasibility studies through online support—we have a joint tool with the IFC and IBM called the SME Toolkit, through which SMEs can download an Android or IBM app to build a feasibility study from scratch. We also have a publication, called Private Sector Publication, and it is a platform of communication that we use to ensure that the messages are getting through to the private sector. The fifth tool that we use for supporting the private sector is a business promotion tool, with which we look into big projects in Qatar, identify the opportunities, and build profiles. For example, we did a comprehensive study with Qatar Rail to understand this; Qatar Rail is the biggest non-oil and gas investment. We wanted to cooperate with Qatar Rail; we analyzed all the related opportunities that are realistically captured by the private sector. We came up with 104 opportunities. We converted these 104 opportunities into project feasibility studies, and we demonstrated them to the private sector at a conference earlier in 2013. We also did something similar with Qatar Shell to identify opportunities, and we held a conference. We are in talks with Qatar 2022 and the SME 2022 initiative to ensure that the private sector gets access to the data.</p><h4>How do you encourage the SME sector to take on a sustainable approach?</h4><p>SMEs are equipped to take on this role. Sustainability can take many forms, starting with infrastructure and construction. It is a huge area, and the private sector is usually smarter about bringing in new ideas about sustainability and implementing them. There is consultancy for sustainability, and there the private sector can play a bigger role. In Qatar, sustainability is in everything we do. QDB offers more subsidized financing for companies that have more financially savvy or sustainable approaches in their delivery.</p><h4>What is your strategy to encourage entrepreneurship?</h4><p>A paradigm shift is occurring within the culture, and we are tackling this at the base. We are planting the seeds of entrepreneurship in Qatar. Traditionally, people bring their camels and sheep to market, having fed and raised them, and then sell them. That is a form of entrepreneurialism that can transfer. At the same time, the nature of our luck as Qataris in having massive wealth around us does have an impact—entrepreneurs may not be as eager as they have begun from a high level of wealth. Our job is to ensure that the picture is clear to them, and we plant the seeds to ensure that they can create their own destinies.</p><div class="quote">“Supporting SMEs is also at the heart of our development. "</div><h4>Where do the efforts of Enterprise Qatar and QDB fit with the nation's 2030 goals?</h4><p>Entrepreneurship has been at the heart of everything Qatar does, ever since the beginning. Our investments in gas when others were doubting its usefulness show how entrepreneurial our government was in taking risk and investing in something that we believed would be the future of clean energy. And, hopefully, it will all pay off. The entrepreneurial spirit is a part of our culture. Supporting SMEs is also at the heart of our development, our economy, and our ecosystem in general. We know in Qatar, as everyone else does, that we are heavily dependent on oil and gas. The way we are building our diversification plan is by increasing the contribution of non-oil and gas productivity in our GDP. QDB, Enterprise Qatar, and the whole entrepreneurship and private sector SME ecosystem is getting the pieces together to solve the puzzle and create a vibrant public sector that will contribute to the economy and GDP. Taking all that into consideration, there is a concrete plan to ensure that entrepreneurs and SMEs receive all the support from the government for a successful journey. Foreign investors are looking to get into Qatar. Local entrepreneurs are looking to play a bigger role. The government is looking to get all the pieces together to ensure that, from a project management perspective, everything falls into place and there are no mishaps. This is the place to be within the Middle East. It's very vibrant, dynamic, and focused. I don't believe that there is such a massive number of projects happening anywhere else in the world at this time; there are so many opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Mohammed Hamad Al Mana Group?<br></h4><p>We started back in 1952 with gas plants. At first, we produced small oxygen cylinders for hospitals, and now we have 17 plants all over the Middle East. We began operations in Doha before expanding to the UAE, Egypt, Sudan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Libya. Gas remains are our core business, but we are also very active in real estate. We are one of the largest—if not the largest—private real estate owners in Doha. We have $3.2 billion worth of property in Doha alone, and we are expanding to commercial and residential properties in London. We have units in Dubai in addition to a large amount of real estate in Lebanon. We have also diversified into fast food and certain enterprises, such as the Subway franchise. We own and operate around 50 outlets throughout Doha. In addition to contracting, we provide full solutions for builders. Our company supplies cement, steel, air conditioning, and flooring for construction projects; everything is offered in-house. The company utterly refrains from outsourcing, which allows us to be extremely competitive.</p><h4>What led the company to diversify into multiple segments?</h4><p>We have always been very successful in the gas business. However, during the recession in 2008, we ceased the expansion of our industrial sector plants. Meanwhile, we discovered that people were demanding a massive amount of low-cost food. By 2010, we had opened 28 Subway locations. We constantly reinvest in our business, and to date, the gas industry has remained our cash cow that enables us to save funds to invest elsewhere.</p><h4>How does the company's activity align with Qatar's National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Expanding our business away from gas has paid off massively, and we are still expanding in other business lines, much as Qatar itself is. When it comes to real estate, 2013 saw the launch of the largest project yet. We have also expanded our factory on an investment of around $12 million. The country is giving us the opportunity to grow, coupled with the vision and milestones to mark our combined success. The Al Mana family has long been a contributor to the local economy, and our decisions shape the success of the country. Our main activity is in the energy and the real estate sectors, but we are always open to new ideas and diversification. In Doha, we also have the Qatar Foundation, which is involved in education, healthcare, and research, and it is expanding its activity in multiple sectors. This opens up the opportunity to grow even more and sparks new ideas, as well as more areas to expand upon. This is how our family is growing and much of our success is based on what the country helps us do. We are also working in terms of education, which is another sector that interests us in the long term. However, we are currently exploring a range of options.</p><h4>How do you ensure quality and consistency given such corporate diversity?</h4><p>Each company naturally has its own management team. We simply oversee each one on a weekly basis and monitor financial activity on a quarterly schedule to ensure that they remain on the right track. We also have our overseas businesses and stocks. The company works to maintain and monitor our businesses, and I am the main supervisor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the establishment of economic zones drive Qatar's economic growth and help in the diversification effort?<br></h4><p>Many countries have employed the concept of economic zones, especially those that seek to further enhance economic activity and development. Economic zones have both a policy and an infrastructure rationale. In terms of policy, an economic zone can be a useful tool as part of an overall economic growth strategy to enhance industrial competitiveness and attract both local and international investments. Thus, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030, Manateq, an autonomous government company and part of the Qatar Authority for SMEs, was established to play a vital part in the country's overall economic growth strategy. By piloting new policies and approaches, Manateq aims to develop and diversify the production of goods, the delivery of services, and the creation of jobs. It also enables efficient government supervision, the provision of off-site infrastructure, and environmental controls. Additionally, Manateq has been mandated to develop and manage several economic zone projects in order to aid and stimulate substantial private sector investment, both local and foreign, into mid-sized activities such as manufacturing. And, through Manateq, Qatar is likewise able to focus on non-oil related industries, with emphasis on economic development through a competitive, knowledge-based, and diversified economy.</p><h4>How are the three current zones positioned to encourage a long-term trend of diversification?</h4><p>Manateq is driven by its vision of creating a future with sustainable growth for everyone. By using resources wisely, supporting diversification, caring for the environment, providing access to growing markets, and making it easier to do business, Manateq creates the right conditions for clients for smooth, long-term operations, as well as further opportunities for excellent returns. It is for these reasons that each of the three economic zones—Ras Bufontas, Abu Nakhla, and Um Alhoul—have been clearly clustered to provide infrastructure and services that cater to specific industries and business sectors. As clustering provides further distinct advantages, Ras Bufontas, for instance, has been defined to cater to advanced technology and logistics businesses, Abu Nakhla for specialized industries and logistics, and Um Alhoul for light manufacturing. A significant factor in the clustering of each zone also involves its size and location. Thus, with Ras Bufontas being approximately a 4.01 square kilometer area that adjoins the New Doha International Airport, this cluster targets business sectors such as logistics, information and communications, healthcare, energy and the environment, high-tech building, and global warehousing. Meanwhile, Abu Nakhla, which is approximately a 11.95 square kilometers in size, just south of the current Doha Industrial Area, targets businesses involved in building materials, machinery and fabrications, specialized spill-over industries, safety and maintenance, and specialized warehousing and logistics. On the other hand, Um Alhoul, which is 33.5 square kilometers in area and adjoins the New Port Project, just south of Wakrah, targets businesses involved in petrochemicals, building materials, maritime operations, metals, logistics, food processing, and many others. Given such focus, it is intended that each of these three economic zones will be able to provide long-term benefits for customers.</p><h4>Where does the economic zones project fit into Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>One of four key pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030 is economic development. On this pillar, the ultimate objective is to develop a competitive and diversified economy that addresses the needs of its people and creates for them a high standard of living. Thus, Manateq and its economic zones clearly have a vital role to play in the realization of Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of the Qatari economy over recent decades?<br></h4><p>When I started a World Bank project in Santo Domingo, I had an indication from my partners at the time that they were considering the possibility of entering the shipping business in Doha. But when I came here, it was still an immature sector operating from a very small port. The country, however, clearly did have potential even though pronounced demand was being met by a poor supply of infrastructure and services, with a patent need for professionals. I led operations as General Manager and the company grew quite rapidly. Yet believing in the need to diversify, we divided it up by activity. Our focus was growth and there was no economic segment that we specifically wanted to enter or avoid. We did not enter high capital ventures because we were a small, new company—albeit with a large parent company—but focused instead on maximum diversification with numerous companies. There were certain industries that I was more capable of understanding than others. In such cases, we opted for joint venture projects to complement our skill sets.</p><h4>How do you select your partners?</h4><p>Nothing happens overnight and much research is required before partnering with a company. Aside from our preference for diversification of activity, we are highly geared toward reputation. I don't mind a new niche player without a long track record, as being a new entity is in the very fabric of niche businesses. We tolerate a degree of risk in certain ventures, provided it is not capital intensive. Therefore, first come reputation and track record, and secondly a niche offering. What role then, do we play? Fundamentally, we need to have the right chemistry for cooperation. I might add that all of the relationships we have developed to date have been very fruitful, wherein our contribution and perspective are valued. There are companies that are associated with big names in Qatar, but that approach us to for help with support services, for example. We are looking at such possibilities since these services are vital.</p><h4>What is the role of foreign companies in developing the Qatari economy?</h4><p>This is a new country that still has much need of instrumental knowledge. The population of seasoned players is limited, which needs addressing. Foreign companies have the capacity to bring in the right technology, information, and experience. No country is isolated; it has to be integrated to maximize its potential in a practical manner that generates wealth.</p><h4>How do you play a role in the diversification of Qatar?</h4><p>The key element that Qatar can bank on is gas and the value added related to it. Qatar is working toward realizing its vision for 2030, and has the potential to become a developed country. In order to do so, fundamentals must become both strong and stable, which requires significant cash flow. Yet without a solid educational base this is impossible. Obsolete infrastructure is being replaced, and underpins the growth of any nation. Qatar needs migration of technology, knowledge, professionalism, and many other elements. And in terms of diversification, it could become a superb center for sports tourism, for example. In fact, we are currently pushing for the development of a sports academy to invest in related training. It's not just about oil and gas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When one hears the name Qatar, the ï¬rst thing that comes into many people's minds is oil and gas. What efforts is the Qatar Financial Center (QFC) Authority making to promote Qatar globally as a ï¬nancial center?<br></h4><p>The QFC Authority, as the strategic and commercial arm of the QFC, is dedicated to playing a major role in the expansion of Qatar's financial services sector. Besides ensuring that this world-class environment continues to evolve to maintain best practices and facilitate the growth of the financial sector, we also help to promote Qatar as an international financial center in a number of other ways. Developing international links is an important element in our growth strategy. In the last year or so, we have entered into memoranda of understandings (MoUs) with our counterparts in China, India, Japan, Turkey, and the UK. We have strengthened our cooperation with Luxembourg for Finance, the agency for the development of the financial sector in Luxembourg, and Europlace, the promotional body for the French financial services industry. Thought leadership, by way of increasing the availability of data and analysis on the MENA region, is another important element in our strategy. With a population of over 380 million, the MENA region accounts for a combined GDP of over $2 trillion. As a key international energy exporter, the region is an increasingly attractive proposition for financial services providers. In 2012, the economies of the region's oil producing nations grew by an impressive 5.5% on average. The QFC Authority continues to commission significant research to further its business strategy by supporting thought leadership initiatives, including events and publications, which encourage dialogue, the sharing of knowledge and best practice, and the identification and exploration of growth opportunities. During 2013, these initiatives have included the Seventh MultaQa Conference, organized with Global Reinsurance magazine. MultaQa has become the leading international insurance industry event of its kind in the Middle East. The QFC Authority also supported the second Bloomberg Doha Financial Summit, which was attended by more than 300 asset management professionals from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the US. Our research shelf includes the D&amp;B Business Optimism Index, the MENA Insurance &amp; Reinsurance Barometers, the FTSE Global Markets Asset Management Survey, and the GCC Mutual Fund Survey. In April 2013, we published the first annual MENA Asset Management Barometer, providing industry practitioners with detailed insight into the regional asset management. In May 2013, we revealed a groundbreaking report on private wealth and the scope for family offices in the Middle East.</p><h4>FDI in the region is expected to rise over the next few years. What is the potential for attracting investments into Qatar from new markets such as Africa and Latin America?</h4><p>It is certainly true that FDI in the GCC region is expected to increase over the coming years, attracted by strong growth in hydrocarbon-based economies, favorable demographics, and massive state infrastructure spending plans against a backdrop of developing capital markets. Heavy public infrastructure investment will create a wide range of funding and investment opportunities for the private sector, such as project finance, bond and sukuk issues, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These all point to excellent opportunities to find growth when other parts of the world, notably the mature and debt-laden economies of the West, are still offering only modest returns. There is growing interest from overseas investors in Qatar in sectors such as health, education, and technology, as well as infrastructure and, of course, hydrocarbons. We fully expect that investors from the fast-emerging economies, such as Africa and Latin America, in addition to those from Asia, will show increasing interest in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[knowing-me-knowing-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you think is the ideal pace and form of growth here, and what role do you think financial and business education has to play in that process?<br></h4><p>Qatar is known for its traditional revenue streams—that is, oil and gas. Since I left school, diversification has been at the forefront of Qatar's national strategy. Qatar's decision to present itself as a financial hub was brave, as New York, London, Dubai, and Singapore are all already established centers for this niche. So the question is, what are you going to offer, and how are you going to compete with all these financial markets across the world? You cannot rely on good intentions alone; the undertaking demands considerable effort and learning. As the educational arm of the financial sector, we are the ones who are upgrading the skills, knowledge, practice, and values of those who work and will be working in the financial industry. We bring high-end certification and courses that cover a wide spectrum of finance-related topics. Each country, industry, and company is unique, and so we customize our programs to suit specific requirements. This is the general role of the Qatar Finance and Business Academy (QFBA).</p><h4>Qatar remained relatively insulated from the 2008 global financial crisis. However, that period created a whole new awareness of crisis aversion in the international community. How do your programs incorporate that awareness into the curricula?</h4><p>All the credit goes to the strong laws, regulations, and the robust monetary system of this country. We believe our programs are both interesting and relevant, and we teach perspectives on the global crisis as part of our curriculum.</p><h4>What is your vision for this institution and what have you achieved over the past year?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the national leader and partner of choice for the financial industry. It is our vision to provide high-end programs for industry and to cater to both starters and veterans of the sector. Then, everybody can find solutions to their needs through our organization. This is at the training level. The second part of the vision is to be able to develop a competency framework for the entire industry. We began this project in January 2013, and within one year we produced the very first such framework for the finance sector. Everybody working in the industry will know what he or she has to do to function correctly and work efficiently in it. The scope is comprehensive, and we are working in conjunction with all the regulators at the Qatar Central Bank (QCB). We are also working with the QFMA and the QFCRA on this project. The third component involves facilitating what is known as a certification test. For many certifications, people travel to Dubai or Bahrain to take the test. Instead, we brought the test to our professionals here, eliminating the need for travel.</p><h4>How does the growth of the financial sector and the educational process push Qatar toward the process of diversification that is central to the vision?</h4><p>If we achieve the status of financial hub, and succeed in focusing on certain niches that are not focused on by other centers, such as asset management and insurance, among others, we will succeed in attracting international companies and banks to operate in Qatar. This would have a powerful impact on the economy, particularly with regard to infrastructure and investment. New people will come to Qatar. In this new era in Qatar, it is clear to see that the leadership has a vision and is working tenaciously to achieve it. The clearest evidence for this is the 2022 FIFA World Cup bid. Today, Qatar is world famous, which means that the goal of becoming a global hub is being achieved as we speak.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the founding of Qatar Petroleum International (QPI)?<br></h4><p>QPI was founded with the aim of securing a prosperous future for Qatar through the creation of strategic and commercially attractive international investments across the energy value chain. QPI leverages existing inter-governmental and IOC relationships to become a partner and supplier of choice across the industry, and, ultimately, to develop into a worldwide investor through the acquisition, development, and operation of an integrated portfolio of assets in the areas of upstream, gas and power, and downstream petrochemicals.</p><h4>What are the goals of the Nebras Power joint venture, and what was the vision behind it?</h4><p>The main objective of establishing Nebras Power was to introduce a global Qatari player to the power, electricity, and water industries, and to harness the synergy and extensive experience of the three Qatari shareholding companies. This venture will not only bring together Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), Qatar Holding (QH), and ourselves under one roof with an aligned strategy, but it will also strengthen cooperation between Qatari companies, and, in turn, strengthen Qatar's global investment outlook. It will take full advantage of the economies of scale and scope that a multi-billion dollar mega-investment company is able to leverage. QEWC will own 60% of the joint venture, and QPI and QH will each own 20%. The shareholders have initially invested $1 billion as startup seed capital to stage the future funding of larger-scale investments. The main investment principles in forming this company include diversifying assets, maturing technology, minimizing risk exposure, optimizing returns, growing Qatar's human capital on the global stage, and positioning Qatar's strategic interests for the long term. The venture's shareholders seek to achieve its set goals within the next three-to-five years. I think that with this, Qatar is becoming a large player in the power sector. It fits well within QPI's value chain and it utilizes all of Qatar's strengths. Instead of the country's influential companies competing with each other, we complement each other.</p><h4>What have QPI's main downstream investments worldwide been, and what plans do you have for future investments?</h4><p>To date, QPI has secured several investments for its downstream activities. In 2008, QPI signed an agreement with Shell and Petro China (an arm of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation) to develop a world-class integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. In 2009, a joint venture company was formed between QPI and Shell Singapore, providing QPI access to the integrated olefin and polymer value chain in Southeast Asia. In 2011, QPI signed an agreement with Siam Cement Group of Thailand and Petro-Vietnam to develop a petrochemical project in Vietnam. Presently, QPI, together with Egypt General Petroleum Corporation and Citadel Group, is developing a secondary refinery in Cairo. This project is in EPC phase and is expected to start operations in 2016. When complete, it will treat fuel oil to produce high-quality diesel and gasoline, and will reduce the import of expensive motor fuels by up to half, as well as cut down environmental emissions. Going forward, we will continue to develop other opportunities in line with our strategy of diversifying within the industrial sector. We are working to be part of the value chain and to create a  meaningful energy portfolio based on three pillars: upstream and downstream activities, gas, and power. We would like to secure good resources in the upstream segment, which will constitute around 60% of our activities in the future. The downstream segment gives us the opportunity to diversify by going into the full stream of the value chain. Compared to other markets, the size and capacity of Qatar is a small niche for QP; it has to go on the international scene and diversify.</p><h4>What potential does QPI see in African countries?</h4><p>Apart from the established hydrocarbon provinces in the north and west, Africa has remained largely under-explored. Several new prolific hydrocarbon provinces have emerged in the last decade in the Central and East African rift basins (Sudan, Chad, Kenya, and Tanzania), as well as the intra-cratonic basins, such as Taudoni, Murdi, and others. These emerging hydrocarbon provinces have attracted small independent exploration companies and other major IOCs and NOCs. Exploration results have revealed encouraging results that point toward significant potentialities. From a business perspective, these technical and geological successes are encouraging; however, they are countered by several commercial and political factors, such as a lack of infrastructure, weak domestic economic growth, insurgents and civil wars, and some inter-state tensions. Nevertheless, QPI is capitalizing on the positives, while seriously considering and mitigating negative risk factors. We approach these challenges as potential opportunities.</p><h4>What upstream investments are in the pipeline for QPI, both in Africa and elsewhere?</h4><p>As an emerging international arm of QP, QPI has an ambitious plan and strategy to enter international energy markets, including upstream, downstream, and gas and power. Upstream investments require more and more stringent analysis and due diligence. The short-term plan focuses on risk-adverse ventures by leveraging government-to-government relations, and by capitalizing on relationships with major international IOCs that are built on trust and the long-term relationship with Qatar. In the near future, we see QPI becoming a major integrated energy player that can venture into exploration growth opportunities. In regards to this, QPI has entered in two projects. First, in April 2008, QPI acquired a 20% share in two blocks of the Mauritania Exploration Venture and became part of the venture as a non-operator with Total E&amp;P-Mauritania. The agreement marked the first upstream investment by QPI overseas. The drilling commenced in 2009 on a land area of 58,000 square kilometers and exploration activities are still in progress. Secondly, in May 2013, QPI signed an agreement for our intention to participate in a capital raising exercise for Total E&amp;P Congo, which if completed, would result in taking on 15% of that company's equity. Additionally, QPI remains active in studying and analyzing various opportunities in a relatively unexplored continent, with the objective of maximizing our share across various energy value chains. Under the leadership of His Highness the Emir, Qatar is emerging as a key player in the world business and political arena. Leveraging and building on this role, QPI is seriously considering several opportunities for energy projects in Africa. Also in line with this strategy, QPI is actively considering opportunities with no geographical boundaries. The main objective is to build a financially, technically, and geographically diversified portfolio of upstream, downstream, and gas and power projects. While being risk-aware, we seize any value adding opportunity that meets our technical and economic criteria. Upstream projects in the pipeline include the acquisition of a sizeable 40% interest in partnership with Centrica in the Suncor assets of the Western Canadian Basin, and evaluating additional direct energy assets in the Western Canadian Basin with the objective of acquiring a sizeable 40% interest under the same partnership to create synergies. QPI is actively seeking investment opportunities on a worldwide basis in the energy sector where it can have an active, rather than passive, financial participation. Based on the amount and variety of business opportunities and projects that Africa can offer, and the strategic relationship that Qatar enjoys with countries in Africa, that region remains an area of focus and priority for QPI.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[maximize-value]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy led to the founding of Tasweeq and what are the strategic goals of the company?<br></h4><p>The overall strategy was to capture maximum market value from the rapidly increasing exports of petroleum products from Qatar. The strategic goal of the company is to assure the reliable and efficient off-take of regulated products in a timely manner to avoid LNG train shutdowns and operational upsets, while maximizing value in a cost-effective and equitable manner for stakeholders.</p><h4>How have you been working with the current producing entities to ensure the best marketing plan?</h4><p>Tasweeq maintains constant open communication channels with all the producing entities (PEs) through routine meetings, teleconferences, and other forms of correspondence. That is all done to ensure that accurate production forecasts from the PEs are seamlessly integrated into Tasweeq's marketing plan. In addition, this close communication aids in mitigating the impacts of untimely and unplanned plant disruptions.</p><h4>What strategic markets is Tasweeq eyeing for further expansion?</h4><p>The bulk of Tasweeq's sales goes to markets east of Suez, predominantly in Asia. We believe the increasing demand from Asia will continue due to rising industrial growth and improved standards of living, which will create opportunities for Tasweeq to tap into new and existing areas of demand.</p><h4>How will Tasweeq cement Qatar's role as a leading exporter of LNG and its byproducts?</h4><p>Tasweeq will help Qatar by continuing to be a reliable, efficient, and responsible supplier, while expanding its market share by diversifying geographically and mixed portfolio of customer types.</p><h4>How does Tasweeq intend on aligning itself with Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>Tasweeq's activities are firmly focused on and aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030, which is demonstrated by our furthering international cooperation with developed and emerging nations. Additionally, Qatar's development of new, clean technologies, such as gas to liquids (GTL), establishes us as one of the leading global knowledge capital specialists.</p><h4>What impact has the shale gas boom had on the dynamics of the market?</h4><p>We are delivering mainly to Asian markets, which have shown strong growth and are capable of absorbing additional supply brought into the market. Regarding shale specifically, views vary from calling it a bubble waiting to burst to a game changer. In spite of this significant uncertainty, Qatar is well positioned to be a reliable energy supplier in the long term.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Qatar's hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>The future is bright as global demand is increasing as supply increases. We believe energy is an integral part of furthering human development, and we look to continue our drive for the latest in environmentally friendly energy and technologies.</p><h4>What are your visions and goals for Tasweeq over the next decade?</h4><p>Over the next decade, we will continue to maximize value for Qatar and our stakeholders, reliably, efficiently, and responsibly, while relying on our robust communication channels with operations, local producers, and international customers. This will enable us to serve new areas of demand east of Suez and beyond and remain well positioned to handle any market challenges as they arise. For the benefit of future generations to come, monetizing the wealth of Qatar is a responsibility that Tasweeq will continue to honor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[this-is-an-intervention]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends are you noticing in regard to the career paths that young people are choosing in Qatar?<br></h4><p>Qataris, like young people everywhere, respond to incentives. Most young Qataris have the option of working in the public sector, earning a comparatively high salary, and living a comfortable life. Therefore, many of the decisions they make regarding education, professional careers, or retirement, are driven by very lucrative incentives. In Qatar, the incentives are even stronger than in other Gulf countries such as the UAE or Saudi Arabia. Qatar wants to diversify and provide alternative employment sources, because it wants to strengthen its private sector and build an economy that is robust and sustainable for the long term. To do this, it needs to further encourage young Qataris to pursue careers outside of the civil service. In this regard, Qatar faces the same challenge that other Gulf counties do, although the challenges here are more acute.</p><h4>What are Silatech's main initiatives?</h4><p>Silatech currently has over 100 projects in 12 Arab countries in play, in fields including microenterprise, financial literacy, career guidance and employability skills, SME development, civic engagement, and research and policy advocacy, among others. One of our most recent and promising new engagements focuses on youth savings and financial literacy programs. Youth savings programs encourage and incentivize young people to join the financial system by saving and opening a bank account. In our region, where less than 10% of young people have access to the banking system, a savings account is the first entry point into the financial system. Along with our regional partners, Silatech has championed youth savings initiatives in Yemen, Morocco, and Egypt. In 2013, we focused on targeting 50,000 young people to open accounts through local institutions. Through a plan encapsulating marketing, awareness, literacy, business development, and tying savings to loans, we could, within two to three years, help to turn this novel program into a mainstream idea. In the area of career guidance and employability, we are working with Microsoft and other partners to develop a regional network of country-focused internet portals that will provide young people with a suite of online resources, from psychometric assessments and career advice to employability skills-focused videos and possibly even job-matching services. In the SME arena, we work to promote access to finance by investing in socially conscious private equity funds that grow quality, sustainable jobs. We are also working to nourish the idea of angel investing in the region through SILA, an innovative new angel investment network we launched with partners late in 2012. While we do bring some seed capital to these discussions and ventures, the greater contribution is the knowledge, experience, and partnership network that we bring to the table.</p><h4>Does Silatech approach potential partners or do they come to you?</h4><p>In the beginning, it was largely we who contacted and approached partners in different ways. Increasingly, however, we have grown and received exposure, so our network is much wider and many more potential partners find us. This is good, but it is still a challenge to choose projects and interventions carefully because we only employ about 55 to 60 full-time workers, and our mandate is the whole Arab world. The challenge is large and inspires us to always look toward maximizing our impact. We want to carry out projects that are scalable. We will often launch a pilot program prior to a full-scale intervention. And while we naturally want every project to succeed, we are not put off when one fails.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company develop after its listing on the Qatar Exchange and what is its scope of operations?<br></h4><p>In 2007, Aamal became a public shareholding company listed on the Qatar Exchange, with a paid-in capital of QAR3.45 billion, making it one of the largest public shareholding companies in Qatar. The company has since increased its paid-in capital to QAR6 billion. Aamal is widely diversified with operations across 21 business units, some of which have been operating in Qatar for more than 40 years, achieving strong, market-leading positions. We are a successful group, staffed with over 2,300 employees, and are considered to be a role model for many other companies in the region. Our 21 business units are grouped into four divisions. The first is industrial manufacturing, which includes branches and subsidiaries involved in the manufacturing of the diverse products needed for the development of infrastructure, from ready-mix and cement blocks to concrete pipes and electrical cables. This division includes our companies Aamal Readymix, Aamal Cement Industries, Advanced Pipes &amp; Casts Company, Innovative Lighting, Senyar Industries Qatar Holding, Doha Cables, Elsewedy Cables Qatar, Doha Transformers, Ci-San Trading, and Gulf Rocks. The second division is trading and distribution, and concerns pharmaceuticals, healthcare products, medical equipment, tires, lubricants, air conditioners, and home appliances. This division includes Aamal Trading &amp; Distribution, Aamal Medical, Ebn Sina Medical, Good Life Chemist, and Foot Care Centre. The third division is property. Branches in this division are involved in retail, residential, and commercial property management and development. The division includes City Centre Doha, and Aamal Real Estate. The final division is managed services, which offers the highest quality services to the corporate sector. This division includes Aamal Travel and Tourism, Aamal Services, ECCO Gulf, Johnson Controls Qatar, and Vivantes Medical Centre.</p><h4>How important is it to maintain a diversified portfolio?</h4><p>Aamal's success is the result of a strategy designed to identify key growth opportunities, capitalize on them through the deployment of capital, and partner with industry leaders, who provide the required level of expertise when necessary. We aim to be the first mover in the market, and offering innovative products and services is a key element of our strategy. Aamal's diversified approach is a source of strength; we provide both a degree of stability and a platform from which to take full advantage of these opportunities. Aamal's corporate strategy is to create long-term shareholder value through the continued profitable operation and expansion of its diversified business platform. The company seeks to take advantage of the growth opportunities created by the Qatar National Vision 2030, and to leverage its position as a leading participant across various key economic sectors to achieve sustained, profitable growth.</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment climate in Qatar?</h4><p>Over the past few years, the economic development of Qatar has been remarkable. The country has become one of the world's fastest-growing and most successful economies as markets continue to diversify and the infrastructure continues to develop. The vision of HH the Emir, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, to develop Qatar into one of the region's leading economic powers, remains at the heart of our business. Aamal is as determined as ever to play a major role in the realization of this, and of the Qatar National Vision 2030, and to be a major beneficiary of the nation's success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nasser Bin Khaled (NBK) Holding has been one of Qatar's most accomplished and entrepreneurial companies over the past 60 years. What strategies and vision have contributed to this success?<br></h4><p>From the very outset, NBK Holding has been as much about supporting Qatari society as it has been about business and entrepreneurship. I believe that this, more than anything else, has been responsible for our long-term success. We have also capitalized efficiently on our business advantages. We had the first-mover advantage in many of the industries we entered because NBK's corporate leadership has made it a priority to spot opportunities early and foray into new markets. Then there's the fact that the NBK brand has always been recognized for outstanding customer service across all subsidiaries. Even today, we understand that our future successes will only be possible with the support of the people and the loyalty of our Qatari and expatriate clientele. That's why we continue to make it a corporate priority to support the people, in particular the youth of the nation.</p><h4>How will your construction, real estate, and tourism businesses take advantage of the opportunities offered by the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is a huge triumph for Qatar on the world stage, and I believe it to be an equally big opportunity for Qatari businesses. I see it as the collective responsibility of the business community to represent Qatar well when the world's eyes are on us. It is self-evident that as we approach the date there will be a sharp increase in demand for a wide range of real estate and tourism services, and NBK is poised to take advantage. We are already working on strategic long-term initiatives to prepare NBK Contracting Companies, NBK Real Estate, and NBK Travel &amp; Tourism for the inevitable spike in demand in the years to come. From my perspective, however, the opportunity goes far beyond 2022. The advances and improvements that we make with the World Cup in mind will serve as an excellent launch pad for growth in future years as Qatar continues to become a global force to be reckoned with.</p><h4>Going forward toward 2030, how will NBK grow with Qatar towards the National Vision?</h4><p>Under the wise leadership of HH the Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar has been set upon a course of growth and progress. Qatar National Vision 2030 unites us all with a common purpose and hope for the future of our nation. At NBK, every important decision we take for the future is held up to the National Vision 2030 before being implemented. By the very act of enterprise we contribute to the economic pillar of the vision. Having always been a people and society-centric organization, our philosophy is naturally aligned with the social and human development pillars. Last but not least, NBK has always been very conscientious about leaving a happy, healthy planet for future generations, which is also the environmental development pillar of QNV 2030. The values of NBK Holding have always been rooted in Qatari society and culture. Even as we continue to expand our operations and grow as an organization, this key facet of our identity will always remain true.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In December 2012, a new law was implemented that led to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) taking on a supervisory and regulatory role for insurance companies. Do you feel that such a change will lead to increased insurance penetration in Qatar, where the levels are currently some of the lowest in the world?<br></h4><p>As the overall economy continues to expand, Qatar's insurance sector is likely to register strong growth over the coming years. You would appreciate that besides being a high-income country, there are a number of reasons for the low insurance penetration rates in Qatar, including the State's comprehensive social security system that provides for pensions and other support services through the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority. Another factor contributing to the low penetration in the non-life sector is that compulsory insurance in most segments is not mandated by law. This is all set to change soon, however, with the recent announcement of the broadening of the compulsory insurance pool of the health sector. Moreover, the QCB would frame a comprehensive set of insurance regulations that are in line with international best practices. Efforts are underway to develop an effective and harmonized authorization and supervision framework for insurance firms. In this regard, we lay greater emphasis on governance, prudential standards, group supervision, and macro prudential surveillance. All these factors contribute toward the healthy growth of the insurance sector in Qatar.</p><h4>The same law also calls for provisions relating to the conduct of financial business in Qatar with regard to consumer protection and client confidentiality. How do you intend to implement these reforms?</h4><p>We aim to develop a coordinated approach among the three regulatory authorities to ensure that financial services firms are transparent with their customers. Such firms should understand the needs of their customers and put in place adequate systems that avoid disputes. In this regard, the dispute resolution mechanism has to be timely and conclusive. Furthermore, consumers have to be safeguarded from unauthorized and unlicensed illegal financial service providers through stricter law enforcement. In view of this, the regulatory perimeter for financial services operating in Qatar needs to be drawn, outlining those services that can only be provided by financial institutions licensed in Qatar. Moreover, we need to frame regulations for financial institutions relating to consumer protection. To maintain client confidentiality, it is necessary to strengthen existing rules protecting customer information and specify the circumstances when confidential information held by financial institutions could be disclosed.</p><h4>The recently formed Financial Stability and Risk and Control Committee (FSRCC) is mandated to ensure financial stability. What strategies led to the formation of this committee, and how it is expected to work in practice?</h4><p>The new QCB law lays greater emphasis on the macro prudential framework in Qatar, and it is from this perspective that the law has established the FSRCC. The FSRCC will minimize the regulatory overlap and plug the gaps through coordinated action from the three regulators. The FSRCC is chaired by the Governor of the QCB and includes the Deputy Governor and the CEOs of the QFMA and the QFC Regulatory Authority. The FSRCC is responsible for: identifying and assessing risks to the financial sector and markets and recommending solutions to manage and mitigate such risks; coordinating the work of the financial regulatory authorities in the state; and proposing policies related to the regulation, control, and supervision of financial services, businesses, and markets. For its regular functioning, the FSRCC would draw resources from the three regulatory agencies. The decisions of the FSRCC will be implemented by each regulator within their own regulatory ambit and jurisdiction.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar's decision to keep its exchange rate pegged to the US dollar is based on key considerations that encompass the current economic realities of the country. "</div><h4>What role does the development of Qatar's financial infrastructure play in achieving the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>The National Development Strategy introduced by the government constitutes the main pillar of our development approach in realizing the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030. The core of this strategy involves the development of a diversified and more resilient economy, in which the financial sector will play a predominant role. As a part of this initiative, we have already made significant progress in developing the financial markets and related infrastructure. Illustratively, major initiatives have already been taken to develop a deep and liquid debt market through regular issuance of treasury bills and government-dated securities. This would lead to the development of a risk-free yield curve that would facilitate the pricing of new financial market instruments. Moreover, the three regulatory agencies are working together to harmonize and strengthen regulatory oversight of Qatar's payment and settlement systems infrastructure, in line with international standards and practices. In this regard, the objective is to gradually integrate QFC firms, which are hitherto outside the domestic payments and settlement system, into the national mainstream. Furthermore, in view of the new QCB law, we are also strengthening our legal and regulatory framework in order to safeguard consumer protection.</p><h4>Moving forward, what is your outlook for Qatar's financial sector in the medium term?</h4><p>Qatar's financial sector outlook remains buoyant given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country and continued government support of the financial sector. The country enjoys a strong credit rating and has a very favorable tax regime. The confidence of the international community in the economy is reflected by the fact that recent issuances of sovereign bonds were over-subscribed by a wide margin. These factors have resulted in the country enjoying a high level of international investor confidence. We are focusing on the financial sector playing a bigger role in developing a more diversified economy over the medium term. Being a predominantly bank-based financial system, this has entailed strengthening the banking sector through various measures. Accordingly, policies are being attuned to international best practices, while meeting the requirements of the financial sector. Moreover, we have adopted a coordinated strategy whereby the three regulatory agencies, for example, the QCB, the QFMA, and the QFCRA, would harmonize regulatory and supervisory standards in Qatar across different jurisdictions. As the apex body and the supreme competent authority for the entire financial sector, the challenge for the QCB is how best to achieve this transition in a non-disruptive manner, while taking cognizance of the views of all stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the ministry's major achievements in recent years?<br></h4><p>Qatar's Ministry of Energy and Industry's work is focused on two main areas: utilizing Qatar's energy resources and diversifying sources of income by widening the country's industrial base. These elements lie at the heart of the State of Qatar's industrial strategy. To meet this, the Ministry of Energy and Industry is implementing robust plans to develop and capitalize on our hydrocarbon wealth and to raise the export value of our growing industrial sector. Qatar's industrial sector celebrated a major milestone in 2011 with the inauguration of Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant, at Ras Laffan Industrial City. A joint venture of Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Shell, Pearl GTL represents the world's first realization of GTL technology applied on a global basis and has the capacity to produce 140,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of GTL products. Besides Pearl GTL, we are building the strategic multi-faceted Barzan gas project. Expected to be fully operational by 2014, this project will help meet the country's future needs for clean burning natural gas in the power and water sectors, and provide feedstock to the country's petrochemical and refining industries. Another important development is the construction of the second Laffan condensate refinery, which will double the facility's total installed condensate refining capacity to about 300,000 bbl/d when it comes online in 2016. This will make it one of the largest single site facilities for condensate refining in the world. The new refinery will meet the long-term needs of the local and export markets, and pave the way to further optimize our condensate processing, create new opportunities, and enhance our refining and export capacities. Qatar's economic and industrial diversification is further boosted by the inauguration of another addition to the petrochemical industry with the completion of the QAFCO-5 project, which is the world's largest single-site producer of ammonia and urea. Continued progress in achieving diversity in the industrial sector also saw the opening of one of the largest-ever aluminum smelters to be built in one phase. Qatalum celebrated another ambitious energy project in Qatar, with a state-of-the-art facility that includes a carbon plant and a casthouse, producing value-added aluminum products, such as extrusion ingots, foundry alloys, and standard ingots that meet the most stringent quality standards of the global market.</p><h4>One of the main pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 is environmental development. What steps is the Ministry taking in order to achieve this?</h4><p>The State of Qatar, through its industrial strategy, aims to contribute to the protection of the global environment pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, and to international economic stability by securing sizeable, long-term supplies of cleaner energy from liquefied natural gas. Qatar has recently joined the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Program. We have carried out a major flaring reduction initiative at our Al-Shaheen oil field, registered under the UN's Clean Development Mechanism. This project will generate some 2.5 million credits of Certified Emission Reductions per year. Furthermore, the Al-Karkara Oil Field—the latest oil field to be developed in Qatar—is the first in the country to be zero gas flaring. It is worth mentioning that QP is active in the State Climate Change Policy Formulation and Coordination Committee. This committee was established in 2007 by HH the Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. QP's representation on this committee helps it to provide direct input into domestic policy discussions, and the ability to influence the formulation of negotiating positions in international forums. We have adopted a number of initiatives to achieve the environmental goals of Qatar National Vision 2030, including the establishment of a Corporate HSE &amp; Sustainable Development Directorate reporting directly to QP's Managing Director. This was an important move to stress the significance of the protection of the environment and the safety of QP's human and material assets. In addition, we have implemented HSE Management Systems (ISO-14001 &amp; 18001) in all QP Business units. Qatar Petroleum has established a R&amp;D program at Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park focused on many facets of its businesses, with environmental protection and sustainable development taking the lion's share of the proposed program. The Ministry of Energy and Industry has demonstrated a strong commitment to protecting the environment, be it in the environmental prerequisites of obtaining industrial licenses, or in the monitoring of industrial projects and their adherence to the requirements of environmental protection.</p><h4>How would you characterize the non-oil potential of Qatar's industries?</h4><p>We believe that small- and medium-scale industries are essential tools to diversify and redistribute the country's sources of wealth and to lessen dependence on hydrocarbon resources. In this context, the State of Qatar offers several incentives and facilities to industrial projects including soft loans at highly competitive rates, terms, and repayment periods through Qatar Development Bank (QDB) and bank associates, as well as the use of our ultra-modern and fully serviced industrial estates. In 2011, the output of the various non-oil-non-gas (NONG) sectors grew at a steady pace, contributing almost 26% of total GDP growth at current prices. In terms of their relative importance, the finance, insurance, real estate, and business services sectors have kept the lead among other NONG sectors, with a share reaching 27.5% in 2011, and a rapid growth rate surging to 18.2% compared to 6.9% in 2010.</p><h4>One of the main challenges in many oil rich countries is the transition from a resource-based to a knowledge-based economy. What efforts is the ministry making in order to promote this and to what extent does QP strive to achieve this?</h4><p>In resource-based economies, abundant natural resources help governments maintain high living standards, strive toward human development, and ensure the nation's prosperity. In Qatar, we are harnessing our hydrocarbon resources and utilizing this economic wealth to help create a conducive environment for a sustainable knowledge-based economy. We have adopted a national development strategy focused on economic diversification that should position the non-hydrocarbon sector as the co-driver of future GDP growth; thus, paving the way for the development of a knowledge-based economy. Education and research play a decisive role in our efforts. This is why Qatar has invested time and resources in trying to create a world-class education system. The oil and gas industry in Qatar has supported this by promoting the National Research &amp; Development programs of the universities in Qatar and linking them to the needs of the industry. Qatar has also instituted Education City and the Qatar Science and Technology Park, which offer a host of incentives for international investors in high-priority areas like R&amp;D, knowledge transfer, and technology advancement. QP has spearheaded the development and growth of Qatar's economy for decades through a highly successful investment program in hydrocarbons. We will continue to play a central role in this effort, as well as in the effort to create a strong, diversified, and sustainable national economy. Our main purpose is very clear; to convert Qatar's hydrocarbon resources into a stream of healthy cash-flow, which could support Qatar's further development and develop the nation into a sustainable and knowledge based economy.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind Qatargas becoming the largest LNG producer in the world?<br></h4><p>The North Field is the single largest non-associated gas field in the world. Qatargas was founded in order to ensure the better utilization of the field, which contains large quantities of non-associated gas—this is gas that occurs in the reservoir without a significant presence of crude oil. Under the vision of His Highness the Emir and the leadership of His Excellency the Minister of Industry and Energy, Qatar decided to utilize these gas resources as a clean energy fuel. With our fleet of LNG carriers, LNG gives the company the flexibility to access any part of the world with ease. From Qatar, we are able to ship any volume to any part of the world, which is essential in the gas industry. The bottom line is, LNG is a form of gas that offers many opportunities to the producer.</p><h4>How is the oversupply of LNG in the world and the recent shale-gas revolution affecting the market for LNG?</h4><p>We are an operating company, and, therefore, we are able to control the amount of LNG that we produce. We are not worried about the oversupply, because what we have seen in terms of energy demand and growth worldwide is that every single drop is important. We are currently working at full capacity in order to ensure that we fulfill the agreements we have with our existing customers all over the world.</p><h4>How would you characterize the appetite for long-term LNG buyers in Asia?</h4><p>We recently completed the first LNG shipment to Singapore, and we commissioned the first LNG terminal there. The Asian appetite is high, and we have seen growth in China, India, and especially Japan, where there is an increase in demand for energy, specifically of gas as it diversifies away from the nuclear energy option in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. The demand in Asia is quite high; we have also seen conversions of coal-powered plants to gas-powered plants.</p><h4>What role does Qatargas play in providing energy security to Europe?</h4><p>We have been supplying Europe through our Qatar terminal, which is the Southhook Terminal in Wales. The capacity of that terminal is 15 million tons, though we do serve various other terminals. Of course, being a global supplier of LNG, we also have contracts with other European countries.</p><h4>What implications will the new gas discoveries in Block 4 of the North Field have on production?</h4><p>There is a moratorium currently in place for the North Field, and indeed for any further fields that are discovered, until 2015. Obviously, future plans regarding the utilization of these resources will be discussed at the appropriate time.</p><h4>What is Qatargas doing in regard to developing courses with universities?</h4><p>We are working closely with universities and research centers in Qatar. Regarding the universities, they supply the training courses, and we sponsor their students in specific fields related to the gas industry. There are programs set by the universities here in Qatar, and those programs cater to the demands and needs of the sector. We were also instrumental in establishing Qatar University's Gas Processing Center. There is a lot of support for programs in schools, and just recently we financed the building of a block of six additional classrooms at the Qatar Industrial School. These are examples of our corporate social responsibility, and there are many examples like this. Every April, we sponsor an annual beach cleanup event in al-Fuwairit in the north of Qatar. Since this is a prime turtle-nesting zone, we felt it appropriate as a responsible corporate citizen to do our best to ensure the turtles have a clean environment. We were also pleased to participate in the “Japan-Qatar Week" celebrations. Japan is important for us, being a foundation customer. The first contract signed with our Japanese customers was in 1992, and we have maintained our partnership with these customers over the years. We have great respect for the Japanese. We appreciate their continuing support and trust that they appreciate our support as a reliable and flexible supplier.</p><h4>What does Qatargas do to address Qatarization?</h4><p>We have a comprehensive localization program and have set ourselves clear targets for Qatarization, which currently stands at 26% of the company's workforce. In 2013, we targeted the recruitment of around 128 Qataris, which was a challenge for the company to achieve; however, in 2012 we recruited 104 students. That is quite an accomplishment because there are many other potential employers aiming at essentially the same talent pool. Qatar has a young labor market and there is great potential and numerous opportunities. Qatargas was one of the first companies in the country to start these initiatives to attract young people into the company. You could say we were pioneers of training and development initiatives that have now become standard throughout the employment sector in Qatar. At the same time, individuals who gained skills and experience with Qatargas found opportunities to move into senior positions with newer, emerging organizations in the state. You could say that Qatargas continues to be in a way a major “incubator of talent" for the state's industrial enterprises.</p><h4>What efforts is Qatargas making in regard to sustainability?</h4><p>We have a vision for 2015, which has been set out for the company. That vision is to be the world's premier LNG company, known for its people, innovation, operational excellence, and corporate social responsibility. Qatargas works closely with its employees using the skills and diversity of our workforce as a significant source of strength. We are also known globally to all of our customers that we are a reliable and secure supplier of LNG. The company is well established. We have a sustainability program and our strategy moving forward is closely linked in with State of Qatar's National Vision 2030. We have established and participated in numerous environmental projects that have positive business and environmental impacts, such as the $1 billion Jetty Boil-off Gas (JBOG) Project designed to capture gas at the loading jetties and reduce flaring during the loading of ships. Instead of flaring the gas, we capture it so it goes back into the network. In fact, there is enough energy recovered by the JBOG Project to power a small city.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in the long term?</h4><p>Currently, we produce 42 million tons of LNG. If you are asking about further expansion, then this all depends on the moratorium set for the North Field. From there, we will know which direction the government and Qatar Petroleum is heading toward, and whether it will increase the LNG business and production or not. It is still too early to talk about this because the deferral will not end until 2015. Having said that, I can see that there is always room for growth. We have just signed a contract for a new Laffan Refinery to be called Laffan Refinery 2. We are operating Laffan Refinery 1, and now we are looking at expanding capacity and adding a second refinery.</p><h4>What are the medium-term strategies and targets of Qatargas?</h4><p>Our plan is to continue our efforts to be a reliable and sustainable producer of LNG and to meet global demand for this clean fuel. We aim to continue operating safely and achieve our aspiration to become the world's premier LNG company. We are not just interested in being the biggest, we want to be premier, which is about quality, class, people, innovation, and excellence. That is what we want to be in the medium term, and of course, also to meet His Highness the Emir's requirements for Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>New extraction technologies have flushed regional markets with natural gas. What is RasGas' strategy for dealing with this reality?<br></h4><p>RasGas' long-term strategic vision, since its inception in 1993, has enabled it to become a major LNG supplier to the world. Over the past 20 years, we have demonstrated that reliability, deliverability, and flexibility are our key strengths that have set us apart. We have invested, through our major shareholders, Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corporation, in the full LNG value chain ranging from some of the world's largest LNG production trains to managing 27 efficient LNG vessels and constructing world-class terminals around the world. This allows us to reliably and efficiently transport and deliver clean energy to the world. Since our first delivery to South Korea in 1999, RasGas has come to produce and sell nearly half of Qatar's total LNG production to markets all across the globe, whilst also producing significant amounts of pipeline gas and associated products. RasGas also remains focused on expanding its wider business portfolio through the production of petrochemical liquid feedstock, helium, and pipeline sales gas for national and regional use. The construction of the $10.3 billion Barzan Gas Project will help to support Qatar's growing energy requirement and provide an incremental 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry gas, as well as associated products starting in 2014. Once the two trains come online, RasGas will produce around 11 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) per day, making us one of the largest gas producers in the world.</p><h4>How does RasGas address sustainability concerns, and how do your sustainability reports help the company achieve its goals?</h4><p>At RasGas, we believe that sustainable practices and business success are inseparable. In 2009, RasGas became the first energy company in Qatar to voluntarily report on its sustainability performance relating to business, environmental, and social issues, which is aligned with the four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Our annual sustainability reports demonstrate our commitment to accountability and transparency in our business practices, as well as keeping us focused on excellence in safety, production, and in making a valuable contribution to the community. It provides us an opportunity to review our business and operations, and remain accountable for our resources. In 2013, we issued our fourth sustainability report and the company received the top accolade for large-scale organisation for its 2012 Sustainability Report at the Excellence in Sustainability Reporting Awards ceremony held by QP. The RasGas Sustainability Report for 2012 improved on previous ones, both in content and presentation, by expanding its coverage and being available online in both English and Arabic to reach a wider audience. It takes account of sustainability reporting guidance specific to the oil and gas industry prepared by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The report benchmarks us with our international competitors and demonstrates that we are world-market leaders in sustainability. In 2012, RasGas launched its second five-year flare minimization program, which is set to continue the trend of downward CO2 emissions, ultimately targeting a 90% reduction from the flaring levels of 2005. RasGas also continues to maintain a safe working environment for its employees and contractors. As of December 2013, the company's venture group had completed a record 100 million man-hours without Lost Time Incident (LTI). RasGas is consistently ranked among the best performers when compared with 20 of the largest companies in the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers' (OGP) safety performance benchmarking report. In 2012, RasGas was the safest company in the upstream industry.</p><h4>RasGas is responsible for 25% of the world's Helium production, a gas whose inertness, low density, and solubility make it useful across many sectors. How is RasGas preparing for what will likely be increased helium prices and potentially a large drop in supply?</h4><p>RasGas does not speculate on price increases, as there are many factors involved in the global pricing market. Our second helium plant, Helium 2, started production in June 2013. Together with Helium 1, built in 2005, RasGas has a combined annual production of approximately 2 bscf per day and will meet around 25% of current total liquid helium global demand. This also makes Qatar the world's largest helium refining facility and the largest exporter and second largest producer of helium in the world. RasGas has off-take agreements with Air Liquide, Iwatani Corporation, and Linde Gases, a Linde Group division. Air Liquide will receive 50%, Linde Gases 30%, and the Iwatani Corporation 20% of our annual liquid helium production up until 2032.</p><h4>In early 2013, Carnegie Mellon Qatar and RasGas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that paved the way for mutually beneficial initiatives and projects that include providing resources and training for students at Carnegie Mellon. What else is RasGas doing to invest in education?</h4><p>Education is the key to sustainability and RasGas' liaison with the education sector is pivotal to ensuring the long-term viability of our Qatarization strategy. As such, we have built numerous long-standing relationships with many educational establishments, such as Qatar University, Texas, A&amp;M University-Qatar, Virginia Commonwealth University-Qatar, and most recently CMU-Q. RasGas provides financial and technical support to a number of university programs that seek to encourage young people to pursue technical or science-based careers. These include support for the Life is Engineering program in collaboration with the Faculty of Engineering at Qatar University, supported by RasGas volunteers. Additionally, we have signed a platinum sponsorship agreement worth $350,000 with Qatar University in support of the Al-Bairaq program, which is designed to generate interest in scientific, experimental, and research skills among high school students in Qatar. We also work directly with high schools; for example, RasGas' Safety Ambassadors program stimulates interest in occupational health and safety as a career for young students in Qatar. This program not only nurtures and develops safety and health awareness as a necessary life skill, but it also builds a foundation for creating a reservoir of talent for the future oil and gas sector. Additionally, RasGas awards scholarships to high school and university students to continue their education locally or internationally for qualifications ranging from diploma programs to Bachelor and Master's degrees. In the summer months, we have a robust internship program that offers students an early introduction to the work environment where they are assigned RasGas mentors. It allows us to participate in the process of training students while they are still at university. This in turn supports our recruitment drive. In 2012, RasGas was awarded the Qatarization Crystal Award in recognition of its support and active education initiatives as part of its Qatarization strategy.</p><h4></h4><h4>How do RasGas' long-term goals align with Qatar's 2030 Vision?</h4><p>As a responsible corporate citizen and respectful member of the Qatari community, RasGas' five-year strategic plan, goals, and objectives are established in alignment with Qatar's National Vision 2030. The strategic choices, which serve as the core of our strategy, revolve around the four pillars of Vision 2030 (Safety, Health and Environment, People, Reliability and Deliverability). To promote sustainable prosperity, we consistently enhance our reliability and deliverability of gas from reservoir to delivery point. For the human development pillar, we are committed to developing Qatari nationals into employees to strengthen the national workforce and optimize the skill mix. To contribute to an integrated approach to sound social development, RasGas implements several effective Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives within the community. To ensure environmental sustainability for future generations, RasGas strictly obeys the regulations enforced by Ministry of Environment and pursues strict initiatives to use energy and national resources efficiently and reduce waste and emissions. The State of Qatar has grown at a historic pace over the past two decades and natural gas has rapidly become the clean energy of choice that powers and transforms global economies. At RasGas, we aim at actively and positively contributing toward and enabling the sustainable development of Qatar and its people in alignment with the Vision 2030. One of our major projects, the Barzan Gas Project, will fuel major development in Qatar and further contribute to all four pillars of Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the oil and gas sector's significance for Qatar?<br></h4><p>The oil and gas industry remains the key source of income for Qatar. However, the country is actively striving to diversify away from a resource-based economy and, as part of this initiative, Qatar Petroleum (QP) has established a number of subsidiary companies, including Al Shaheen Holding. The aim of these companies is to invest in energy and non-energy related companies through acquisition and partnership with leading international companies.</p><h4>How do you expect the recent natural gas discoveries in the North Field to impact your operations?</h4><p>The announcement of the new discoveries will almost definitely have a positive impact on Al Shaheen Holding. Gas production requires mortaring, in turn meaning more rigs, and, therefore, a greater need for oil and gas services, which falls directly within the remit of Al Shaheen Weatherford, our joint venture with Weatherford International. In addition, this also means an increased requirement for machinery, such as compressors, turbines, and pipelines, the servicing and maintenance of which falls within the capability of our two joint ventures with GE Oil &amp; Gas; Al Shaheen GE Services, and PII Pipeline Solutions. In addition, there are a significant number of existing wells around Qatar that are depleting, and will soon require rejuvenation and, therefore, new technology, which falls within our target investment market.</p><h4>How does Al Shaheen ensure the sustainability of its operations here?</h4><p>One of the mandates of our strategic plan is to focus heavily on the environment. We are actively looking to expand in the field of sustainability. Hazardous waste could include chemicals, water waste, or even metals, all of which affect the environment. We are keen to identify a partner with the know-how to work with us on environmental issues.</p><h4>R&amp;D is paramount to the energy industry. In this context, how are you leveraging your capabilities to develop Qatar's knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>Our mandate is to identify new technology. Many international companies have approached us to invest with them in developing their technology. In existing joint ventures, we always prioritize R&amp;D, our core strength. Meanwhile, the upstream sector remains highly competitive, and we need to remain technologically current. Therefore, we are active in bringing in technology, and looking to grow that field.</p><h4>How do you approach Qatarization within the company?</h4><p>Qatarization and the creation of local job opportunities is a founding component of our objectives. We also actively interact with Qatar Petroleum and other local institutions to assess what training opportunities we can provide newly qualified Qataris at our joint venture companies. We already have Qataris that are now fully trained, and who will be transferred to the head office of PII Pipeline Solutions for further career development. We also provide specialized training to Qatar Petroleum, in conjunction with GE Services, at our facility in Ras Laffan, and are currently seeking to expand this offering to other Qatar-based companies. In the future, we also want to attract more university students. Here you have the tools, the machines, and the engineers to provide an opportunity for students to observe the real world. We believe that by providing both international and local training, we have a strong platform for attracting more locals to the services sector, where we currently have limited experience, particularly in senior management. Increasing the number of nationals with know-how in specialized services will be extremely important for the long-term success of Qatari businesses in this sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Where the Market Is]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[where-the-market-is]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the recent changes to the regulatory environment?<br></h4><p>The regulation change has been in the making since 2007, so it was bound to happen. Most of the companies will be very much prepared to handle the regulations, and it is necessary in this regulatory environment. Not having an insurance regulator causes many problems for the insurance companies operating in a country. Insurance is a business in which you are constantly dealing in international markets. When you are dealing as counterparties not just locally, but internationally, most of the time the international insurance company needs to know who the regulators are.</p><h4>How would you assess the success of Qatar Insurance Company (QIC) in its first 50 years of business in the country?</h4><p>QIC has never had a year when it recorded a loss, and that is a testament to our success. QIC has good systems in place, and everything is sustainable. It has grown significantly over the last 10 years. We have a reasonably competitive environment in the country, and there are six other national insurers. QIC has competition coming in both the local market as well as from international insurance houses. In terms of competiveness, QIC is in the top quartile of companies in the region. QIC operates across the region, meaning our business is not just focused on Qatar. QIC has a diversified business plan. Being able to develop a very diversified business in a small country is a huge success. QIC has been rated A by Standard &amp; Poor's since 2008, and with no blip during the global financial crisis.</p><h4>What is your target market comprised of?</h4><p>QIC's business is 85% comprised of corporates, both local and foreign. According to Qatari law, every company with a presence here needs to be insured locally. For our corporate clients, we mainly work in property and casualty. We also offer personal lines, and we provide medical, household, and hard asset cover.</p><h4>To what extent do you work within the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Oil and gas is big, but it is risky. A company like Qatar Petroleum (QP) insures up to $1 billion. QIC's total balance sheet is $1.2 billion, so we can't carry that risk. The amount of business coming from non-oil and gas sector businesses will increase as the asset base of the country develops. QIC is an asset-based insurer. The oil and gas assets are significant in size and they are very complicated. One can't take that risk. There are only two companies in the world that literally absorb 40% of the world's reinsurance. Every risk you see that is large ultimately flows into those balance sheets. The impact on our business from the oil and gas industry is related to the oil and gas industry rather than the oil and gas itself. Around 75% of QIC's business is non-energy related, of which 75% is for motor vehicles.</p><h4>Given the importance of reinsurance in this market, what about the future of Q-Re?</h4><p>That is one of our growth vehicles because we are expanding internationally. Instead of starting and trying to establish direct operations all over the world, we are using a reinsurance platform to grow. That is very critical for us, and we have now an operational base in Zurich, Bermuda, and a representative office in London. To divide your insurance base internationally you have to be based out of the reinsurance centers. You cannot sit so far away and expect the business to walk through your door. We have to be where the market is.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the insurance sector as a whole for the short term?</h4><p>I have a positive outlook for the short term; the insurance industry here is stable and is growing in line with the economy. Competition is strong; however, new products are coming into the market and this spurs demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ExxonMobil has a long history in Qatar and enjoys an important relationship with the government. How does this history help it remain competitive?<br></h4><p>Relationships are extremely important, especially in Qatar, and to that end we are fortunate in having developed a strong foundation with the State of Qatar and Qatar Petroleum (QP) over the past 20 years. The beginning of the partnership we know today dates back to the early 1990s when we were asked to participate in the first Qatargas venture, which marked the country's first LNG undertaking. Following our initial venture, the government of Qatar and QP were interested in forming a second venture with ExxonMobil, which became RasGas. From there, we began to build these businesses to what we have today. We spent the beginning of this partnership getting to know each other and understanding the strengths each of us brought to the table. From this understanding, we were able to work toward delivering on the vision of His Highness the Father Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and the goals that he set out for the industry. That relationship has since progressed and grown stronger, and it is my belief that we were able to expand our projects because we had taken the time to build the relationship from the ground up. Since that time, we have been fortunate enough to participate in 12 of the 14 LNG trains in the country. In terms of our relative strengths, the government established a business climate of transparency and stability that allows companies like ours to thrive. Additionally, QP brought operating strengths that really complemented our own, which is why our relationship has been able to expand as it has, especially over the past decade. The partnership between QP and ExxonMobil also brought technology and scale to the country, which necessitated an increased train size. This also enabled us to drive down the costs of the business and the scale created a reach that is allowing us to export to 20 different countries in 2013 from Qatar alone. It has been a remarkable journey, wherein we have been able to take a business that was mostly point-to-point LNG with only a few buyers in Asia and then globalize this trend. Today, you cannot help but hear about an LNG-related development somewhere in the world. Qatar is essentially responsible for globalizing the LNG business, and the QP-ExxonMobil partnership was a conduit for this.</p><h4>ExxonMobil is partnering with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) to build an LNG export facility at Sabine Pass in Texas. How does shale gas change your strategy in Qatar?</h4><p>The challenge society faces in the coming years is extremely complex when you consider the global population growing to 9 billion people over the next 30 years, a concurrent 35% growth in energy demand, and the need to manage risks associated with climate change. When you consider economic prosperity and poverty alleviation, it is ultimately dependent on economic growth, which, in turn, is dependent on energy consumption. This is an enormous challenge and a huge responsibility for our industry. The growth of shale gas offers an opportunity to help address this challenge. By 2040, we see natural gas going from the third most demanded energy resource to the second, displacing coal. Natural gas, whether produced from conventional reservoirs or shale deposits, can play an important role in helping address the energy challenge. As a reliable, abundant, and cleaner burning source of energy, natural gas can help support a growing population and increased standards of living while reducing the environmental impacts of energy use. Also in support of a growing demand for natural gas, we have signed an agreement with QPI to investigate upstream opportunities in North America, and we are looking at an expansion at the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas that would allow us to capitalize on the growing supply of gas in the US. With regard to Golden Pass, we have applied for and received a free trade agreement (FTA) export license, and are currently awaiting the non-free trade agreement (NFTA) export license, which we hope to receive shortly. It is exciting for us to look at taking a business we know well, with partners we trust, and expanding it elsewhere.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sasol is considered a pioneer in the GTL industry at large, and in Qatar specifically, having entered a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum on the ORYX GTL plant. How do you assess the commercial viability of such operations?<br></h4><p>It is no secret that the ORYX GTL plant is one of the most successful joint ventures in Qatar today. That is due to the combined resources of Qatar Petroleum, the lead partner in the joint venture, and Sasol. It is viable and it is successful. On the basis of the success that Sasol has been enjoying here in Qatar, we are now looking for other opportunities around the world. Gas conversion technology, however, has existed for over 60 years, and Sasol has been operating plants in South Africa using Fischer-Tropsch technology since 1952. What makes this one unique is that it is a low-temperature process, and therefore an economic venture.</p><h4>What future markets exist for diesel fuels that are created through the FT conversion process?</h4><p>Fuels created by gas conversion are inherently more environmentally friendly than conventional fuels created from fossil oil. There is a market demand for them, especially as GTL fuels are low in sulfur, they produce lower greenhouse gas emissions, and they have a high cetane number. Functionally speaking, GTL fuels are no different from petroleum-based fuels and can be used in two ways: as a fuel or as a blendstock.</p><h4>Where are the products of the ORYX GTL plant exported?</h4><p>The ORYX GTL site currently produces three products. Some are for export and some are for domestic use. LPG, for example, is produced for domestic use in Qatar. Naphtha, a highly paraffinic product, is generally exported to Southern Asia and the Far East as cracker feedstock for chemical crackers and ethane crackers. The largest product by volume is diesel, which mainly goes to Europe and, more recently, to the Middle Eastern markets.</p><div class="quote">“Whatever the outcome, there is a continued need for self-sufficiency within markets, and this is based on having sufficient hydrocarbons and not having to import."</div><h4>What initiatives does Sasol undertake in order to ensure the sustainability of its operations here?</h4><p>Efficiency is core to our approach moving forward. In Qatar, we are looking at a higher level of carbon efficiency through the ORYX GTL plant. We're incorporating lessons learned in Qatar to maximize the efficiency of our next slate of projects. For example, there is an active program to reduce flaring, in line with Qatar's containment philosophy to have a lower carbon footprint. What we are learning from these modifications is that we can apply them in our new projects to lower their environmental impact and maintain the same level of production quality.</p><h4>What efforts with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) does Sasol focus on here in Qatar?</h4><p>Sasol is a company committed to the communities in which we operate. Our initiatives are aligned to support the Qatar National Vision 2030. For example, in 2012 we launched a program to highlight the abilities of people who are disabled, called “Definitely Able." Additionally, we are actively involved in supporting environmental issues. In partnership with Friends of the Environment Center Qatar, we are developing an application for smart phones and tablets that will bring the wealth of Qatar's bird and insect life to the palm of your hand. In April 2013, during the QP Environmental Fair, we brought a play from Lebanon that emphasized the importance of recycling to young people. These are just two examples of our investment in the community here in Qatar, a market to which we are committed for the long term.</p><h4></h4><h4>From a global perspective, how is the shale gas revolution affecting global markets, and how is that affecting Sasol specifically?</h4><p>Sasol has direct stakes in shale gas and is in a joint venture producing shale gas in Canada. We have seen in North America  that shale has created a situation where  there is a complete disassociation between the oil price and the gas price. The question is, what is the supply/demand balance in the future? It is clear to us that in the long term, demand for gas will rapidly increase, and shale will assist in meeting that demand. There has been a lot of new gas found off the coast of Africa, as well as in Australia and a number of other places. It looks like there will be a tight balance between supply and demand going forward. What we don't know is what will happen in terms of shale in China and other places in Europe. There is a lot of development on shale gas in the UK and other places. Whether demand will outstrip supply, only time will tell. Whatever the outcome, there is a continued need for self-sufficiency within markets, and this is based on having sufficient hydrocarbons and not having to import. GTL is one of the solutions available to gas-rich countries such as Qatar.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in Qatar?</h4><p>For energy specifically, there is no indication that there will be an expansion of LNG production; however, there will be an expansion in refinery capacity for crude oil. That will produce growth, but it will depend on oil and gas prices. It is our understanding that the moratorium on an increased flow of gas from the North Field will be evaluated in the coming years. There is an indication that an increase of gas supply from the North Field will happen. There was a gas find that was announced in April 2013 of 2.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf). If there is an additional gas find, then in three to five years time there will be an increase in gas production. What we have found is that in Qatar it is looking at diversifying, meaning there are more C2, C3, and C4 going into gas treatment and chemicals. We have the two crackers with downstream production coming up, but that is petrochemicals. One of those crackers will be up and running by 2018, and that will start a different kind of increase, but not directly in energy. The energy sector depends very much on oil prices, and there is an indication that oil prices are a little bit softer, and that will impact on gas prices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Qatar Exchange (QE) has been very successful in recent years, and has seen 14% year-on-year growth since 2012. What strategies have led to this success since the founding of the Exchange?<br></h4><p>The QE was established 16 years ago, and its success is related to the broader success of Qatar itself. Despite all that is occurring in the region, Qatar has seen strong continuous GDP growth in the mid- to-upper teens since 2008. Our success is linked to this positive performance, which has been motivated by the strong policies of Qatar's leadership. The exchange supports local companies and promotes investment in Qatar's future, and we are constantly adapting to help achieve the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>How do you think the QE fits into Qatar's long-term economic aspirations?</h4><p>The development of the QE is clearly an essential aspect of the broader development of the capital markets in Qatar. Efficient and well-established capital markets contribute to the growth of the economy since they facilitate efficient capital allocation, providing funds to those projects and companies that generate the highest return. At the same time, the development of a vibrant private sector is an important element in Qatar's strategy for diversifying the economy and building thriving business across various sectors. We believe that  the QE has been developing and will continue to develop to play its role in realizing this objective.</p><h4>How has the recent upgrade to Emerging Market Status broadened your horizons?</h4><p>The upgrade will attract additional international institutional investors to the market and will support liquidity, thus benefiting listed companies and the other investors in the market.</p><h4>How does the QE facilitate foreign investment in the Qatari economy, and what is your outlook for foreign investment going forward?</h4><p>Firstly, companies listed on the exchange can now, in some cases, have foreign ownership in excess of 25%. In addition, the state is building confidence among international investors through regulation. It is key for any investor to know that when they enter a market their investment is subject to adequate regulation. Additionally, we are trying to introduce new tools and products for the international investor, and these are other factors that will encourage the investor to come to the Qatari market. We are using the grid infrastructure and have a robust disclosure system.</p><h4>How do new, large listings affect the exchange?</h4><p>The listing of any company in the market represents value-added to the market as the listing of the shares of a new company will increase the investment options offered to investors and enhance the liquidity in the market. It provides investors with more options, some of which hold very strong positions in the market. Though we have only 42 companies listed, some are vast entities with huge capitalization exceeding the numerous exchanges that boast hundreds of listed companies. These 42 companies have a capitalization of roughly $130 billion, so it is not a question of the number of companies, but of their credibility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[challenging-the-paradigm]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will the recent credit upgrade do in terms of Bank Technique's attractiveness to investors?</h4><p>A high level of NPLs partially explains the bank's previously low credit rating in the 2012-2013 period. However, following intensive and fruitful work during that period, we managed to achieve a significant upgrade from rating agency Fitch in December 2013. Along with the development of retail and corporate banking segments, we want Bank Technique to be active on the financial markets as well. We are in the process of establishing a strong relationship with global financial institutions in the context of our interest in developing treasury and interbank operations. A higher rating will provide the opportunity to establish better and closer cooperation with international financial institutions. From now on, we are going to be more concentrated on trade finance and forex operations. At the same time, we are considering the issuing of the bonds as the next stage of our strategic plan. We are set to participate in various large-scale projects of our customers by financing them. Large projects require substantial funds, which is, again, why sound ratings are so crucial to making sure our customers enjoy uninterrupted financing. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve our figures, which will ultimately benefit us on the financial markets. And since we are considering the issuance of corporate bonds at later stages, the role of credit ratings becomes all the more essential to our operations.</p><h4>What innovations is Bank Technique trying to bring to its retail-banking arm?</h4><p>There are several initiatives being realized, and currently we are moving forward on the opening of e-branches, which will complement our e-banking lines, and will be installing ATMs with access to the e-banking system. At the same time, we are looking into specific equipment for transactions that do not involve ATMs. We ultimately want to enable our customers to execute all of their transactions through the e-banking system, although we understand that changing people's habits and increasing the popularity of e-banking requires time. At the same time, we are about to issue a special display card that will act as a payment card with an embedded chip and identification tool. The card will be enhanced by display and will generate one-time passwords. These passwords are required for customer identification in our online banking systems Technique Online (desktop) and Technique Mobile (smartphones and tablets). This innovative card—a MasterCard Gold—will enable us to provide our customers greater security and comfort, and is the first display card in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the card will provide additional security when shopping online. Apart from CVC, customers are provided 3D security through MasterCard. Usually, with similar products, the code is static, yet our product has the advantage of being dynamic. We plan to use this card as identification at our e-branches, as well, while the same will apply for our call center. The operator will ask whether you are an e-banking customer, and if yes, a one-time code will be requested. During 2013, we gave much time to the implementation of our new online banking system, which we scheduled for launch in the spring. Our objective was to make as many transactions as possible available on one platform. As a result, we succeeded in building an online banking system with the largest functionality and most innovative features. We expect our customers to respond positively to the system, which enables almost all non-cash banking transactions.</p><div class="quote">“Currently we are moving forward on the opening of e-branches."</div><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yachay University styles itself as the City of Knowledge. What does that mean?</h4><p>Yachay University's concept involves the creation of a science and technology park. A global city is going to be built where people can experience the latest technology and world-class companies can maintain permanent communication and exchange businesses. Its full name is Universidad de Investigación de Tecnologí­a Experimental, and it is a fundamental part of our overall project. National public-sector research centers are based across the university, and we are also partnering with a number of enterprises around the world in projects to develop R&amp;D facilities within the city. From an economic perspective, one of the most important aspects of the city is entrepreneurship. As we seek investment from established companies, we offer them a complete business system to allow for the creation of new enterprises and start-ups. Essentially, Yachay is an ecosystem for innovation, with all systems, public services, and high-quality, advanced technologies in place. Any serious engagement in the ICT sector requires an excellent internet connection, power supply, and advanced manpower. YACHAY offers precisely that; i.e., the right infrastructure with public services comparable to the highest international standards. It is also important that we are not competing in the way China did in the international market 20 years ago, on the basis of having the lowest labor costs in the world. Rather, we are trying to develop a system known for having the most qualified engineers and scientists available. Classical academia in Latin America is not traditionally about connecting entrepreneurs and the industrial sector. We have a triple-helix concept, which aims to coordinate the relationship between the public sector, academia, and industry. The public sector and academia used to invest heavily in basic research, while industry, in contrast, pursued margins. Therefore, Yachay University bridges the gap between basic and applied research and the end product. We leverage human talent, infrastructure, and valuable incentives, such as lower transaction costs, to create a bank of innovative ideas. The state is a promoter of these initiatives; it has the will to advance into the knowledge-based economy and has invested what is necessary to guarantee that workers' skills are nurtured. There are approximately 8,000 people studying abroad at well-known universities. These students can then return to the country and develop their own ideas, and Ecuador will channel hydrocarbon revenues into new facilities and other support mechanisms.</p><h4>What is the importance of international relationships for the institution?</h4><p>There is no restriction on benefiting from knowledge. We understand that knowledge has no boundaries, but we recognized, however, that our system was sub-standard, so we instituted a major reform in that system that includes new universities. Because of the low level of research, teaching, and overall performance, we began with an evaluation of the system. We proposed the creation of these four new universities. One of them is Yachay University, which was created with the purpose of becoming the prime academic institution in the region, the vocation of which is the development of experimental technologies to solve the problems of Ecuadorean society and guarantee the rights described in the constitution. In Ecuador, then, research is an element of the social contract in the new constitution. It is a pledge and program to direct Ecuadorean society toward a knowledge-based model.</p><h4>How will you facilitate a transference of knowledge between social segments?</h4><p>The national constitution recognizes three subsystems in our economy. The first one is the private sector, which guarantees the rights to private property, which is far removed from the model of the traditional socialist regime. The second subsystem is the state sector. And in Ecuador, we have another one, the popular solidarity economy, which involves communal and cooperative property. Ecuador is home to 14 nationalities, each with their own understanding of the law and the economy. Yachay University cannot merely develop a strategy that guarantees the active role of public enterprises. Its role is to develop the city holistically, and to commercialize technology. In the 1970s, we developed Petroecuador to create an oil-based economy, and in the 1980s we created Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones to develop the ICT sector. We have developed Yachay because technology and knowledge underpin the future. The private sector is the developer of these new businesses, along with established companies. Our role as the state is to enable knowledge transfer from Yachay to the private companies that are developing the sector. The popular solidarity economy, which consists of cooperatives, such as collectives of banana farmers, is also important in Ecuador. One of the commercial failings of this sector is its lack of access to technology. This represents the difference between, for example, an Ecuadorean banana cooperative and Dole. Dole obtains its seeds from Monsanto; it purchases them at a low price and has its own laboratories. A banana cooperative may have 10,000 farmers, but lacks such technology, so it has to buy seeds from abroad. They are therefore tied to the technological package of fertilizers and pesticides that they have to import. The final price is also quite different. This type of business has no way of developing its own technology in order to be competitive. Yachay's role is not only technological, but also social and educational when it comes to offering new opportunities to the community and introducing new ways to generate income.</p><div class="quote">“It is a pledge and program to direct Ecuadorean society toward a knowledge-based model."</div><h4>How do you foresee Yachay contributing to the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>We expect Yachay to become the main technological center in Ecuador. It will become an incubator of technologies that will provide great benefits to the Ecuadorean people, all the while testing technologies in order to get the most of their potential. As such, Yachay is a concept with the potential to positively impact Ecuadorean society at large through a social system, rather than a commercially motivated marketing concept.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>My father, HH Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, left office in a unique and rather unprecedented step with upright stature, after helping Qatar to become a developed country with modern facilities and institutions, and where per capita income has reached the highest level in the world. His Highness left his position with Qatar a non-stop site of development and with manifold, balanced, and growing political and economic relations, as well as a safe and stable society where crime is virtually non-existent. Qatar has transformed from a state that some people could barely locate on a map into a major player in politics, economy, media, culture, and sport worldwide. His Highness decided to end his reign while still able to give his best. He wanted also to translate his words into actions, especially concerning the necessities of change and the succession of generations. He handed over the banner to me as an expression of confidence in his Heir Apparent. I hope to be worthy of this trust, and to be able to continue the path laid out by this man, who is actually the builder of the modern State of Qatar, and the pioneer of its awakening.<br></p><p>In 2008, to pursue the march of reform and modernity, we drew up a road map for the future of the country under the title of Qatar National Vision 2030, which is aimed at transforming Qatar by 2030 into an advanced country capable of achieving sustainable development and ensuring a continued and decent standard of living for its people. It is natural that we put the interests of Qatar and the Qatari people at the top of our priorities list. This includes individuals, society, economy, politics, and cultural identity. At the same time, we have to bear in mind that there is no identity without belonging to wider circles. We are part of the Arabian Gulf region, the Arab world, and the Islamic world. We are also a part of humanity and the international community. As part of Qatar National Vision 2030, we consider the building of institutions that are based on the rational management of resources, professional standards, and benchmarks of productivity and efficiency, while serving the greater public interest as one of the development processes that we aspire to. The other is qualifying our citizens for productive work and developing them such that they find meaning in their lives in the serving of their country and society.</p><p>As you know, the comprehensive development of our country has been, and continues to be, a major concern for us because we believe that integrated and balanced development is the key to establishing a modern state responsive to the needs of today, and capable of achieving for Qatar the stature that we look forward to, and for the Qatari people the decent standard of living they deserve, without abandoning our authentic Qatari Arab heritage and our most tolerant Islamic faith. In the economic domain, Qatar has sustained its accomplishments by achieving the best results as per the vision and strategy set out for this purpose, despite global economic uncertainty and instability that prevent complete recovery from the successive crises that afflict a number of advanced and emerging economies alike. Real GDP increased at a lesser rate in 2012 compared to previous growth rates. But, if we take into account the low growth rate in the oil sector, we observe that achieving this growth rate in GDP required a growth rate of up to 10% in the non-oil sector, which was not an easy achievement. This is what must be done to diversify the structure of the Qatari economy, through the participation of the private sector and by encouraging private initiative that can identify potential and market needs in the context of price control and development planning. Maintaining good annual growth rates over the coming years is considered a major challenge in light of the expected decline in the growth rate of the hydrocarbons sector. This requires a doubling of our efforts to increase productivity, improve economic and technical efficiency, promote economic diversification, encourage entrepreneurship, expand R&amp;D, and move forward toward a knowledge-based economy. This is exactly what we are working to achieve in the next phase. The real growth rate in GDP is coupled with other indicators that reflect the strength of Qatar's economy, namely that government expenditures in the public budget for the 2013-2014 fiscal year are higher than any spending in previous budgets exceeding the 2012-2013 fiscal year level by 17%. This increase has come in a timely manner to compensate for lower growth in the oil sector, and to sustain the fiscal stimulus and the need for spending on the priorities of the National Development Strategy 2011-2016, which includes health, education, and infrastructure development. Qatar has maintained its top rank in global competitiveness and its relatively high indicators in the field of human development. Qatar has also attained the highest Human Development ranking among the Arab Gulf countries in the Human Development Report for 2013, issued by the UN Development Program. This comparison is not intended as bragging, but to identify areas of strength in order to preserve them, and the areas of weakness in order to work on their development and overcome them.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar has maintained its top rank in global competitiveness and its relatively high indicators in the

"</div><p>The private sector remains a key partner in development, whether in diversifying income sources or expanding the productive base of the state, thus encouraging this sector, removing obstacles, and providing it with adequate incentives rests with the government in the first place, and it is the duty of the business community and the Chamber of Commerce to cooperate with the government by providing all necessary proposals and solutions to enable the private sector to play its role. There remains a need for surmounting other difficulties facing the private sector, such as combating monopoly, providing an atmosphere of competition, overcoming bureaucratic barriers, and reducing the size and number of intermediate companies and institutions between the state sector on the one hand, and entrepreneurs and businessmen on the other.</p><p>Qatar has confirmed its advanced standing as the most competitive state in the Middle East, and remained among the world's top-20 economies in 2013. We have established cooperative relations based on common interests and mutual respect with many countries around the world in the West and the East, in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and in the region. There is no alternative to the common interests and mutual respect in relations between countries. The State of Qatar has also aligned itself with the issues of the Arab peoples and their aspiration to live freely and with dignity away from corruption and despotism.</p><p>In spite of the economic turmoil in the world, the financial sector in Qatar has pushed its way toward progress and is upgrading its services. This has culminated in the Qatar Stock Exchange joining the emerging markets group. Qatar has also maintained its high credit rating, which we seek to upgrade as well, by promoting transparency of competitive procedures in the markets and simplifying legislation.</p><p>We are a state, a people, and a coherent society; we are not a political party. This is why we strive to maintain relationships with all governments and nations while respecting all sincere, effective, and active political trends in the region, without being supportive of one trend over another. God has blessed us with natural resources that would not have brought us this income without the vision and courage of HH my father. We are meant to preserve it and prepare its alternatives. Despite the high standard of living that we can provide, we must deal responsibly with our resources and our economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-shared-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between France and Qatar is based on political interests, on trust, and on the same approach to today's main global challenges, and especially of this region. If there was a purpose to my visit it was, first of all, to demonstrate that on the major political issues Qatar and France have the same vision and desires. I notably think of the events in Syria on which you worked yesterday with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs at the Group of Friends of the Syrian People conference.<br></p><p>I also came together with the heads of 46 French companies to demonstrate that we must take a further step in our economic partnership. France is aware of the speed of Qatar's successful development. It is truly striking, and further evidence still was provided to us when we visited the Bouygues site, here in Doha.</p><p>Everything in Qatar is taking on a new dimension: the size of the projects, the volume of finance, and the quality of the technology used. There again, our companies must respond to all the requests addressed to them. We do not ask for any special treatment or favors. We simply want to take pride in our excellence, our work quality, and our engineering, as well as the technical prowess of our products.</p><div class="quote">“  We must have principles: time, excellence, and mutual support. We must project ourselves in tomorrow's sectors. "</div><p>Qatar has a 30-year vision of its future, which is the reason for its exceptional business diversification and development. You deliberately decided to be less dependent on your oil and gas resources and open to all sectors of the future. As you are now entering upon this new phase of development, based not only on a diversification of your businesses, but also of your investments, it is our desire to fully participate in a cooperation founded on three principles.</p><p>The first is “time." It is been a long time since we arrived in Qatar. Total has been here for 75 years now. French companies must be willing to commit to Qatar for the long term. Not to simply meet temporary needs or catch a single opportunity, but to make it their home. There are 100 companies present in Qatar today engaged in all sectors from information technology and engineering, to distribution, and financial services. Cooperation in the academic field will also contribute to create future professionals for our companies' mutual benefit.</p><p>The second principle on which we wish to base our cooperation is “technological excellence." We take pride in knowing that Airbus provides two-thirds of the Qatar Airways fleet, and are even more pleased to know that Technip has made a significant contribution to the construction of mega-gas liquefaction trains; that Bouygues and Vinci could show their know-how in matters of civil engineering or in participating in prestigious projects, and that many French companies are present within the Qatar Science and Technology Park. This is what encourages us, because you have chosen us for the quality of our products and the excellence of our work.</p><p>The third principle is “mutual support." As I often say, these investments should cover all sectors of France's growing economy: industry and services, but also real estate—giving priority to the industry and services sectors.</p><p>France is an attractive country; however, we must be compelling enough to make your investments arrive where we expect them.</p><p>We would like to establish two partnerships, and I wish to give you two examples, the first being a financial partnership. With the “Caisse des dépí´ts" and the Qatari investment fund we have created Qatar Holding, a new investment fund that aims to support French SMEs in a process based on trust and transparency.</p><p>The second partnership I suggest sees our companies, French and Qatari, projected together in third party markets. Vinci and Diar, for example, have established a joint venture to carry out projects in Africa; Qatar Petroleum and Total have agreed to jointly develop oil activities in the Congo. We can multiply these kinds of alliances and cooperation and act together in a number of active markets, these being based on technology or geographical areas.</p><p>I also hope we can give more importance to the presence of our companies in three areas. The first is energy, since it is at the core of our economic and environmental challenges today and an element of future competitiveness. Qatar owns the third largest gas reserves in the world. To our thinking this is the least polluting hydrocarbon, and the one on which we still pin our hopes. French companies must continue to develop themselves with even more efficient technologies. But I also know the attention you invest into environmental aspects, and the energy transition. It is no coincidence that Qatar hosted the 18th edition of the Conference on Climate Change and expressed its willingness to take full responsibility on this matter. France itself will host the 21st edition of the same conference, and Qatar will be of invaluable help for us in achieving a positive outcome. We are, together, well aware of the challenges we will have to face in the energy field. We can then cooperate on the development of renewable energies, in the energy efficiency field, the reduction of carbon use, as well as in other investment areas we can pursue together.</p><p>The second area is urban development. The rapid growth of cities is a common phenomenon in many geographical areas. But here in Qatar, you have gone through major changes. The population has tripled in 10 years. A million people will be arriving in Qatar by 2030, which will create pressure. The projects are considerable, both in terms of developing office and residential buildings, as well as tourist and sporting facilities. However, there is more than just the real estate aspect. There is also transport infrastructure, sewage treatment, and other waste disposal. In short, what we call “smart cities," in which you have led the way. In these fields, French companies are internationally recognized for their expertise. I know they are already present here to meet your needs, for the metro in Doha, and today Alstom, for Lusail's tramway system.</p><p>The last area is services, such as water quality or waste disposal. There too, we have companies that are among the best in the world. But I would like to focus a moment on a sector that we have in common, which is sport. I am not referring to any specific French team. I talk, rather, of sport in general and about the major events Qatar is currently preparing to host. In the past, Qatar has already organized many of them. However, the one that awaits Qatar at the start of the next decade, the FIFA World Cup, is going to be a real challenge. In 1998, France organized the FIFA World Cup, too. We know from experience what the organization of such a competition implies. We ourselves are set to host the European Football Championship in 2016. When I say “we" it is of course all our services, teams, and companies that are ready to work in collaboration with you, and to respond to all your requests. You can join us now—with professionals of the highest rank—in the preparation of our European Championship in order to understand what organizing a FIFA World Cup means. And to see not only how to build a stadium, which is the minimum requirement, but also how to make the right choices in matters of transport, airports, hotels and other accommodation, and on the management of international events—the FIFA World Cup being one of the biggest.</p><p>We can do more. We must have principles: time, excellence, and mutual support. We must project ourselves in tomorrow's sectors. We need an idea to share in terms of experience and technology. I want to salute the initiative we have taken here. Firstly, to gather together the Qatari and French business leaders, as well as the creation of the Franco-Qatari Business Council, which will bring together over the long term the companies of our two countries. I thank the Qatari Minister for Trade, as well as the French Minister for Foreign Trade for taking the initiative. I expect this Council to assess all investment opportunities in both countries to facilitate trade, to feed the flow of exports, and to stimulate partnerships, because we must succeed. We must ensure continued solid political relations, a common vision of regional balance, and security cooperation. These considerations together have underpinned the excellent long-term relationship between our two countries. My hope is that it will support new trade and investment in the interests of both Qatar and France.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, on the Qatar-Japan Business Forum and bilateral trade.</h4>
<p>A month after the Great East Japan Earthquake struck, Sheikh Khalid Bin Khalifa Al Thani, the CEO of Qatargas, came all the way to Japan to assure us that, “Japan need not worry at all about getting an additional supply of natural gas.“ I can hardly imagine how truly relieved the Japanese side must have been upon hearing that.</p>
<p>Not only that, but he continued on, saying, “Japan is our foundation customer, which has strongly supported the economic development of Qatar. It is now our turn to continue to provide all the support we can.“</p>
<p>We were deeply touched by this. Indeed, I visited Qatar six years ago as Prime Minister. And, for a time, I worked for Kobe Steel. So I know a bit, limited though it may be, about the relationship between Qatar and Japan. In 1974, Qatar constructed a steelworks called Qatar Steel, and it was in fact Kobe Steel that came to be Qatar Steel’s partner in a joint undertaking. This undertaking was still in its early years when I graduated from university and started working for Kobe Steel. I remember that the building of the first integrated steel mill on the Arabian Peninsula came up as a subject at that time.</p><div class="quote">“  Qatar’s per capita GDP is more than double that of Japan. We rarely see such an affluent market. “</div>
<p>JOGMEC has just now newly concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Qatar Petroleum. While its objective is to reinforce cooperation in the areas of oil and natural gas, I am especially pleased at the fact that over the past 40 years, the resources and energy relationship between Qatar and Japan has been developed successfully.</p>
<p>Qatar and Japan have been growing side by side, so to speak, up to the present day. We have enjoyed a warm-hearted relationship with a compassionate human touch. I would like to take this opportunity to express once more our sincere gratitude for the heartfelt assistance given to us after the great earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011.</p>
<p>I recently visited Qatar for the first time in six years, and I was amazed at how dramatically the scenery has changed through the increase in the number of high-rise buildings. I have heard that in the coming months and years, as Qatar prepares to host the FIFA World Cup eight years from now, well more than JPY10 trillion of demand for infrastructure investment will be generated.</p>
<p>I also heard that in anticipation of this, in just the last few years, as many as 20 countries have newly entered into diplomatic relations with Qatar and launched embassies here.</p>
<p>Moreover, Qatar’s per capita GDP is more than double that of Japan. We rarely see such an affluent market. This is precisely why I recommend the Qatari people to enjoy a variety of Japanese food as well as our highly developed medical technologies and services, and why I would like to aim at Japan and Qatar living and prospering together. Cooperation has already begun between Medical Excellence Japan and Qatar’s Hamad General Hospital. Moreover, I believe Qatar is the best place where Japan’s regenerative medicine can come into widespread use here.</p>
<p>Another example is Japan’s vegetable factories. The highest level of technology in the world can successfully cultivate fresh lettuce in the midst of a parched environment. With one thing and another, I would like the people of Qatar to come to think, “the one who always comes through for us is none other than Japan. I intend to deepen the cooperation between Japan and Qatar across a broad range of areas such as political and security matters, economics, education, agricultural science, medical technologies and services, and culture and people-to-people exchanges, rather than having our relations stay limited to the area of energy. I intend to give relations between Japan and the Middle East a robust push forward, based on the three pillars of collaboration (al-ta’awun), coexistence and co-prosperity (al-ta’Äish), and harmony and tolerance (al-tasÄmuh).</p>

		<url><![CDATA[building-on-established-relations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Diplomatic relations between Italy and Qatar date back to the independence of the latter in 1971 and entered a new stage with the opening of embassies in Rome and in Doha in the 1990s. The dynamism of Qatar and the constant improvement and deepening of our relations with Doha have inspired the recent decision by the Italian government to expand our diplomatic activity there. In 2013, we opened a Trade Section and a Defense Attaché Office within the Embassy, which reflects the increase in trade turnover and Italy's economic presence in Qatar, combined with strengthened cooperation on defense, also made possible by the signature of an Agreement in 2010.<br></p><p>On the broad political front, 2012 was a significant year, with an official visit of HH the Father Emir (then in his capacity as Emir) Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani to Rome in April, followed by a mission to Doha of the Italian Prime Minister in November. And while 2013 was marked by important political transitions, both in Qatar and Italy, we are preparing the ground for an intense 2014, when we hope to maintain the frequency and level of exchanging visits. Remaining on the political front, it is important to recall that a number of agreements have been signed in the past, allowing businessmen and entrepreneurs of both countries to perform economic activity under the protection of international law.</p><p>In the context of intensified and constantly strengthened ties, our trade and economic cooperation has been developing over the years: we are proud that Italian companies have been chosen to realize a number of the chemical plants; similarly, we have opened new factories in the light industries sector. For three years, Italy has been a customer for Qatari LNG, thanks to the construction of a gas terminal with a considerable contribution by Qatar, whereas our export in 1H2013 has registered an increase of 20%, after growth of 34% from 2011 to 2012. Italian machinery and furniture, renowned the world over for its expert customization, have claimed a considerable slice of the Qatari market.</p><div class="quote">“A distinctive feature of Qatar in the context of the Middle East is the priority assigned to education, culture, and research. "</div><p>It is always very clear to me that Italy can do even more in Qatar. One of the slogans adopted in Doha runs: “Qatar deserves the best." Italy can actually deliver the best and share it with friendly nations. A distinctive feature of Qatar in the context of the Middle East is the priority assigned to education, culture, and research, fundamental directions that form the core of the Qatari National Vision for 2030. We are in the process of finalizing an agreement in these important sectors with the Qatari authorities; several limited projects and initiatives have already been launched and our specialists have been received with appreciation by the Institutions in Doha. It is up to both of us to keep this going by promoting contacts between our civil societies, and between universities and research centers.</p><p>Over the coming years, Qatar will be working intensely in order to meet the requirements of the Qatari National Vision 2030, while in the meantime laying the groundwork for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In this last regard, we are ready not only to engage our best companies in the building sector, but also to expand our presence in the field of tourism and in activities that maintain an operation as complex as a global sports event. Flows of visitors and football fans want to feel safe during their stay in Qatar and this can be achieved through technologies that we have perfected during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino. Moreover, Italy has developed an advanced legal and law enforcement structure in the context of working place security and accident prevention, and we could put into motion a real partnership with Qatar in preparing for the World Cup. The attention of many is focused today on these topics with reference to Qatar, and we feel we could effectively help Doha meet its objectives in terms of human rights protection in its policy towards foreign workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are behind the rapid development of Bahrain's industrial and commercial sectors?<br></h4><p>Bahrain has the most central location in the GCC region and is more outward looking and open minded toward the attaining of its economic, cultural, and technological development. Over the course of her long and colorful history, the Kingdom of Bahrain has served as a gateway between trading nations and civilizations. This is reflected in the attitudes of both people and government, as they strive to overcome obstacles concerning welfare, prosperity, and progress. Bahrain's drive toward industrialization and economic development testifies to this fact. Consistent, flexible, and rewarding programs were adopted in the late 1960s to establish and foster a viable industrial base. It was the first in the region to attract oil exploration investments and discovery and the first to achieve public education, health, social, and financial services. Lacking any sizable agricultural or oil resources prompted Bahrain's early embracing of economic diversification. Both the manufacturing and service sectors gained early attention and priority, and have consequently yielded the highest share of the nation's GDP and employment opportunities.</p><h4>Manama was named the Capital of Arab Tourism in 2013 and it hosted the International Conference on Exploring New Cultural Horizons for Tourism, receiving 6.7 million of visitors in 2011, almost 50% of them from Saudi Arabia. What role do you envisage for the sector in Bahrain as a stable growth driver?</h4><p>The Bahrain tourism strategy envisages the improvement and expansion of tourism infrastructure, facilities, and attractions, with the active participation and involvement of the private sector. The enlargement of the King Fahd causeway to Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries will be complemented by the new causeway connection to Qatar, and supported by the GCC railroad network. Such logistical improvements will easily double the tourism inflows to Bahrain.</p><h4>Bahrain is ranked the 12th most open economy worldwide by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal's 2013 Index of Economic Freedom. How does this promote the development of the economy and what actions for further openness do you plan?</h4><p>Bahrain is the most diversified economy in the Gulf region and has achieved this by maintaining an investor-friendly environment and adopting a policy of open markets. There is zero taxation, no exchange control, and 100% foreign ownership permitted in all activities. Bahrain is also undertaking serious and sound steps toward the materialization of its economic strategy and its Economic Vision 2030, through which it hopes to achieve competitiveness, sustainability, and fairness objectives. Moreover, Bahrain has the best legal and regulatory infrastructure in the region, and our new Commercial Companies Law will be one of the most progressive in the world—we most certainly have the most stable and supportive political environment and world-class infrastructure that provides good logistics in terms of communications and transport. Our workforce, which has been nurtured over the years by substantial government investment in the education and health systems, is healthy, educated, and willing, and we have also used our excellent foreign relations, such as with other GCC countries, the US, Singapore, and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries, to expand our internal market by means of FTAs.</p><div class="quote">“ Bahrain is the most diversified economy in the Gulf region.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were present when Qatar Airways inaugurated its Maputo-Doha service. How has the launch of that service signalled a new era of cooperation between Mozambique and Qatar?<br></h4><p>One of the key bottlenecks in Africa is logistics. The operational cost of transporting merchandise from point A to point B, and the time that merchandise is held at ports and airports, create barriers to progress. Therefore, it is both comforting and strategically convenient that both intra-African connections and connections between Africa and other regions of the world have become more fluid. The importance of having seven international airline companies present in Mozambique is of course that it not only connects Mozambique to the world in terms of opportunities for developing businesses, but it also contributes to a reduction in the operational costs that Mozambique faces. Prior to the presence of Qatar Airlines in the country, in order to visit any country in the Middle East, we would first be obliged to fly to Europe. Today, we enjoy a direct route to Doha. The same thing happened for us in Central Africa. We formerly had to fly to Europe and from there back to Africa. Today, we travel there on Kenya Airways. Ethiopian Airways and South African Airways connect us with North Africa. The internal connections in Africa generate business dynamics, and the private sector in Africa already has strategic partners, reducing the operational cost of developing new businesses in Africa and increasing the productivity of private companies, because it takes less time for their employees to move around, and also expedited logistic operations. On the other hand, the Middle East has become a platform connecting the financial markets. For the investments that this region has made, and for the region's capital accumulation arising from petroleum. And therefore, through Doha, we could establish a direct connection within a very short period of time. From Doha, we can connect to the rest of the Middle East and the Asian market.</p><h4>What can Mozambique learn from the way that Qatar has used its natural gas reserves for economic growth?</h4><p>President Guebuza visited Qatar at the invitation of the Emir. Qatar has opened itself to Mozambique and has passed much of its knowhow and knowledge regarding the oil and gas sector. A major part of our expertise in the oil and gas arena nowadays is due to openness, the transmission of know-how, and knowledge that Qatar has provided to Mozambique. We have a very good political and diplomatic relationship with Qatar, and these bonds have enabled us not only to gain knowledge about how Qatar has developed its economy from the oil and gas industry, but also created a direct connection through Qatar Airways from Maputo to Doha. In addition, many Mozambicans work in Qatar at the Mozal aluminum smelter. There are families of Mozambicans born in Qatar that went to work and had children there, who have enjoyed excellent conditions. Political and diplomatic relations between Mozambique, and Qatar will continue to bring the common objectives of the economic development of both nations to the fore.</p><div class="quote">“From Doha, we can connect to the rest of the Middle East and the Asian market.

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar is undergoing rapid growth, with GDP growing 18.8% over 2011, and further development expected in the future. In your opinion, which segments of the economy possess more potential for future development?<br></h4><p>Qatar's government is using its oil and gas revenues to diversify the economy and strengthen the non-oil sector in order to create a strong foundation for long-term and sustainable development. Winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup means that infrastructure expansion will support economic growth over the next decade. Furthermore, investments in a diverse range of sectors including healthcare, education, tourism, and financial services will ensure that recent gains can be sustained over the long term. The government's determination to expand its non-hydrocarbons sector is illustrated by its goal of fully financing the state budget from these revenues. As a result, we have seen strong growth for the non-hydrocarbon sectors compared to the oil and gas sector. Statistical indicators from the Qatar National Bank (QNB) showed that in 2012 the oil and gas sector growth rate was 1.7%, while the non-oil and gas sector's growth rate was about 10%. The highest growth rate was in the industrial manufacturing sector at 11.8%, followed by the government services sector at 11.5%. The growth rate for the transport and communications sector was 10.6%, while trade at restaurants and hotels was 7.7%, and finally the financial sector at 6.7%. According to the IMF, the non-hydrocarbon economy is expected to rise by between 9% and 10% until 2016.</p><h4></h4><h4>Qatar is investing its large revenues from oil and gas in other economic sectors in order to expand its economic base and develop a strong private sector. By following this strategy, how do you foresee Qatar's economy in the medium and long term?</h4><p>The country's long-term development plan seeks to transform the country into “an advanced society capable of sustaining its development and providing a high standard of living for all of its people." Through the Qatar National Vision 2030, Qatar's leadership has committed to investing its resources in its people and “in world-class infrastructure to create a dynamic and more diversified economy in which the private sector plays a prominent role." In addition, the government's long-term strategy places stability against volatile markets at the center of the country's development plan, with a comprehensive vision to balance growth and stability. It is worthwhile to emphasize that Qatar's extensive infrastructure developments have a key role to play in attracting investors to the country and supporting the government's bid to diversify sources of growth, while maintaining stability. Small- and medium-sized businesses are also earmarked for a key role in helping Qatar diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons and   boost the private sector's contribution to GDP. In the more immediate term, the first National Development Strategy 2011-16 (NDS) identifies priorities for the country and seeks to articulate specific actions and targets for each sector. The NDS calls for major investments in education, health, and research to help develop a knowledge-based economy that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>In order to attract foreign investment, Qatar offers a wide range of incentives, including subsidized or nominal rates for gas and electricity, and no import duty on machinery, among other benefits. What else is being done at the Ministry to place Qatar among the top destinations for foreign investment in the international arena?</h4><p>Qatar's government has established a favorable business environment, including active motivation and encouragement to the private sector to invest in viable economic industries. Qatar welcomes foreign participation in joint ventures or 100% fully owned firms through technology supply, market administration, and equity participation. Qatar allows 100% foreign ownership in nine key sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, health, tourism, the development and exploitation of natural resources, energy, and mining. The government offers several attractive incentives to foreign investors, such as natural gas priced at a nominal rate, electricity and water at a nominal rate, a developed infrastructure, and industrial land at a nominal rent starting at QAR10 per square meter per year, though this can differ from area to area and between the public and private sectors. On top of these, there are no customs duties on the import of machinery, equipment, and spare parts, and no export duties. In addition to the above, the government also offers other incentives including no quantitative quotas on imports, no income tax on the salaries of expatriates, and no exchange control regulations. In fact, the Qatari riyal is freely convertible at a rate of USD1:QAR 3.64, an exchange rate that has been stable for over two decades. Qatar also provides excellent medical and educational facilities, easy access to world markets with first-class air and sea connections, and excellent telecommunications facilities.</p><div class="quote">“  Qatar's extensive infrastructure developments have a key role to play in attracting investors to the country. "</div><p>Additionally, the  Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) offers foreign investors the opportunity to invest in the financial services industry. Financial firms operating in the QFC are free to operate in the domestic economy, being subject only to a 10% tax on locally sourced profits. The QFC allows companies to conduct business both inside and outside of Qatar, in local or foreign currency. As well, the QFC has been set up to provide for a world-class regulatory framework modelled on English common law and the regulations of other leading global finance centers.</p><h4>How would you characterize the legal environment in Qatar?</h4><p>The legal system is reasonably mature, with Emiri Decrees forming the basis of a relatively coherent body of modern statute law that remains in line with the principles of the sharia. Although 100% foreign ownership is allowed in certain sectors of the economy, in general this is restricted to 49%. In a bid to attract greater foreign investment, the legal system is being streamlined. In addition, Qatar aims to become a global center for international dispute resolution. The government has sought to improve transparency in the state, and in 2011 a corruption watchdog for state authorities was established.</p><h4>How is the tax environment developing in Qatar?</h4><p>In a bid to boost foreign investment, the government made the significant step of scrapping its 10%-30% tax structure at the end of 2009 and replacing it with a new 10% flat-rate corporate tax. Qatar is recognized for the ease of paying taxes in the country. Citizens from other GCC countries are treated as Qatari citizens for the purposes of tax law. The absence of personal income tax makes Qatar an attractive destination for expatriate workers.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the bilateral relations between Qatar and India?<br></h4><p>I believe Qatar to be one of India's closest friends in the Gulf region. The enlightenment, openness, and respect for diversity shown by the leaders of Qatar has contributed greatly to its rapid socio-economic development, making it a model for the region as a whole. Our relations with Qatar are part of our historical, cultural, and civilizational links with the Gulf region. This is a region of vital importance to us. It is home to 5 million Indians, and is also an important source of our energy requirements.</p><h4>To what extent do Indian citizens living in Qatar contribute to the Indian economy?</h4><p>Indians constitute the largest expatriate community in Qatar, numbering over 400,000. The Indian community in Qatar has earned a reputation for hard work, diligence, and great enterprise. The hard work of Indian citizens living and working in Qatar is contributing to our mutual prosperity. Their annual remittances of over $700 million to India are an invaluable contribution not only to their families in India, but also to society at large. The government is undertaking measures to facilitate this process. Our financing requirements for the infrastructure sector alone are estimated at $500 billion over the next five years.</p><h4>What is your outlook for growth in the Indian economy and what role can Qatar play in India's economic trajectory?</h4><p>The Indian economy rests on strong fundamentals. Since 2005, we have averaged 9% GDP growth per annum. Our development efforts have been positively impacting our substantial agriculture sector, which has registered growth of over 4%. The resurgence of our rural economy and a more inclusive and balanced growth model will, I am sure, create wealth for our people, and rid the ancient land of India of ignorance and disease. The current international economic and financial situation has clouded some of the near term growth prospects. I am, however, confident that the long-term outlook for our economy remains strong and robust. Our inherent strengths, the large size of our markets, the diversified industrial base we possess, and the strong and dynamic private sector will eventually allow us to return to a 9% growth trajectory. The current global financial crisis presents, in many ways, a rare window of opportunity for India and Qatar. The investment requirements of a large emerging economy like India and the vast financial surpluses of an energy rich economy such as Qatar can be married to create a win-win situation for both of our countries. Indian companies are also increasingly looking to invest in Qatar in such sectors as energy, construction, finance, and information technology.</p><div class="quote">“  The current global financial crisis presents, in many ways, a rare window of opportunity for India and Qatar.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Mozambique Stock Exchange (BVM) played in the country's economic growth over the past 14 years?<br></h4><p>The stock exchange, created to serve as an alternative means of financing the economy, was established in 1998, and began trading in 1999. Since its creation, it has seen the listing of 59 securities, with a capitalization of around MZN26 billion. Most of these have been debt securities that have already been amortized. Currently, we have 32 marketable securities on the bourse. Of those, 20 are bonds (11 from companies, and nine treasury bonds), and of the remaining securities, eight are commercial papers and three are stocks. The total capitalization of the stock exchange is MZN31.7 billion ($1.59 billion), which is equivalent to around 7% of Mozambican GDP. Another role for the stock exchange has been as an alternative to bank savings. This is important because it makes social inclusion more possible. It also makes possible the participation of the Mozambican people in the large-scale investments that are now sources. Yet, by opening up access to capital in the stock exchange, we enable Mozambican people to participate in these ventures.</p><h4>How is the BVM working with Mozambican companies to help them list?</h4><p>We visit Mozambican companies to explain the stock exchange to them and discuss the ways that they can adjust their structure and business practices to meet the listing requirements. We have had a very positive response from the companies we visit. There is considerable interest in both listing and investing, although for many companies this remains unfamiliar territory. We have also talked with certain international companies about setting up dual listings with both the BVM and those of their home markets.</p><h4>What is the benefit of using the stock exchange to obtain financing locally in Mozambique?</h4><p>The primary benefit for international companies is access to local financing for such key investments as the mineral resources sector. We understand that the necessary financing for these major investments is unavailable locally, meaning large companies need to obtain it beyond Mozambique. Utilizing the bourse enables them to obtain at least a portion of the financing internally. And while this is good for the foreign investor, it simultaneously contributes to the local economy. Internally sourcing financing is easier when you consider the exchange rate, as the financing comes in the form of the local currency, meticals.</p><h4>What role does financial education play in your work?</h4><p>Financial education is a priority for the stock exchange. We have developed a financial education program, and we are now contracting a company to help us develop a series of conferences and seminars to teach businesses and people about the stock exchange.</p><h4>What are the advantages of investing through the BVM for international investors?</h4><p>The primary advantage is that you can access the stocks of the listed companies as well as bonds. Currently, the interest rates for investors are quite attractive in Mozambique as the inflation rate is low. If you are investing in savings, as a foreigner, there are plenty of advantages owing to this higher interest rate. We are receiving feedback from brokers that foreign investors are looking for securities to invest in. If you invest in these through the stock exchange and register them, an exception in the exchange law allows you to repatriate the income, without any of the normal restrictions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent wave of investment coming into Mozambique, particularly in the coal and gas sectors, changed the role of the air travel business?</h4><p>The advent of coal and gas in Mozambique caught us almost unprepared. Luckily, due to the importance of tourism in the transport sector, Aeroportos de Moçambique (ADM) was already preparing a plan to sustain tourism. This was part of our 2025 agenda, which included the modernization of Maputo International Airport. We already had a plan in place for expansion to facilitate greater air travel capacity before significant coal and gas reserves were discovered. That being said, some aspects were not included in it. The need for an airport in Palma wasn't in our plans, for one, and neither was the need to rethink its location, because we didn't know at the time that there was coal beneath the airport. In the near future, we will also need an airport in Metangula, since coal has been discovered around Lake Nyasa.</p><h4>How were you able to adapt this to the 2025 plan?</h4><p>Nakawa was already part of the 2025 project, having been recognized as a strategic location. The renovation of Pemba Airport was also already a reality because of the area's important tourism status. The only component we really had to add was the airport in Palma, which is where the LNG plant will be developed, and where up to 10,000 people will be relocating to for the construction phase. The investors are a group concession comprised of Eni, Anadarko, and ENH. We have been approached to manage and operate the airport once completed. Currently, we are improving Mocí­mboa da Praia Airport allowing passengers to get within driving distance of Palma, which isn't more than 200 kilometers away. Anadarko has an operation in Mocí­mboa da Praia and wants to expand because the terminal and runway are too small to handle cargo aircraft.</p><h4>What adds to the significance of Maputo International Airport?</h4><p>The original project involved the renovation and expansion of the existing airport. However, we subsequently decided that a brand new airport was required; a truly modern facility, right through to the smallest detail, which is what we have today. Even the lighting system is almost completely natural. During the day, you don't need to flip a single switch. We also have the most modern facilities in terms of environmental standards, use of rainwater, and minimal emissions, among other things. We are all very proud of this airport, as should all Mozambicans be too.</p><div class="quote">“  The advent of coal and gas in Mozambique caught us almost unprepared. "</div><h4>What are the plans for Nacala Airport, and what role will it play in the system when upgraded?</h4><p>Nacala Airport is included in a strategic air transport plan that divides the country into three main areas: south, central, and north. This is a big country and traversing these areas takes at least an hour by air. For example, it takes more than an hour to get from Maputo to the north, meaning it is difficult for Maputo to support that part. That is why we have divided the country into three major areas for practical purposes. For example, if someone flies to Beira in central Mozambique, he or she can then access the rest of central Mozambique via a half-hour long flight. Similarly, Maputo covers the southern region, while Nacala covers the north. That is the first part of our domestic strategy. We also have a regional strategy for the east coast of Africa, including Cairo, Addis Ababa, and Nairobi. Between Nairobi and South Africa there is no other practical airport. Dar es Salaam is too close to Nairobi to be truly effective, as two hubs cannot coexist in close proximity. But from Nairobi to Nacala, it is almost a two-hour flight, and roughly another two-hour flight from Johannesburg to Nacala. The trend now in the air industry is for long haul planes to fly you into a major airport, from where the regional airlines fly you to smaller destinations. Regional flights are profitable only when they are less than an hour and a half in duration, since they use smaller planes. That is why Dar es Salaam will not succeed, and neither will Maputo, which is too close to Johannesburg. Our aim is to make Nacala an important hub in the future. Perhaps in 20 years, it will have even superseded Maputo. Meanwhile, Nampula, which is also in the same area, has certain constraints, namely its being surrounded by mountains. It's costly and expensive to expand an airport there, and there are bad weather and wind conditions because of the terrain, with considerable wind shear. In this regard, Nampula will remain a regional airport serviced by smaller aircraft. Nacala Airport will be ready by around June 2014. To put a new airport on the map is not easy. You have to make it known, get airlines to fly there, and make sure it is well connected to special economic zones. We are really doing something unique in terms of air transport development in Mozambique overall, and are achieving this thanks to solid leadership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the significance of Mozambique for South African Airways (SAA) developed over the time you have had operations here?</h4><p>The relationship between Mozambique and South Africa has evolved throughout the years by families living on both sides of the border, the movement of people in general, and politics; there have always been agreements. SAA has been here for many years. Up until 2006, SAA was represented in Mozambique by a general sales agent (GSA); however, in 2007 we decided to open our own branch. Now, we have a fully fledged branch with finance and sales and an operational side at the airport. This route has now become very important. Through that route, the relationship of the two governments and that of the two communities has evolved; therefore, it is important for the region and us in general. The first reason is this route is a feeder to our hub in Johannesburg. You have people coming from all over Mozambique into Maputo and connecting to Johannesburg. It is changing as other market dynamic impact on the route, but we still have business people who need to go to South Africa and Southern African territories, such as Cape Town and Durban and Lagos, Dakar, to mention just a few. Thus, we use this market to feed those routes. Other than that, we go can beyond Johannesburg in the region, such as to Luanda, Douala, or to West Africa, China, the US, or Europe. It is a very important route, and has to be looked after carefully. That is why we have Voyager, SAA's frequent flyer program. It is how we keep our customers flying with us. It is a good, profitable route, and important for the region and the country.</p><h4>How have the investments in gas and coal changed the market in Mozambique?</h4><p>Investment creates demand. In 2012, we had an influx of people coming from Brazil into Mozambique because of Vale, for example. In our case, we influenced and assisted the market by bringing these people easily and comfortably into Maputo through our subsidiaries and partner airlines. These investments will assist the market to grow. It will also spur competition, which is good. New companies come because there is oil and gas. They also know many people need to travel and commute quickly. It has reached the stage where investment comes and drives the market. If you look to business people, they talk about oil and gas, and what they can do to assist or be part of oil and gas industry. We are not against that, we are actually very close to it, in such a way that we are looking into expanding our services.</p><h4>There has been an influx of new airlines coming into Mozambique in recent years. What distinguishes SAA from the newer airlines in the market?</h4><p>We have been in Mozambique for many years. We have for the 11th consecutive year been awarded the best airline in Africa. This sets us apart from the others because of our service. SAA has a four-star rating. The best aspect of the award is that it is the passengers who vote. SAA is also the best on-time airline in Africa. We have better and fresher products. An area where we can actually move and be closer to the competition is when it comes to partnering. One of the best partners in the airline industry is LAM. We have a code share agreement with it among others whereby we offer additional services to our customers to get to their destination. This means that they don't have to go to three or four ticketing offices to buy their ticket. They buy one ticket and get their accumulated miles and benefits.</p><div class="quote">“  Investment creates demand. In 2012, we had an influx of people coming from Brazil into Mozambique because of Vale. "</div><h4>What role is SAA playing in connecting the world's Lusophone countries?</h4><p>We have a motto, “Bringing the World to Africa and taking Africa to the world." That is our strategy. Being an African airline, our hub is in Johannesburg, and we take people to all destinations, connecting them through Johannesburg to Brazil, India, and Angola, for example. The idea was to choose some of the destinations and connect our passengers to where they want to go. If you look at it only at an international level, outside of Maputo, we connect everyone through Johannesburg to 900 destinations in the world. We fly to 26 destinations in Africa. Through our code shares, we are looking at even more destinations. Therefore, we will do our utmost to take our passengers to those countries and partner other carries to destinations we do not operate; hence, reaching places such as Cape Verde, Lisbon, and Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, whenever there is a demand and it makes a sense businesswise.</p><h4>Do you welcome a more competitive market in Mozambique?</h4><p>With competition, you really need to be there; competition is important. When you have competition, you innovate. We are pleased with the route to Brazil. Innovation means you have to continually look after the customer. We have just introduced the new A320-200, which has extra space and is more luxurious, which makes our customer happier. The market is still growing and more competition will come. There will be a larger appetite for Mozambique because there will be more investment and opportunities. In the last week of October 2013, we transported approximately 1,800 people on 17 flights into Maputo alone, which is our entire capacity. There is still an opportunity, and we need to continue innovating.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[beira-calling]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role of the Port of Beira in Mozambique's logistics sector?<br></h4><p>The Port of Beira is the second largest port in Mozambique by most metrics. It differs from Maputo, the number one, or Nacala, which is the number three, in that its main role is as a transit port. It has historically been used by Zimbabwe to access the sea. Its construction began in 1929, and 65%-70% of traffic at the port was transit cargo up until 2009. From that point, the Mozambican economy began to pick up, and then with the addition of coal traffic, and the problems in Zimbabwe, Mozambican cargo has taken on a much bigger role. Malawi has also slowly started to take care of the transit cargo deficit at this port, and is actually doing quite well. Zambia is a great market with considerable potential, but still has very strong commercial connections with South Africa. We are seeing them slowly return to Beira for the transportation of copper, sugar, tobacco, and fertilizer imports.</p><h4>Does the port have sufficient capacity to meet growing demand?</h4><p>The existing container terminal, which was built and started operations in 1992, is designed for 100,000 TEUs. At the same terminal last year we handled 170,000 TEUs, so you can appreciate the pressure. Over the past 12 years the average rise in general cargo has been 12-15%, while for the container terminal it has been 15%. We forecast major traffic increases over the next decade, and so we need to undertake massive investments. This includes, for example, constructing a completely new 600-meter quay, as well as the construction of the new fertilizer terminal, and a mineral terminal, and the upgrading of other existing terminals, and expansion of the existing container terminal. The new fertilizer terminal will allow us to increase the bulk fertilizer we handle from around 1,500 to 2,000 tons per ship per day to 7,000 to 8,000 tons per ship per day. Unfortunately, transportation is insufficient to cope with the off-loading capacity of ships. A docked vessel costs around $40,000 to $50,000 a day in demurrage. The coal terminal is not part of our concession agreement, but Vale and Rio Tinto have requested us to operate it for strategic reasons.</p><h4>What trends can you detect in the Mozambican economy based on changing shipping patterns at the port?</h4><p>There is a massive impact on the agricultural sector in both imports and exports. In terms of the amount of fertilizer being imported via Beira, in 2009 we used to handle not more than 70,000 tons per year, but in 2013 we will have easily reached 650,000 tons. With the fertilizer terminal my expectation is that in 2015 we will have comfortably arrived at the 1 million ton mark. Construction of the terminal will be done in 2014 and in 2015 it will commence operation. I want to see the 1 million ton mark in Beira, because the region handles around 1.5 million tons per year. The other side of the equation is exports, such as maize, white sisal, cotton, and tobacco. Out of the 650,000 tons that I mentioned before, roughly 60,000 tons is destined for Mozambique, with the sugar industry receiving its share. We have also seen a 20% annual rise in clinker imports over the past four years, which signals increased cement production in Mozambique, as is readily reflected in construction projects nationwide. Another point of reference I can provide is tobacco from Malawi. Until 2004 the Port of Beira had transported 2.5% of Malawi's tobacco. Nacala Port used to take 17.5%, while the remaining 80% was shipped via South African ports. In stark contrast, we are now moving 82%-83% of Malawian tobacco.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's progress in terms of technology adoption?<br></h4><p>Mozambique's progress has been nothing short of remarkable, although the majority of the population does not recognize this fact. For example, in the area of ICT, it is known that even in the most remote areas illiterate people are using cell phones; there has also been a marked improvement in the expansion of e-government in the various districts of the country over the past five years. Biotechnology is being talked about extensively, and with increased mining activity, cutting-edge technologies for the extraction of ores have been brought into use. This said, there is still a large part of the population that utilizes rudimentary technology to carry out, among other things, agriculture- and livestock-related activities.</p><h4>What role can science and technology play in the economic development of Mozambique?</h4><p>Countries that are economically developed today are like this because they invested in science and technological innovation. The use of scientific models for solving day-to-day problems, plus appropriate technology for these purposes, has room to grow, such as, for example, in the sector of agriculture and livestock, decreasing exports, and increasing imports, which will lead to an increase in the gross domestic product of the country. Without a doubt, the development of Mozambique is linked to its investment in scientific research and in human resources training. Through the creation and rapid diffusion of knowledge based on scientific research, technological progress, and social experience, science and technology have become the main drivers of change in both developed and developing nations. In the emerging knowledge economy, ICT is a key component of its development, driven by knowledge, particularly in the growing service industries and global markets. We believe that the development of this socio-economic pearl of the Indian Ocean not only depends on the allocation of resources, but on the level of knowledge or research that Mozambicans, particularly the new generation, can accomplish. For us, innovation must be the engine of Mozambique's socio-economic development. At the microeconomic level, innovation can increase companies' productivity and profitability and positively change market sizes. At the macroeconomic level, it should improve the level of income and employment, and access regional and international markets. Therefore, for Mozambique to achieve its desired socio-economic development, we must urgently go for approaches that emphasize a knowledge-based economy, in which the synergies of relationships between education and research institutions, and private industry and government, are increasingly important. The primary role of the government of Mozambique is the creation of a favorable environment for scientific and technological development. The manufacturing sector, comprising private and public companies, has the task of acting as the fulcrum of innovation.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of the Maluana Science and Technology Park for Mozambique's technological development?</h4><p>This park is a symbol of awareness of a need for the country to develop science and technology. Such parks provide a medium for the creation of infrastructure and appropriate space in one locale for cutting-edge research, education, incubation, entrepreneurship, innovation, and technological development. This is a first for the country, and, due to the size of Mozambique, there is a need for additional parks in other parts of the country to enable integrated development. It is also a challenge because we need this first experience to yield results to justify the investment made so that other Science and Technology Park initiatives can be achieved. The Maluana Science and Technology Park, at a distance of 60 kilometers north of Maputo, has great significance for Mozambique's technological development since this complex will enable the development of scientific research, promote innovation and the development of human capital, and the establishment of incubators and technology-based commerce. If we align the activities of higher education, scientific research, and innovation institutions that will determine the generation and accommodation of technology-based businesses, as well as products and services that may also have applications beyond Mozambique, then there is excellent potential here. This park also includes activities related to research in areas such as biotechnology and ethno-botany. It is in this park where infrastructure important for the economic and social life of the country will be located, such as the data center, which will serve not only the government, but also the national and foreign private sector.</p><div class="quote">“  It is necessary to ensure that scientists located in research institutions produce knowledge that is geared toward the production of food. "</div><h4>What efforts is the government making to meet the challenges that Mozambique faces in terms of technological infrastructure?</h4><p>Government efforts to meet the challenges of technological infrastructure that Mozambique faces are based on the promotion of a program of support and the creation of science and technology infrastructure, aimed at consolidating and qualifying the supply of technologies and services. In terms of the physical infrastructure and equipment components, creating expansion projects or the rehabilitation of existing technological infrastructure may also be considered on an exceptional basis to develop physical infrastructure. This could comprise specific buildings and facilities for common use, as well as lab equipment, and others, enabling the development of expertise in technological areas relevant to the competitiveness of companies and/or the diffusion of knowledge. We seek to promote the consolidation of science and technological infrastructure to avoid the duplication of entities with overlapping objectives, while also promoting the inclusion of this infrastructure in regional and international networks. The efforts of the government include the adaptation, renewal, upgrading, and expansion of scientific equipment and the infrastructure of scientific and technological institutions, including the remodeling or upgrading of scientific infrastructure to promote safety and energy efficiency. The efforts of the Ministry of Science and Technology can be seen through a number of initiatives such as the Millennium Villages, an integrated development program based in impoverished communities operating on the principle that scientific knowledge can foster economic and social development. There are numerous examples of institutions involved in this research, such as the Center for Research and Development in Ethno-Botany (CIDE), the Center for Research and Transfer of Technologies for Community Development (CITT), Maluana Science and Technology Park, Community Multimedia Centers (CMCs), the Umbelúzi Centre for Research and Transfer of Agricultural Technologies (CITTAU), the Xai-Xai Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, and the National Center of Biotechnology and Bioscience (CNBB).</p><h4>What are your policy priorities over the coming year?</h4><p>The great challenge comes from the need to transform science, technology, and productive innovation into the primary driving force in our efforts to eradicate poverty in Mozambique. In this context we believe it is necessary to ensure that scientists located in research institutions produce knowledge that is geared toward the production of food. Special attention should be given to the improvement of productivity, production, and post-harvest technology and the issue of water resources, and to ensuring that knowledge is available, affordable, and easily transferable to the market, especially rural communities with higher rates of poverty. Our main priorities can be broken down into the following: human resources, infrastructure and facilities, knowledge transfer, and improved legislative regulation of technology-related activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Meridian 32 Group's sectoral focus developed over the past decade?<br></h4><p>Meridian 32 has always had a real estate focus, but the activity you see today in Mozambique's real estate sector is a recent phenomenon. The growth that we have had since 2011 completely dwarfs that of the previous 20 years. When we started focusing on real estate here in 2000, it was a very different time. Every year we add a fresh component to our portfolio, but in general, we are keeping to a broad-based consulting practice. It is difficult to specialize in Mozambique, because you lack  critical mass. We started with accounting work, which then shifted into outsourcing. We prepare everything from accounting to invoicing, payroll processing to debt collection and account management. We have also expanded into the downstream petroleum sector, and are now advising the Petromoc board on strategic projects. In around 2008 we acquired an environmental practice that conducts environmental impact, water quality, and waste pollution assessments.</p><h4>Which of these segments is most important for your business?</h4><p>Real estate is obviously important for us because we arose from it. We are one of the few organizations in the country capable of providing full real estate solutions with the exception of construction. We have no ambition to be a construction company, but in the real estate value chain we perform everything else from finding land, to carrying out environmental assessments, managing the architectural and engineering aspects of the project, running the tender, supervising the construction, and ultimately selling the property if the client wishes to do so. Additionally, our public relations arm manages all communication concerns, and we have released a number of publications.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the real estate market in Mozambique?</h4><p>We expect the number of apartments and offices to grow exponentially over the next two to three years. We see demand and supply as being unevenly matched, but closely correlated. Overall, I see real estate as an extremely promising sector in which to invest, and in particular the retail segment, much overlooked thus far. The country is grossly under-retailed. I am not referring to 40,000-50,000 sqm shopping centers, but rather to community centers in the range of 3,000-7,500 sqm that sell low-cost goods and fresh produce to locals without electricity.</p><div class="quote">“  The price of construction in Mozambique is very high and is an area of concern that the government should tackle. "</div><h4>Do you expect the growth of the market to come from expatriates or Mozambicans?</h4><p>Let us look at the segments one by one. Three years ago our company employed just 25 people, but now we have a staff of 60. We are now looking to move into a  more modern office, and I think there are many SMEs in a similar position. There is not only foreign-driven growth in evidence. Companies like our own, which are 100% local, are not associated with larger groups at this point in time; we do not have a KPMG or Jones Lang LaSalle brand, but are a homegrown company. The issue for SMEs is financing, however. In terms of foreign-driven growth, multinationals that have been here for a long time like BP, Total, and PwC, are all growing at a rate of 20% a year, so it is clear that they will soon need more space. The residential segment to date has been primarily driven by expatriate demand, which is understandable, as we do not yet have a fully stable economy. There is still significant risk, and people still associate Mozambique with it, and look for somebody that has guaranteed income. Unfortunately, very few Mozambicans have had that up until today. There has been limited lower- and middle-class housing built, but over the past year we have seen the government focus on affordable housing.</p><h4>What is the main challenge constraining growth of the residential segment?</h4><p>The price of construction in Mozambique is very high and is an area of concern that the government should tackle. Construction costs need to be managed. It is beyond comprehension why costs in say, Nelspruit, just 200 kilometers away, are 60% of the prices here. We cannot understand this because duties are relatively low on construction materials, at about 2.5% to 7.5%. In general, though, costs are declining. The dynamics are also changing with the increasing presence of Chinese and Indian firms. They have access to materials and manpower at one-third the cost of Western manpower. Previously, the sector was dominated by the Portuguese and South Africans, but these new players are looking to build massive estates of 4,000 or 5,000 units. Other groups continue to build for the expatriate community, which is another expanding segment.</p><h4>Do you expect major international retail developers to enter Mozambique soon?</h4><p>Retail is a particularly high-risk sector, and so is primarily driven by large developers. I'm expecting to see Middle Eastern companies and brands dominated by South African and Chinese firms. This will not be retail development as in the Middle East or Europe, but rather will target all 25 million Mozambicans. Those people have perhaps three or four dollars to spend every day.</p><h4>What is the number one challenge for a foreign investor coming to Mozambique?</h4><p>I think that once you define your opportunity, the main issue here is getting finance from local sources. However, being denominated in meticais this is both expensive and risky, and hence off-putting to many investors. Also, many of the local banks have low capitalization and cannot lend more than 20% of their shared capital value to any single borrower. The banks may need to form a consortium, or to bring in money from the foreign bank's head office. The second issue lies in the ongoing process of shifting the national mentality away from the socialism of two decades ago. Thirdly, there is the human capital issue. It is relatively difficult to find and retain qualified, capable staff at the right salary level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Mozambique fit into Cargill's global business plan?<br></h4><p>Cargill is one of the world's leading food and agriculture companies, and for almost 150 years we have been involved in agriculture supply chains—from working alongside farmers, right through to supporting manufacturers to deliver their products to the market. In short, what we do is move food from areas of surplus to areas of deficit. Cargill has made a concerted decision that it wants to increase its investments in Africa over the next five years. Mozambique was one of the countries that really came to the foreground. Its projected GDP is among the top five in the world in growth terms, and seven of the top-10 countries are in Africa. We see great potential in Mozambique. Cargill has had a relationship with the country over many years, and in the past 12 months we established our operations in the country with a view to growing our business. Today, in the country, most farming is done by small-scale, non-commercial farmers. We believe there are opportunities to support growth in Mozambique's agricultural sector. Our goal is to link small- and medium-size farmers in the supply chain, by providing these local farmers with better access to markets to sell their crops at a fair and reliable price, provide support to increase crop yields and quality, and stimulate growth toward more commercial production.</p><h4>What are the challenges that smallholder farmers are facing in Mozambique, and how is Cargill supporting them?</h4><p>In Mozambique we are working closely with smallholder farmers to improve productivity, access crop inputs, and enable them to have better access to markets to sell their crops through a transparent pricing framework. By providing farmers with reliable buyers that pay fair prices, it provides security to farmers and encourages more production. The market will rather be stimulated by a demand-pull situation rather than a supply-push. We need to buy the crop, educate on better quality standards and thresholds, and provide access to better inputs, such as improved seed varieties. The average yield for maize is roughly one ton per hectare. Let's assume, on average, farmers can sell their maize for $200 per ton. If they could possibly increase their yields to three tons per hectare, their incomes will be tripled. However, some farmers want to expand and become commercial farmers, and we need to help them to have a greater opportunity to achieve this ambition. That's the model; however, start-up costs are high. If it costs $25 million for a 10,000-hectare commercial farm and an estimated return on investment (ROI) of close to 10 years, people want some kind of security. There is an amazing opportunity here for the agricultural sector. There are approximately two million farmers here already, but each is farming a single hectare. We have to get the balance right in order to bring farmers to the next level with a right mix of commercial and smallholder farming.</p><h4>What role has your work with the Aga Khan Foundation and the Agrarian Institute of Bilibiza (IAB) played in your presence in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation to support the IAB is very aligned with our longer-term aim to help support agricultural production and a future generation of commercial farmers in Mozambique. Our $1.35 million, three-year partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation will enable the IAB to improve its teaching capabilities and to reach more local student farmers. The IAB will train up to 400 students a year with relevant agricultural technical and entrepreneurial skills. Cargill pledged our support for the G8 New Alliance for Food and Nutrition Security and the Grow Africa partnership. We believe these efforts will facilitate critical policy discussions and commitments to accelerate investment and transformative change in African agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[science-naturally]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the importance for your university of international partnerships, such as the agreement with the Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University?</h4><p>I must say that after Mozambique's independence, Eduardo Mondlane University was a more teacher-focused university, as the priority at that time was teacher training. In that period, most of the lectures were given by foreigners who generally came to teach in Mozambique. In the 1990s, we realized that we could try something different, through cooperation with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and also certain donor agencies, such as NORAD from Norway and DANIDA from Denmark. These organizations have helped the university to build the critical mass in terms of projects and in terms of Master's programs. At the moment, we consider this continuing international cooperation vital for the university, as it makes us more international and builds our capacity. The international population is key, and we have several bilateral arrangements with foreign institutions. We also have multilateral agreements through different agencies. I evaluate our current situation as good, but believe it could be further improved.</p><h4>How do you go about selecting institutions for collaboration?</h4><p>We carefully consider our priorities and act on that knowledge. Today, we are looking more to universities that can support us in terms of post-graduate studies. We could probably be more pro-active in this endeavor; some come to us because of our reputation, but it might be an idea to seek out partners ourselves. China will become a more important destination for students, but currently Australia and Brazil are popular choices.</p><h4>How has the growth of the gas and mining industries in Mozambique influenced peoples' choices in terms of higher education?</h4><p>I think we realized that we were somewhat lacking in momentum. Until recently, Eduardo Mondlane was probably the only university that offered courses related to mining, namely our geology course. When the gas and coal boom occurred, we were not prepared for the increased demand for relevant courses. Therefore, we are now trying to make up for lost time. We are working on a strategic plan for geo-scientists and engineers to meet demand. This will involve a considerable investment, with more infrastructure and human resources being needed. Although the boom is here, the response is not yet at an adequate level, and will be noticeable over the next few years. We are currently teaching our first petroleum engineering MA students, who are set to graduate in 2015. Then, many of these will themselves be ready to teach undergraduates. We are developing an MA training course with Anadarko, but there are also proposals to organize courses for people already working in mining.</p><div class="quote">“  We have around 30,000 candidates each year, but can admit just 4,000. "</div><h4>Many people say that there is not currently much emphasis given to natural sciences in tertiary education in Mozambique. Would you agree?</h4><p>This is indeed true. Of the entire university population, probably 70% or 80% have opted for social sciences or humanities. This is largely because secondary education itself lacks emphasis or the means to teach natural sciences. To counter this apparent lack of interest we plan to launch a scheme of “open days" where school-aged students can come to understand that science is also a study option in a graduate and post-graduate setting. We also provide scientific equipment to certain affiliated schools. The Ministry, too, is currently providing kits to these schools, so that school children can at least encounter equipment such as microscopes at an early age.</p><h4>How does Eduardo Mondlane face the logistical challenge of educating people across a wide and varied terrain?</h4><p>This is a major problem we have to contend with. We have around 30,000 candidates each year, but can admit just 4,000. We do have the capacity in some areas to reach people living remotely from Maputo through distance education. And yet, while we leverage online learning, internet connection is not as reliable as we would like, which is a further handicap for the entire system. A medium-term solution will therefore involve an increased number of internet providers. On the other hand, while online study is a partial solution regarding the social sciences, it is not the be all and end all where natural sciences are concerned, as students need to physically be present at our facilities. We have fewer than 100,000 students for a population of 20 million, which is clearly not enough.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) currently acts as a partner rather than an operator in Mozambican oil and gas concessions. How do you see this changing in the future?<br></h4><p>The goal of ENH is to become an operator in Mozambique's oil and gas business within 20 to 40 years. Over the course of that period, Mozambique will gain the technology and human resources necessary to assume field operations. Another area of interest is marketing, and we plan to champion the marketing of Mozambican gas.</p><h4>What is ENH doing to facilitate that knowledge transfer?</h4><p>We have 11 concessions in Mozambique, and ENH has shared in each along with international companies. In these joint ventures, there are committees that complete the technical review of information. We also hold operating committee meetings, which is where all decisions are made. Looking at the way we are structured, in one concession we have more than one partner—up to three or four. With this amount of interaction we can really learn a lot. In the case of Rovuma, where ENI is the operator, one of the international partners is Kogas, which has extensive experience in LNG as a seller in addition to its shipping business. Its knowledge is being transferred to certain entities internally. People from ENI come here and go through the process, and we also send people to ENI's technical academy for a year or two. We have people in Portugal, too, at Galp Energia Academy, which has been heavily involved in Brazil and Angola. We are also looking for experience from all over the world. We ask ourselves: How did Petrobras grow? How did Sonagas get to the level that it is at today? We are learning from those models and are pleased with the progress being made.</p><h4>How would you compare the way that Mozambique is developing its hydrocarbon reserves to the way it has been done in other countries?</h4><p>We came in early, starting production 10 years ago with just one small field. Today, we have more than 100 tcf of natural gas, which means that we have enough natural resources for four to five generations. This is in contrast to Angola, where Sonagas was given the blocks when the 40-year concessions of international companies expired. It started at the end, and had 30 years of production and experience. So the question now is: how do you strategically position yourself to have relevance? The relevance does not come from the resource sitting in the ground; it comes from how it is used. Mozambique is a long, narrow country with 2,400 kilometers of coastline. If you build east-west infrastructure, it becomes easy to connect to the markets of the interior: Malawi, Zambia, and South Africa. These markets will either need energy from Mozambique, or else natural gas to build their own small industries. Then, there is talk of having four LNG trains, which could produce up to 20 million tons per year for international export. For example, Qatar now produces around 47 million tons. We could produce almost 50% of what Qatar is currently managing. A country can become globally and regionally relevant with its resources, and, consequently, access to finance for the country improves. Agriculture, which is the main driving force of the country's economy, will also receive a boost. When you have all these projects combined, you see more people coming in, you have internal needs to meet, and you improve the production of your crops. The sustainable management of resources leads to the economic development of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Big Dig to Invest]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-big-dig-to-invest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mozambique within the portfolio of projects you manage across Africa, Asia, and Australia?<br></h4><p>The core business for Vale in terms of mining is iron ore, copper, nickel, fertilizers, and coal. In the coal sector, Mozambique ranks first and holds the key mining reserve, and this will certainly be our largest operation. We have a current capacity of 11 million tons of coking and thermal coal and are already in the process of expanding this to 22 million tons per year. This will transform it into one of the largest operations in terms of high quality hard coking coal. And for us, it marks an important sign of consolidation and growth of both our business in coal, and of the mining industry itself.</p><h4>How do operations in Mozambique compare to the other coal operations that Vale runs in the region?</h4><p>In Africa, our main presence is in Mozambique, and we have limited business in Zambia through joint ventures. We have also been active in Guinea, Liberia, and DRC, and have some exploration projects in other countries. However, in terms of a comprehensive operation, our main presence in Africa is the Moatize mine in Mozambique. Indeed, this is from where Vale really entered Africa and decided to develop a large presence. We arrived in Mozambique in 2005, having won the international tender for the Moatize mine, and commenced implementation in 2007. Mozambique is  one of our most important experiences in Africa, and we are pleased to have overcome numerous challenges thus far.</p><h4>In 2013, you faced a number of logistical challenges and were forced to lower your annual coal export estimates. Should investors be concerned?</h4><p>Infrastructure, aside from the mine itself, is the key in making mining feasible. We knew the challenges from the start, and we have pursued several logistical alternatives. We are currently using the Sena Line as a temporary solution, whereby we export around 4 million to 5 million tons per year. However, our permanent solution will be the Nacala Line, the construction of which we have invested in and through which we will start exporting in 2015. The capacity-related challenges we have been facing, and not only with the railways, but also with Beira Port, are familiar ones, and the government is working hard to fulfill the requirements of the industry and there are some improvements being registered.</p><h4>What is the current status of the Nacala Line?</h4><p>We have more than 11,000 people working on the site, which goes from Tete through Malawi to Nacala. We have started construction on all fronts. Of the 900 kilometer line, almost 600 kilometers are brownfield and around 250 kilometers are greenfield. The greenfield line will be ready in 2014, and the brownfield line will take an additional two years to upgrade, although we will commence exports in 2015 as we upgrade those portions of the line. Our target is to reach a minimum 22 million ton capacity per year by 2017, and we are on track to realize this. All contractors are in place and working across the related sectors. We have also been well supported by the local government, and not just of Mozambique, but also Malawi. Meanwhile, we are building a deepwater port in Nacala-a-Velha capable of loading Cape-sized vessels, crucial for our industry in order to be competitive in the international maritime cargo market.</p><h4>How will Vale's logistical investments in northern Mozambique benefit the broader economy?</h4><p>The one critical aspect of the Nacala Railway Line investment is the inclusiveness of the project. It is not exclusively dedicated to coal, not even for Vale, making it a project that other players and mining companies can access, from sectors as diverse as agriculture, forestry products, general cargo, and public transportation. Nacalais poised to become an economic platform, not only for Mozambique and Malawi, but also the Southern African Development Community (SADC). That certainly makes it an important economic and development platform for the region itself.</p><h4>How is Vale contributing to the economy through employment and training?</h4><p>Our priority is to hire local people, and not only during the construction phase, in which almost 90% of the workforce is local, both here and in Malawi. We are also working to train and develop people for the future. Today, we employ 2,000 people at our Moatize mine operation, of which almost 90% are locals, at all levels. And, after years of operation, we are particularly happy to have reached this level of national employees given the time it takes to train people. We have found people well prepared in terms of basic education, and we're happy to be taking on young people with bright futures. We also have a policy of working with local companies wherever possible. Sometimes, the main contractors may be foreign, but when they arrive they require local partnerships. In terms of our investment, more than $1 billion has been paid to local companies, which means considerable opportunity for local people and local firms.</p><h4>How is Vale contributing to more sustainable development?</h4><p>Our mission is to transform natural resources into sustainable development, and through this ideal we believe we are well on our way in Mozambique, as well as the region. We are taking care of the environment, providing people with opportunities, and involving society in the entire process. All of our core operations are carried out in collaboration with the local and state government, and also in partnership with other stakeholders. We used to say that we had a Brazilian accent, but now we are a Mozambican company and proud to be fulfilling our goals and overcoming challenges. If you go to Catembe, for example, you'll see how people have gained opportunities and, through entrepreneurship, are working in a sustainable way and generating economic activity. Doubtless we still have much to do; it is a process after all. If you go to Chad today and compare it to five or 10 years ago you can see how the industry is giving people opportunities and developing the region. Of course, the challenge is to ensure sustainable government. With efficient government budget allocation, I have no doubt that the region and the country is destined to profit enormously from these natural resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently completed the pre-feasibility study for the Tete pig iron project. How would you characterize the results of the study?<br></h4><p>The results outlined a compelling commercial case for the development of a vertically integrated, mine-mouth operation, smelting 1 million tons per annum of pig iron with associated ferro-vanadium. In doing so, we are able to unlock significant project value through the beneficiation of raw materials in country. Pig iron, incidentally, is used along side scrap iron in electric arc furnaces [EAFs] to produce steel products. EAFs account for roughly 30% of global steel production; in areas such as the Middle East, they account for 100% of production. The pre-feasibility study modelled a 37-year mine life that exploited just 15% of our 727 million ton iron ore resource, clearly demonstrating project longevity as well as scope for ramping up production. As part of the study, we ran the numbers at 2 million tons per annum, which further improved the underlying fundamentals and demonstrated the scalability of the project. The project is located in one of the most exciting emerging mining and industrial jurisdictions of southern Africa with unique access to power, water, and abundant coal reserves—all the key commodities for iron and steel making. The technology the company plans to use requires, along with iron ore, a significant amount of thermal coal; thermal coal that is being produced as a wash by-product in the immediate vicinity and, due to infrastructure and market constraints, is being re-buried as waste at considerable cost. Access to our captive iron ore, with mining strip ratios averaging just 0.4 over the first 20 years of operation, and very low-cost coal, will result in low quartile production costs of around $225 per ton of pig iron free on board (FOB). This compares particularly favourably to an FOB cost of production of around $385 in Brazil, one of the world's largest suppliers of merchant pig iron. At our cost of production, we are able to deliver a ton of pig iron to a north China port for around $250, whereas domestic operating costs are estimated at close to $400 per ton. This margin will enable Tete pig iron to compete across the global sea-borne pig iron market and, if push came to shove, with scrap iron prices. It will also open up new markets where merchant pig iron has simply not been competitive in the past—neighboring regions like the Middle East for example. Baobab has embarked on a bankable feasibility study, which should be concluded during 3Q2014. Areas of key perceived risk have been prioritised for completion, including measured resource drilling, pilot scale test work, environmental and community studies, as well as submitting various licence applications and opening discussions on tax treatment. We are also in the process of formalizing the project's port, rail, and power requirements, the last of which we are working along side Mozambique's energy utility, EDM, on an option study. We are also working closely with our joint venture partners, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), on community and enterprise development initiatives—an operation of this scale will have a profound local and regional impact. During the BFS, we will be looking at the potential of unlocking additional value by taking the project that last step down stream to steel production. We are strategically poised to play a central role in the nascent development of this part of Africa, supplying the region's unrelenting demand for steel.</p><h4>How do you confront the logistical challenges that come with operating in Mozambique?</h4><p>The question is whether or not we will have access to 1 million tons per annum of rail capacity by the end of 2016. The expansion on the Sena Line to 18 million tons and the Nacala Corridor to 22 million tons per annum will go a long way toward addressing regional capacity issues. I have seen first hand the refurbishment and expansion works on both corridors and I am confident that the development timelines and our requirements will be met. We are in discussions with both the government and the private sector on formalizing contracts. Pricing is sensitive, but our op-ex margins are such that we can afford to carry more in transport costs. We could use trucks (some of the coal operators do), but logistically that means having 70 trucks a day on the road, which is not a particularly ­attractive scenario.</p><h4>The Tete pig iron project is one of five assets in Baobab's portfolio. Do you plan to develop your other projects through joint ventures?</h4><p>Yes and no. As a publicly listed company, our investors are investing in Baobab for the Tete pig iron project; Tete is our most advanced asset and takes about 95% of our time and investment. However, Baobab has other great assets and the company has to find ways of systematically advancing them; we are in joint venture with Metals of Africa, which is developing our greenfield Changara base metals project; we are entering into a joint venture with Auroch on our copper, gold, and nickel project in Manica. At the same time, we are also on the lookout for opportunities that will add value and are currently looking into a magnetite/phosphate licence immediately adjacent to our Tete project. Ultimately, we are in Mozambique to develop mineral resources and joint venture partnerships are often the best way to share the technical and capital load. We are well established in the country, having built up a staff of over 50 industry professionals and field operatives since our beginning in 2007. During this time the company has invested upward of $40 million, over 80% of which is directly attributable to exploration and development. We take a very hands-on approach to our work with the bulk of Baobab's management team, including myself, resident in Mozambique.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique as a mining jurisdiction?</h4><p>Politically, Mozambique is facing its most challenging decade ahead, owing largely to the imminent development of its resources. The wealth that will be created must be fed into the national economy equitably. The government recognises the importance of the mineral resource and oil and gas sectors as cornerstones to the new economy and is proactive in encouraging foreign investment. The support is there from the top down—the ministers we have the privilege of working with are very talented and committed to developing the project. Mining has not been a significant part of the Mozambican economy until recently and there is still much to be learned. The country has revised its licensing system and mining legislation, and is consulting the private sector. It seems to be cautious about introducing change, and does not want to repeat the mistake of the copper tax in Zambia, or the 50% state ownership situation in Zimbabwe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-cities-between]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Mozambican government doing to promote international investment in the industrial sector?</h4><p>The government's strategy for attracting foreign investment is focused on three areas: sectors that are priorities for the government, those that are of interest to private foreign investors, and those that are not of primary interest to foreign investors, but in which the government wishes to promote investment. In terms of government priorities, I would highlight the agricultural sector, in which it is state policy to promote investment. The agriculture sector in Mozambique has all the right characteristics to support the integrated growth of the economy, as well as poverty reduction, participation of the Mozambican population in productive activities, the transformation of micro and small enterprises, and the bridging of rural and urban areas. The main impacts of this approach are the reduction of population build-up in areas of limited size, a better expression of the Mozambican population in terms of integrated national development, improved national integration, and greater job opportunities, especially considering that 33% to 38% of Mozambicans are below 18 years of age. In a country as young as this, development strategies need to be oriented to ensure that the population has work, can develop its productive capacity, start new enterprises, and learn skills. This is a government priority. The second focus concerns sectors of the economy in which the private sector, of its own volition, is keen to invest. Obviously, the interest of large foreign companies is focused on the extractive industry given the significant global demand for those resources. This fact has brought an enormous amount of international firms to Mozambique.</p><h4>How is the Ministry looking to encourage new start-ups in the marketplace?</h4><p>As the Ministry of Trade and Industry, it is our goal to structure the economy in order to enable micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises to become suppliers of products and services to the mineral resources industry. To that end, we have created the Institute for the Promotion of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (IPEME). IPEME is preparing to create entrepreneurship incubators that will absorb graduates from technical institutes and universities and provide them with the capacity to become entrepreneurs. Enterprises will be created that can supply products and services for megaprojects in the extractive industry, but that can also become professionals with expertise in the private sector, reducing the necessity of importing qualified labor for the extractive industry. Our third focus is on local investment-related legislation, which in Mozambique ensures open access. This means that investors from anywhere in the world, can invest in Mozambique. This law assures that foreign investors can come to Mozambique to develop their business as individuals, or by establishing partnerships with Mozambican enterprises and individuals. As part of this law, a code of fiscal benefits for investments allows tax deductions and tax exemptions for such expenses as equipment imports, to ensure the economic viability of investing here. Mozambique is still a developing country. We still have poverty, and rank low on many development indices, such as infant mortality, chronic malnutrition, and children not attending school, among others. These factors oblige the government to spend a huge part of its budget on education, training, health, and reducing the social costs of the population to make sure that it is productive.</p><h4>What efforts is the government making to address nutritional issues and reduce malnutrition?</h4><p>We have created a multi-sectoral mechanism in which there is a direct engagement from the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, and State Administration. The problems that result from chronic malnutrition impact the health of the individual and his or her intellectual and natural capacities. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is responsible for coordinating the fortification of the food chain, because the main challenge in this area is not exactly food production; it is a problem of including minerals, vitamins, and nutrients. And only the food industry itself can carry out this process. In that respect, we have introduced the National Committee for Food Fortification in partnership with international organizations like GAIN, the Helen Keller Foundation, and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which have been assisting us by working together to encourage the national food processing industry to include micronutrients in its products. Our objective is to reduce malnutrition in the regions of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition, including Niassa, Nampula, Zambezia, and Sofala. Those provinces are, ironically, those with the greatest cereal production in the country. Those provinces not only produce cereals, but also tubers and oils, so it would make sense for them not to suffer chronic malnutrition. Therefore, food habits and cultural practices are the problem. We are trying to stimulate a process in which, instead of producing and consuming, the local community could produce for sale. Then, we could introduce micronutrients to the processed product and sell it back to the families.</p><div class="quote">“  It is our goal to structure the economy in order to enable micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises to become suppliers of products and services to the mineral resources industry. "</div><h4>How would you characterize the importance of regional integration in Mozambique's economic development?</h4><p>Mozambique has a vision of commerce based on the framework of the WTO and our regional cooperation agreements. It is part of the 15-member Southern African Development Community (SADC). Of those 15 countries, Mozambique is the only one that is not a part of other communities, including the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the South African Customs Union (SACU). Mozambique believes that perfect integration in the region will allow competitive gains for each country. During our presidency of the SADC, our main focus was on ensuring that decisive space was created for free industrial zones in the Southern African region. That was achieved, and now we want to ensure that over the next two years, all 15 member countries of the SADC use the free industrial zones to increase opportunities for the industrial sector.</p><p>We also have a strategic geographical position that allows us to be a vehicle for the dynamics of global commerce, as we are close to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. This region has the potential to become a platform linking Asia to Latin America. We also have bilateral agreements, including the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Europe, which affords us a very comfortable position. In terms of our trade with Europe, our priority is to continue exporting using our preferential access through Everything But Arms (EBA). This has allowed us to revitalize our sugar and tobacco industries as well as export a significant amount of aluminum. We also have preferential access for most products to the US, and a list of 400 products to China. We are one of the only countries to hold such extensive agreements with so many countries. This is an important part of our trade policy, offering opportunities for foreign private players keen to invest in Mozambique.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vodacom entered Mozambique 10 years ago and today has a 38% market share. How has your strategy led to this?<br></h4><p>Vodacom is known worldwide for quality. It's a given that if you make a call in an area where we operate, it goes through clearly, and you are able to hold the call for as long as needed. That value proposition now extends into data as well. In this particular market, we've really taken the lead in giving bonuses and special offers, in particular to new customers that are coming into the market and who may not have owned a mobile phone before, or with limited disposable income. We offer great packages that have helped them get a mobile phone and make the most of their mobile services budget. In short, our strategy has been to focus on quality and value, rather than the competition. Judging from our feedback, people are impressed with the quality of the services we offer in general.</p><h4>Mobile penetration in Mozambique is still comparatively low. What does that mean for your operations here?</h4><p>We see tremendous opportunities here today, even though penetration is low compared to other countries. The political situation is stable, and there has been a peaceful presidential transition following the elections, which is quite unusual. That stability has given us a good level of reassurance on the long-term future of the company. Then when you look at the interactive investments that are coming in and that will be of huge importance and benefit to the historically underdeveloped north of the country, you find that, in the long term, Mozambique is a place of great opportunity, and we want to be a part of that. This is our 10th anniversary year, and we've expanded our network by 70%, with the process complete by November 2013. This is something that we've never done before, and I think it confirms our belief in the long-term future of Mozambique.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for foreign investors in Mozambique?</h4><p>The lack of skilled employees is a challenge, and efforts to develop talent and skills can backfire when your competition poaches your staff. Another issue is that there's substantial investment without a definitive national infrastructure plan. Individual ministries appear to be acting without a coherent plan. You just have to persevere, and also be flexible and attempt new approaches. The telecoms industry is open to this kind of flexibility, thankfully.</p><h4>Do you welcome the arrival of a third player in Mozambique's mobile telecommunications market?</h4><p>There would be inevitable growing pains for the newcomer. When you go from a two-player to a three-player situation in a market of 25 million people, you find that the quality of service tends to improve, thanks to competition. Also, the market is still big enough for all three to justify making more investments in the country, spurred on by their competition. I think three is the right number to ensure ubiquitous coverage and to improve the quality of the service and products on offer. Mozambique is large enough for this to be workable for all parties involved.</p><h4>What other mobile trends do you foresee moving into 2014?</h4><p>The growth of data will continue at an extraordinary rate. In addition, I foresee that many people's first experience of a computer won't be sitting at a desk, but on a $50-$80 smartphone. Those low-cost smartphones are set to transform peoples' lives, providing access to the internet, phone connectivity, mobile money, cameras, music, and entertainment. Our plans involve continued investment in data, too. The demand is there and rising; this is an exciting time to be involved in the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the government taking to ensure that Mozambique's port and rail infrastructure can keep up with the country's rapid economic growth?</h4><p>We are working on the enlargement and modernization of the Port of Maputo in line with the $1.7 billion master plan, which includes the dredging, enlargement, and modernization of terminals. The seaport of Maputo serves the entire country, as well as the northeast of South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe via the rail lines at Ressano Garcia, Goba, and Limpopo, respectively. We are also reconstructing the rail and port system in Beira, including both Beira port and the Sena line railway, which connects Beira to the coal fields in Tete as well as to Zimbabwe and Zambia. Over $160 million has been invested in the Sena line and $300 million in Beira port, particularly to support the dredging of the port. To support coal logistics, a deep-sea port is currently being built in Nacala along with the improvement of the Nacala-Moatize rail line. The project will cost around $4.5 million and enable the transportation of 30 million tons of goods per year. In addition, the government has recently signed a concession contract for the Macuse Corridor, which includes the construction of a rail line between Moatize and Macuse on the coast.</p><h4>What improvements are being made to Mozambique's telecommunications infrastructure?</h4><p>In relation to the telecommunications network in rural areas, in 2009 we completed the installation of telecommunications systems in all district capitals, and extended them to all administrative posts and locations. The fiber-optic network covers all the province capitals and will encompass whole districts. Three mobile telecommunications companies currently operate in the country: mCel, since 1997, Vodacom, since 2003, and Movitel, since 2012.</p><h4>What role can public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in developing Mozambique's transport infrastructure?</h4><p>The private sector is the government's strategic partner in this business area. Our infrastructure is built and rehabilitated under a concession regime within the framework of PPPs. All the main seaports, namely Maputo, Beira, and Nacala, were made into concession areas for the private sector, which mobilized its respective investments. In the telecommunications area, the market is already liberalized and two private mobile operators were licensed through public tenders.</p><div class="quote">“  Exhaustive modernization work is being conducted at the moment as regards airport infrastructure. "</div><h4>What role does the aviation sector play in Mozambique's transport policy and what are your goals for Mozambique's aviation sector?</h4><p>Air transport serves as a catalyst for national and international tourism. Exhaustive modernization work is being conducted at the moment as regards airport infrastructure in Maputo, Vilanculos, Nacala, and Pemba. At the same time, we are working to raise LAM's aircraft fleet number, as well as strengthen the capacities of the civil aviation regulator.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of the rail, port, and airport upgrades in Nacala, and what will be their ultimate role in Southeast Africa's transport system?</h4><p>Nacala was made a special economic zone through a government decision in order to facilitate the attraction of direct investment. The airport of Nacala is entering its final construction stage, and stands out for its geostrategic position, which facilitates connectivity with Europe and Asia. Nacala is a deep-water port that enables unlimited growth. Nacala's rail line crosses productive zones, in which a giant agricultural project called PROSAVANA is being implemented. Nacala's rail line equally serves Malawi.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for Mozambique to serve as a transport hub through the Beira, Maputo, and Nacala corridors linking Southeastern Africa?</h4><p>The Corridors of Development of Nacala, Beira, and Maputo support the Southern African Development Community (SADC's) economic integration. The Maputo Corridor serves the northeast of South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. The Techobanine project is underway, which will complement Maputo seaport and serve Botswana and Zimbabwe. The Beira Corridor already serves Zimbabwe, Zambia, and the south of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Nacala Corridor ensures importation and exportation from neighboring Malawi via the rail line to Nacala.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for Mozambique's transport and communications infrastructure in 2014?</h4><p>In parallel with what is happening in the country, the sector intends to stay on course through sustained peace and political and macroeconomic stability, and through special attention to four areas. Firstly, we need to build infrastructure to guarantee the logistics of mineral extraction. Secondly, we must reorganize the urban public transportation sector. Thirdly, there is a need to expand the telecommunications network to rural areas. And lastly, we need to consolidate the civil aviation sector through investment in airport infrastructure and the enhancement of our aircraft fleet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mota-Engil's role in Mozambique's construction sector?</h4><p>Mota-Engil has been present in Mozambique for over 20 years, having been involved in the construction of numerous reference works for the present and future of Mozambique, such as the Armando Emilio Guebuza Bridge, the water supply system of Maputo, and the African Games Village, as well as the construction of roads and other infrastructure. Currently, Mota-Engil group has three major projects under way: a new bridge over the Zambezi River in Tete; the 235-kilometer Chimoio-Espungabera Road, and the upgrade of the Sena railway line's capacity to 20 million tons. We recently completed the 80-kilometer Milange-Mocuba Road, as well as the rehabilitation of the Sena Line to 6 million tons. We have also constructed schools, as well as a general hospital in Mavalane, and have undertaken the rehabilitation of the maternity ward of Maputo Central Hospital, among others. Our projects have significant strategic importance for national development, and should be viewed not as civil construction, but rather, as engineering projects, that include bridges, viaducts, highways, and railways. Furthermore, the group has many ongoing civil construction projects developed by Mota-Engil and its associate Emocil, such as works at the Port of Maputo, the 24th of July Condominium, and the Tilweni Condominium tower. One of our major projects is the upgrade of the Sena Line, which is at the heart of Mozambique's coal transport infrastructure. We are also looking at projects along the Moatize-Macuse line and have begun to work in the natural gas market in a project for ENI.</p><h4>How are Mota-Engil's projects contributing to overall development in Mozambique?</h4><p>We are working on roads, railways, bridges, and ports that require logistics, and our projects have a major effect on the overall national economy. We won the emergency intervention railway project for the Sena Line, where we vitally contributed technical advice in solving the logistical problem of coal transportation. The African Games Village was created after the relocation of the games in 2011 from Zambia to Mozambique, around two years before the event. A consortium was signed with Mota-Engil 15 months before the opening of the Games. We completed this scheme of more than 800 houses in a record time of 13 months, and ahead of the scheduled event opening. Another project that is having a noticeable effect on the country is the Ecolife project started in October 2013. This involves the collection of urban solid waste in Maputo's downtown district. This was our first contract in Mozambique in the environment and services sector. Ecolife's main goal is to promote environmental education, and the project is our first in the environment and services sector here. We are also involved in real estate, where a good example of our work is the Tilweni Condominium, a 20-floor building in downtown Maputo.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of your business by segment?</h4><p>Infrastructure represents around 80% of our business volume and civil construction represents 20%. Currently, in real estate, we have two projects in Mozambique: one is already completed, while the other is coming to fruition, and we are poised to commence another here in Maputo. The city's market is beginning to reach saturation, and our conviction is that within five years the real estate opportunities will have dried up. This explains why we are already positioning ourselves in the other provincial capitals of Nacala, Beira, Palma, and Pemba. Our strategic plan regarding the positioning of real estate projects until 2015 is Maputo, but beyond that date we are repositioning to the north where there will be a need for construction.</p><div class="quote">“  Our company predominently comprises national employees, whom we intend to develop to even higher levels. "</div><h4>What major challenges have you faced as an international company in Mozambique, and how have you overcome them?</h4><p>Mota-Engil's approach is to contribute in developing essential infrastructure shortfalls and provide solutions. We do so in various divisions of our group, as I already mentioned. Our presence in Mozambique does not only concern construction since we are a diversified entrepreneurial group. In addition to the strategic positioning of Mozambique, recent growth of the sectors of coal and natural gas has created a demand for logistics. The country has new business opportunities for all sectors and for which we must be able toreply.</p><p>Projections show continued economic growth of around 7.8% on average in the period of 2013 to 2015 and 8% in the period of 2016-2017. Real estate has been growing because there is a need to house the technicians arriving to execute these megaprojects. This is how I see matters panning out; certain sectors will gradually grow as a result of the successful exploitation of our resources.</p><h4>What role does human resources development play in your operations?</h4><p>Mota-Engil has significant human capital in Mozambique. Mota-Engil's view in Mozambique is aligned with the traditional corporate view of the company, which is to seek the best technical and financial options for projects. Our company predominently comprises national employees, whom we intend to develop to even higher levels of competency. We have around 1,700 employees, of which there are 1,600 Mozambicans, making for just 100 employees from abroad. We have pursued the systematic training, supervision, and follow-up of our human resources. We attempt to ensure reliable foreign partnerships through the signing of a letter of commitment to tutor young Mozambican staff, with the goal of guiding, training, and introducing them to Mota-Engil's culture. In other words, we do not mobilize any staff to Mozambique without their signing of this letter, since it is the only sustainable way that we can grow in Mozambique. Human resources are key to our success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the importance of agriculture to the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>Agriculture is, and will remain, the cornerstone of the economic and social development of Mozambique. It is important not only because of the volume of food provided by agriculture, but also because of the contribution of this sector to GDP, which is estimated at around 24%. This contribution may decline because of the urgency to exploit natural resources, such as gas and coal; however, it will remain significant. Agriculture in Mozambique not only meets domestic demand, but also satisfies export orders. Its importance has led the government to create a strategic investment plan for the agrarian market. Our main goal is to reach stable levels of food consumption and nutrition. The implementation of this strategic plan respects production in Mozambique, the existing infrastructure, and the market opportunities that arise both within the country and abroad. We have six producers: Maputo and Limpopo Valley in the south, the Beira Corridor and Zambeze Valley in central Mozambique, and the Nacala and Pemba corridors in the north of the country. We have partnerships in these areas, the most developed and solid being that with Japan and Brazil. The country must now establish a foundation for agricultural research, an area in which Brazil has long experience under the auspices of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Mozambique also needs to develop the basis for technology transfer, and draft a plan related to integrated development in the north of the country. Each of the corridors produces a specific variety of products for sale to the local market and for export. Currently, we are self-sufficient in certain products essential for healthy nutrition. It has turned Mozambique into an exporting country from one that formerly received aid from other nations.</p><h4>How is the government balancing efforts to promote the commercial side of agriculture and maintain food security?</h4><p>It is important to remember that the priority of the strategic plan created to develop the agrarian sector is to ensure that subsistence producers can become business-oriented producers through the utilization of technology. Low-income producers can grow from producing one ton per hectare to five, six, or even higher tonnage per hectare when provided with high-quality seeds, technology, and knowledge of how to prepare the soil. This is already happening. If we look at the Limpopo Corridor, we note that the rice producers being assisted by this plan are producing five tons of rice per hectare. These producers came from a subsistence system to become business-oriented farmers. Moreover, private-sector participation, be it internal or from abroad, is also welcome. Adequate investment laws in place will ensure responsible investment. Those wishing to invest in food products must promote agriculture by signing contracts with producers across around 40% of the area in question. The investor thereby promotes, supports, and then buys what is produced by the local farmers in a core area 40% of which needs to be productive. And where products other than food-crops are produced, at least 10% of the total area must increase its agriculture yield in line with local communities. For example, with an investment in a forest of 1,000 hectares, 100 hectares must be made available for food production, and people from local communities must be hired to work on 300 hectares.</p><h4>What is the appeal of Mozambique as a destination for agriculture investment?</h4><p>In agriculture, our largest foreign investors are from South Africa and Portugal. Chinese investors also form a sizeable part of the group. We have excellent ecological conditions and a plentiful water supply fed by 35 rivers. Mozambique has excellent soil and a hospitable and hardworking population that is capable of making a huge contribution to the food industry.</p><h4>What efforts is the government making to ensure that farmers have access to technology and agricultural extension programs?</h4><p>We are reinforcing agrarian research and the expansion of this sector. The technology transfer system in Mozambique is based on demonstration. We need to promote the technology available in agriculture, cattle farming, and forestry by allowing agricultural workers to examine and compare them in a hands-on fashion. Only in this manner can they appreciate fully just how technology can be directly incorporated into agribusiness. Farmers also learn on the job, where certain companies and teach the technical and commercial rules established by these enterprises. They have a predetermined area in which to work, ranging from 0.5 to 2 hectares, and learn to manage it effectively. Once they have done so, they receive a larger area to manage commercially as an agrarian professional. Today, 1,200 people offer such demonstrations nationwide, while 5,000 people are productively engaged in the agribusiness. Annual prizes are awarded to the most effective producers by the President of the Republic. There are five categories in which we distribute prizes: best producer of the year, best female producer, best young producer, for those under 35 years of age, as well as prizes for largest expansion registered, and best researcher.</p><h4>What are your agricultural priorities for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our main overall priority for agriculture over the next 12 months is to give a clear sign for agro-processing. We have been negotiating with Brazil in relation to a program geared at increasing food security, allowing us to invest $100 million in equipment for processing and maintenance. Yet while our greatest need is to develop the agro-industry, unfortunately, we still face the problem of production. A well-developed agro-industry would enable us to solve this issue, and to generate new jobs and higher profitability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Agriculture Promotion Center (CEPAGRI)?<br></h4><p>CEPAGRI is an institution under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture that is designed to promote investment in agribusiness. Our main role is to promote the agrarian and agro-industrial sectors, interact with the private sector, and support private investors in order to maximise their contribution in the country's socio-economic development. Mozambique is a very large country, and its current agricultural strategy focuses on the six development corridors, each of which plays a specific role. CEPAGRI, in coordination with Monitor Deloitte, has identified 12 key value chains based on the private sector and government interest that are relevant and that require promotion be it for national or foreigner investors. We offer the appropriate fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, guarantees, and protection of their investments. Our goal, then, is to create links between the government and the private sector. We have an agriculture master plan with the following four objectives: (i) increase production and productivity, (ii) boost infrastructure to improve access to the market, (iii) encourage the sustainable use of natural resources, and (iv) strengthen the use of agricultural institutions. Mozambique should be able to meet the needs of all of its people through local production.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for Mozambique's agricultural sector right now?</h4><p>The largest agricultural challenge for Mozambique is to increase agriculture productivity and develop the agro-processing industry. Much of our agricultural production, cereals specially, is sent to other neighboring countries because we lack the capacity to process and add value locally. For instance, Malawi receives much of our production because it has the capacity to process corn into flour. Mozambique has just approved a plan for agribusiness, wherein one recommendation is to increase agro-processing and mechanization, since to increase productivity and yield farmers need to mechanize. Our smallholder farmers are using hoes when they should be using tractors. The right motivation and incentives exist to boost mechanized production through the creation of agrarian services centres. Farmers must be focused on production, and we will handle the bureaucratic and logistics side through these service centres. We also have internal challenges regarding storage. In Zimpeto, we helped a wholesalers' market to obtain cold storage facilities for perishable crops. If the produce remains unsold, it spoils, and for this reason we mobilized resources to create a solution.</p><h4>What would you say are the main strategic crops for Mozambique?</h4><p>We have 12 strategic crops, including rice, which is a key staple. We have the potential to produce all of our own rice, but right now we import 60% of our consumption. We have a unit plant in Xai-Xai, but if we had three—one in the south, another in the central region, and one in the north—the country would be balanced in terms of production. We also have soy, which is strategic in terms of aviculture feeding; chicken is also a key staple of domestic cuisine consumed by lower-income people in large cities and industrial centres. With our soy and corn, we are able to produce aviculture food indefinitely. Meanwhile, bananas are also being grown on a large scale and exported to Europe from Nampula; we also produce and export sugar. Cotton, too, is part of the export basket and offers much potential as industrial facilities enable local processing. Indeed, one of our goals is to produce medical cotton. Mozambique still imports a considerable volume of poultry from Brazil and South Africa. The government's main goal is to meet demand with domestically produced poultry; however, as long as we cannot afford to achieve that goal, we cannot dismiss imports. We import a significant volume of meat from South Africa and Botswana, although we have the potential to produce it here as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis are the primary reasons for hospital visits in Mozambique. What are you doing to combat these illnesses?<br></h4><p>These three illnesses have a major impact on the quality of health of Mozambicans, and therefore the Ministry of Health is concentrating on tackling them. To ensure that we have health staff specialized in dealing with these conditions we first need strong internal organization, and a social commitment to combat them. First, it is essential that people understand what these illnesses involve, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health has developed a very strong community action program in all provinces and districts over the past few years. Additionally, wherever there are health centers, there are designated community-health committees that represent community leaders and traditional medicine practitioners; in short, people known well in local public life, who also work with the health authorities. They allow for regular meetings to be held and for programs to be designed of relevance to the communities themselves. Together they spread the message that it is necessary for everybody to be informed and aware, so that all can make a personal contribution, with family and community, in combating disease through prevention.</p><h4>What have been some of the major successes of this community involvement work?</h4><p>One major success has been our program of increasing vaccination levels. For that program to succeed it is necessary for the public to understand what we are doing and why, as some mothers remain reluctant to bring their children for vaccination. When we conduct our campaigns we also deliver general health information regarding such topics as nutrition, and discuss preventative behavior to avoid contracting HIV, by promoting family planning. All of this requires considerable community commitment, which we have succeeded in winning. Roughly five years ago we introduced a new vaccine that allows us to prevent respiratory diseases. During 2013, we introduced a pneumococcal vaccine also to prevent respiratory diseases, and are working today to introduce the HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer in women. Finally, one of our biggest successes to date has been the fall in infant mortality from 144 (per 100,000 live births) in 1997 to 64 in 2011. We have basically cut infant mortality in half over the past decade.</p><h4>How is Mozambique confronting the challenge posed by the lack of qualified medical personnel?</h4><p>We have been building more training centers. There is almost no province that lacks an institution for health sciences.Investment in education has increased by 30%, which is very important, and a great deal of effort has been invested by the Mozambican government to provide good-quality training centers in almost every region, province, and district.</p><div class="quote">“  The health sector in Mozambique is basically dominated by the public sector. "</div><h4>What role can the private sector play in developing Mozambique's healthcare system?</h4><p>The private sector has to be regarded as complementary to the public sector and we encourage its development. The health sector in Mozambique is basically dominated by the public sector, but we think that a strong intervention on the part of the private sector could help the country to develop rapidly. The presence of the private sector is necessary in the health sector because it by and large comes with the resources that allow it to install new technologies faster. This advanced technology will allow Mozambican doctors, nurses, and staff to learn from the experience of those professionals. The Mozambican public system will be able to develop faster because we are observing considerable interest, and we also have areas in which we favor the localization of these hospitals as a priority.</p><h4>What have been Mozambique's greatest recent successes in public health?</h4><p>One of our greatest successes has been in combating the infant mortality rate. We have also registered good results in fighting malaria, and a reduction in cholera outbreaks over the past two years, particularly in Cabo Delgado and Nampula.</p><h4>What are the government's public health priorities moving forward?</h4><p>We are working to decrease the high maternal mortality rate by providing maternal and pre-natal medical facilities. To this end, we are training more staff and building more maternity facilities and surgeries in which we can perform cesarean deliveries. In terms of increasing women's access to delivery by qualified personnel, the ratio of such deliveries has now reached about 63%, and is rising. The growth of maternity science and neo-natal care for women during the first 40 days is also contributing significantly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted you to found Clinicare, given that your background is in the public sector?<br></h4><p>I am a Mozambican neurosurgeon. When I finished my studies I started to work in the public sector, where unfortunately, there are many difficulties. Imaging is very important in my field, yet 10 years ago, we didn't have imaging machines, even in Maputo Central Hospital. It was at that time that I decided to enter the private sector. That is why in the beginning the idea was to establish an imaging center in Maputo, including digital x-rays, MRI, CT-scan, densitometry, mammography, and ultrasound. After that we realized that major investment was needed in this area. My partners and I discussed building clinics in other areas, too. We are a medium-size clinic with the most relevant specialties available: dentistry, laboratory, ICU, physiotherapy, and chemistry, among others. It was not possible to open a private hospital in Mozambique 15 years ago because this was exclusively a public sector domain. The government decided to allow for the opening of privately managed facilities after a few years. Clinics started to be established, but mainly for consultations rather than diagnostics (imaging) and surgery. Such clinics were not built from scratch in line with best practices and layouts for clinics—existing houses were often converted into small clinics. Very few of them featured the facilities we have now. Some elements are still missing, for example radiotherapy is not available in the country, and for these facilities one must go to South Africa.</p><h4>One of the reasons for the lack of higher-level services has been a lack of base consumers with sufficient funds. How have you seen this change over time?</h4><p>We know that ordinary people don't have the possibility to use privately managed clinics and services. Most users now come through the many existing insurance companies that are used by private sector companies operating in Mozambique. Most companies have contracts with insurers, through which they access clinics. It is not a perfect situation, but it is one we can manage. Insurance companies tend to pay late and add an administrative burden to clinics, but there is little room for maneuverability as the market currently stands. Our average patient is a Mozambican working for a medium- to large-size company, although there are also expatriates working for the embassies and foreign companies based in Mozambique. Expatriates are a demanding type of client and their level of confidence in the use of private clinics is increasing. Our commitment to quality, security, staff professionalism, and availability is reaching expatriates and also Mozambicans who would usually travel to South Africa for treatment.</p><h4>How do you think investment in gas and coal over the past decade has affected the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Positively. All the economic improvements in the country will indirectly affect us. Expatriate patients are starting to use our services, and because they are more demanding they help us improve not just the services we provide, but also on the best way to deliver them to this new customer base. It is still early days to see the high-level impact of such investments, but I am confident that they will come. Also, one must take note that these major investments are not located in Maputo but in other less accessible and developed provinces such as Tete and Cabo Delgado.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does UCM play in the education sector in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>UCM was one of the first private universities in Mozambique, and the first to have its headquarters beyond Maputo. It is part of the Mozambican Catholic church. The Archbishop of Beira launched the university at a crucial moment for Mozambique, during the peace negotiations in 1992. One of the issues that had led to the civil war was the absence of higher education in the center and north of the country. At that time the only higher education institution was Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM), based in Maputo. To overcome this problem the mediators thought that the only solution would be the foundation of a university for central and northern Mozambique. In 1995 the initial proposal for a Catholic University was approved in Mozambique, and in 1996, the two first faculties, economics and management, started in Beira, and, on the same day in Nampula, the Faculty of Law was established. Since then faculties of education, communications, agriculture, tourism, computer sciences, engineering, natural resources, mineralogy, and social and political sciences have come into being. What we want to do is educate men and women in a holistic manner, not only in terms of scientific knowledge but also in human knowledge, practical knowledge, and values that can enrich the work of not only the person, but also of other people. We also give priority to gender equality because women were marginalized in Mozambique with regard to access to higher education. We now have 11 research centers, and in each basic unit, or in each faculty, we are also the only university in the country that currently offers courses on HIV/AIDS.</p><h4>How would you characterize the higher education system in Mozambique?</h4><p>Higher education in Mozambique is a challenge as it is still young. Last year, we celebrated 50 years of higher education in Mozambique. Other nations have had centuries of higher education. This means that at the moment it is a great challenge. We have 21 million inhabitants in Mozambique, 70% to 80% of whom are young people. Right now we have 46 institutions of higher education, which is insufficient for such a population. There are few opportunities for access to higher education because the country remains poor and there are few families that have the resources to gain access. This is a problem for women in particular. We can see that women are less privileged in many parts of Africa, but in the last couple of years I believe that positive gains have been made.</p><h4>How has the influx of investment in the mineral resources sector affected the role of the educational system in Mozambique?</h4><p>The discovery of natural resources in Tete and Cabo Delgado is great news that brings hope to many Mozambicans. That allows also for the universities and the higher education institutions to start preparing to face new challenges that nobody expected. It is crucially important for Mozambique that we have highly qualified staff who can compete on equal terms with candidates that have been trained elsewhere, especially those who advise the government on investment in those areas and how to capitalize on the resources from mines, natural gas, and oil in Pemba. The universities can do this because they first train the human resources that underpin national development. The universities should start designing educational plans that match the developmental priorities of this country, such as coal and natural gas. We have courses in the area of mineralogy, mine engineering, and geology in Tete. In Cabo Delgado we also thought about starting some programs, and are already designing courses for the natural gas, oil engineering, logistics, and transportation sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We also review our own practices as required. Our in-depth knowledge of the country and its policies and institutions provides a major advantage in advising clients on legal matters. Finally, we always apply sensitive analysis in legal reviews for major projects and concessions in key economic sectors.</p><h4>What have been some of the flagship transactions CGA has been involved in?</h4><p>CGA has been involved in major transactions such as the Nacala Corridor Railway and Coal Terminal Concession involving Mozambique and Malawi, the LNG Project Plan in Northern Mozambique and its port facilities, and is part of a public-private partnership (PPP) for the construction, operation, maintenance, and management of the railway and port facilities in Macuse. In addition, we have been involved in power generation projects such as the Moatize Power Concession, and a power plant in the south of Mozambique. Our expertise has also been utilized in wood chip and textile factories, as well as in a sugar cane plantation and sugar mill.</p><h4>What distinguishes CGA among the corporate law firms operating in Mozambique?</h4><p>CGA is structured by specialized teams capable of providing legal services at international standards of quality, both in domestic and international transactions. CGA is, as a private legal firm, the foremost pool of professionals operating on a specialized team basis in the country.</p><h4>How does CGA leverage its international partnerships to the benefit of its clients?</h4><p>We use comparative analysis in searching for better solutions for the benefit of clients. We also assist clients on a team basis. Additionally, we promote exchange programs in specialized areas that enrich and broaden advisory work for major projects.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's regulatory environment for foreign investors?</h4><p>Mozambique has established a specific, comprehensive, and attractive framework for foreign investment. This framework includes investment promotion and procedures for approval and implementation, rights and guarantees, arbitration, and related tax benefits. There are specific rules and regulations for special economic zones (EEZ). Exchange control rules and regulations are also included under the foreign investment framework. The general regime applicable to foreign investment into Mozambique is set out in Law No. 393 of June 24 (Law on Investment — LI); Decree No. 432009 of October 21 (Regulation of the investment Law — RIL); Law No. 42009, of January 12 (Code of Fiscal Benefits for Investments - CFBI); and Decree No. 562009 of October 7 (Regulation of CFBI). The Investment Promotion Centre (Centro de Promoçío de Investimentos or CPI) is the Mozambican government authority responsible for promoting, approving, and monitoring foreign investment in Mozambique, and the Council of Ministers is responsible for approving relevant investment projects. The major sectors in which we expect to see substantial investment are oil and gas, mining, energy, public infrastructure, and agriculture and agro-industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Area 1 gas reserves that Anadarko Moçambique Area 1 Lda (AMA1) is developing for Mozambique?</h4><p>AMA1 has been exploring for oil and natural gas since early 2007. We made our first discovery in Offshore Area 1 in early 2010 and have been systematically appraising natural gas discoveries since then. We expect to be actively drilling until around the end of 3Q2014. We estimate Area 1's recoverable natural gas resources in the range of 45 to 70 tcf, rendering them among the largest natural gas discoveries in the world over the past decade. In terms of global impact, we see LNG as the enabler of natural gas development here in Mozambique. AMA1's initial phase envisages 10 million tons of LNG per annum, and we believe there are sufficient resources to support the development of 50 MMTPA in future years, which would rank Mozambique as the world's third largest LNG exporter, as 50 million tons represents approximately 20% of current global demand. The scale here provides the ability for Mozambique to become a global player in LNG. Obviously, Mozambique is well positioned for the growing consumer markets in Asia. We have the scope to consider markets worldwide, although for this project we are focused on Asian markets. In terms of the benefits to be reaped by Mozambique itself, the project has the potential to fuel large-scale growth in terms of GDP, foreign exchange, and project revenues, in addition to developing a skilled workforce and infrastructure. It can provide money for the treasury to invest in education, healthcare, and other core areas of the state. Our contract with the government is mutually equitable, and involves significant tax revenues and royalties. The national oil company is also an equity participant in the project. The government has announced foreseeing other projects that could develop from natural gas-based feedstock, such as industrial schemes and power generation. AMA1 is supportive of initiatives that can also have significant economic impact on the country, on job creation, and on economic diversification.</p><h4>What is the significance of this project for Anadarko's global portfolio?</h4><p>Globally, this will be the biggest single investment that Anadarko has ever embarked upon. We have just completed our third large-scale project in Algeria, which also involved many logistical and technical challenges, and so not unlike what is happening here. We are looking forward to moving into LNG. Anadarko is a world leader in deep-water developments, and we also have superlative project management skills that enable us to undertake large-scale projects such as LNG. Moving into that area offers significant growth potential for the company, not only in Africa, but also globally.</p><h4>How have you tackled the logistics challenges of operating in remote areas in Northern Mozambique?</h4><p>There are advantages to what we have in Palma, where the LNG facility is being developed, versus the challenges that the mining industry is facing in the interior of the country. We are located on the coast, which simplifies a number of things. We will certainly have to build marine offload facilities for our construction activities. Our seismic and drilling operations have been run out of Pemba for the past four to six years, which has worked well. Pemba has an international airport, which makes it easier to get people and goods there, although the city could receive further infrastructure development. The port of Pemba itself requires upgrading, and we are supporting government initiatives to do so. In Palma, we are going to partner with the government in developing infrastructure. This will include marine facilities, such as a jetty for LNG loading and the construction of docks, although these would have to be built anyway. The work is already ongoing. In terms of air transport, we have been using Mocimboa da Praia Airport, which is about 60 kilometers away from the site. Logistically, it is better to have the airport in the industrial area where we are going to develop the LNG component and to have some of the spinoff industries the government has in mind there. For this we will need to build a new airport in order to accommodate the volume of aircraft required to transport our equipment and the workforce needed at Palma.</p><div class="quote">“  We have approximately 100 local SMEs that we do, or have done, business with. "</div><h4>How have Anadarko's local content policies contributed to upgrading the capacity of Mozambican business?</h4><p>Extractive industries in general, and certainly the oil and natural gas industry, are highly capital-intensive, but not particularly labor intensive. Though we will not require a significant number of people to operate the facilities, we will need a large number of people to build them. Most of the workers to be hired during construction will be sourced through the engineering, procurement, and construction contractors (EPCCs), and not directly from AMA1. In terms of SME development, we fully support what the government is trying to do. We held a supplier awareness workshop in Maputo last week where the Minister of Trade and Industry delivered a keynote speech. The idea is to support SMEs, which account for the majority of companies in Mozambique. Our work with SMEs is helpful for them because we will have the same requirements as the EPCCs and many other international companies. It is a process of education and we are working with the government to ensure that our project is of maximum benefit for those sectors. We fully understand the importance of this in terms of the largest support for further mega-projects. We have invested somewhere in the range of $15 million on SMEs as suppliers this year. We have approximately 100 local SMEs that we do, or have done, business with, and the number is growing. We are developing a database of suppliers that have been through our corporate due diligence process. The idea is certainly to maximize the use of local business.</p><h4>What are the next steps moving toward the first LNG exports in 2018?</h4><p>We have completed the public consultation and received feedback from technical groups interested in our project. We expect to receive our license to start building offshore infrastructure for the project in 2014. The other aspect is to complete our agreement with the government to facilitate the project, which is really all about putting in place the framework stability that we need for the buyers of LNG and the EPCCs themselves. The President announced in July 2013 that this would be done through a decree approved by parliament, which is exactly what projects like this need. That will determine the timing of the final investment decision and, with that, everything should be in place for delivery of the first cargo in 2018. The project is world class and the buyers of LNG will see it as a strategic source for the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the regulatory framework for upstream oil and gas in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>I think the regulatory framework for petroleum in general, which also includes gas, is evolving in the best way possible. We have adopted an approach whereby, over time, we look at the regulatory framework and try to see if it matches reality. As a matter of fact, we are currently in the processes of revising the legal and regulatory framework, and are awaiting parliamentary approval of the latest draft. We are doing this essentially because we want to fine-tune the gaps and legally cater to potential new developments, such as LNG projects or shale gas exploration—we are not currently involved in those aspects of the sector. In addition to that, we have decided that from now on all contracts for oil and gas exploration will be made public. We are effectively streamlining petroleum legislation to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sector.</p><h4>How important is it to ensure transparency in the management of Mozambique's petroleum resources?</h4><p>The reason why we have had success thus far is because we inspire confidence in the investor community. Investors know that we play clean in terms of how they acquire acreage for exploration, and how they become involved in Mozambique. The processes are transparent. We have much to improve, but the contracts contain anti-corruption clauses. We are part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the government is taking numerous measures to guarantee the effective management of the sector.</p><h4>What changes can we expect to see in the new petroleum law?</h4><p>Usually, whatever documents we draft for the petroleum sector, such as laws and regulations, we make sure that we share the content with the stakeholders. In principle, we try to attract investors through whatever we undertake. Therefore, the legal framework has to satisfy the stakeholders and investors that come to Mozambique, and who play a valuable role here. We run workshops and hold consultations, deliver them the final draft, and seek to accommodate their wishes. In general, we listen to stakeholders because, at the end of the day, we are keen to attract investment to the country.</p><h4>Why is the LNG plant a crucial development and what is its status?</h4><p>It is crucial because we have to fund deep offshore reserves, which are very costly to develop. We believe that the only way to make sure we extract enough is to have an anchor project, such as LNG, to take advantage of the market. Then, we can take the anchor project and start to develop local projects such as power generation. And while we are looking at LNG exports, that doesn't mean we don't give priority to the local market; it is a priority for us because we are about adding value to Mozambique itself. However, in order to develop the high-cost reserves that require a wide range of expensive technology, we need to devise an anchor project. That project is basically about producing LNG to supply the entire market and inject value into the country. We have received many proposals from international investors keen to develop projects that we see as very beneficial in terms of generating employment, and improving both infrastructure and the capacity of local labor and content. We would like to see our national or private companies developing strategic partnerships with foreign companies to supply services, meaning that in 10 or 20 years we are able undertake this activity on our own.</p><h4>How would you characterize the government's efforts to ensure that investments in the petroleum sector translate into maximum benefits for Mozambicans?</h4><p>Although we don't have policies in place, such as for local content, we have to encourage companies to commit themselves to the country, taking into consideration its needs in terms of economic development. We are moving in the right direction. And, meanwhile, we certainly don't intend to rush through legislation for local content or corporate social responsibility (CSR), but rather introduce the right legal framework that both satisfies the investor community and ensures that Mozambique takes the greatest possible advantage of its circumstances for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Own Coal]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[own-coal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What first brought Jindal Steel &amp; Power Limited (JSPL) Mozambique Minerals to Mozambique?</h4><p>The core business of Jindal is steel and power, meaning that the idea behind coming here was to mine coal for our own steel production operations in India. Mozambique is one of the richest countries in the world for mineral resources. In 2008, when we saw that coal exploration in Mozambique was beginning, and particularly coking coal, we came here to set up a mining operation. Actually, before we set up here, two major companies had already done so. Our strategy is not to mine and sell the coal in the local market here, but to utilize it for our own international expansion program. Mozambican coal has the opportunity to respond to the growing market of coal in India, so one of the challenges is to find coal at competitive rates, which is where Mozambique fits into our plans. In addition, risk analysis suggests that Mozambique is a sensible destination for our company, as there is relatively reliable political stability, a strategic coastal location, and good people, in addition to the fact that things move fast here. Overall GDP growth in Mozambique has been at over 7% over the past decade. The only real issue is one of language, although many people speak English, and Portuguese is not too difficult to get a grasp of.</p><h4>You first began exporting from the mine in 2013. What are your next steps to develop your presence here in Mozambique?</h4><p>We took 1.5 years to explore the mine, and on finding the coal we signed a contract with the government of Mozambique, which gave us mining rights for 25 years. It took us another 1.5 years to develop the mine infrastructure. When fully operational in terms of necessary infrastructure, plants, accommodation, and utilities, we began exploiting it. Since mid-2013, we have exported more than 150,000 tons of coal. However, the quantity is short of our requirements, as the infrastructure is not yet synchronized with production. In Phase I, we have developed a 3 million ton per annum (Mtpa) capacity coal processing plant and now we are moving ahead with another 7 Mtpa plant so, within three to four years, we should be able to reach the 10 Mtpa level with an option of reaching up to a 20 Mtpa capacity if the infrastructure is adequately developed.</p><h4>How is the slurry pipeline providing an innovative solution to Mozambique's logistics challenges?</h4><p>The slurry pipeline, while not a new concept globally speaking, is innovative for Mozambique. We have already done preliminary studies that confirm the feasibility of transferring coal to the slurry pipeline. This would be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of transporting the resource to the nearest port, approximately 500 kilometers away. It is highly feasible, and will support infrastructural capacity.</p><h4>What efforts do you make to confront human capital challenges in Mozambique and provide development opportunities for your workforce?</h4><p>Developing human capital is an integral part of any business. If the proper resources in terms of equipment, manpower, and knowledge are present, then your business can be developed. We are trying to leverage what Jindal has already done in India and across the globe, and to convey our experience to workers. Training is necessary, however, at all levels of the organization, myself and other management-level staff included. We should strive for continuous, unlimited improvement of our skills and knowledge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind BHP Billiton's initial decision to invest in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>At that time, the Mozambican government was looking for foreign investors to get the economy moving in the wake of the civil war. At the same time, BHP Billiton was looking to expand its aluminum business. It therefore made perfect sense for both parties to commit to this large investment. Obviously, there were concerns at the time because ours was the first foreign investment in many years and the largest in Mozambique of the previous 30 years. There was a willingness on the part of the government to work with a foreign investor, although there were a number of challenges involved in being an early entrant.</p><h4>How would you characterize the role that Mozal has played in developing Mozambique's industrial sector?</h4><p>The project was realized in two phases in what became a more-than $2 billion investment. Since the early days of the project, there was an undertaking to develop local industry. The industrial park adjacent to Mozal today had not previously existed, and around 12 to 15 companies are providing services to Mozal that have developed over the years. Locally, Mozal spends between $120 million and $180 million a year in the service industry. The Mozal Linkages Program launched in the early days still focuses on developing local industry. The program concerns mentorship and ensures the sustainability of contractors and people that provide services to us. It is important that these companies and individuals sustain their competitiveness. Over 100 companies have completed the program and the feedback we have had suggests that its graduates over the last three years have displayed, on average, a 34% increase in turnover. Our aim is to help them grow their business beyond Mozal, and ultimately the ideal of sustainability underpins the program. And when we consider the job creation aspect, Mozal has roughly 1,200 directly employed staff and around 600 to 800 contractors. Approximately 6,000 to 7,000 people benefit from Mozal in total.</p><h4>What are the major challenges that you have faced investing in Mozambique, and how have you overcome them?</h4><p>One of the challenges that Mozal faced in the early days—and that some of the new players face—is infrastructure. There needs to be a match between the government's prioritization of infrastructure and actual projects. This is being tackled by a team within the government tasked with overcoming such specific challenges. Part of Mozal's project entailed investing in infrastructure, because we knew that was not a priority at the time from a governmental perspective. One such example was the construction of a bridge near our facilities, which positively served to bring the project online, swiftly enabling full-capacity operation. Another important factor for us was the availability of a skilled workforce. After so many years of internal strife, there were no large operators in the country, which meant a sore lack of skills. That was also built into Mozal's plan in terms of up-skilling people. In terms of financing, much has been done to reduce the level of perceived risk. Indeed, structures were put in place to address those questions, including an audit framework, to assure lenders that they would get a return on their investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[powering-up-mozambique]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Siemens been supporting Mozambican industry?<br></h4><p>Siemens has been present in Mozambique for around 60 years. We built the railway to South Africa, the pylons for the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Project, and the HVDC solution that delivers power to South Africa. Siemens was present before anyone even began to talk about gas and coal. We have been supporting Mozambique in terms of energy, education, and healthcare for decades. The CT scanners in the majority of hospitals across the country were also supplied by Siemens. We have a team of local people that provides maintenance services for this equipment. We receive support here locally, and from South Africa and Germany. We are also present in the energy and infrastructure sectors. And today, in the advent of the discovery of hydrocarbons, we're ready to share our experience of working in this specific industry. We're also positioning ourselves to continue supporting Mozambique and working on power generation, LNG plants, transmission lines, and new hospitals.</p><h4>What was behind the decision to increase Siemens' role and commitment to Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is a very important country for Siemens in Africa and is a key market in our growth strategy. We recently received a visit from the executive management in Germany, underlining the importance given to this market. As a company, Siemens sees many growth opportunities in Mozambique. With the opening of our new branch office earlier this year, we are gearing up for continued growth. Our new office in Maputo will help us to better serve our customers and support our business strategy. These are exciting times with many opportunities for Siemens and for Mozambique. For us, it is only the beginning of further growth.</p><h4>The German Minister of Technology and the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs also visited Mozambique recently. What was the significance of this?</h4><p>That arose from a project that we began working on two years ago with the German embassy in Maputo and our colleagues at the Siemens headquarters. In short, perceptions are changing about Africa as a continent, and Mozambique is considered a key market in Africa's growth story.</p><h4>What convinced them that the market had changed?</h4><p>The facts speak for themselves. Mozambique is experiencing rapid economic growth of over 7% per annum, making it one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. The country's coal mining industry is one of the drivers of economic growth. The Mozambique coastline has emerged as a new energy hub following large natural gas discoveries off shore. Mozambique is also experiencing rapid urbanization. Today, around 7 million people live in Mozambique's urban centres. And by 2030, around 14 million Mozambicans will live in cities. This all presents many opportunities for local and international companies. The spotlight is squarely on Mozambique and many companies around the world are focusing on the country.</p><h4>What role can local sourcing and content play in your operations here?</h4><p>Large infrastructure projects provide a great opportunity to not only create local jobs, but also invest in skills development for the future. As the main contractor, Siemens will ensure that Mozambicans benefit from the growth of their own country by being employed locally and help build infrastructure for their country. We are going to employ graduates from universities and give them necessary training. For example, for the substation component of the project we will employ more than 300 people, all locals. They will not only have much needed jobs, but will also benefit from training and skills transfer by working with world-class technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Telecomunicaçíµes de Moçambique (TDM) contributed to the economic development of Mozambique?<br></h4><p>TDM is 90% state-owned, with the remaining 10% owned by its employees. We compete with other market players on an equal basis; we provide quality solutions to telecommunications operators, organizations, and people contributing to the growth and development of the country.</p><h4>How would you characterize the ability of Mozambique's telecommunications infrastructure to meet the needs of rapid economic growth?</h4><p>We have a modern and robust telecommunications infrastructure, and yet its level of development is not uniform, and needs improvement. There are challenges ahead, in particularly with regards to investment in new infrastructure and the strengthening of existing services.</p><h4>What role does TDM play in the development of infrastructure?</h4><p>TDM is the main provider of telecommunications infrastructure in Mozambique for landlines, backhaul for mobile telephone services, broadband services, and the internet. As such, TDM is a major player in the economic development of the country. It is the only player in fixed-line telecommunications services, which, as you know, are in decline. Up to 2010, our network was exclusively linking all provincial capitals through a national broadband transmission network using 10,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cables, allowing TDM to satisfy demand. TDM also provides ADSL connections and a CDMA network that covers all provincial capitals and major cities. We have been providing CDMA services for voice calls and the internet to reach areas inaccessible through normal cable and fiber optics. We recently upgraded the CDMA network to 800 MHz. Recently, we also launched a more comprehensive service in an effort to provide coverage to more customers. We have also extended this to all products due to increased mobile phone usage, and also aim to introduce new services like SMS and email, and possibly media in the future.</p><h4>What is the main challenge of ensuring that Mozambique's telecommunications infrastructure reaches the entire population?</h4><p>Infrastructure is very expensive to put in place for widespread benefit. We need to address universal access, which means that we need to encompass certain areas that are not commercially viable, but rather a social or nationally strategic consideration. If people can efficiently interact, they are immediately in a better position to participate in national development. We have moved from being a public to a private company, although our core mission has remained to provide infrastructure for the benefit of all, while simultaneously dealing with issues related to the introduction of an open market.</p><h4>How do you balance TDM's social and commercial goals?</h4><p>This is a difficult balance to maintain, but throughout 2011 and 2012 we achieved a positive balance sheet. We are working to provide infrastructure for all as soon as possible, especially at hospitals and other public facilities. This, along with the connectivity of schools, is something we are determined to realize. It is only a matter of time, but the small projects are often the most difficult.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are new investments coming into Mozambique changing the hospitality sector in Maputo?</h4><p>Numerous companies are coming to Maputo and Mozambique, and the offer is growing, which will naturally impact the hotel industry. As long as offerings do not outpace demand, there shouldn't be untoward challenges to contend with. Overall, 2013 was a positive one, and our occupancy rates have matched those of the previous year, while operating expenses have efficiently been reduced. Around 95% of our guests are business travellers, and we are proud to host many government and business meetings. Although only 5% of our visitors are here for leisure, I am quite optimistic about the growth of this segment.</p><h4>What are you doing to raise weekend occupancy?</h4><p>Over the past year, we have managed to put together some attractive packages to encourage people to fly for the weekend, not only through various alliances with other entities, but also through the combination of unique experiences. We want to introduce potential guests to our exotic home and provide experiences that will allow them to know not only the city, but also its cuisine and authenticity.</p><h4>Would you say that Mozambique's tourism sector is now working more closely together to promote the country as a destination?</h4><p>There are certainly many opportunities to be realized. There has been an extra effort from both the public and private sectors, and all those willing to invest in Mozambique that truly appreciate this beautiful country. The number of international brands interested in it is rising, and can help position the country as a destination by marketing the variety and quality on offer.</p><div class="quote">“  Our well-travelled guests are increasingly demanding having had their high expectations of certain standards met in other countries at a uniform level. "</div><h4>What would you say is the significance of Polana within the Serena brand?</h4><p>Polana alone is a very strong and well-known brand, not only in Africa, but worldwide, with a 91-year pedigree. Serena stands for quality, with its 40 years history and portfolio of hotels in Africa and the Middle East. The combination of the two is a recipe for perfection.</p><h4>Polana has a long history in Maputo. Is that one of the factors that distinguishes the hotel?</h4><p>History makes this hotel very special and brings the proverbial “wow factor" to the experience, to which one might add the generational factor of knowing that parents and grandparents have also enjoyed a stay. The hotel, since its launch in 1922 has become the number one address, having undergone many historical phases, some easier than others, and throughout them all, has always kept its doors open. When Serena arrived in 2003 it added to  Polana Serena Hotel a distinguished quality and brand strength, which still further contributed to positioning the hotel. If you have a venue boasting both a name and a history, and that provides exceptional service and complete product offering that features a spa, wireless internet, restaurants, bar, beautiful landscaping, two pools, and a cultural life of its own, then you have a complete package. Our well-travelled guests are increasingly demanding, having had their high expectations of certain standards met in other countries at a uniform level. And, when they arrive at Polana their expectations are higher still when you consider that the hotel is known as the Grand-Dame of Maputo.</p><h4>Given the human capital challenges that you face, how do you ensure the highest level of service for your guests?</h4><p>First of all, I think it is matter of getting everybody involved. If you have a team that does not understand its leadership's goals, something needs to change in terms of communicating core ideals. If we fail to engage our staff and ensure their pride of being a part of not only Polana, but of Polana Serena, the fault lies with us. We need to lead by example, and engaging with the team is key at all times. Continuous training is a must as also is two-way communication, where we understanding our employees' challenges, while being open to their ideas. Team spirit and continuous engagement are what allow us to know and solve problems immediately.</p><h4>What are your goals for the hotel in 2014?</h4><p>For this year, we aim to keep improving our offer and the quality of service to always provide our guests good value for money. Also there is an exciting project for Polana Mar, which I am sure will bring added value to Polana Serena Hotel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated you to establish Portador Diario?<br></h4><p>I formerly worked in banking, but left that sector during during the global financial crisis. At that time, I was considerıng a wide array of possible careers, but then it occurred to me that many international companies were setting up headquarters in Maputo, only to realize that the postal system was notoriously unreliable. The further thought occurred that there was a market to be created by becoming their mailman, as it were, by establishing a courier company. We opened for business in 2007 with a focus on partnering national airline LAM to be able to distribute nationwide. And today, we hold around an 80% share of the courier market for documents and letters. We have continued our partnership with LAM and are now able to ship throughout Mozambique, as well as to South Africa, and Portugal.</p><h4>What major projects are you working on?</h4><p>Currently, we are working with Maputo City Council to set up a PO Box system for the city. Mozambique lacks a postal code system, which presents serious challenges for mail delivery. We will be providing space for the PO Box system and helping to operate it together with the municipality. Ultimately, the service will be extended nationwide.</p><h4>Logistics is problematic for many companies operating in Mozambique. How do you overcome related challenges to ensure timely delivery?</h4><p>Mozambique's infrastructure challenges directly impact our business, in particular the condition of the roads, which is why we work with LAM. There are additional bureaucratic challenges to contend with, as well as educational, commercial, and infrastructural obstacles to clear. The key is to overcome these problems with an overarching strategy; they can only be overcome on a day-to-day basis by developing creative solutions. In fact this day-to-day problem solving remains a sticking point in Mozambique, and one that demands long-term solutions conducive to broader development.</p><h4>Can you give an example of a creative solution?</h4><p>Let's imagine an urgent letter that needs to reach Tete, but that the schedules plane has taken off and the truck has also departed. The customer cannot simply be left to contend with this problem, and we would opt to rent an alternative vehicle. Our advantage lies in being local, which enables us to more effective local solutions than a larger international courier company.</p><h4>What is your current client profile?</h4><p>Most international companies prefer to work with international brands, but in contrast our main client base comprises Mozambican SMEs.</p><h4>What have been your greatest successes and how do you perceive the future of the courier sector?</h4><p>Our major success lies in assisting local SMEs, a vital segment of the Mozambican economy, to develop. I see the future as being contingent upon by the quality of infrastructure, in which I also include the national education system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Finance Minister of the Year for Emerging Europe in 2013, what accomplishments were you most proud of?</h4><p>First of all, policymaking is a team sport. Therefore, I am proud to accept this award on behalf of all of those who have worked hard along with me on moving Turkey forward through structural and macroeconomic reforms. As a team, we have managed to make our nation's economy far more inclusive and take the country to a higher level of development. Our reforms also provide a great pathway for sustainable growth over the coming decade. In our success story, fiscal discipline has played a great role. Historically, Turkey has suffered chronically from high budget deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. Our general government deficit, which stood at 10.8% of GDP when we took office in 2002, declined to just 1% in 2013. Turkey's fiscal deficit in 2013 was just one-fifth of the average deficit recorded by OECD member countries. As a result, our public sector debt fell from 74% in 2002 to 36.3% of GDP in 2013. If you look at that performance in the context of the Maastricht Criteria that apply to the countries in the eurozone, our debt-to-GDP ratio is just over half of the eurozone's 60% target set in the treaty. In fact, in the eurozone itself, only three small economies—Estonia, Luxembourg, and Latvia—perform better on that score than Turkey.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Finance's strategy to fight against Turkey's informal economy, which stands at roughly 26.5% of GDP?</h4><p>Significantly reducing the size of the shadow economy is of great importance to me. An informal economy leads to unfair competition, limits economies of scale, and, hence, hinders innovation and economic development. It also stands in the way of a properly functioning social security system. Since we took office in 2002, we have made great strides in reducing the size of the informal economy. Strengthening our country's tax audit capacity and increasing voluntary tax compliance are among our top priorities. I also believe the new Income Tax Law that I submitted to the Parliament in 2013 will be instrumental in incentivizing a switch to the formal economy. With the new law, we have combined the Income Tax Law and Corporate Tax Law into a single piece of legislation. This will enhance the simplicity, clarity, and the efficiency of revenue collection. It will also help to improve voluntary compliance. Through our investments into human resources and technology our tax audit capacity can now identify taxpayers and activities that are subject to tax by means of on-the-spot electronic inspection and audit. All of these measures boil down to one truly significant number. We have managed to reduce the share of informal employment within total employment from 52.1% in 2002 to 33.6% in January 2014, an 18.5% decline. However, more needs to be done. At 26.5% of GDP, our informal economy is still larger than the average 18.4% in the EU. Our main goal is to reduce informality to converge to the EU average over the medium term. In the long term, we aim to have an informal sector that accounts for a low share of GDP, similar to countries such as Germany. The Ministry of Finance is very pro-active on this front.</p><div class="quote">“We intend to simplify our tax code and create greater transparency and equity."</div><h4>What income tax reforms are priorities for the short term, and how will they affect Turkey's economy?</h4><p>We intend to simplify our tax code and create greater transparency and equity, while at the same time protecting taxpayers' rights and broadening the tax base. Therefore, our first priority is the approval of the new Income Tax Law, which was drafted with these objectives in mind. We submitted it to our parliament, the Grand National Assembly, in 2013. I expect the Draft Law to be ratified by the end of 2014. Additionally, we are now revising the Tax Procedure Law to harmonize it with our economic and social policies to make its provisions clearer and easier to implement. In addition to that, these reforms will lay the foundation for an effective, simple, and fair tax system to adequately fund our national priorities. These goals include sustainable development, an increase in our domestic savings rate, a reduction in the informal economy, and a lessening of regional disparities.</p><h4>How will Turkey's macroeconomic fundamentals prepare the economy for any shocks that the country may experience in 2014?</h4><p>There is no doubt that 2014 is shaping up to be a more complicated year for many emerging economies than most people expected. The combination of a reduction in market liquidity due to tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the simultaneous slowdown of the Chinese economy, the second-largest economy in the world, creates different challenges. Turkey's soft spot is its current account deficit (CAD). However, even there I expect significant adjustments in 2014. Surely, a major part of it will be because of the slowdown in domestic demand. Some of this was due to political uncertainty preceding local elections, some are due to tighter financial conditions, and others are due to the recent macro-prudential measures restricting credit growth. However, we expect that external demand will help lower our CAD with the recovery of the EU. The depreciation of the Turkish lira enhances the competitiveness of our exports. This comes at a good time, given a pickup of growth in the EU. The MENA region overall is also more stable now. Furthermore, gold imports are likely to fall and Turkey's tourism revenues will increase. With all these factors combined, the CAD will become more manageable. Furthermore, our flexible exchange rate and independent monetary policy will serve as automatic stabilizers. The depreciation of the lira reduces imports and makes exports more competitive, while higher interest rates increase savings, all leading to a lower CAD. Managing in a more crisis-prone global environment, we are also greatly helped by past reforms that have resulted in a sound and strong Turkish banking sector. It will cushion, rather than amplify, the external challenges that we are facing. For example, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of our banking system stood at 15.5% in February 2014. This ratio is nearly twice the required ratio of 8%. Finally, our strong fiscal position allows for room to counteract external shocks.</p><h4>Beyond the expected 4% growth rate, what other goals or targets does the Ministry of Finance have for 2014?</h4><p>In an environment of global volatility, contraction in global liquidity, and political tensions in some of our neighboring countries, preserving macroeconomic stability may be even more important than achieving our growth target. What is important is to reduce the CAD to manageable levels, keep the inflation rate at low levels (and in single digits), sustain the strong fiscal position, and raise savings. Combating inflation has been among our government's greatest success stories. At the end of 2002, Turkish inflation stood at 68.4%, while by the end of 2013, the rate had fallen to 7.4%. Our goal is to reduce it to the low-single digits. With fiscal discipline, we are giving leeway to the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) in its mandate to ensure price stability.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Mozambique today welcomes 2.4 million arrivals annually, and is aiming to reach 4 million arrivals by 2020. What is your strategy to achieve this?</h4><p>A decade ago, our goal was to reach 2.2 million tourists by 2013. Fortunately, we have achieved this. And now we are evaluating the strategic plan for the coming decade, and defining a strategy that will allow us to reach 4 million tourists by the year 2020. One of the main strategies is to continue promoting our country at tourism fairs, both regionally and internationally, such as INDABA in South Africa, which is one of the largest fairs on the continent. We have also taken part in other fairs hosted in Tanzania and Zimbabwe. On top on that, for the past three years we have organized a joint regional tourist exhibition with South Africa, Swaziland, and the Seychelles. To capitalize on all of these efforts, we have been in contact with regional television channels, such as South African Television 2, which has around 7 million viewers. We believe this helps to call attention to our country. We have also just launched “Discover Mozambique," an annual fair hosted in Maputo.</p><h4>Currently, around half of tourists in Mozambique come from South Africa. What regions are you looking to further afield?</h4><p>We are also looking to Europe, where Portugal of course stands out as a primary source market. In 2012, we received around 80,000 tourists from Portugal, followed by the UK with 57,000 visitors. From our total figure of 2.2 million tourists, 400,000 came from Europe. Naturally, we will continue to encourage growth in the number of European visitors. We have opened discussions with the Russian authorities, which view Mozambique as an attractive “sea and sun" destination. We are also opening the market to Asia, particularly China, among other countries. The Malaysian authorities are interested in opening up a route to Africa, and are considering Mozambique as a potential gateway to the continent.</p><h4>Infrastructure remains a challenge for Mozambique's tourism sector. What is the government doing to address this?</h4><p>The situation has actually improved in terms of infrastructure. Today, Maputo has an airport that can accommodate even the largest planes, which is a marked achievement for us; and we are rehabilitating the international airport at Pemba to improve the services offered. We have renovated other airports, such as Beira and Tete. Five years ago, the airport at Tete could host no more than two flights a week, but now it operates three or four per day. Meanwhile, there are several major roads under construction and others being rehabilitated. Our plan by 2017-2018 is to have the country connected from one end to the other through to Tanzania. In cooperation with Tanzania, we have built a bridge, the road connection of which has yet to be completed. National Highway 1, which connects Maputo with other cities, is good in sections, but certainly needs improvement. There is work to be done and the government wants to keep building roads and airports so that by 2020 Mozambique will become a more structured country and more welcoming for tourists.</p><div class="quote">“  We think that the coal and gas industries should help to stimulate a closing of the national infrastructure gap. "</div><h4>Most of the attention is focused on the extractive sector in Mozambique today. Why is tourism an important part of the economy?</h4><p>We think that the coal and gas industries should help to stimulate a closing of the national infrastructure gap for wider application, because within 50 to 100 years our natural resources might have been depleted. Tourism is not a limited resource; activity in this sector will continue employing the population and communities for the future. Tourism will also sustain related segments such as food and beverages. It has the potential to one day become the dynamo of the Mozambican economy. Today, tourism contributes around 6.8% of GDP, but for 2014 we are looking for a print of 7.1%. This is relatively low when compared to countries like Tanzania, (between 17% and 20% of GDP) and South Africa, but we will keep working to increase the attractiveness of our offering.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where are the greatest opportunities for tourism investments?</h4><p>First of all, Mozambique has a problematic shortfall of accommodation. Therefore, a core investment necessity is hotel construction, especially business hotels in Maputo, Cabo Delgado, and Pemba. Other areas of interest are Mocí­mboa da Praia, Palma, Tete, Nampula, and particularly in Nacala Velha, Nacala Porto, and in Nampula city itself. Sofala Province and the city of Beira are also important considerations. Another priority investment area is transportation. People arrive in Maputo on the sole airline operator, LAM. We would hope to see alternative flights to Tete, Ponta de Ouro, and Vilanculos in the future.</p><p>Meanwhile, we also present an eco-tourism offering. There are a variety of conservation areas in the country, such as the Maputo Special Reserve, which is the natural habitat of elephants, hippos, buffalo, and both forest and coastal terrain. We have wonderful landscapes, such as Niassa and Manica provinces, the former being an area that remains untouched by man. Mozambique has much to offer.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, Trinidad and Tobago held the Chairmanship of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM. How goes CARICOM's reform process, and which of its objectives have you prioritized?</h4><p>During the conference I stated that CARICOM is conscientiously working toward creating a more efficient integration movement. The process of reform in the Community has also been proceeding apace, and we have been seeking the input of all our stakeholders via consultations undertaken by a team of change facilitators, led by the secretary general. To date, national consultations in all member states and two associate members have been completed. With respect to the Draft Strategic Plan for the Caribbean Community 2015-2019, which was presented to the Heads, it is integral that the plan, once approved, becomes a living, vital document for our Community and should be used as a standard for assessing our performance and progress. Trinidad and Tobago wholly supports the thrust of the proposed vision, mission, and core values for the Community, which were formulated through engagement in a broad, public process. The six integrated strategic priorities—building economic resilience; building social resilience; building environmental resilience; building technological resilience; strengthening the CARICOM identity and spirit of community; and strengthening community governance—have further been elaborated into a strategic framework. The integration of the strategic priorities is important as we must seek to avoid an entangled landscape of overlapping programs with inconsistent goals. As Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, I would like to see greater attention paid to the process, whereby the transformation of the Secretariat's culture and structure would be achieved. The organization should shift to one that is results oriented as results are about improved conditions that are quantifiable. Performance measures should be set at the program level as this will help carry the link between vision and action throughout the Secretariat. Moreover, the process of tracking results should be manageable.</p><h4>During the 32nd CARICOM Summit, President Santos stated that, “the current decade can be—and will be—the decade of Latin America and the Caribbean." What is Colombia's importance for the CARICOM, and in what areas would you like to see further steps toward integration?</h4><p>At the 32nd Regular Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM held in July 2011 in St. Kitts and Nevis, the other CARICOM Heads and I were pleased to engage in dialogue with HE Juan Manuel Santos Calderon, President of Colombia, and welcomed his interest in strengthening his country's relations with CARICOM. At that meeting, CARICOM Heads and the President agreed on the need for strengthening south-south co-operation and the development of transportation links between CARICOM and Latin America, in particular air transportation, as a means of promoting deeper relations. Trade is a very important issue for Trinidad and Tobago, and, more specifically, the ability of the Trinidad and Tobago manufacturing sector to penetrate new markets. For this reason, we have been closely monitoring the progress made with respect to the study that aims at assisting CARICOM states to take greater advantage of existing trade agreements with third states such as Colombia. Once finalized, the study will serve to inform policy recommendations that would benefit the private sector in the region, allowing businesses to capitalize on the opportunities for the expansion of exports to Colombia. Additionally, during the 6th Summit of the Americas, which was held in Cartagena in 2012, I signed a multi-million dollar loan with the Andean Bank in Colombia. This deal provides Trinidad and Tobago with the funds for major infrastructural works on roads, transportation, telecommunications, power generation and transmission, water, and sanitation. The signing of this deal enabled Trinidad and Tobago to become a special member country of the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF), thereby making us eligible to receive financing. I believe this demonstrates our strong commitment to deepening regional integration, as well as promoting south-south cooperation in our efforts to advance development across Latin America and the Caribbean. Trinidad and Tobago also looks forward to receiving any support that could be provided by the government of Colombia as CARICOM seeks to implement its crime and security strategy, which was adopted by CARICOM Heads in February 2013 and which has the goal of significantly improving citizen security by creating a safe, just, and free Community.</p><div class="quote">“My government regards Colombia as an important trading partner."</div><h4>Colombia is Trinidad and Tobago's third largest import partner. What is the importance of this trade relationship, what tariff benefits does it enjoy and what competitive exports can the country offer Colombia in order to boost bilateral commerce?</h4><p>In 2011, Colombia was recorded as Trinidad and Tobago's third largest import partner, with imports from Colombia accounting for approximately 11% of total imports for Trinidad and Tobago. An analysis of the trade between both countries revealed that Trinidad and Tobago recorded a negative, primarily declining trade balance with Colombia during the period 2006-2011. We are the leading CARICOM exporter to and importer from Colombia. Our exports are significantly composed of energy products and include other liquefied petroleum gases, natural gas, urea, anhydrous ammonia, methanol, and bars and rods of non-alloy steel, while our imports from Colombia include other sugar, other raw cane sugar, palm oil and its fractions, and coconut, palm kernel, and babassu oil. My government regards Colombia as an important trading partner as Trinidad and Tobago is focused on expanding access to markets in Central and Latin America given their geographical proximity. Colombia is regarded as an interesting and viable market for CARICOM. This was concretized on July 24, 1994 with the signing of the Agreement on Trade, Economic, and Technical Cooperation between CARICOM and the government of the Republic of Colombia. The agreement serves to facilitate bilateral trade between CARICOM and Colombia. The objectives of the agreement are to strengthen economic relations, trade, and technical cooperation between CARICOM and Colombia. The agreement, which was negotiated in 1994, was initially a non-reciprocal agreement granting preferential tariff rates to CARICOM exports in the Colombian market. The agreement was re-negotiated in 1998 to provide for duty elimination/reduction on an agreed list of products from Colombia into the CARICOM More-Developed Countries (MDCs), namely Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago, as a member of CARICOM, benefits from duty-free access to a wide range of goods. Among the goods that benefit from duty-free access into Colombia are petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, mineral or chemical fertilizers, ferrous products, semi-finished products of iron or non-alloy steel, and uncoated paper and paper board. Upon the re-negotiation of the agreement in 1998, the MDCs of CARICOM agreed to provide immediate duty-free concessions on selected goods from Colombia. Accordingly, some of the goods which benefit from preferential access into Trinidad and Tobago (Jamaica, Barbados, and Guyana) are butter and other fats and oils, unmanufactured tobacco, seeds, fruits and spores (for sowing), leather, woven fabrics of cotton, and agricultural, horticultural, or forestry machinery. In addition to the promotion and expansion of goods traded between both parties, the agreement also encourages the promotion and protection of investments aimed at taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the markets of the parties and strengthening their competitiveness in the international market. It also supports the facilitation of the creation and operation of regional joint ventures, the development of technical and scientific cooperation activities that may be agreed upon between the parties, and the promotion of private sector activities, including business exchanges between the parties.</p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago's Health Minister, HE Dr Khan, said he intends to visit Colombia to seek specialists. What is your government's vision of what Colombia's health sector can offer your nation?</h4><p>A high level team from our Ministry of Health visited Colombia in 2013. The team visited several health institutions in Bogotá, Medellin, Barranquilla, and Cali to gain exposure specific to the clinical operations of high-quality medical institutions in Colombia, and to discuss the provision of low-priced medical services, the recruitment of foreign healthcare professionals, and the training of local medical practitioners. A follow up visit by our Chief Medical Officer and several consultants in the fields of cardiology, oncology, and pathology is currently being planned. Colombia has been very interested in developing health linkages with Trinidad and Tobago, and we welcome the opportunity to partner with Colombia as my government strives to provide quality and affordable healthcare to our citizens.</p><h4>Last year, Colombia's Foreign Relations Minister, HE Holguin, agreed to convene a meeting of airlines to examine the prospects of enhancing air links in the wider Caribbean and South America. How is Trinidad and Tobago advancing toward better air links with its Latin American partners, and what benefits to you see in linking with Colombia?</h4><p>In June 2013, consultations on airline connectivity were held in Santo Domingo in the context of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Foreign Affairs was present at the meeting. Discussions centered on the potentially great synergies between our local national airline, Caribbean Airlines (CAL), and AVIANCA, which could be beneficial to Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago as well as Latin America and the Caribbean. Officials from CAL and AVIANCA have agreed to examine potential scenarios for fares, schedules, payloads, new routes, and/or sharing existing routes. With my government's thrust to aggressively target the emerging markets of Latin America, improved air links with Colombia would offer another incentive for potential investors.</p><h4>Whilst Trinidad and Tobago is not yet the top choice for tourists from Colombia, it has all the potential to attract travellers. How can both nations collaborate in boosting the flow of tourists?</h4><p>Trinidad and Tobago, which was at one time in our history a Spanish-held territory, still exhibits many place names, foods, music, and other cultural traits derived from our Spanish heritage. Such elements may be used as a foundation by both our countries to attract travellers. In addition, Trinidad and Tobago's initiative to make Spanish the first foreign language of Trinidad and Tobago may also add to its attractiveness to Colombian visitors. Additionally, our twin island republic prides itself on offering a contrasting tourism product. In Trinidad, travellers may enjoy our unique cultural diversity and thriving business environment, while in Tobago travellers will find a semi-rustic and idyllic island environment focused on leisure tourism. Exchange visits between travel agents, tourism officials, and leisure journalists from both countries would further serve to increase and promote knowledge and awareness of the tourism product offered by both countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mexican market for BNP Paribas?</h4><p>This year we will celebrate our 10th anniversary here in Mexico. We initiated our activity in a shy way a few years back. In mid-2013, we decided to change the focus of the company. Our company was solely focused on the automotive finance business, and in response we have instituted a three-year development plan with our various subsidiaries. For the personal finance sector, 80% of growth for the next three years will come from the automotive business, so the focus in Mexico is on the automotive finance segment. The automotive industry has been growing steadily since the last crisis and hopes to continue on this path, aiming to reach 1.7 million units in a few years. In 2013, we closed with over 1 million units sold. We see a trend in the automotive finance market that is growing faster than the automotive industry. In 2013, our portfolio of auto units grew by 65%.</p><h4>What new products are you planning to launch in the automotive market?</h4><p>We have a great product for the automotive business through which we targeted the new and used vehicle market for SMEs and consumers. As well, we are focusing on the motorcycle segment. We enjoy strong collaboration with Harley-Davidson, Bombardier, and KTM. We aim to use KTM Finance as a brand to finance its motorcycle sales. We are also talking with Polaris to launch the same finance model, and have another agreement with Suzuki. We think that the motorcycle business has to grow; currently, the number is at 350,000 to 400,000 units a year, but the potential is huge. In Argentina, 800,000 motorcycles per year are sold, yet its population is just one-third that of Mexico.</p><div class="quote">“We have an excellent platform to service the portfolio, and are comfortable with the risks we are taking in the country."</div><h4>How are the company's services performing in the motorcycle market?</h4><p>I was with BNP in Argentina, where we are the leaders in motorcycle financing. We provide one out of every four loans for motorcycles in Argentina, meaning we have a strong knowledge of how to handle this credit. The performance of our finance services in the motorcycle market is the best in its class in Mexico. This market has a range of financing offers available, and BNP Paribas Personal Finance (BNPP PF) has the expertise to analyze and grant the necessary credit. Today we are working with prestigious brands such as Harley Davison, KTM as KTM Finance, and we are about to launch Suzuki Financial Services Moto. The service is the same as auto, as in less than 20 minutes the customer can find out the result of a credit application, and all they need is their customer ID without any other documentation.</p><h4>How do you feel about the potential of the automotive sector in Mexico?</h4><p>On the finance side, it is a mature market. There is a strong presence of the finance arm of the auto companies, but there are also a number of major banks here. It is mature, but it has a lot of potential, too. We like to be small in structure and flexible enough to provide alternatives to the products in the market. We are developing branded products for each one, and can customize our tools and develop insurance products specific for each brand. Within our offer there are several brands and companies that offer services to the companies. We support brands and support these groups.</p><h4>What are the advantages of belonging to an institution like BNP Paribas?</h4><p>We are strong at managing portfolios, and that is the greatest advantage we have. We also have a flexible approach to each business. If we compare our offer to other brands or banks, they usually offer just one alternative solution. We allow the customer to choose from five companies and select their insurance, depending on the price of said companies. We have extensive scoring systems that give immediate responses to clients.</p><h4>How does local knowledge contribute to the process of offering international products?</h4><p>We have an excellent platform to service the portfolio, and are comfortable with the risks we are taking in the country. We are comfortable in the boundaries, too, and have a competitive offer for credit and for conditions on rates and down payments. In the automotive business, interpersonal relations mean a lot, and this fact is true for Mexico as it is for every other country in the world.</p><h4>How many employees do you have?</h4><p>We have now 188 employees that enforce the platforms and service the credits, including an in-house collections department. There are only a few products that we outsource, as we like to control the process.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in automotive finance in Mexico?</h4><p>Financing in Mexico is showing an uptrend; finance is growing and will be a key player in reaching the volume expected for the automotive industry. Within the market, competiveness is on the rise, with a strong presence of captive financing companies and banks fighting to increase their participation in the market. Credit will have to grow; currently, the average credit penetration for new cars  is at around 50%, which is quite low for a mature market. We should be looking at 70% or 80% for finance penetration. If you combine all the factors, the potential for growth for the country and the automotive business and finance market is high; this is why we are investing.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the financial reform program and how will it affect your operations?</h4><p>In the short term, it seems that the implementation of the reforms is impacting car sales; cumulative figures are 0.6% higher compared to the same period last year. Dealers are cutting their sales forecasts for this year due to the uncertainty created by the tax reform package. In the case of BNPP PF, the impact will not be too high, because the dealers are using our offer to close customer deals, and our financing share among these partners is growing. The spirit of the financial reform is to make credit more available and affordable, but we will need to wait for the complementary laws to evaluate the final impact.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the automotive financing sector in Mexico in the medium term?</h4><p>Our outlook is that the uptrend will continue, and that the financing share will be key for the automotive industry, while the dealers will need a finance partner with better services and competitive offers. In 2013, BNPP PF grew 65% in the auto segment compared to 2012. For 2014, we are planning to grow by more than 70%. As mentioned, Mexico is a focus of development for BNPP PF, and we are in an aggressive development process that should allow us to quadruple our auto loans portfolio by 2016.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were awarded African Leader of the Year: 2014 by TBY. How does this reflect on your governance over the past eight years?</h4><p>Firstly, I of course feel great satisfaction at being awarded by such a prestigious and reputable organization. Secondly, it confirms that the international community is paying closer attention to Mozambique and viewing the country as an increasingly attractive place to do business.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive address for international investment?</h4><p>Our people are our greatest asset. Mozambicans have an outgoing demeanor, and for this reason, are easy-going and communicative. We should also recall the fact that even prior to the discovery of our mineral resources, Mozambique was growing at a rate of 7% per year, which had already attracted investor interest. The second factor is that our legal framework, and numerous organizations, such as CPI, work hard to facilitate the investment environment. Moreover, our legal framework is subject to systematic evaluation in light of national development to remain current and relevant to investment. Naturally, investors need incentives, and we have been working to ensure that both sides of the equation benefit from any investment made. The third factor rendering Mozambique attractive for business is our abundant resources. The country is rich in water, which makes it highly attractive for the development of agriculture and livestock. The other consideration is the recent emergence of mineral resources, which has attracted a significant volume of investment and is allowing Mozambique to make a decisive leap forward in terms of development. Another aspect that we cannot ignore is Mozambique's strategically advantageous location. While established trade links exist between the East and West, when coming from America or Europe, unless you sail through the Suez Canal, it is necessary to pass Mozambique. We understand that we face strong competition from the Suez Canal, which offers a shorter journey from the Northern hemisphere to Asia. Nonetheless, it is of fundamental importance that we take maximum advantage of our location in the interests of economic development.</p><h4>What role do you see Mozambique's mineral resources playing in terms of economic transformation?</h4><p>Today, the bulk of development in our mineral resources sector is in the coal industry, which remains in its infancy. Mozambique's gas reserves have yet to be developed; we will begin exporting gas in 2018. Our coal reserves, because of their location in the interior of the country and distance from the ocean, are creating growth in the logistics industry, which is crucial for the country because it is fuelling the establishment of more rapid and efficient connections. This has an immediate impact on our ports, which until very recently had a nominal capacity of less than 20 million tons. The Port of Maputo, for example, has a nominal capacity of 14 million tons annually, and had never reached capacity levels until two years ago. Within the next few years, we expect the port to handle around 18 million tons of cargo annually. We had formerly believed that our ports were of a realistic size relative to demand. Yet today, the ports of Beira and Nacala are both undergoing expansion. This is a reflection of the needs of the mineral resources sector, to which our logistics sector is also in the process of responding.</p><p>Meanwhile, our gas resources will hugely impact our economy. We already have hydroelectric power, but we also have the potential to create energy using gas. Natural gas has far greater economic promise than the basic production of energy. The impact of the gas sector can also develop downstream sectors, such as the petrochemical industry, which will create jobs and increase the level of expertise among Mozambicans.</p><h4>To what extent should international investors be concerned about the recent instability in central Mozambique?</h4><p>Such events will inevitably invite concerns on a human level. Let us not lose sight of the fact, however, that Mozambique is experiencing rapid growth, and producing raw materials and industrial products that contribute also to broader international development. The current domestic problem concerns a faction that has chosen to operate beyond the letter of the law, and to reject the stipulations of our constitution. One of the issues specified in the Rome General Peace Accords of 1992 was that those accords would be incorporated into the Constitution of Mozambique, which was duly done. Over time, our Constitution has been enhanced through the Assembly of the Republic, of which RENAMO is a part. All changes have been authorized by the assembly, and therefore current disputes fail to take into account the Rome Accords. The important question remains: is it worth investing in Mozambique? The answer is a resounding yes. The government of Mozambique respects both the law and the Rome Accords.</p><h4>Mozambique currently holds the presidency of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP). How would you characterize its role within the CPLP and its relations with other CPLP members?</h4><p>Mozambique enjoys excellent relations with other members of the CPLP that other member-states enjoy among themselves. A common problem for all members is that interactions predominantly take place in the cultural arena, which is by no means all they have to share. In recent years, Brazil has made significant investments in Mozambique, and despite the great distance between the two countries, there is now a significant and growing movement of Brazilian business toward our country. There has also been a growth of Angolan investments in Mozambique. Our current objective is to translate the political and cultural connections of the CPLP into the economic arena in a way that can be more fluid, consistent, and advantageous for everyone.</p><h4>Looking back over your presidency, what would you identify as your greatest achievement?</h4><p>The primary success has been the strengthening of Mozambican self-esteem, a feeling that can only grow with each passing success our country records. Second has been the decentralization that we have implemented, whereby the centers of power have been divided between Maputo, the seat of central government, and the provinces. Another element to consider is the greater involvement of the population in discussions on public affairs and efforts toward economic equality. Such efforts are reflected in the approximately MZN7 million distributed annually at a local level for perceived needs. It is also visible in the MZN7 million directed into infrastructure development, where, once again, decisions are made at a local level on the most pressing needs. Another area I would draw attention to is transport infrastructure, which has greatly improved, despite the long and costly distances travelled in Mozambique. Finally, education and technical training, even in smaller towns and provinces, has been raised to urban standards.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Mozambique, and what are your priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>On one hand, our priority is to ensure that a transition takes place so as to accelerate the overall development of Mozambique. And on the other it is to ensure that Mozambique can surpass its current GDP per capita of around $700-$800 to a level of $2,000 or above within the next five years. A third priority is for the first two elements to be reflected in the real incomes of the Mozambican people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the government's main priorities regarding the Strategic Plan for Institutional Development over the next five years?<br></h4><p>First, Mozambique will continue to develop and consolidate its institutions to better provide basic goods and services, while ensuring the proper conditions for continued economic development. Second, we plan to continue developing the country's infrastructure in order to promote economic advancement. Finally, the plan is designed to help Mozambique develop its human resources. This is an important priority, as it will ensure that all Mozambicans can benefit from the current wave of foreign investment.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Mozambique as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>Mozambique presents many advantages as a destination for foreign investment. First, due to its geo-strategic location on the eastern coast of Africa, the country serves as a natural connection between the countries of the African hinterland and the rest of the world. This provides a range of opportunities for development and investment in the logistics sector. Secondly, for the most part, Mozambique enjoys political, economic, and social stability. In addition, the country has a favorable legal framework for foreign investment. Mozambique also has a wealth of potential in its natural resources. The country has rich fishery resources, which create attractive investment opportunities in fishery and seafood processing of a diverse range of produce. Mozambique is also rich in natural beauty, which provides many opportunities for tourism investments in all segments of the market. Additionally, the existence of a diversity of rivers with permanent courses and many microclimates within the country creates favorable conditions for agriculture all year round.</p><h4>What is the government doing to ensure and improve the ease of investing and doing business in Mozambique?</h4><p>Over the last few years, Mozambique has undertaken institutional reforms and procedures to facilitate an improved environment for doing business and creating companies. We have simplified the procedures to reduce the time needed to obtain licenses and revised the forms related to the payment of taxes and fees.</p><div class="quote">“  Mozambique is a mature and stable country with a functioning democratic institution. "</div><h4>What would you say to investors who are concerned about events in the Central region of the country?</h4><p>Mozambique is a mature and stable country with a functioning democratic institution. We have always been able to resolve any problems the country has faced as they have arisen over time. We believe that the current situation will be short-lived. It is important to remember that we are a country born out of war against colonial powers, and following our independence we suffered through a long war of destabilization supported by foreign powers. As a result, we understand the harm that comes from war. We want peace, which is the only way to guarantee that we can achieve our aspirations for social and economic development.</p><h4>What will be the most important sectors for investment in the Mozambican economy over the coming years?</h4><p>Around 70% of the population lives in rural areas and their livelihoods come from agricultural activities. In this sense, agriculture will continue to be our number one priority due to its ability to contribute to rural development, reduce poverty, and promote dynamism in our processing industries. The infrastructure sector also offers good opportunities for development through public-private partnerships (PPPs). To this end, the government recently approved the Integrated Investment Program, which outlines a number of infrastructure projects that should be developed by 2016, with a view to tackling the necessities for development in many sectors of the economy. The energy and tourism sectors also offer many opportunities for investment.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in the Mozambican economy over the coming year?</h4><p>Our views for the coming year are outlined in the government's five-year plan, which contains a plan for social and economic development. The fight against poverty through the growth of agricultural and fisheries productivity as well as human development and promoting increased employment will be our main focuses for 2014. We predict inflation of around 5.6% and GDP growth of around 8%. The economy will continue to receive major investments in the natural resources sector, particularly gas, coal, and forestry. Mozambique will continue on its path to inclusive and sustainable development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for foreign investors?<br></h4><p>Mozambique has been, and will continue to be, a privileged investment destination, as international investors move to Africa in pursuit of fresher and more competitive markets for sources of raw materials. The country also offers viable locations for the processing of those resources in addition to the advantage that some African countries, including Mozambique, have in terms of labor, cost factors, social stability, and access to preferential markets, such as the EU, the US, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and China. Over the past 15 years, Mozambique has received investments to the tune of between $3 billion and $5 billion per annum from all around the world in various sectors, notably natural resources, agriculture and agro-industry, transport, communications, tourism and hospitality, industry, banking, and insurance, to name a few. It does not come as a surprise to anyone that our business environment has been registering remarkable improvements thanks to a wave of reforms undertaken by the government in close collaboration with the private sector. For over 20 years, the government has been working with representatives of the private sector in the identification of bottlenecks to business development. Reforms in the public sector have also been undertaken allowing public institutions to render faster and more efficient services. These reforms have encompassed various institutions, such as customs services, notaries and conservatories, ministries, and provincial and district government authorities, among others. Legal instruments have also been reformed, including labor laws, the legal framework on investments, and the commercial code. Also, at the heart of the matter is the need to improve the articulation between all institutions directly involved in investment promotion and facilitation which, in the past, used to work in isolation. There is an urgent need to bring them to work more closely together. I am talking of institutions such as the CPI, GAZEDA, CEPAGRI, the ministries of agriculture, finance, mineral resources, IPEME, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the National Tourism Authority (INATUR), the Zambeze Development Office, and the Institute for the Promotion of Exports (IPEX).</p><h4>What is the significance of Mozambique's mid-2013 foreign currency credit rating upgrade by Fitch?</h4><p>We are delighted to know that our excellent development efforts and macroeconomic management are starting to be recognized by the international community, particularly by credit rating institutions such as Fitch and others. It is also highly positive when Fitch recognizes, for example, that the expansion of Mozambique's coal sector has been gaining momentum, as well as the improvement in infrastructure. Therefore, Fitch's upgrade of the national economy is significant in boosting international investor and development partner confidence in Mozambique.</p><h4>To what extent should international investors be concerned about stability in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is a stable country, and the Mozambican people have proven capable of seeing beyond their differences. We proved this in 1992 when the government and Renamo signed the Rome Peace Agreement, ending 16 years of armed conflict. We have had multi-party general elections and municipal elections, which are open for all forces of society to contribute to the way the country is run. HE Armando Guebuza, the President of the Republic, has been one of the key guarantors of this openness through a program called “Open and Inclusive Presidency," through which he consults with all our citizens on the way the social and economic development process must be undertaken. It is true to say that certain events lately have marred the positive image that Mozambique has established, but, once again, we will be able to overcome these issues through dialogue.</p><div class="quote">“The economy should continue to grow at an average of 7% with the possibility of acceleratıon with the expected intensification of mining activity. "</div><h4>Which are the key sectors for investment in the Mozambican economy going forward?</h4><p>Despite the emergence of mineral resources, agriculture remains a priority sector  simply because it is the source of livelihood for most of our population. Given the availability of millions of hectares of arable land (about 35 million hectares), agriculture has the potential to generate substantial revenue through the export of cash crops such as rice, cotton, cashew nuts, and soya beans, among others, as well as covering the food security needs not only for Mozambique, but also for the SADC region. Other priority sectors include the mining sector, with a priority on the local processing of resources, notably coal and gas, agro-industry, general industry, hotels and tourism, banking and insurance, transport and communications, and construction.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy over the coming year?</h4><p>The economy should continue to grow at an average of 7% with the possibility of acceleration with the expected intensification of mining activity. In numerical terms, we expect real growth of 7.8% in 2014; inflation should be in the region of 5.6% and exports should continue to grow and diversify.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent is access to financing a major constraint on development in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>Unfortunately, access to credit, especially for national entrepreneurs to fund their participation in megaprojects at different stages (upstream, medium stream, and downstream), is still difficult and the new discoveries of natural resources pose even greater challenges to national credit institutions taking into account their inadequate funding structure, being specialized in short-term lending operations. To mitigate this situation, the government has decided to establish Banco Nacional de Investimento (BNI), a national investment and development institution. In this capacity, BNI provides financial advisory services and finance infrastructure to all sectors of the economy, as well as their respective value chain using its balance sheet funds, or through a co-financing approach. As of December 2012, BNI is 100% owned by the Mozambican government. The main objective is to bridge the government's development lines of credit to the private and public sectors.</p><h4>How are you working with SMEs to assist with access to financing?</h4><p>We prepare them for listing on the stock exchange. In Mozambique, the main source of funding for SMEs is the commercial banks, which is not recommendable for seed capital. Therefore, our role is to offer an alternative approach by helping them in IPO operations and taking a minority stake with exiting clauses. This financial arrangement improves SME risk profiles and makes them eligible to be listed in the second stock exchange window and bankable for commercial banks and other financial providers.</p><h4>How can the government oversee the development of natural resources so as to ensure sustainable long-term economic development for Mozambique?</h4><p>It can accomplish that by making sure all stakeholders are involved in every project, especially non-renewable resource projects, and this can be done by setting up friendly legislation and streamlining procedures for starting up and doing business. I am talking about improving the business environment, even considering the huge effort already made by the government in this respect, as investors can now register an SME in a single day.</p><h4>What balance should be struck between physical infrastructure and the regulatory framework?</h4><p>I think both are very significant. The regulatory framework doesn't cost anything, so it should be prioritized. For physical infrastructure, it is possible, along with a good regulatory framework, to finance projects using the public-private partnership (PPP) method. With the private sector involved, it is possible to improve infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications, which are vital to boosting the competiveness of the Mozambican economy.</p><h4>What does Mozambique's foreign currency credit rating upgrade by Fitch signal about the economy?</h4><p>It means that investors' money in Mozambique is safe and that borrowers can raise external funding and get a lower spread. In this sense, it was a positive move to facilitate development and deepen the capital and foreign currency markets. It also sends a signal that the country's macroeconomic management is holding, solidifying the country's risk profile.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy in 2014?</h4><p>The country has grown by around 7% annually for the past decade, and I expect the process to continue. Within five years, I expect GDP to have grown from $12 billion to about $30 billion and fourfold by 2030, taking into account the output of the current investment in mineral resources. This increase in the country's GDP will consequently increase GDP per capita.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[local-team-global-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Intellica first get started in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>Intellica is a consulting firm established in 2006 by a group of Mozambican consultants and incubated in a global audit and consulting firm. Due to the conflict of interest between auditors and consultants, the global firm had to discontinue consultation and focus its activities exclusively on the auditing market. In so doing, Intellica became a spin-off company of Ernst &amp; Young Moçambique Advisory and Corporate Finance Services.</p><h4>What services does Intellica provide to businesses in Mozambique?</h4><p>Currently, we have five main service lines: corporate finance, investment and structured finance advisory, IT consultancy, management consultancy, and strategy advisory. In management consultancy, we also offer human resources consultation.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in Mozambique?</h4><p>Intellica is the first choice in the market for consultancy services in Mozambique, and our major clients are key national Mozambican entities from both the private and public sectors. These include Hidroeléctrica de Cahorra Bassa (HCB), Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), Petromo, Banco de Moçambique, Aeroportos de Moçambique (ADM), Instituto de Gestío de Participaçíµes do Estado (IGEPE), Fundo de Energia (FUNAE), Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarboneto (ENH), and Portos e Caminhos de Ferrro de Moçambique (CFM). We basically work with all of the major players in the market.</p><div class="quote">“  Intellica is the first choice in the market for consultancy services in Mozambique. "</div><h4>What has made Intellica the lead player in Mozambique?</h4><p>Essentially, we never lose sight of our focus to create value for our customers. The client's interests always come first in our approach to the market. Then, there are many factors underpinning our success. First of all, most Intellica consultants are Mozambican and boast extensive experience gained at global auditing and consulting firms, having amassed experience in project management methodologies based on international practices. Therefore, Intellica is able to bet on local knowledge and capacity with a global vision. Our staff meets the highest standards required to provide supreme service. Secondly, we know the markets extremely well; this makes a difference. Additionally, the government prefers to promote local companies, and has a preference for contracting their services. Almost all of us at Intellica are Mozambican, meaning that our advantage is that we have local knowledge with a global vision.</p><h4>How does Intellica ensure that its clients still have access to the full range of global expertise?</h4><p>In some cases, we establish partnerships with international companies to acquire know-how on how to provide superior services to our clients. For one of our projects, we partnered with a global consultancy company. Back in 2009, we were providing management and strategy consultancy to the Program to Support Public Sector Reform (PARESP) by advising the government on the operation and consolidation of service desks in Matola, Maputo City, Quelimane, Nampula, Pemba, and Tete. We partnered with the Public Administration Brazilian Institute (IBAP) to provide consultancy and expertise in this particular service. Then, in 2010, we evaluated EDM's basic assets, such as its transmission lines, power plants, and dams. Internally lacking in engineering expertise, we established a partnership with Portuguese company ENSULMECI, a specialist in the electricity sector. We combined our financial and engineering expertise to provide EDM with an asset evaluation, underlining our key objective of creating value for our clients.</p><h4>What kind of corporate finance services do you provide?</h4><p>If a company wants to develop a new project, we can help it to do so through feasibility studies, or else help structure funding or fundraising efforts. We can develop specific financial products enabling a company to be listed on the stock exchange, either locally or internationally. And when a company wants to find a local partner, we can help by evaluating and recommending local companies we know. Currently, we have a large financial advisory project, whereby we are structuring $200 million in a sugar business investment. We look to international markets for investors to raise capital, as well as for investors to become equity shareholders. This is our main service as financial advisors. In regard to corporate finance, we help our clients to obtain loans from the banking system, and also perform feasibility studies, create business plans, and advise clients on the risk and potential of their respective markets.</p><h4>Would you say there is a lack of depth to Mozambique's domestic capital markets?</h4><p>Yes, this is the prime challenge we have in Mozambique: how to finance our companies and projects. Our financial institutions are still not very experienced at providing investment capital or private equity. If you want to invest more than $100 million, you have to go to the international market. There are some local banks that can provide this; however, they have to create a syndicate to provide the money. Relying on just one bank is not possible. We, therefore, need to develop our financial and capital markets. In terms of private equity, you also have to go to the international market. There is little expertise in local companies when dealing with the international market. In our case, as Intellica, we have a partnership with certain international financial institutions, such as investment banks. When we identify an opportunity, or a project that requires financing, we consult with international partners, and use their network to raise the capital.</p><h4>Do you think that getting international companies to list on the Bolsa de Valores de Moçambique (BVM) could be effective?</h4><p>Today, we are still not developed enough to attract major international companies. Perhaps by 2020 or 2025 we will be, but currently our market is very small. And as the government is the main provider, our private sector remains weak in comparison. I do believe that over the next decade this will change. We need to develop our private sector, and the state needs to let the private sector enjoy a free hand in the market and the broader economy.</p><h4>What areas offer the best opportunity for foreign investors considering entering Mozambique?</h4><p>The first area is infrastructure, especially transport infrastructure and logistics. We face many challenges on this front. Mozambique urgently needs an effective mechanism that facilitates the investment process, and one that allows investors to export their production. We currently lack infrastructure in the central regions of the country, for example, which is limiting our ability to export minerals, and investment to rectify this obstacle is essential. We also need greater investment in professional education. The government has actually adopted a good policy in its program to reform and improve education potential, but more is still required. We urgently need investment in these areas because we still lack the technicians needed to respond to demand from new investment, and must be prepared for the growing demand of tomorrow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role of Banco Comercial e de Investimentos (BCI)?</h4><p>BCI is one of the leading banks in Mozambique, and of particular importance for SMEs. We are squarely focused on the economic and social development of the country, having become one of the most preferred banks among Mozambicans, and are held in high regard. We have also registered growth over the past few years. BCI is known for taking a novel approach to individual business segments. For example, we were the first to launch integrated business centers, which are unique venues where we serve diverse clients with corporate, exclusive, and retail areas, under one roof. We have also been active market leaders in electronic channels, as well as the biggest card issuer with the most point of sales. We have also registered considerable success in non-traditional channels, such as online banking, where we continue to grow. We have paid significant attention to human resources, having trained and fully prepared our people to be able to provide superlative service quality. In fact, we have won a number of awards, and have recently been named best commercial bank.</p><h4>What innovative solutions have you tailored to the Mozambican market?</h4><p>In October 2013, we launched a credit line for Mozambican SMEs. This was the first time that a bank had allowed a 0% spread over the prime rate to SMEs. We understood that pricing was the question, and that there was a barrier to be broken in order to bring the small companies to the market. There was also a need to communicate with the market regarding our new corporate status. Today, we are considering a second line, as the first will shortly reach capacity. This would give us a better picture of the true nature of the market.</p><h4>In terms of the SME segment, what is the advantage of working with BCI rather than a bank that focuses solely on SMEs?</h4><p>We have a wider offer; our specific service model allocates managers specifically to SMEs. We have exclusive conditions in terms of credit lines and not only consider credit needs, but also the day-to-day needs of SMEs. We also look at liquidity management and payment solutions. We provide export and import solutions in order to make a complete offer that matches the needs of such companies. We have also supported many of the activities of the Institute for the Promotion of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (IPEME) to foster the development of entrepreneurs nationwide. We have been working very closely with the government in support of a wide range of new SMEs. We strongly believe that SMEs will be crucial for Mozambique in terms of generating equity. This will indirectly assist larger companies engaged in new projects, and those undertaking new operations, as SMEs are a key link in the value chain in Mozambique.</p><h4>What is the driver of growth in the retail segment?</h4><p>I think momentum comes from both formerly unbanked clients and those switching banks. We have notably grown in terms of client numbers, including those for whom we were their first bank. Other clients have switched banks to us, either during a campaign or upon word of mouth recommendation. Today, we are focused on enlarging our client number by catering to unbanked Mozambicans, and this activity is part of the government's target of enlarging banking coverage nationwide. It also explains why we have opened many branches in uncovered districts of the country. We opened six new branches in 2013, and plan for 12 more in 2014.</p><h4>Does technology play a big part in reaching rural communities?</h4><p>Yes, we rely on it heavily to deliver our services. We are even planning an important experiment whereby we will be the first to launch a mobile bank, which will effectively be a travelling branch, the staff of which will enable people to open an account, make deposits and withdrawals, and use ATMs.</p><h4>What is the advantage of working with BCI for international corporates coming into Mozambique?</h4><p>BCI is a strong, sustainable, profitable, and liquid bank. We have launched a corporate direct channel with a corporate department that deals with large companies that are settled or want to settle their operations in Mozambique. This is one of the core areas of our structure. We have created specific client managers for these clients, and are banking all of the major companies present in Mozambique. The dedicated desks established to address the needs of specific segments within the economy mean that we have, say, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture-related know-how that allows us to better help with specific projects that require specialized knowledge. Regarding the capability of our own funds and the volume of credit lines, we can handle what we have put in place and the investment banking operation that is able to support large-scale projects, such as project finance, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and corporate banking, and so forth. Once a project's requirement outgrows our local capacities, we call on the support of our colleagues in Portugal. The international platform of financial groups to which we belong is wide and supports Mozambique's principle commercial and investment relations. We have a platform in South Africa, and others in Brazil, China, and the US, enabling us to confidently support the movement of capital and goods worldwide. This is a comparative advantage that we have when targeting those clients.</p><h4>Is increased competition a positive force in the market?</h4><p>The market is essentially controlled by two banks of significant market share, namely Millenium bim and BCI. Often, what you observe in the banking sector is a leader and group of banks that are chipping away at it; however, in Mozambique you basically only have BCI. There should be a larger number of players here to foster a more balanced market. There is a third level of banks that are facing more serious competition as they are small and cannot adequately compete. Each bank is positioning itself with a general approach, so there is room in the local banking universe for niche services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted United Bank for Africa Mozambique (UBA) to enter the Mozambican market in 2010?<br></h4><p>The country is blessed with very rich mineral resources, a growing economy and stable and well-run government. Since investment will only go to where it is welcomed, we intend to carry out a lot of long-term investment in the country because of these business opportunities and solid governance enjoyed by the country. We celebrated our third anniversary in the country at the end of 2013 and currently have two branches in Maputo, while the third one will be opened shortly in Nampula. Our primary focus is corporate and commercial banking, while also reaching out to retail banking, mainly through our e-banking channel. Our business philosophy rests on value-chain banking.</p><h4>What is UBA's approach to the retail segment in Mozambique?</h4><p>UBA offers unique banking products that help us drive the retail banking business and financial inclusion. A high percentage of the 23 million population remains unbanked, which makes for a huge untapped potential. Leveraging on our group's strength and expertise in e-banking, we are constantly deploying e-banking products to serve this segment of the population. One of these unique products is our UBA Africard, which is a Visa pre-paid card. This e-wallet is increasingly integrating the unbanked population into the financial system. We invite the public to benefit from the different banking products available from UBA that are tailor-made for each customer type.</p><h4>What are the corporate, retail, and SME ratios of your client portfolio?</h4><p>About 45% of our business today is corporate, with 35% SMEs and 20% retail. Our business philosophy is entrenched in value-chain banking. Corporate clients have a diversity of needs. They need strong suppliers and service providers and also need to take care of their staff. At UBA, we identify and provide financial support to these areas under our value-chain banking strategy. When you support the service providers at the center of the value chain, it eases the pressure on our corporate customers, who are at the top of the chain.</p><h4>What makes UBA unique in the Mozambican banking sector?</h4><p>The fact remains that UBA specializes in African businesses. Our experience in other African countries helps us develop African-made solutions for specific needs. No one can understand Africa and African businesses better than Africans. Therefore, being a pan-African bank, UBA always seeks to constantly identify these needs and offer specific solutions for them. Our operations are driven by our group policies, which are domesticated in line with the local country's regulations. UBA group is a large entity, but is also aware of local requirements of any country it operates in, as regulations differ country by country. Our ability to align our policies to the local regulations has remained a great plus for us. Another strength of UBA is that we have, at the group level, specialized divisions for every key banking area. We constantly leverage these specialized skills to deploy service and value to our numerous customers, which also makes us unique. Our staff at UBA Mozambique can be deployed to take up higher roles in any office within our group. We regularly send our staff for training to acquire greater skills and widen their understanding of Africa. We also have products that facilitate trade across the African countries where we have operations.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of Mozambique for UBA as a pan-African bank?</h4><p>The Mozambican economy, like any other, requires financial support to be able to maximise its potential. Our presence here will, therefore, support the ongoing developmental process in the country, of course while also providing returns to our shareholders. It is our belief that Mozambique will become one of the African success stories.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's role within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP)?<br></h4><p>The performance of the pro tempore presidency of the CPLP during Mozambique's tenure reveals the importance of the potential contributions of the CPLP to face future challenges on a global scale, in step with social and economic development. In the context of the theme of the Mozambican presidency, “Food and Nutrition Security," Mozambique oversaw the constitution of a Council of Food and Nutrition Security of the CPLP. We follow a strategic plan to ensure alignment on the issue of food sovereignty, and a memorandum with the FAO, to be embodied in the “Together Against Hunger" program, which raises awareness and funds for projects to combat hunger and malnutrition in our countries. Our vision is of a community of countries with a healthy and active human capital, free from hunger and poverty in a context of progressive realization of the human right to adequate food and respect for national sovereignty.</p><h4>How has the recent surge of investment in Mozambique's mineral resources sector affected its economic relationship with the countries of the CPLP?</h4><p>I believe that this can only strengthen Mozambique, the CPLP, and its member states. There are about 250 million Portuguese speakers— by 2050 this is expected to have reached 323 million—on four continents, and countries of high economic potential. In terms of economic potential, Brazil is in the BRICS group; Angola and Mozambique, which may become the sixth largest gas producer after the US, Canada, Russia, Iran, and Qatar, with growth rates of around 8%; and East Timor, which also has prospects of high double-digit growth rates, thanks to oil and natural gas. In this area, Brazil, Angola, and Mozambique represent over 50% of oil discoveries made over the past eight years. The economies of CPLP countries, accompanied by Mozambique, enjoy considerable growth potential. I believe that these optimistic prospects should encourage policymakers to address the challenges and opportunities of growth and development toward an economic transformation of member countries supported by growth across a diversity of sectors—extractive, agriculture, and industry. The economic rise of countries should also create better employment opportunities that support growth more inclusively.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive investment destination for investors from other CPLP countries?</h4><p>Mozambique shares with CPLP countries its historic past and common objectives that are underpinned by the Portuguese language. It shares the same regional area of economic integration with Angola, the SADC, and is highly committed to the constant sharing of knowledge among our communities. Mozambique has revealed markedly high, sustainable economic growth, reflecting a skilled national workforce that is capable and applied.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities during your tenure as Executive Secretary of the CPLP?</h4><p>In 2013, within the scope of my mandate, I have already made official visits to the member states of Angola, Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, Cape Verde, and East Timor, before the Council of Ministers in July 2013. I have still not visited Guinea-Bissau given the political situation in the country, although CPLP international missions have been there. We must not forget that ours is a community composed of countries the development of which is quite varied, and ultimately we will be judged on our ability to walk at the same pace. However, I am very optimistic. I hope to receive approval for the next CPLP Summit, in July 2014, of a document that will serve as a roadmap for organizational and policy changes. These changes will make the CPLP a common project, and will include a mobilizing strategy with a definition of stable goals as a guide to the organization in the pursuit of excellence for our populations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Sweden has a long-standing relationship with Mozambique. In fact, it started in 1964 when the first President of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), Eduardo Mondlane, visited Sweden requesting support for the Mozambican Institute in Tanzania, the cradle of Mozambican independence. Consequently, in 2014 we celebrate 50 years of cooperation between Swedes and Mozambicans. Sweden has continued to nurture its presence in Mozambique since independence in 1975 in the areas of diplomacy, development cooperation, and trade.<br></p><p>In October 2013, I had the opportunity to visit Mozambique with a delegation from Sweden to learn more about our common experience and to contribute to the vibrant continuation of our relations. I was very well received by Prime Minister Dr. Alberto Vaquina and had the opportunity to meet with politicians, business people, academics, and members of civil society, among others. Meeting with Mozambican institutions like the Investment Promotion Centre (CPI), the National Bank of Investment (BNI), and the Institute of Directors (IoD), as well as with representatives from Swedish businesses established in Mozambique, I recognized their enthusiasm for the exciting economic developments that are currently taking place here. I could both see and feel that Mozambique is on the move and undergoing dynamic development.</p><p>I observed Mozambique's transformation into a market economy and a multiparty democracy. And while the journey has been impressive, further improvement is still required. I think transparency is a key issue, as corruption is a major obstacle to economic development, not only in Mozambique, but in many other countries, distorting markets and competition. Being a politician myself, I hope and count on the 2014 elections consolidating multiparty democracy and providing ample space for all political parties.</p><div class="quote">“  Swedish-Mozambican trade and business links should be improved in the years to come and I feel very strongly about promoting these, as there are mutual benefits for our two countries. "</div><p>Clearly then, Mozambique faces many challenges, with a young and growing population that needs education and professional training, as well as quality health services, in order to capture the opportunities of strong economic growth. Through development cooperation, Sweden will continue to work with the government of Mozambique to respond to these challenges. We will also encourage Swedish companies to consider business opportunities in Mozambique.</p><p>Swedish technology from Ericsson is used to develop telecommunications in Mozambique, and ABB transformers are being used in both public and private energy projects around the country. Atlas Copco and Sandvik provide machinery and services for the mining industry, whereas Volvo Construction Equipment is used in the construction industry. There is definitely room for more Swedish companies to bring their business to Mozambique. If they respond to the challenges of building their investments on a long-term basis, providing technology and know-how, as well as training young Mozambicans for this new phase of development, I am convinced that they will enjoy success. Swedish-Mozambican trade and business links should be improved in the years to come and I feel very strongly about promoting these, as there are mutual benefits for our two countries.</p><p>Our development cooperation program is significant and covers a number of sectors, channeled mainly through the public sector, but also through the private sector and civil society. Sweden has a rather unique cooperation program with the University of Eduardo Mondlane, which has been ongoing since 1978, resulting in knowledge transfer and research in fields such as agriculture, veterinary science, engineering, and archeology. During the 16 years of war, Sweden was not only one of the major donors of humanitarian aid, but also continued to invest in areas such as education and energy. These are crucial sectors of development for Mozambique and we are pleased that Swedish science and technology, as well as industrial expertise, has been used to accelerate economic growth. We are proud to be longstanding partners with Mozambique, during both good times and bad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013 Aberdeen hosted a high-level government delegation from Mozambique to share its experience in developing oil and gas infrastructure. What role can Scotland play as a partner in helping Mozambique to develop its emerging offshore gas industry?<br></h4><p>Scotland has an incredible wealth of energy resources obtained using a range of technologies, which could help Mozambique fully capitalize on its oil and gas industry. Oil and gas is the largest industry in Scotland, and over the past four decades production in the North Sea has created a strong supply chain, a skilled workforce, a renowned academic sector, and well-developed energy infrastructure. We have developed specific strengths in several key areas, which have helped to transform developments globally as well as at home. Scottish industry has taken drilling and well technology to new levels, while the subsea-engineering technology now deployed around the world was borne out of necessity in North Sea waters. Much of the global subsea activity is now developed, designed, and delivered in Scotland. The subsea market is predicted to double over the next five years, and with the UK accounting for one-third of the current market, we will have a significant role to play in this growth. We've also developed world-class expertise in many other areas including production and process management, asset integrity, downhole technology, and project management.</p><h4>How can Mozambican companies benefit from Scotland's experience and expertise in the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Scottish companies have built up a significant expertise over the past 40 years that could benefit Mozambican companies. For example, according to Ernst &amp; Young's review of the UK oil field services industry in 2012, the supply chain across the UK has achieved revenues of over $39 billion a year. In Scotland alone, 2,000 companies operate within the supply chain, and although there is a concentration around Aberdeen, many of these are located elsewhere in Scotland. These span the entire oil and gas upstream lifecycle, through exploration, development, production, and decommissioning.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for Scottish investment?</h4><p>Africa remains one of the primary drivers of the deepwater industry alongside the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. Indeed, current exploration and production drilling activities in the Gulf of Guinea and offshore Mozambique and Tanzania have increased global demand for deepwater drilling assets. Successes in these markets are adding additional fields to the region's development backlog and further establishing Africa as a hub of deepwater activity. In particular, new exploration, such as the offshore Rovuma basin in Mozambique and Tanzania, has the potential to boost regional production and exports substantially. Scotland's significant offshore experience, built up over 40 years of harsh conditions in the North Sea, means our companies are ideally placed to support Mozambique as it realizes its potential in this area.</p><div class="quote">“  Africa remains one of the primary drivers of the deepwater industry alongside the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. "</div><h4>How would an independent Scotland leverage its expertise in the oil and gas sector to build diplomatic relationships internationally?</h4><p>An independent Scotland would continue to develop relationships internationally to promote its expertise within the oil and gas industry worldwide. We would leverage Scotland's renown in the international arena and our approach to global affairs to develop Scotland's economy, which would be key to ensuring the continued and increased prosperity of the nation.</p><h4>What role are Scottish investors playing in the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>Sustainable Energy Scotland and Scottish Development International assist companies to internationalize, with a number of companies evaluating locations for future expansion. Africa is a key market for us and information continues to be gathered to inform companies of the opportunities.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of economic relations between Scotland and Mozambique?</h4><p>Scotland is keen to strengthen economic relations with Mozambique. Developing close links with our research and academic institutions, as well as our oil and gas businesses, will be beneficial for both parties.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the growth of the gas and coal industries determined your sector focus?<br></h4><p>As investment into the mining sector increases, port and transport infrastructure needs to keep pace with our competitors. We have therefore concentrated on the engineering opportunities at the port and petroleum downstream distribution infrastructure. There has been very little investment in this sector since the late 1960s, and despite Mozambican ports servicing six landlocked neighbors, we lacked LPG or bitumen terminals and adequate storage infrastructure. The entire Southern SADC Region depends on trucking from South Africa. We have, while upgrading and rehabilitating the Maputo Petroleum Terminal, introduced LPG and Bitumen Terminals, and are in the process of constructing storage facilities in association with Petromoc. We are doing the same in Beira port and propose subsequently to repeat it in Nacala port, too.</p><h4>Do you feel that the commercialization of agriculture has the potential to be a major driver of economic growth?</h4><p>Around 70% of Mozambicans are rural sustenance farmers who do not produce in commercial volume; hence, they do not contribute to the formal economy. The challenge for the government is to educate these farmers, while creating and providing the infrastructure for commercial agriculture. This is so that within the medium term, rural Mozambicans become contributing members of the economy. Commercial agriculture has two important elements, the corporate sponsored large farms and the local entrepreneurial smallholdings. The large farms are important in providing initial investment to create the agricultural infrastructure and to employ the population on a large scale in economically productive activity, thus ensuring equitable growth. Then again, there has to be a balance between food crops, such as grain and beans, and cash crops like rubber, coffee, and oil seeds. Food crops are not commercially viable without government subsidies due to developed countries budgeting for a cheaper food bill for their large urban populations through agricultural support.</p><h4>What are Mozambique Holdings' initiatives in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>We have acquired 10,000 acres of land in Zambezia Province and are introducing rubber cultivation to Mozambique. After due diligence, we developed a nursery with technical assistance from the Rubber Board of India to plant 2,000 plants as a pilot program two years ago. Since the progress of these plants is satisfactory, we have expanded the nursery and are planting a further 20,000 in 2014 and have budgeted to plant 1,000 acres over next five years. Since the process requires a large number of workers, we improved village conditions by providing an elementary school and a health center. We also employed all the able bodied villagers, numbering over 600 and created a 200 acre pigeon-pea farm, which is the common local crop that the villagers are skilled in cultivating. We will add further workers over time and teach them rubber-planting skills as we progress and introduce one or two more short-term crops, such as turmeric and ginger, to balance the cash flows, since rubber is a long-gestation crop.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for international investment?</h4><p>Mozambique has a land area twice that of Germany and a coastline of 2,400 kilometers with a population of just 20 million. It has vast arable land with ample water sources and stable ground water, offering vast agriculture and fishing opportunities. Mozambique's mineral and energy potential are well documented, and the country was the largest tourist destination during colonial times. Moreover, Mozambicans have been exposed to foreign cultures due to the country's long coastline. Mozambique is welcoming to overseas initiatives in entrepreneurship and technology. The government has also been actively promoting international investment to develop its resources and employ its people productively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the strength of the financial system in Mozambique?</h4><p>Unlike in developed markets, where the capital markets play a leading role in the financial system, in Mozambique the banks are the primary dynamo of the economy. Therefore, an analysis of the Mozambican financial system—the current outlook for which is positive—must rely on an analysis of the banking system. Despite the international financial crisis impacting most advanced economies, the Mozambican banking system continues to develop normally, in a healthy, robust, and transparent manner. Over the past five years, the system has seen growth of 100% in net assets, deposits, and total credit. In addition, the banks have been active in complying with the prudential ratios and limits established by the Bank of Mozambique for the protection of depositors and investors. During the same five-year period, there was also an increase in capital, which contributed to an increase in credit and helped in maintaining high levels of liquidity in the banking system. This is crucial for maintaining trust. Indeed, the solvency ratio of the Mozambican banking system is 15%, which is more than double the stipulated level. Another positive aspect is that the level of overdue loans in the banking system remains at just 5%.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the current reforms underway in Mozambique's banking regulatory system?</h4><p>They are having a positive effect, and our regulatory system incorporates the principle recommendations of the Basel Committee, as adapted for Mozambique. In this context, the legislation creates ideal conditions for the fostering of banking activity in a favorable climate for all interested parties. Mozambique's banking legislation has undergone a number of reforms over the past two decades. These have allowed the banking sector to thrive with the emergence of new institutions and the growth of the economy. And now, given recent events in the international financial system, Mozambique is also in the process of updating its banking regulations to achieve a number of goals. First, in order to strengthen our ability to prevent and manage financial crises, we have approved the creation of a deposit guarantee fund, and have approved a regulation allowing the Bank of Mozambique to become the lender of last resort and provide emergency liquidity assistance to temporarily insolvent financial institutions. In addition, we are approving contingency plans for credit institutions in Mozambique. Secondly, in order to improve technical supervision, we have adopted a new risk-based methodology. Finally, we are also working to improve the classification of loans in line with international standards, to intensify our anti-money laundering measures, and to strengthen cooperation with other supervisory authorities.</p><h4>How does the Bank plan to confront the risks posted by the expansion of the extractive sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>The discovery and exploitation of natural resources in Mozambique in recent times has been a subject of much debate among the country's macroeconomic policymakers, as well as in the private sector and civil society. The country is aware of the risks and possible impacts that can arise from the exploitation of the natural resource sector. Over the medium to long term, commenced development of the extractive sector is expected to bring marked improvement to the country's key macroeconomic indicators. In terms of the fiscal sector, the IMF projects tax revenues rising to around 34% of GDP in 2020, up from the current 23%. We will also see a reduction of total expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Initially, this ratio will increase to reflect the high investments in infrastructure to support natural resource development. Over the long term, we expect expenditure to stabilize at around 30% less than revenues, creating a budget surplus. This will be coupled with a reduction in the role of foreign aid in the state budget. In the external sector, we will see an improvement in the current account balance over the long term, as well as an increase in foreign reserves. However, in the short term, continued imports of goods and machinery for megaprojects will see the current account deficit increase. The high inflow of external resources and increased state revenues will also pose challenges to the macroeconomic management of the country. The first challenge will be the lack of internal absorption capacity, which will create inflationary pressure. If increased capital inflows are not coupled with a rise in goods and services in the economy, inflation can result. Secondly, the increased expenditure in the short term to support infrastructure development may lead to an increase in public debt. Finally, massive capital inflows might lead to currency depreciation and the so-called “Dutch disease." However, there is no evidence of this phenomenon occurring. There is also a risk that this would leave Mozambique vulnerable to price shocks in oil and minerals. In view of these concerns, the Bank recommends the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. Among the many possibilities for spending Mozambique's resource wealth, the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund is the most suitable alternative for the current macroeconomic climate.</p><div class="quote">“  The Bank of Mozambique has pursued a monetary policy over the past two years geared at creating space for credit growth in the private sector. "</div><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy, and what are your monetary policy priorities for 2014?</h4><p>The performance of the Mozambican economy remains positive and in line with the macroeconomic targets set by the government for 2013. More recent data indicates that in 2012, real GDP grew at a rate of 7.2% (similar to the 7.3% average of the past five years). In 2013, the country was devastated by floods, especially in the southern regions, which hampered the performance of the agricultural sector. Since agriculture is the sector with the largest share of GDP, this contributed to a deceleration of the growth rate in the first quarter to 4.3%. However, data from the second quarter indicates an improvement in sector performance (in particular the production of foodstuffs) and economic activity in general, with real growth year on year at 8.7% in the second quarter of the current year's GDP. Inflation data shows an evolution of this indicator up to September, in line with government forecasts for the year-end. In pursuing the objectives of monetary policy, the Bank of Mozambique has pursued a monetary policy over the past two years geared at creating space for credit growth in the private sector, and in this manner contributing to an inclusive and stronger economic growth. The Bank of Mozambique has focused interventions via the interbank markets in order to regulate bank liquidity and to ensure stability of the exchange rate. Information on inflation until September, as well as the Bank's short and medium term projections, suggests that the 4.4% average inflation target set for 2013 will be met. For 2014, monetary policy will remain geared toward meeting the main macroeconomic objectives of the government. However, we realize that 2014 is an election year and that the commissioning of a further 10 municipalities could contribute to accelerating inflation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Banco Terra balance its social goals with being a for-profit bank?<br></h4><p>One of our major shareholders is Rabobank of the Netherlands, which implements a two-sided strategy. Firstly, there is the retail and wholesale banking activity of Rabo International. The focus is on food and agriculture with a worldwide branch network. Secondly, there is Rabo Development, a dedicated department that executes two activities: international banking advisory services and a participation arm. Rabo Development participates in banks in developing countries. It holds to a principle of a minority shareholding in these banks to allow local market players to take or maintain a stake. Banco Terra is the only greenfield operation within Rabobank Development. Our focus is on SMEs, retail, and corporate banking, as well as agriculture. With this last segment, we are a direct component of sectoral development. We play a role in providing access to finance for small- to medium-sized farming operations that have to be sustainable. We have finance schemes in rural areas where we enter into tri-partite agreements where Banco Terra pre-finances input to the farmers, and where larger farmers or traders purchase the crop. Payments flow to Banco Terra, whereby the pre-finance is repaid. Through such schemes many farmers are reached.</p><h4>What are the challenges of focusing so heavily on agribusiness?</h4><p>We invest considerable effort into training farmers. Based on our experience in the market and the knowledge of our farmers, we develop cash-flow projections jointly with the farmers. We are able to benchmark input against our experience regarding cost, for example related to bush clearing, land preparation, and irrigation. Having said that, agriculture, especially for medium-sized farmers, is a high-risk activity. This was, among other things, demonstrated by the floods in early 2012 and 2013, which affected our customers in the Limpopo Valley.</p><h4>What role does Banco Terra play in agribusiness in Mozambique?</h4><p>We aim to be the leading financial services provider in Mozambique. To achieve that, Banco Terra has developed a concise strategy for individual crops in agriculture. We always approach a crop through its value chain. We have mapped these value chains with the market players and defined the opportunities and risks per crop. This approach has been picked up by the market and by international investors in agribusiness. On a weekly basis, we speak with individual farmers and investors who are interested in Mozambique's agro-industry. By providing these parties information and contacts, Banco Terra is catalyzing new agribusiness.</p><h4>Who is driving the growth in agriculture of Mozambique, small farmers or international investors?</h4><p>The two go hand-in-hand, and both types of investment are required. Looking at the potential of the country with its fertile soil, excellent climate, and access to water, the conditions for farming are good in general. Small farmers, as well as larger counterparts, are all looking for opportunities.  We finance both small farmers and large commercial farms. We are, for example, involved in financing larger farmers that also have developing programs with smaller, linked-out growers.</p><h4>To what extent is access to finance a constraint for medium-sized businesses?</h4><p>Access to finance in itself is not a constraint. What we experience is that collateral is in many cases insufficient. Furthermore, we face problems in terms of the level of technical farming knowledge that need to be addressed. Hence our activities go beyond financing, and encompass assisting farmers through the season. Due to the risks involved in financing farmers, the price of credit remains high. It proves difficult in many cases to base our financing on reliable financial information.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your first state visit after taking office in April 2012 was to Mozambique. How would you characterize the importance of the Malawian-Mozambican economic relationship for both countries?<br></h4><p>Mozambique is a very important neighbor of Malawi economically. As a landlocked country, Malawi's traditional routes to the sea are Mozambique's ports of Beira and Nacala. It is, therefore, important that Malawi has easy and unimpeded access to the sea for its exports and imports. This relationship was strained during the previous administration. It was therefore important I normalize the country's relations with Mozambique when this administration came to power.</p><h4>Since you took office in 2012, Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to revisit or resume a number of cooperative projects. What is the status of these projects, and what is your outlook for them?</h4><p>Malawi and Mozambique have a long-standing technical cooperation agreement dating back to the 1980s. One of the main projects is the signing of the Power Interconnector, through which Mozambique exports power to Malawi. The signing ceremony took place mid-2012 in Malawi when Mozambican President Armando Guebuza made a state visit to the country. Other projects include the feasibility study on the viability of the Shire Zambezi Waterway project. The two countries renewed their commitment to see the donor-funded project study done as a basis for the implementation of further activities on the project.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's role within the Southern African Development Community (SADC)?</h4><p>Mozambique's role within the SADC is very strategic. First, it is an important seaport outlet for Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Lesotho. All these countries are landlocked and depend on Mozambique for access to the sea. In 2012-2013, Mozambican President Guebuza ably chaired the 14-member country organization and was instrumental in putting in place mechanisms for the proper functioning of various organs of the SADC, including the committees on politics, defense, and security. For example, President Guebuza's chairpersonship of the SADC also laid the foundation for the peaceful mediation of the conflict among presidential aspirants and later the peaceful holding of presidential elections in Madagascar.</p><div class="quote">“There are huge prospects for continued cooperation, especially in transport and trade."</div><h4>What is your outlook for Malawian-Mozambican economic relations over the medium term?</h4><p>The outlook is good, and Malawi and Mozambique will continue to work together to enhance their cooperation in many areas. There are huge prospects for continued cooperation, especially in transport and trade. The Mozambican government, through Vale, a Brazilian company, is currently building a railway that passes through several districts in southern Malawi, such as Chikhwawa, Mwanza, Neno, Balaka, and Machinga. Malawi has been given a quota of tonnage of its imports and exports to transport using the rail facility free of charge. The railway will also enable people, mostly farmers along the facility, to gain easy access to markets for their produce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>It was an honor to be the first Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand to visit Mozambique earlier in 2013. By selecting Mozambique as the first destination of our official visit to Africa, we reaffirmed the belief shared by many around the world that Mozambique is Africa's latest growth frontier.<br></p><p>The World Bank forecasts roughly 7% growth for 2013, making Mozambique one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Mozambique is also in the top five African countries receiving FDI, including around $5 billion in 2012 according to UNCTAD. Multinational corporations have also invested in a wide range of sectors.</p><p>All of this has been achieved, despite flooding in 2013. This is something that Thailand fully understands because we faced similar challenges in 2011. We managed to recover very quickly, registering economic growth of around 6.4% 2013. To prevent future floods, $12 billion is being invested in water management across Thailand. Therefore, we are confident that our growth, forecast at around 5% in 2014, will continue. We would be pleased to share our experience in water management and flood prevention methods.</p><p>These achievements were possible because of the effective policies of President Guebuza, the continuing stability in the country, as well as the active role played by the private sector. The Mozambican government policy of investing in infrastructure will also lead to further growth and employment. Important projects include the development of North-South and East-West corridors. Thai companies are also ready to invest in projects such as the Macuzi port and railway. We support this policy, and in our region alone are investing $66 billion in infrastructure development. This includes high-speed trains from Thailand to China. Another important project is the land bridge linking the Dawei seaport in Myanmar on the Indian Ocean with Laem Chabang port in Thailand. This will help enhance regional connectivity that will benefit Mozambique and Africa as a whole as it opens up a direct route from Southeast Asia to Africa. It is expected that the transportation of goods from Macuzi to Dawei will take just eight days. We aim to work more closely together on this matter as we see Mozambique's great potential to become a trade hub and a gateway to eastern and southern Africa. It is only natural that Mozambique and Thailand should enhance their business partnership to support further growth and prosperity for both our countries. During my visit to Mozambique, President Guebuza and I agreed to double our trade within five years and expand investment. I firmly believe that we can achieve this with the contribution of the Mozambican private sector, and to this end we have signed a number of key agreements. However, the key role will have to be played by the private sector. And here, I believe that the Thai private sector makes a great partner for Mozambique. The interests of the Thai private sector cut across many sectors, from gemstones and jewelry, to hotels and tourism, food processing, construction, and automobile assembly industries. Partnerships with Thai companies do not merely offer high-quality products, services, and skills, but also promote the diversification of Mozambique's economy, fostering sustainable growth.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that Mozambique will be the first country in Africa with which Thailand will pursue this project. It is my hope that it will not only support Mozambique's continuing development and success, but also enhance better understanding between our peoples.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, UKTI established a dedicated trade officer at the British High Commission in Maputo. How would you characterize the importance of the economic relationship between Mozambique and the UK?<br></h4><p>Mozambique's economy has been growing at a phenomenal rate, which we expect to continue. Mozambique remains a small market, but a dynamic one nonetheless, and its natural resources of gas and coal could prove transformative. UK goods exports to Mozambique increased by over 80% in 2012, and continue to rise; the UK imported nearly £80 million from Mozambique over the same period. We also provide Mozambique with £70 million to £80 million each year in development assistance, so it is an important and growing relationship. But as the UK Minister with responsibility for Africa, I believe we must be even more ambitious. It is for that reason that I have selected Mozambique as a High Level Prosperity Partner. This initiative, which I formally launched on November 19, 2013, marks the exciting next step in our bilateral relationship and will see the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and UK Trade and Investment working with the government of Mozambique across a number of key sectors, including agriculture, minerals, and financial services, to share expertise and achieve a paradigm shift in our economic relations. I visited Mozambique in July (for the second time in 2013) and I know the Mozambican government is fully behind the initiative. Our shared goal is to generate prosperity and employment in both Mozambique and Britain.</p><h4>British companies were among the first to make new investments in the Mozambican economy following the end of the civil war in 1992. How would you characterize the role that British investors are playing in Mozambique's development?</h4><p>UK companies play a critical role in Mozambique's economy as major employers and exporters. They bring capital, know-how, jobs, and high standards of corporate governance and social responsibility, while the skills and expertise they share with the local workforce are critical for national development. For example, I visited Lonrho's impressive operation at Maputo harbor, where products freshly fished from the sea by Mozambicans are frozen by the quayside, and then shipped and on the shelves of UK supermarkets within 72 hours. The fact that President Guebuza chose to come to Aberdeen earlier in 2013 to learn from our experience in developing North Sea oil and gas demonstrates the positive reputation we already enjoy in Mozambique. The High Level Prosperity Partnership, which I discussed with the President in Aberdeen, will develop this even further. For example, I have invited Mozambique's Minister for Agriculture to my Lincolnshire constituency to visit farmers, supermarkets, and agricultural colleges to see for himself where UK expertise might be most valuable in key areas such as education, agriculture, and flood control. The Mozambican government is keen to encourage the sort of quality investment that UK business delivers.</p><div class="quote">“  We provide Mozambique with £70 million to £80 million each year in development assistance, so it is an important and growing relationship.

		<url><![CDATA[the-hub-concept]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has your growth strategy been since commencing operations in 1995?</h4><p>We began in 1995, shortly after the Noriega era, hence at a time of skepticism toward Panama in terms of investment. We decided to build a terminal on a former US base with an investment of $150 million, and to date have invested $650 million with plans to invest a further $250 million. When we arrived in Panama there was a total shipping volume of 100,000 TEUs, while in 2013 the level was at almost 7 million TEUs. As pioneers, we ourselves moved 2 million TEUs, and we became the first company to establish the hub concept in Panama.</p><h4>How does Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT) contribute to national development?</h4><p>When we set up in Panama, the unemployment rate in Colón was very high. Moreover, many didn't believe that local labor could manage an efficient port. Therefore, we not only trained our people well, but actually created careers for them. Some of them have been with us for 18 years. We have therefore provided good-quality jobs with opportunities to move up the ladder. MIT has created 1,200 direct jobs, and 90% of the workforce is from the Colón area. We also contribute by generating the economy surrounding the terminal. Apart from these 1,200 direct employees, we employee around 300 security guards and 500 individuals from other unions in Colón</p><div class="quote">“This is the only country where you can unload in one ocean, and then transport by rail or truck to another."</div><h4>MIT is affiliated with Carrix Inc., whose main division, SSA Marine, is based in Colón, from where it monitors its operations abroad. What is the importance of Panama for Carrix Inc. and what are its expansion plans?</h4><p>Our company is based in Seattle, Washington, but our international branch was established in Panama. We did so before anyone else started to look into Panama because of its regulatory advantages. And from here we supervise our operations in Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Panama, and Costa Rica. We've been able to grow from here and today have three operations in Colombia. We also may establish operations in the Caribbean very soon. The plan is for Panama to be our springboard for operations not only in Latin America, but also throughout the world.</p><h4>Which routes are the most important for MIT's business activities?</h4><p>Basically, our core business comes from Asia into Latin America, although lately we have a large volume of business within Latin America, too. By Asia I mean China, Taiwan, and the Philippines as they are the key exporters of goods. China and Hong Kong would probably hold the number one spot.</p><h4>What was the financial performance of MIT in 2013 and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013 there was a slight decrease in volume based on prices in neighboring countries like Venezuela, and some restrictions in Colombia. We are looking to other markets in order to resolve this issue. However, after growing by rates of 15%-20% every year, such a reduction is not significant in a business like ours. What Panama has to do is not only look at the traditional markets like Venezuela and Colombia, but also other growth markets such as Mexico, Ecuador, or Chile.</p><h4>As a leading company in port services for shipping lines, how would you assess the level of competition in a logistics hub like Panama?</h4><p>We are definitely a unique offering because this is the only country where you can unload in one ocean, and then transport by rail or truck to another. You can do that by train, by truck, or by ship transit via the Panama Canal. This unique advantage that Panama has I call the “Panama Product," which is basically the ability to take advantage of our geographic position to move cargo from one ocean to another.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Panama Canal expansion project for MIT in terms of growth?</h4><p>Ultimately, we are set to invest $1 billion in Panama, and we believe in putting your money where your mouth is. This is clear evidence of our belief in this commitment. The options were simple; if we didn't expand the Panama Canal, Panama would no longer be competitive in the international arena. Expansion required a bigger canal. Every terminal in the country has plans to build larger capacity terminals to handle today's large vessels because the options were simple; you either accommodated them or the business will go to our competitors. So we all decided, separately, but ultimately jointly, to make this investment.</p><h4>According to the Panama Canal Authority, the expansion is going to create around 30,000 jobs related to the logistics industry. What is your assessment of this estimate?</h4><p>Ports are not a job-generating industry, though auxiliary industry and services involve a substantial need for logistics. The problem is that Panama today does not need to create jobs, as the available jobs outnumber the people available. We foresee more jobs being generated in the logistics supply chain, for which we need to train our people. Everyone needs to be clear about the fact that no economy can sustain this current pace of growth. We would prefer to see growth of 4%-5% over the coming years in order to avoid an inflationary environment, which Panama normally does not experience.</p><h4>How will the free trade agreement (FTA) signed between Panama and Mexico affect MIT?</h4><p>We should be cautiously optimistic as all FTAs do not create more trade. Yet the biggest issue is that the agreement needs to be reinforced by other economic issues or programs such that our country can be both an export and import economy. We do feel that the FTA will generate more trade, and Panama can become the hub for countries in the Americas.</p><h4>How would you assess Panama's port infrastructure and the government's efforts to improve its capabilities?</h4><p>We probably have some of the best maritime infrastructure in the world. That is not our problem. Our problem, rather, is how to best connect that infrastructure. We need to be more dynamic in terms of the utilization of e-commerce, and we need to improve customs procedures through the use of electronic document transfers. In short, while we've been successful in establishing the infrastructure, we now need to concentrate on the process itself. The next step for us in Panama is to be able to move cargo between air, rail, ports, and trucks, electronically. That is why we have been sitting down with the government and the private sector on a logistics committee addressing this part of the business, with careful attention to the land transportation part of the equation as well as the sea component.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategy of the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) in promoting the development of the Islamic economy of Dubai?</h4><p>The DIEDC was created to implement HH Sheikh Mohammed's vision to make Dubai the global capital of the Islamic economy. This will be done by implementing a comprehensive strategy that focuses on developing seven key sectors of the Islamic economy. The role of the center itself will be that of an enabler. We will help our stakeholders, both government and private sector entities, to implement specific projects to accelerate the development of the Islamic economy within Dubai. DIEDC will develop an enabling and empowering environment, including the necessary legislative and regulatory framework, to support the growth of the Islamic economy. The center will also keep track of and promote economic activities that are sharia compliant. The “Dubai: Capital of Islamic Economy" strategy revolves around seven key strategic pillars, in which we will position Dubai to be the global reference and economic engine of Islamic finance, and a trusted name and solutions provider for the halal industry. In addition, we will also work with stakeholders to establish Dubai as a destination of choice for family-friendly tourism, as a pioneer of the Islamic digital economy and the capital of Islamic fashion, arts, and design. The Centre will also be a global knowledge resource for the Islamic economy, and will aim to position Dubai as a leader in Islamic economy standards and certification as part of its strategy.</p><h4>Considering the different standards and procedures applied in different economic segments, how will you ensure greater normalization of the halal sector?</h4><p>Dialogue is critical as we try to unify standards that already exist. What is missing is consensus. When it comes to the Muslim population and the needs of Muslims, there will always be differences because of the various schools of thought. But what we can promote through Dubai is the adoption of a universally accepted set of common standards or agreements that can be the foundations for locally implemented standards.</p><div class="quote">“The Centre will also be a global knowledge resource for the Islamic economy."</div><h4>Focusing more on the general economy, the DIEDC has been conducting research into which segments are to be developed first as far as the Islamic economy is concerned. What were the results of this study?</h4><p>The answer lies in the seven key pillars of the “Dubai: Capital of Islamic Economy" strategy. We have identified several initiatives under each pillar, which in turn would accelerate the development of Islamic economic activities. One example is the opportunity in the takaful industry, specifically in terms of re-takaful, as this sector is under-served globally. Studies show that there are just 19 fully-fledged re-takaful companies, and on a global scale 19 companies is negligible. Therefore, there is an opportunity to create a national champion for re-takaful that is based in Dubai, and one that will provide re-takaful services and close that particular gap.</p><h4>Dubai is pushing toward more diversified growth. What do you think will be the role of the Islamic economy in the next years?</h4><p>I think that it will be a strong contributor to the development of the general economy. If you look at the economic ecosystem for any given country, you are able to observe various sectors that contribute toward the development of national GDP. In Dubai, the Islamic economy will be a key sector that will contribute to the development of our broader economy. We feel the same about other jurisdictions and countries. In the Muslim world, the Islamic economy is a major contributor to the overall economy, and Islamic economic activities are becoming increasingly important in non-Muslim countries, such is the case for example with Islamic finance. Another good example of this can be found in the halal sector in Australia and New Zealand, where most of the slaughterhouses that produce meat are halal certified. The “wholesome" aspect of halal certification addresses quality of life, health, and hygiene, as well as other areas beyond simply compliance with sharia principles. This has caused broader global consumers, and suppliers in turn, to adopt such standards.</p><h4>What is the DIEDC doing in terms of international recognitions and awards?</h4><p>Some of our activities promote various programs and awards that encourage innovation. An example of this was the Islamic Economy Awards, held under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice-President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, and HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai. The awards have two elements: corporate awards, which are categorized across various economic sectors; and individual awards, such as a lifetime achievement awards for individuals who have contributed to the development of the Islamic economy. We would like to see such awards in all sectors to stimulate innovation.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Millennium bim doing to support the lower income and SME segments of the market?<br></h4><p>This economy, with the development that it has, needs greater financial inclusion. This financial inclusion requires that the bank creates innovative products that meet the needs of our clients in areas that have low penetration. This is our approach and we will keep on leading the bank in this way. There are many microfinance institutions in Mozambique, but we started the sector here. The International Bank of Mozambique got into contact with institutions that had experience in microfinance, and we created a microfinance bank called Novo Banco, in which we were one of the stakeholders. We are now opening new branches in different areas of the country where business is growing.</p><h4>How has the increased influx of international corporates changed Millennium bim's business?</h4><p>We approach both the mass market and the corporate segments differently. Obviously, the oil and gas and mineral resources projects are a major part of the Mozambican economy. This will bring in major investments from multinationals, and a lot of them import their own financial packages already completely designed abroad. Our home institution Millennium BCP in Portugal has a developed investment banking model, and considerable professional experience. We previously had an investment banking practice in Mozambique, which we are now rebuilding in collaboration with Millennium BCP so that we are not left out of infrastructure financing opportunities in Mozambique. Crucially, we need to be prepared to respond to the appeals for financial resources from SMEs in every domain, whether they be in the electricity, tourism, agriculture, food, or transport sectors.</p><h4>What forthcoming trends do you see in Mozambique's banking sector?</h4><p>The expansion of the oil and gas sector will precipitate major investments from abroad. These investments will be too big for the banking sector's capabilities, and the big-ticket transactions will be funded by global banks. Such banks are seeking to have a permanent footing in Mozambique, whilst others use regional offices located in Johannesburg or other neighboring countries. The development of huge investment projects requires a concomitant development of clusters of local SMEs to cater to the different services and goods that multinational companies (MNCs) require along their value chain to accomplish their production plans. This is where local content comes in, regardless of whether it is imposed by legislation or not. The underlying business model for SMEs involves a stable stream of revenues that translate into contractual arrangements pertaining to the supply of goods and services. This is where we can come on board and support companies to enhance their capabilities. The situation is so critical that Millennium bim has rolled out specific products for the linkage-related SMEs, as is the case of the discount of invoices aimed at smoothing the cash-flow cycle, forex transactions, and wage payments.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest opportunities for foreign investors in Mozambique in 2014?</h4><p>Massive investments in infrastructure are required in regions that are extremely underdeveloped and where skilled manpower is scarce. Developed countries' resources and experience can be replicated in Mozambique through adequate adaptation to local conditions. Opportunities abound in logistics, such as ports, railways, roads, warehouses, and transportation. Accommodation is non-existent in regions like Palma, or is faced with huge supply constraints in some cities, like Tete. State-sponsored training centers for specialized skills have lagged behind, and increasing urbanization calls for real estate development in the main cities. It is like the country is starting anew, with all the other components that are enablers for an environment conducive to investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of the unbundling of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)?</h4><p><span></span>The unbundling of PHCN was the outcome of the federal government's reform initiatives, and was part of its transformation agenda. It followed a pattern that had already been developed for telecommunications. The reform initiatives abrogated the monopoly law, liberalized the sector, and created a regulatory agency. The reforms will be considered successful if they delineate three major strategic rules: policy formulation, regulation, and operations in the sector. What we formerly had in place was the NEPA Act, which created a monopoly for the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), authorizing it to undertake all activities within the sector, from generation to transmission and distribution. If electricity didn't reach my area, and I decided to provide cables, poles, and transformers to take the power to my community, those assets became the assets of NEPA, according to the monopoly act. Therefore, the primary significance of the reform was its abrogation of the NEPA Act. That's why we had to establish the PHCN as a transition vehicle to allow the unbundling of NEPA into successor companies, where the main objective of the unbundling was to foster competition. It was critical to ensure full revenue collection in the value chain as failure to do so would leave the sector with no chance of survival. When NEPA was an integrated company with transmission, generation, and distribution in one entity, those who generated power didn't care if they collected the proceeds from the end user. The generation department generated the power and brought it to the grid, while the transmission people didn't care if X amount of power was lost and, by extension, in distribution, the operators didn't care if they collected the full value of the power transmitted or not. As a result, over the years, there were huge revenue leakages in the value chain. The government covered any shortfall, and any further investment to improve the system had to come from the government budget. Now, with the reform, the generation and distribution components of the business have been separated, and only transmission remains in government hands. The power generation part of NEPA was broken down into six power generation companies, and many independent power producers have invested in the sector. We're quite happy with the results. In the distribution sector, monopoly pricing has been abolished thanks to the newly competitive nature of the sector, and the former distribution giant has been broken down into 11 distribution companies based in different regions and areas. Now, we can surmise which distribution companies are engaged in best practices, and ensure that the others play according to the same rules and apply the same standards to their operations. Generation is straightforward; you install a generator and crank up the power. But because of the risk of power losses in transmission and distribution, we decided to introduce an intervening party, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader (NBET), which signs power-purchase agreements with the generation companies. The aim was to avoid disincentivizing power generating companies from investing in the power generation sector. The NBET basically guarantees that whatever power a company generates is bought and paid for in full. Meanwhile, the distribution companies were not sold on the basis of price, but on the commitment made to reduce aggregate technical and financial collection losses. After the unbundling, a regulatory agency was also set up, which has the power to grant and revoke licenses. This controls and ensures good behavior in terms of environmental issues, the appropriateness of the technologies employed, safety standards, and more. Most importantly, it provides a one-stop shop for anyone who wants to enter the generation or distribution sector. Another issue that the reforms addressed was pricing. Previously, under NEPA, the government had been subsidizing power for the public sector. It was therefore not economically viable for any private sector entity to invest its own capital and set up a generation or distribution plant. One of the major challenges prior to privatization was to figure out a tariff that was cost-reflective and that could yield an adequate rate of return on the investments of those wishing to enter the sector. This was done through the introduction of the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO 2) in 2012. It provided the added confidence that investors needed to invest in the power sector. Because no matter what liberalization or reform measures you bring into the sector, if you don't enjoy a good return on your investment, people won't invest. Another element that attracted private investors into the sector was the role that public enterprises played in the privatization process. We set clear standards of international best practice in structuring the transaction, insisting on high standards of transparency and also setting clear rules and parameters. In evaluating the technical proposals, we opened it up for strategic stakeholders to view and oversee the evaluation process. The important fact here is that the president and the vice-president supported us in maintaining transparency, the success of which has demonstrated our desire to comply fully with international best practices. Our mandate is very clear; to create an environment that will attract international investments and foreign capital into the country. That is the aim of President Goodluck Jonathan, as well.</p><h4>In what other sectors do you see opportunities for liberalization?</h4><p>Our next focus area will be the transportation sector, the inefficiency of which today means that transport costs account for an average of 30% of all costs on transported goods and products. To give an example; a container lands in Lagos and is transported by truck to Kano, which takes three days. A trailer can carry no more than two 40-foot containers, or even two 20-foot containers. On the other hand, one railway wagon can carry 10 to 20 of those containers and get to Kano within 24 hours. Trucks are inefficient, and also damage our roads. As with the NEPA Act, we have the Railway Act, the Inland Waterways Act, and the Ports and Harbor Act, all of which restrict operations and grant monopoly rights in those sectors. Meanwhile, in the pipeline, we have a railway draft reform bill, an inland waterways draft reform bill, a roads reform bill, and a ports and harbor reform bill. We will also establish a regulatory agency called the National Transport Commission to provide intermodal regulation and promote intermodal development, such as ensuring major airports have railway links. Another area besides transport is the reform of the housing sector. It's estimated that the middle class alone demands a minimum of 17 million housing units. Right now, we're looking at what policies and legal and regulatory frameworks we need to put in place to encourage massive private sector housing investment. We're also working on the privatization of development finance institutions, like the Bank of Industry and the Bank of Agriculture, at which privatization has already begun. Also, under the leadership of the Minister of Finance, we're working on the establishment of a wholesale development bank. There is also the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange project, through which we intend to introduce a warehouse depository system. Currently, the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange only has a trading platform, so we've gone into advanced discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, which has warehouses and silos located nationwide. It is set to cede a number of those silos to the Abuja Commodities and Stock Exchange for privatization. Two factors have been hindering the development of agriculture in Nigeria: one, the instability and unpredictability of prices; and two, the lack of a defined buyer. This initiative will thus seek to introduce a stable system for pricing and for identifying certain buyers. Another crucial sector is the minerals and mining sector. Nigeria has large mineral deposits that are virtually untapped. Coal, gold, columbite, and limestone are all there, but today we extract only oil and gas. Now however, we are working on removing the obstacles that seem to be holding investors back from entering those sectors. Refineries are also up for privatization, pending an amicable resolution of labor issues. We're also looking at a concession of the Nigerian Gas Company and the Nigerian pipelines, which transport gas and petroleum products. The other sectors that I wanted to mention are tourism and sports. Nigeria has considerable potential to become a tourist destination when you consider that, among others, we have game and national parks. These have not been major revenue earners yet, and therefore we're looking at how we can transform these assets into profitable ventures that will attract private investors. In terms of sports, we have stadiums all over the country and a population of 160 million that loves football.</p><div class="quote">“The Nigerian business environment is undergoing a major process of improvement."</div><h4>What is your message to potential investors looking at Nigeria as a whole?</h4><p>The Nigerian business environment is undergoing a major process of improvement, and through the privatization drive the government is taking the initiative to welcome investment across a range of sectors. We believe wholeheartedly in Nigeria as an investor address, and that it is one of the best propositions in the world today.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the regulatory framework for upstream oil and gas in Mozambique?</h4><p>I think the regulatory framework for petroleum in general, which also includes gas, is evolving in the best way possible. We have adopted an approach whereby, over time, we look at the regulatory framework and try to see if it matches reality. As a matter of fact, we are currently in the processes of revising the legal and regulatory framework, and are awaiting parliamentary approval of the latest draft. We are doing this essentially because we want to fine-tune the gaps and legally cater to potential new developments, such as LNG projects or shale gas exploration—we are not currently involved in those aspects of the sector. In addition to that, we have decided that from now on all contracts for oil and gas exploration will be made public. We are effectively streamlining petroleum legislation to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sector.</p><h4>How important is it to ensure transparency in the management of Mozambique's petroleum resources?</h4><p>The reason why we have had success thus far is because we inspire confidence in the investor community. Investors know that we play clean in terms of how they acquire acreage for exploration, and how they become involved in Mozambique. The processes are transparent. We have much to improve, but the contracts contain anti-corruption clauses. We are part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the government is taking numerous measures to guarantee the effective management of the sector.</p><div class="quote">“The reason why we have had success thus far is because we inspire confidence in the investor community."</div><h4>What changes can we expect to see in the new petroleum law?</h4><p>Usually, whatever documents we draft for the petroleum sector, such as laws and regulations, we make sure that we share the content with the stakeholders. In principle, we try to attract investors through whatever we undertake. Therefore, the legal framework has to satisfy the stakeholders and investors that come to Mozambique, and who play a valuable role here. We run workshops and hold consultations, deliver them the final draft, and seek to accommodate their wishes. In general, we listen to stakeholders because, at the end of the day, we are keen to attract investment to the country.</p><h4>Why is the LNG plant a crucial development and what is its status?</h4><p>It is crucial because we have to fund deep offshore reserves, which are very costly to develop. We believe that the only way to make sure we extract enough is to have an anchor project, such as LNG, to take advantage of the market. Then, we can take the anchor project and start to develop local projects such as power generation. And while we are looking at LNG exports, that doesn't mean we don't give priority to the local market; it is a priority for us because we are about adding value to Mozambique itself. However, in order to develop the high-cost reserves that require a wide range of expensive technology, we need to devise an anchor project. That project is basically about producing LNG to supply the entire market and inject value into the country. We have received many proposals from international investors keen to develop projects that we see as very beneficial in terms of generating employment, and improving both infrastructure and the capacity of local labor and content. We would like to see our national or private companies developing strategic partnerships with foreign companies to supply services, meaning that in 10 or 20 years we are able undertake this activity on our own.</p><h4>How would you characterize the government's efforts to ensure that investments in the petroleum sector translate into maximum benefits for Mozambicans?</h4><p>Although we don't have policies in place, such as for local content, we have to encourage companies to commit themselves to the country, taking into consideration its needs in terms of economic development. We are moving in the right direction. And, meanwhile, we certainly don't intend to rush through legislation for local content or corporate social responsibility (CSR), but rather introduce the right legal framework that both satisfies the investor community and ensures that Mozambique takes the greatest possible advantage of its circumstances for the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the e-government initiative?<br></h4><p>Part of the e-government initiative is the “e-transformation" program. The Information Technology Authority (ITA) and the Cabinet are driving this with a target of when each stage of the transformation should have been achieved. We are not only concerned with the current silo delivery of e-services, but also for the integration of government. We have one portal, www.oman.om, whereby citizens can access all services with a single sign-on. We have our government network, and we have our cyber-security centers to monitor and work with all of the security policies. We also offer a payment gateway that enables the government to receive its payments online. We have issued two laws: an eTransactions Law and our cyber-security law. These laws enable the right environment for e-transactions.</p><h4>How would you describe your work to increase public awareness and computer literacy levels?</h4><p>We have several initiatives in this regard. We have committed to train about 93,000 civil servants through our Government IT Training and Certification (GITTC) program. As well, throughout the Sultanate, we have established 19 Community Knowledge Centers (CKC), which provide free ICT training for citizens. We have nine centers that are dedicated to training women only and the remaining 10 centers are mixed gender. For those wilayats where there is no CKC in the area, we utilize local schools and private institutions as centers to deliver the same training. We also have the National PC (NPC) initiative, and we are happy to report that we have distributed more than 100,000 free PCs. Targeted recipients for these PCs include social-beneficiary families with a child at school. In addition, if such a family has a son or daughter in college or university, those students are also entitled to receive their own laptop. The first phase of this initiative ended in summer 2013. The next phases will involve other members of society, and will be announced. We also provide specialized training in ICT, which includes certification with multinational companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. Our overall aim is to prepare citizens for employment and raise their awareness of IT. Finally, the government has recently created a broadband company to increase the IT penetration of the country. A government-owned company is part of the national broadband strategy and will provide the passive infrastructure and fiber optics. We will use previously existing infrastructure to lay down fiber-optic cables. Muscat is the first area to receive our attention, and to this end we have already invested more than OMR100 million ($260 million) with Haya Water to deliver fiber to the home (FTTH).</p><h4>Is this new broadband company based on international models?</h4><p>Yes, we are employing the same model as is used in Singapore and Australia. It is an extremely beneficial investment and a crucial part of the infrastructure. The government released some spectrum that used to be controlled by the Ministry of Defence. We have invested more than OMR50 million ($130 million) to migrate the spectrum to telecoms, which in turn will offer better broadband. The new company will provide the passive infrastructure. This will allow small-scale ISPs to compete for the delivery of internet services, and thus encourage business and get the job done efficiently.</p><h4>What role should IT play in developing Oman as a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>ICT is vital for all industries, as it enables other sectors to perform. Tourism, education, oil and gas, and healthcare all use ICT. We feel that IT will always play an especially crucial part, and this is why we are pushing our training programs so hard. For example, we are currently training people to create virtual reality applications, and one of the target sectors is oil and gas. Another example is tourism—without a location-based program that shows people the best destinations, restaurants, and cafés, people struggle to get the most out of the country and the tourism sector will suffer as a result. Coming back to the third pillar, IT industry development is essential. We are not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, but we are doing our best to enable the part of the industry that relates to us—ICT. We are working with partners such as Microsoft, SAP, and Cisco at our centers to encourage the development of SMEs by teaching their leaders and employees the necessary skills.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of this region for Medtronic's global strategy?</h4><p>Medtronic is giving a lot of attention to make sure we provide access to our therapies globally. The focus has been placed on ensuring that this is how we carry out our decisions. Having said that, our region—an emerging global market—is receiving a lot of attention. Some people would probably feel the pressure; we think it is a great opportunity. Medtronic Global is offering us the support necessary for us to provide our patients in the region with better access to the therapies and technologies we produce. Once you look at how big the region is, you understand that you cannot have a single defined strategy, and you cannot have a single goal. Obviously, however, there are common goals. At Medtronic, we have a very noble mission that we truly believe in, and it guides us in our operations from Pakistan to Morocco, and from Turkey to South Africa. This is a vast region, and thus we have ensured that there is a dedication to creating sub-regions. These sub-regions can establish different sets of strategies that they can monitor throughout.</p><h4>How would you characterize Medtronic's specific strategy for Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is a rather diverse market. The economy has proven to be a very stable one, even in difficult times. The population is among the largest in the region, and the healthcare infrastructure provides a good level of service. Turkey has good specialty hospitals, polyclinics, and reimbursement systems. Turkey, as a market, is one of our strongest potentials for contribution. Turkey has done a great job improving its life expectancy. The population we now serve is much larger than it used to be, and I think that trend will continue. Specific diseases, such as diabetes, which is a core specialty for us, are significant for the region, and particularly for countries like Turkey. The diabetes rate of some of the countries in the region is 20% of the population. That is the estimate of a few million people around the region. When you look at the costs in the system associated with such treatments, and how companies like ours can try to reduce the impact while improving quality of life, Turkey is a perfect place to start because the set-up is there. We recently announced our acquisition of Biostar and the start of more collaboration with Medicall, our 10-plus-year distributor in Turkey. We will have access to most of the regions in Turkey for our therapies. This gets us closer to the patients. It also gets us closer to trends where we can contribute more, and that makes it easier for us to make investment decisions since we are directly engaged and involved in the market.</p><div class="quote">“We are hoping to be able to serve every region we are responsible for through directly dedicated Medtronic resources."</div><h4>Where do you see Medtronic in the long term?</h4><p>We are hoping to be able to serve every region we are responsible for through directly dedicated Medtronic resources. We believe that local experts need to serve local patients at the point of need, we are thus exploring many new models to work with our existing partners to help support them achieve top performance in terms of service delivery to patients. We estimate that we are now serving close to 300,000 patients per year in this region. We are hoping to serve 1 million patients by the end of 2018. In 2014, at Medtronic, we are going to see departments that focus on government programs and Hospital Solutions.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the growth of ETB over the past few years?</h4><p>Last year was a very important one for ETB due to the implementation of our strategic development plan, which sets out the basis of our development for the next five years. In terms of the company's turnover, 2013 was also a key year. We reversed the trend of the past seven years and, for the first time in this period, experienced positive growth.</p><h4>What brought about the sale of ETB's Tigo shares?</h4><p>ETB has changed its vision and we sold the shares we had at Tigo. However, before that, we carried out many business activities together. For example, we jointly bought the 4G spectrum for $100 million, sharing the cost of the move, and also share the 4G infrastructure. Tigo is a national company with a high level of know-how and robust infrastructure across the country, and ETB has benefited from that. However, our relationship entered a kind of passive stage and, after doing great things together with the 4G, it stopped generating synergies for ETB's interests. In this context, we are set to launch our new mobile telephony company in September 2013—ETB mobile.</p><div class="quote">“We are set to launch our new mobile telephony company in September 2013—ETB mobile."</div><h4>What is the relevance of LTE technologies such as 4G for ETB' s future growth plans?</h4><p>It is one of our top priorities, because with this infrastructure we will be able to offer services to other providers in the industry. In this context, it also offers us the possibility to expand our product portfolio with something we did not have before. From September, we will be offering voice and data services to both pre-paid and post-paid mobile telephone users at the national level, which will allow us to enter one of the most attractive markets for new technologies.</p><h4>ETB holds a 34% share in the broadband market, being one of the leading companies in the industry. What is the secret behind this success?</h4><p>ETB has 129 years of history and has always been a highly innovative company—we have been evolving ever since our first day, and the best example of our success in such a competitive industry is that we are one of the leading companies in Colombia. Also, around the world, there are very few companies in our industry that can boast such a history. In this context, we were the first company to launch broadband services in Colombia, where Bogotá is our stronghold, the area in which we focus our operations, and in which we offer high-quality services. We should keep in mind the importance of Bogotá for Colombia; it represents 25% of GDP. As part of our strategic plan for the next five years, we are pushing innovation and investment to the forefront and plan to replace all our lines in Bogotá with fiber-optic infrastructure. At the moment, more than 200,000 households in Bogotá already enjoy it. By the end of the year, we will have covered between 800,000 and 1 million households. In terms of new technologies and connectivity, our plans regarding fiber optics confirm our commitment to innovation in daily business activity. Again, we are pioneers in being the first company to implement a fiber-optic strategy for households in Colombia on such a level. We also believe that by boosting connectivity with fiber optics across the city, we are also contributing to increased competitiveness, employment, and dynamism in Bogotá. We also will be complementing our services and products with our new TV platform.</p><h4>How important is service integration for clients?</h4><p>When we launch our new mobile telephony services in September, we will become the only company in Colombia offering all the integrated services of fixed and mobile telephony, internet, and TV under one brand and with one bill, bringing further convenience to our clients.</p><h4>ETB recently sold overseas bonds for a total of $300 million. How would you assess the attractiveness of the company for foreign investors?</h4><p>We are an attractive company to invest in because we have a structured and ambitious strategic plan that sets our future vision as well as the goals we want to achieve and how we will go about achieving them. The issuance of bonds was a great success, and despite having the legal capacity to sell up to $600 million, we decided to target $300 million because the restructuring of the company has created internal synergies as well as raising the capacity of our funding. Thanks to the $300 million deal, we have already covered investments for the next decade and that's the only debt we have currently. The issuance of bonds has shown the trust and reliability investors have in our strategic plan and the growth capacity of ETB.</p><h4>What have been some of the landmark achievements of ETB during your tenure?</h4><p>We have received awards both nationally and internationally, which I believe boosts our already established credentials. However, the greatest accolade we have received is the current condition of our company; whereas two years ago it was up for sale and virtually at its end, today we proudly observe its solid development. This is a company that pioneers technologies and we see a bright future ahead of us.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has BLOM Bank been affected by the regional turmoil over the past year?</h4><p>Relatively speaking, 2013 was a good year for BLOM. We registered growth on the balance sheet, and in loans and deposits, and posted growth in profits of around 5%. BLOM is a very consistent bank, and we continue to be prudent with gradual growth, and have never seen a year of decline. Three years ago Syria was the second most important market for us after Lebanon. Yet today it is one of the smaller ones—there has been a major drop in deposits and loans. Therefore, the war in Syria has not really affected our bottom line by much in 2013 as the country is a proportionately smaller operation. We were affected more by Syria in 2011 and 2012 because of the big drop in our operations during those two years. There is another dimension to this, however, in so much as both in addition to our operations in Syria, Lebanon is also feeling the pinch in terms of lower economic growth due to the security situation of the region and the arrival of refugees. Ultimately, the performance of the economy affects that of the bank, too.</p><h4>But if we talk about the year to date, have overall deposits grown on last year?</h4><p>We are still growing continuously, as we have recently published our 1Q2014 results showing growth in deposits and loans. The bank's strategy errs on the side of caution and looks for gradual growth, and while we are modern with a liberal outlook in general terms, we opt for a conservative stance in business.</p><div class="quote">“While we are present in 13 countries, for us the bottom line is more important than scale."</div><h4>What is BLOM's overall market share in terms of the Lebanese banking sector?</h4><p>In terms of customer deposits in Lebanese pounds, we are number one, at around 13%. In terms of overall deposits, we hold 13.4% of the market. As for lending, we are number one in retail banking in all product categories (housing loans, car loans, personal loans, and credit card receivables). We are also the number one lender for loans made to entities operating in Lebanon. BLOM Bank has also been voted unanimously as the best bank in Lebanon by many major international institutions.</p><h4>Does BLOM Bank have any intentions to significantly expand its foreign market size in terms of loans and deposits similar to Bank Audi?</h4><p>While we are present in 13 countries, for us the bottom line is more important than scale. Our shareholders are more concerned about return on equity (ROE) and profitability than about the size of the balance sheet. This is where our culture is different, because we are very careful in terms of keeping our costs low and our ROE high—we have the highest ROE and the lowest cost-to-income readings in the sector. And today, we even have the highest level of profits even though we do not have the highest equity, so our profitability is the highest in relative and absolute terms. At BLOM Bank, we have more than sufficient equity from our internally generated profits, which makes for a relatively strong equity base, meaning there is in no need to raise additional equity.</p><h4>How well do you feel Lebanon's banking sector is progressing to be able to meet the Basel III requirements?</h4><p>The sector is in good shape. First of all, Lebanon is going to be compliant with the ratios required by Basel III by the end of 2014. The Central Bank has actually asked the banks to be compliant by the end of 2014, stipulating a 12% capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Basel III stipulates full compliance by January 2019, and therefore we are set to be at least three years ahead of the rest of the world. Already, the average CAR of the banks in Lebanon is close to 12%.</p><h4>How is your investment banking arm developing in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p>There is little investment banking activity in Lebanon. We do have our own investment arm, Blominvest Bank, which deals with most of our investment banking activity, but Lebanon is a very limited market and we have seen only two deals in the government debt market of late. There is more of a focus on our investment banking activities in Saudi Arabia, where the market is bigger and the prospects are better. Our investment company there, Blominvest Saudi Arabia, is currently very active, especially in the area of real estate funds.</p><h4>What could you tell us about the BLOM Development Bank, which is specialized in Islamic banking?</h4><p>It is doing well, and experiencing growth, although Islamic banking in Lebanon represents a minuscule market when compared to the total size of the commercial banks. There is no real tradition of Islamic instruments in Lebanon—they are much more established in the Gulf. In Lebanon, people prefer commercial banks. Islamic banks still account for less than 1% of the banking universe locally.</p><h4>What areas is BLOM Bank investing in the most?</h4><p>As a universal bank, we undertake all activities. In 2013, growth in lending was mostly in housing loans in light of the Central Bank's incentives. Asset management and fund management have also grown amid greater public interest. We have also paid attention to the SME sector, and hence these three areas have seen the highest levels of growth, in that order. And then, of course, technology is crucial in our business, and we always try to lead the field in this area. We have also pioneered several products, with one being a credit card, the Touch pre-paid VISA Credit Card, which loads units onto your mobile phone as you spend, instead of receiving points. This card proved highly popular with the public. In fact, it was so successful it received VISA's “Best Acquisition Campaign" award for Lebanon in 2013.</p><h4>Do you have a technology budget?</h4><p>Whenever we see an opportunity to invest in an innovation that has the potential to bring us benefits, we don't hold back.</p><h4>In what region will you be expanding your operations the most over the next year?</h4><p>The growth of our operations is mostly observed in those countries that we have recently entered. Our investment banking arm in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly. Meanwhile, our corporate and commercial banking operations in Qatar are also expanding swiftly. Overall, our Gulf operations, namely in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, are in general doing well. Our operation in Egypt performed strongly in 2013, and we expect 2014 to be extremely good as well. I would, in fact, say that the Gulf and Egypt are posting the best growth performance.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) grown over the last year?</h4><p>It has grown significantly. In 2013, the local index, which we call Tanzania Stock Index (TSI), grew by almost 100%. We doubled in terms of domestic market capitalization for the 12 locally listed companies. For total market capitalization, we experienced more than 25% growth. We have two indexes, a local index for domestic companies and an all share index for the whole market, including cross-listed companies. Some of the cross-listed companies did not do so well in 2013 in their primary markets. We have five that are cross-listed from Nairobi and one from the London Stock Exchange.</p><h4>The Tanzanian government recently released its plans to ease restrictions for foreign investors, especially for government bonds. How will these changes affect the DSE?</h4><p>The President has indicated that the government is in the final phases of enhancing capital account liberalization, and this will increase the level of foreign investors in our listed equities and also in the fixed-income instruments space. We believe that this might happen in the next 12 to 24 months. This, for us, is a great move because it will increase the investor base. Once you have that, then market forces tend to play a role and hence a better price mechanism and proper valuation for listed securities will emerge. And we will also be able to manage the pricing of these financial products.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in investing in the DSE in light of these new reforms?</h4><p>The interest and appetite of foreign portfolio investors to participate in our market is high, both in the equity segment and on the fixed-income side. We receive a lot of queries as to when we will increase or remove the limits or restrictions that hinder foreign participation in our equity and fixed-income space. Foreigners are allowed to participate up to a limit, and currently the ceiling is 60%. In the East African region, our limit in the lowest, followed by Kenya, which is at 85%. Uganda and Rwanda do not have the threshold, while Burundi does not have a stock exchange yet. It is important we note that most of the companies listed on the DSE have already reached or, in some cases, exceeded that limit. What this means is that, generally, foreigners are not allowed to participate in our market because, in most of the companies, the ownership limit has already been reached. Many foreign investors are keen to participate if we increase the minimum threshold. On the fixed-income side, we also receive many portfolio investors from abroad. As a country, we may decide to remove this restriction in a phased approach. We may begin by allowing East African investors to participate in our market, which is how other countries in the East African Community (EAC) are doing it. Many investors from other countries normally run their operations in the region through Nairobi. Once we allow investors from region, such as portfolio investors and other similar types of investor, i.e. portfolio or fund managers, then we will tap some foreign investors beyond the region who are interested in our market.</p><div class="quote">“The interest and appetite of foreign portfolio investors to participate in our market is high."</div><h4>What are some of your strategies to attract more companies to list themselves on the DSE?</h4><p>We are approaching this matter from various fronts. Over the past nine months we have been aggressively engaged in a public education and awareness creation campaign, the objective of which has been to educate and inform the public and specifically entrepreneurs, business enterprises, and investors on the potential and opportunities provided by the DSE for long-term capital raising and investment. We have been doing this through mainstream and social media platforms as well as seminars that we have run all across the country. We have also been encouraging the government to fast track the implementation of legislative actions that are meant to broaden the ownership of key sectors of the economy, i.e. telecommunications, mining, and financial services. In 2010, the parliament passed two pieces of legislation: the Electronic and Postal Telecommunication Act and the Mining Act, which upon implementation will result in the listing of telecommunications companies and mining companies with special mining licenses. Listing these companies will widen the ownership of local citizens in these companies, and that will result in economic and financial inclusiveness and increase the level of financial literacy among the public. But, most importantly, it will increase the level of transparency and good governance practices, which are very important to any economy and for economic growth. Apart from legislative action, we have also been liaising with the government to privatize its parastatals through listing on the DSE. There are about 34 companies that the government still has a stake in. We believe that some of those companies could be privatized through listing on the DSE. Out of these, we see 10 or 11 that have the potential to be listed on the DSE. Lastly, we have been speaking with municipalities and local governments to consider financing some of their development projects using public money by way of municipal bonds or establishing special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the same aim.</p><h4>Is there any specific sector that you are targeting first?</h4><p>We do not have specific sectors that we target; we understand that enterprises from all sectors may use the DSE for capital raising. However, the telecommunications, mining, and financial services sectors may be the ones to get the ball rolling with, mainly because of their positions and sensitivity within the economy. With the discovery of natural gas now, this sector may also require consideration so that we enable local Tanzanians to participate not only as consumers of services and products produced by these sectors or suppliers or employees or contractors to these sectors, but in ownership as well. In 2013, we also introduced the Enterprise Growth Market, which is to enable SMEs to access the market and raise capital for their expansion and growth. Its rules are not as stringent as for the main investment market. With a lower amount of capital and lower number of shareholders, it is attractive for SMEs even if they do not have a history of operating profitability as they can show that they comply with good governance standards. We have been successful in that campaign, and we are still interacting with the mainstream media and social media to try and educate the public.</p><h4>Could you please elaborate on your integration plans with Kenya and Uganda?</h4><p>We are part of the East African Securities Exchange Association (EASEA). With that association and the support of the EAC, we have been making significant progress. We are in different phases of implementing some activities, including initiatives toward regional securities issuances, regional stockbrokers, common securities trading, and depository and settlement infrastructure. We are now at an advanced stage toward introducing the regional infrastructure platform that will integrate our automated trading systems and our central securities depositories. The EAC Secretariat is spearheading the project, which will bring these exchanges together through ICT infrastructure, meaning that securities and investments will be easily moved across the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What specific areas have you identified for collaboration between Abu Dhabi and Singapore?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is guided by the Vision 2030 and so we know that it has a strong desire to diversify away from oil and gas and develop a varied economic matrix with services and manufacturing accounting for 60% of GDP. Today, the figure is at 44%, and I must comment on its efforts. For example, in aerospace, Abu Dhabi boasts a repair and overhaul center, and is now setting up its own manufacturing center to produce composite components and parts for Boeing and Airbus. It has established Etihad Airlines and aspires to create an aviation hub, perhaps smaller than that of Dubai. It is also entering the semiconductors segment. Abu Dhabi and Singapore are now creating a joint laboratory to conduct semiconductor research, and both have pledged a total of $21 million over three years to the venture, which is to focus on collaborative research projects in micro-electro-mechanical systems (mems), a type of semiconductor chip intended for next-generation products. It is also venturing into semi-conductors, buying into our global foundry, the $3 billion investment of which is by far Abu Dhabi's largest into Singapore. Of course, Emiratis are very curious about how we developed our industrial segments and airport, and so at one time our airport group was providing advisory services to the authorities there on the Etihad deal at Abu Dhabi Airport. In infrastructure, manufacturing, and services Emiratis are keen to establish means of working with us. In banking, First Gulf Bank and Emirate NBD are present here, and in terms of banking, we are an Asian financial center. A glance at our geography reveals that we are a seven hour flight away, and we serve two distinctive regions, as a result of which we are both highly competitive and complementary.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for Singapore businesses and investment in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Over the past few years, we have seen many Singaporean master planning agencies and conceptual design companies go to Abu Dhabi to help plan zones and industrial districts. We are well known for urban and city planning; being a small city-state, we've learned from experience that a good blue print allows for sustainable development for decades to come, but that if you lack one, you very soon run into bottlenecks. On the master-planning front, we have many companies providing services there. This also includes areas such as water treatment and waste management, where we have some experience to contribute. Another area is individual building design; for example, we have several companies specialized in building hotels. Similarly, we have architects, and a good example of their success is the Dubai Mall, designed by DP Architects from Singapore. We even have companies in the retail sector. Charles and Keith, for example, is a Singaporean company. It really depends on what Abu Dhabi has to offer, and how open it is in terms of business opportunities.</p><div class="quote">“In infrastructure, manufacturing, and services Emiratis are keen to establish means of working with us."</div><h4>What were some of the milestones of the 2013 forum?</h4><p>We have had seven years of meetings thus far, and many success stories have emerged. One of the most productive components of the forum involves individual work groups. For example, the 2013 forum staged a work group on semiconductors, with others on water management, oil and gas, transport and logistics, and urban planning. The whole idea behind combining semiconductors and water management was to seek ways to work together; perhaps Abu Dhabi could borrow some of the experiences we have implemented in Abu Dhabi, or else co-develop some of the technology for export. Ultimately, I think what we have successfully forged with Abu Dhabi is a high level of understanding and trust, and indeed, we are now talking about third-country investments together. For example, much time has recently been devoted to investment opportunities in Southeast Asia, as we are among the top three investors in many countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In China, we rank among the top five. As a result, our friends from Abu Dhabi agree that we know this region well, and that they want to partner our companies to explore some of these opportunities.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The City of Knowledge is located in an area that used to be one of the US Army's headquarters. How did this come about?</h4><p>The original idea to create a City of Knowledge came from two prominent Panamanian businessmen, Fernando Eleta and Gabriel Lewis Galindo, who proposed to convert US Army Fort Clayton into an international center for knowledge exchange. This army base was the headquarters of the US Southern Command for several decades. In the context of the transference to Panama of what for almost a century was the Panama Canal Zone as a consequence of the Torrijos-Carter treaties, these two gentlemen conceived the idea of creating an international space to propitiate a platform to look for answers to the challenges of the 21st century. In 1998, President Ernesto Pérez Balladares attended the Summit of the Americas in Miami and he launched the idea of Panama being willing to replace soldiers and weapons with students, teachers, and books in something that was going to be named the City of Knowledge.</p><h4>The non-profit organization that manages the park, the City of Knowledge Foundation, was created in 1995. What are its main objectives?</h4><p>The main objectives were the launching of a platform conformed by prestigious universities and research centers, along with high-tech businesses and eventually international organizations. The presence of these actors, with the participation of local counterparts, should create added value in the pursuit of knowledge and its application to answer the key questions brought about by the 21st century. With that in mind, the first crucial decision led to the creation of a non-profit private foundation to facilitate continuity for this ambitious project. The model was organized around a board of trustees representing different sectors, including the academic-scientific community, the business community, the government, and labor unions. The presidents of the three main universities, the President of the Council of the Presidents of Universities, the National Secretary of Science, Technology, and Innovation, and a number of businessmen are part of the board of trustees of the foundation. We also have the ministers of Foreign Relations, Education, the Presidency, and of Finance and Economics, a representative of the National Assembly, our legislative body branch, as well as two representatives from organized labor unions.</p><h4>In what ways does the City of Knowledge contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p>The original concept was to attract universities from all over the world to Panama and to train people, not only from Panama, but also from neighboring countries. From day one, this project was conceived of as an internationally oriented project. The first idea was to create an international think tank, to invite all kinds of universities and people to discuss problems and projects, and to produce solutions. We soon realized that we should bring together two sectors that were traditionally apart, and often times opposed to each other: academia and the business community. The City of Knowledge Foundation signed an agreement with the government at the end of the term of Pérez Balladares. This effort translated into a law supported by all political parties at the end of last century, when the whole country was looking at the canal and wondering whether or not Panama could administer it efficiently; there was a certain unity of focus in the country. The Foundation has gained the respect of the community, the government, and we work directly with the business community and the universities, as well as the governmental agencies involved with the main areas covered. Because of its strategic geographical location, and despite being a small country, Panama has been playing a meaningful role on the international scene even before the term “globalization" became popular. That explains why the City of Knowledge was not conceived to look for answers only for Panama; it was conceived to search for answers for the region and the world.</p><div class="quote">“Every year we accept only 10% of the companies that apply to join the technology park at the City of Knowledge."</div><h4>What types of companies can set up in the City of Knowledge, and what economic benefits are offered to them?</h4><p>Every year we accept only 10% of the companies that apply to join the technology park at the City of Knowledge because we are strict about our admission process. The benefits are tax exemptions; they can conduct international business from here, and they also have migratory status, guaranteed by City of Knowledge visas issued by the government of Panama. Once a company is affiliated to the City of Knowledge Technology Park, work permits are issued as another benefit. These are also offered by other projects in Panama, like Panama Pací­fico, among others.</p><h4>How do you assess the level of innovation and infrastructure here in Panama and the government's efforts to improve it?</h4><p>At the City of Knowledge we created the first business incubator in the country. We have been committed to the promotion of entrepreneurship in Panama. We convene people who are well recognized as knowledgeable about information technologies and other disciplines to assess potential candidate businesses for the City of Knowledge. In 2013, we had about 98 applications and we only admitted nine companies. Once they are here, we supervise their commitment with innovation, research, and development, and if they do not fulfill what they committed to when they signed the affiliation agreement with us, then they are asked to leave. From 2010 to 2013, we audited 52 companies and eliminated 26. As of now, we have 83 companies, most of which are information companies at the technology park. They are basically IT and biotechnology companies that have established themselves to carry out research.</p><h4>What is the importance of sustainability for the City of Knowledge?</h4><p>From the beginning we wanted to create a community that would reflect the best practices within the umbrella of sustainability. If we are going to promote ourselves as a place that looks for answers for the 21st century, we have to commit ourselves and send a message. We promote sustainability in a range of ways—so much so that all the new buildings have to be certified according to the US LEED green building standards. The dormitories recently built received the highest level of LEED certification, platinum. Only four projects in all of Latin America are certified platinum. The Foundation has received international support from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the EU, the World Bank, CAF, and more. We had a six-year program with the EU that was crucial for our development. The program helped us to transfer technology from Europe to Latin America, and trained our team about best practices for scientific technology parks in the UK, France, Spain, and Italy. In total, they sent 17 missions with around 100 experts in different fields such as innovation and entrepreneurship. Learning best practices in Europe, they helped us promote and attract companies and universities; they also helped us organize and redesign some buildings. The program was for ‚¬13.3 million, and the foundation provided ‚¬3.6 million as counterpart.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[behind-the-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core reasons behind the current success of the construction sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The Colombian economy has experienced continued and impressive growth. This also means that people are experiencing a better financial position, and the first basic need they aim to solve is their housing situation; thus, they invest in real estate. A few years ago, many people did not have access to the housing market, which made the market stagnant. Also, Colombia has a large backlog in terms of housing and construction. Other reasons behind the construction sector's success include the number of investors with large amounts of cash available that have decided to invest in real estate—many people see real estate as assets that, despite crises, generate value and can be passed on as inheritance. Over the last few years, we have also seen the consolidation of the second housing segment. Finally, the boom of the trustee industry also gave a boost to the construction and real estate sectors. The level of trust toward the country has increased, and that has encouraged many people to invest in the country and leave their savings in Colombia rather than in other countries and currencies.</p><h4>In your opinion, what kind of real estate projects does Bogotá need right now?</h4><p>Projects with a social interest, as well as housing units for the lower strata of society, will continue to be necessary, because the backlog we have accumulated over the years is quite large—our country still has many people that require access to housing units. At the same time, the continued growth of the middle class requires additional residential real estate projects for them—society's purchasing power is increasing, thus allowing people to move up the social ladder. These two segments of the population still have potential for further development, especially the first one. Regarding upper-class residential projects, the market still offers opportunities in this segment too, but the potential is not as great. For institutional investors, there is also a great need for quality office buildings of single ownership in cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, and Bogotá. There is also an interesting potential in logistic or industrial park developments in free trade zones (FTZs).</p><div class="quote">“We have always believed that tough times are a synonym for opportunities."</div><h4>What role does your company play in the development of new social interest and lower strata real estate projects?</h4><p>We are a marketer of real estate projects, which has become very prominent among new investors arriving to Colombia or individuals and companies coming to Bogotá. We have also attracted many small constructors that are interested in outsourcing their marketing department. We advise our clients from A to Z, meaning that we analyze the potential of their projects, and how to better market their products. Marketing real estate projects also means we assume the administrative side of selling housing units, collecting the money, and registering processes. We have foreign clients, many of them from Spain, who see us as the best local partner to understand the market.</p><h4>Estrategias Comerciales is the market leader in brokerage of under construction projects. What explains your position in the market?</h4><p>We have always believed that tough times are a synonym for opportunities, which is how we were born; it was some 14 years ago, when Colombia had its first economic recession in more than 60 years. The country was in the middle of a banking and financial crisis, and the banks had a vast portfolio of new and incomplete projects. By the early 2000s, Colombia was advancing toward economic recovery thanks, amongst other factors, to the boost in exports that were enjoying a more attractive exchange rate in addition to growing prices for Colombia's leading export product: petroleum. During this time, we started marketing real estate assets from banks based on our vast knowledge of the industry. As the country walked toward recovery, we started working with property constructors on new projects. I believe that we can split the competition into three segments: real estate brokers (pure real estate companies that do nothing else other than act as an intermediary); large constructors and developers in Colombia (these companies do similar activities to ours, beside, of course, design and construction); and finally our particular segment of the industry, in which we have a niche. The first two segments I mentioned, however, are not in direct competition with us; they are just part of the sector.</p><h4>What is the potential for the real estate private equity industry?</h4><p>We are currently managing the sale of fiduciary investments in the hotel industry for retail clients, for example. The hotel industry in Colombia has expanded over the last few years due to a lack of facilities in the past, along with the increase of tourism activity in the country. Today, the country is catching up, and one way of doing that is by democratizing the investment in hotel projects. For example, we have a brokerage agreement with Grupo Hotelero Estelar, the largest Colombian hospitality company, which is owned by Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo of Grupo Aval. Grupo Estelar has constructed many hotels in the last few years under different schemes; it owns some of its hotels, and it has sold units to private investors. Now, it has finally democratized the investment in this segment of the real estate sector through real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, it went in search of people willing to buy fiduciary titles, a very interesting activity that makes those buying it direct owners of the project. The return on investment is between 9% and 15% at the moment, depending on the hotel and the location. Colombia is currently experiencing a boom in REITs and fiduciary duties, which are being applied in other segments of the sector apart from hospitality.</p><h4>What cities are you looking at in terms of expansion of your business activity?</h4><p>The Financial Times' Intelligence Unit highlighted the economic prospects of Cali and Barranquilla, mentioning the opportunities the signing of the FTA with the US offers for their commercial and business relations. Barranquilla is a very interesting city—a maritime city that is expanding quickly—and this has fostered the development of the real estate sector, too. We plan to open offices there in the near future. Cali, too, holds great potential for our business. Other cities with a great potential are Villavicencio, Ibagué, and Neiva. There many middle-sized cities with great potential in this country.</p><h4>Do you believe there is a real estate bubble in Bogotá?</h4><p>Property bubbles have a number of characteristics measured by numerous financial indicators, such as price-to-income ratio, the affordability index, the deposit-to-income ratio, and housing-debt-to-income ratio, to name a few. In my view, the main reason why real estate bubbles are created is the housing-debt-to-income ratio. In Colombia, this does not happen, because many people pay by cash and those asking for financing can only cover 50%-60% of the value of the property. This reduces risks. However, I think land supply is very limited, and, thus, costs are high, which is driving prices up in Bogotá. Furthermore, Standard &amp; Poor's has upgraded its credit rating for Colombia to BBB from BBB-.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Xerox contributed to the economic development of Ecuador?</h4><p>While Xerox has been growing annually, our goal has also been to promote our team's efficiency and productivity as much as needed to achieve the right goals. In that sense, for many years, we have set out our expectations according to a number of metrics such as customer and distributor satisfaction, which are both on the rise. Paper use is decreasing daily due to several environmental factors, adding up to efficiency and cost savings. For many years, this has been a negative trend for us, because we have been focused on printing paper. Now, we have recognized that the only way to survive in this multimedia world is by concentrating on creating efficient solutions in document management. Therefore, Xerox has always been a partner for our customers and not just a retailer. We focus on a few different market segments, including SMBs and top-tier corporates. On these three levels we have always made an effort to provide efficiency through consulting to our business partners. Our consulting services are based on managing their documentation processes to better understand how we can assist them. Being a business partner implies generating networking relations at all corporate levels and investing money, time, and technology. After all, we have a similar approach to smaller businesses. As a result of our consulting services, we have transformed our business model. At the same time, we have promoted the digital document process geared toward customer productivity.</p><h4>What is the importance of Ecuador within Xerox's global portfolio?</h4><p>Xerox Ecuador has been the best operation model around the globe over the past four or five years. There are four main regions, including the US and Canada, Asia, Europe, and the emerging markets such as Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and the CIS. Among these 180 countries, Ecuador has delivered the best performance and YoY growth. We have also had the biggest market share increase and implemented many unique services over the past three years.</p><div class="quote">“The government in Ecuador is an important customer that has multiple service requirements."</div><h4>Why is the Ecuadorean market such a strong performer for Xerox?</h4><p>There are several reasons behind this, one being that Xerox has been here for around 48 years. For instance, our success is our passion; we're proud to be Ecuadorean and hard workers. Also, our customer's trust due to our value proposition is key.</p><h4>Last year you mentioned that Xerox still faced the challenge of being perceived to be focused on paper. What have you been doing to change that?</h4><p>This has been hard for us to be honest. We've been emphasizing Xerox's involvement in digitalization and the outsourcing of technology business processes, including the banking segment. Our communication to top executives is that Xerox offers IT services and more. We are now closing deals on this matter with some of the largest companies in the region. This organization is divided horizontally and vertically, meaning that we have units that focus on specific segments such as electronic archiving and banking and education services. One of our projects, Yachay Laboratories, is where we're investing to develop new service technologies.</p><h4>How important is the public sector for Xerox in Ecuador?</h4><p>The government in Ecuador is an important customer that has multiple service requirements. There are around 6,000 companies in this segment, meaning the government is our biggest client.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are your major goals for the next few years?</h4><p>First of all, our customers are our main focus. Xerox is doing well in terms of revenue, profit, market share, inventory, and collections. However, our purpose is to leave a legacy based not only on financial results. Secondly, our customers are going to receive fewer documents printed by Xerox, because we are corporate citizens conscious about the environment. Consequently, we develop software, technology, and electronics in order to cut down on paper use. We also keep social investment in mind to reinvest our earnings in social projects. For example, we reforest native trees on our main forests in Quito, having planted more than a thousand trees. We have recycling strategies for toners and cartridges. Last but not least, we're keen to develop our employees, since they are our main asset.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Ford performed in the Mexican market recently?</h4><p>We have been present in Mexico for close to 90 years, and have become one of its largest exporters. I would describe the performance of Ford in Mexico as outstanding. Naturally, that has much to do with the massive investments made over the course of recent years, such as the expansion of the production plant in Hermosillo, which grew from 56 vehicles per hour to 62 vehicles per hour—that means an annual capacity of 380,000 units. Since 201, we have also invested in the launch of the new Fusion model, the opening of a new engine plant in Chihuahua, and the refurbishment of the Cuautitlán assembly plant for the launch of the new model Fiesta. We have been growing our engineering capacity in Mexico by expanding the Product Development Center headcount from 50 to near 1,000 engineers by the end of 2013. Moreover, we are undertaking design work for the broader Ford universe. These achievements have granted us a wholly different status. The new investments provided such scale that, in 2013, we became the country's second largest exporter. We are keen to sustain this momentum, but of course our competitors have not been idle. Some that were once solely importers are today planning, or are already building, production facilities in Mexico.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of the Mexican market?</h4><p>I would identify them as highly competitive labor cost and logistics, as well as proximity to the US, which is the second largest market after China. A number of carmakers have also established production bases here. This makes for a unique combination, rendering Mexico virtually unrecognizable from even a decade ago, when companies were entering solely for the promise of cheap labor. In general terms, importing components and assembling vehicles here for shipping to the US was previously the name of the game. However, growth in production volumes made investments by suppliers and manufacturers a workable proposition, thus providing the scale needed to also make financial sense. Numerous companies therefore established a presence in Mexico. Meanwhile, as part of a broader infrastructure drive to advance the nation, the government has launched numerous institutions of higher education with the aim of developing Mexico's indigenous skill base; an investment in the future of the nation. And so today we have skilled labor prepared to tackle the demands of business. That's why Mexico has gone from being a basic car manufacturer to an engineering and design workshop. The rules are changing.</p><div class="quote">“We remain committed to Mexico, and therefore plan to sustain our prominent role in the sector."</div><h4>What examples of Ford's innovative spirit would you care to highlight?</h4><p>Our product development center is underpinned by innovation. We have a very aggressive target for 2014, in which we plan to register at least 50 diverse patents with the US patent office, ranging from tires to upholstery. The good news is that Mexican engineers themselves are behind these innovations. The average age at our product development center is 28 years, and we have been hiring approximately 150 people a year. These skilled individuals are tasked with making our components better, lighter, simpler, and faster. Ford of Mexico's total headcount stands at around 8,400.</p><h4>What are your production plans?</h4><p>Hermosillo will remain the key source of the Fusion and MKZ Lincoln models for the US market. We are already exporting the Fusion model around the world. China is poised to commence importing the MKZ Lincoln by the second half of the year, and will become an important destination for our products due to its growth story. Lincoln is a low-volume product, but nevertheless is important for us for being the first product be launched in China. We will raise the production of the four-liter engine to 450,000 units and the diesel engine plant to over 180,000 units a year, totaling over 600,000 engines per year at our Chihuahua plant.</p><h4>Do you see Mexico as a logistics platform?</h4><p>The transportation infrastructure in Mexico is reasonably well developed, and the government continues to work on urgent improvements. Nevertheless, more improvement is required at our ports and on the railroad network, which would in turn boost investor appetite.</p><h4>What is the focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>We provide engineering services to Europe, China, and the US, among others, and boast an excellent delivery track record that has supported our growth strategy. Another element is that numerous suppliers have established themselves in Mexico, a fact that we take full advantage of. Having purchased $500 million worth of production materials some years back, we closed 2013 with a little over $11 billion in related purchases. Some of those components are for the local market, while the remainder are destined for export. Mexico today accounts for 14% of Ford's global purchases, yet we expect the number to increase in light of the benefits on offer here. The added scale will translate into improved competitiveness, potentially lower costs, and better quality. The activity of new ventures established in the country, in addition to volume growth, will provide further economies of scale that will favor investments yet to come in a virtuous circle. Meanwhile, we continue to scope out opportunities for marked expansion over the course of the next four to five years. And while we play our cards close to our chest, we are pursuing an aggressive growth plan in terms of product development. The plants continue to be upgraded in line with our general advancement, while new products and models are strategically launched.</p><h4>How do you envisage the future performance of the sector?</h4><p>We remain committed to Mexico, and therefore plan to sustain our prominent role in the sector within the export and local markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the new national automotive policy unique?</h4><p>The policy is comprehensive and was designed to complement the circumstances of various stakeholders. Currently, we are importing over 90% of the vehicles we use. Automobiles and spare parts, including tires, are the second biggest user of foreign exchange. As the economy improves and demand grows, it will soon be the number one user of foreign exchange. Part of the policy relates to looking at how to develop the internal market with affordable vehicles and a financing scheme. VON Nigeria Ltd will be assembling low-cost Hyundai vehicles that will compete with imported used vehicles. We will also be developing an affordable vehicle-financing scheme. Over 90% of automobiles are sold on a cash basis here, as vehicle financing through the banks is done at an interest rate of 22% per annum, which is not affordable for many purchasers. This is why we are working with some banks and other agencies to see if we can obtain affordable financing at the single-digit level, perhaps 9%. That should make vehicles more affordable and boost the market. We estimate the demand for vehicles will double to about 700,000 units annually if there is an affordable vehicle scheme. You can see that the potential demand in the market is huge. Also, there is the issue of patronage. All government agencies and ministries are mandated to prioritize products from local assembly plants, except when the kind they want is not produced locally. We are also planning to build automotive supply parks, and these will have all the necessary facilities; a road network, power, water, and other infrastructure, so that companies can come and get established quickly. We are addressing standards by outlining automotive safety standards and are building an automotive test center, where vehicles and components will be tested to ensure their safe use. Finally, we have programs for manpower development. These include creating a curriculum for training mechanics in modern automotive technology, and setting a syllabus for teaching automotive engineering in Nigerian universities. We will collaborate with the Industrial Training Fund as well to set up automotive production/training centers.</p><h4>How is the National Automotive Council (NAC) helping to attract investment in the sector?</h4><p>The policy is designed specifically to attract investment into the sector. Since the policy was announced, over 10 major OEMs from Europe and Asia have expressed interest in investing in Nigeria and have signed technical partnerships with Nigerian companies either to use the existing assembly plants or establish new ones. We are working with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) to attract component manufacturers that will supply the assembly plants. Vehicle assembly started in Nigeria in the 1960s by some companies using semi-knocked-down (SKD) kits. The government became involved when it established six assembly plants in the 1970s using completely-knocked-down (CKD) kits. These were producing over 100,000 vehicles annually by the 1980s, with local content programs vigorously pursued. However, our financial crises, which started from 1985, led to a drastic reduction in demand for new vehicles and the beginning of the shift of demand to second-hand vehicles. This coupled with the lack of government patronage and the lowering of the vehicle import tariffs in 2005 led to the collapse of the industry. While demand for new vehicles recovered from 2000 onwards, the local industry was not in a position to compete. This new policy took account of that failure to ensure it is not repeated.</p><div class="quote">“We are working with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) to attract component manufacturers."</div><h4>Do you foresee a resurgence in tire manufacturing due to changes in the automotive policy?</h4><p>We are a tropical country, so we have had rubber plantations since colonial times. Michelin and Dunlop started producing tires in Nigeria in 1962 and 1963, respectively. They were meeting about 80% of our needs, then about three million tires annually by 2005, and even had plans to expand to meet market demand. In 2005, we lowered the tariffs from a 40% import duty to 10% for truck tires and 20% for car tires. This caused the factories to close down because they could not compete with Indian and Chinese tire manufacturers. They are now exporting the rubber from their plantations and importing finished tires. We are now spending about $1 billion on importing about 5 million tires annually. The new policy has a special provision to encourage tire manufacturing in Nigeria.</p><h4>How does the policy address the issue of dealerships?</h4><p>We have two types of automotive dealers at the moment: dealers that trade with representatives of major OEMs and dealers that depend wholly on the sale of imported second-hand vehicles. The policy is geared toward producing affordable vehicles and, when coupled with an affordable vehicle-financing scheme, will reduce the demand for used vehicles. There are also tariff measures in the policy to reduce the demand for used vehicles. The dealers of second-hand vehicles would be assisted to become distributors for the assembly plants. The credit purchase scheme we are establishing would be through the dealers. There would still be a second-hand vehicle market, but it would be fed locally, not with imports. This policy does raise the bar against imports, which tends to encourage smuggling. However, there is a provision in this policy to put in place a very tight program to prevent smuggling that involves a new cross check mechanism and national database for vehicle identification numbers.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries Wealth contributing to a diversified economy in the Sultanate of Oman?</h4><p>The Omani economy is passing through the diversifying process by focusing on other renewable resources. In the next five-year plan, the government will include fisheries and mining along with tourism, oil, and logistics. One of the components of Oman's diversified economy is fisheries, which includes both sea fishing and aquaculture. We feel that we should utilize the opportunities and optimize production from the seas and also accelerate the growth of aquaculture by expanding production. Of course, this will, by extension, contribute to food security and provide a healthy protein source to the nation and further afield as we export 50% of our production. We are the largest market in the GCC, and Europe is also a key export destination. Over the next four or five years, we are trying to focus on the quantities exported to Europe as these are more lucrative value-added products.</p><h4>The development strategy adopted by the Ministry is supported by a budget of $1.3 billion. What will be the main projects executed within the scope of Vision 2020?</h4><p>We are of course primarily interested in expanding infrastructure, and work is being done to bring ports in all coastal towns to the required level of readiness for business. By the end of this period we will have around 30 multipurpose fishing ports that will not only serve the fishing sector, but also the tourism and trade sectors. We expect these multipurpose ports to greatly assist the fisheries and tourism enterprises to be developed as there is wide scope for development. In addition to the new ports, we are also modernizing eight fishing ports built 10-20 years ago. We will enlarge them and develop more facilities to receive the fishing and tourism fleet. Funds have also been allocated to build wholesale fish markets as well as retail markets in all cites of the Sultanate in order to create an efficient marketing system. Fleets will be renewed, while we have also allocated funds for aquaculture development. We are trying to ensure that the processing sector generates value-added to maximize the income or value of the fisheries and export processed products to the optimum markets. These are really the main components: infrastructure, fleet development, fisherman training, the development of aquaculture, and a focus on post-harvest activities to reduce waste and optimize the value of production.</p><div class="quote">“The Omani economy is passing through the diversifying process by focusing on other renewable resources."</div><h4>How do you promote entrepreneurship among the population?</h4><p>The social component features within our plan: when you build a port or a fish market, people work there as there is a reduced need to migrate from villages to the capital city. We are maximizing the value of this sector by also creating employment for nationals. Fishing is an appealing sector today, and the sector currently employs more than 45,000 Omanis, including the Ministry's staff itself. Some of those are part-time workers, but others are full-time employees. What attracts them to the sector is the prices on offer for a good product, which reflects in their income. We feel that with the high surge in fish prices and global demand for fish, people will choose to remain in this sector.</p><h4>The experiences of many countries confirm the potential of aquaculture as an industry to diversify sources of income. What will be the impact of aquaculture for the development of fisheries in Oman?</h4><p>We expect to produce around 200,000 tons of fish products by the year 2030, which is the equivalent of our current production from the sea. This means that Oman can double its production over the next 15 or so years from the current 200,000 tons from the sea, although we are aiming by 2030 to have reached close to 500,000 tons of sea-fishery and aquaculture products. Aquaculture will play an instrumental role in boosting production, increasing the income from the seas of Oman, and also creating thousands of jobs for nationals, especially graduates from universities and training schools, and other Omanis. This is the objective we are trying to achieve by promoting this sector. We are basing our plan on the experience of Norway, Turkey, Chile, Scotland, and other Mediterranean countries—those are the pioneers in this area. We invite investors from these countries to explore the opportunities in Omani waters. We are building on the experience of others, and that is why we are aggressively promoting the sector in Oman. We also promote our aquaculture and fisheries sector internationally by attending key trade shows in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.</p><h4>Investment represents a crucial factor for the development of these sectors. What incentives are you promoting to attract international investment?</h4><p>We provide incentives to investors by streamlining the process of doing business in Oman. The FDI law in Oman is highly transparent and attractive, and the government is providing incentives to bring in investors. Most such incentives have traditionally gone to the petroleum industry, but we are trying to shift investor attention to other sectors by promoting a range of sectors. We provide land at what may be the lowest lease terms in the region. We also streamline the process by reducing the time needed to obtain permits. We have a one-stop shop here within the Ministry to help investors obtain permits, environmental and otherwise. Furthermore, we supply trained labor from local universities. The financial system in Oman is extremely robust and, again, transparent. Meanwhile, the legal framework in Oman safeguards investors.</p><h4>Regarding FDI, what are your latest achievements?</h4><p>We started promoting aquaculture early last year. We have received over 30 applications for the aquaculture business, but only permitted 19 schemes with a total value of OMR130 million. This investment is a joint venture between Omani investors and foreign investment from Asia, the US, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and elsewhere. There is a collection of investors and investment coming from different parts of the world. Now we are gearing up to work with the first four companies to start their construction phase, probably within 2014.</p><h4>What role does technology play in this sector?</h4><p>Our fishermen and people employed in the sector are undergoing training to adopt modern technology to improve the efficiency of fishing gear and vessels as well as to maximize the output of the aquaculture sector. We have companies in the US transferring state-of-the-art technology to Oman, and we may in fact be the first recipients in the region. Moreover, we want to become a leading player in aquaculture by leveraging every opportunity that our location provides, namely clean seas and suitable locations for aquaculture.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's vision for the future?</h4><p>We want to create a world-class, sustainable, and competitive fisheries sector. By 2020, that will bring benefits to society and is what our citizens deserve from their natural resources. Of course, sustainability is essential for a world-class, competitive fishery sector. We are also supporting the development of other infrastructure—airports, ports, and roads—all of which will be of benefit to the fisheries sector. Ultimately, we envisage being able to export directly from the area of production. This will allow Oman to become the hub for the food and fishery industries.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Today, key sectors such as oil and gas, engineering goods, food, metals, luxury goods, automotive, and aviation are all major contributors to the growth of Dubai and its logistics sector. How did this help your business in 2013?<br></h4><p>FedEx is a major contributor to the business community. We facilitate international trade and enhance customer flexibility and speed to market through our well-established international air and intra-regional ground network, which connects over 99% of the world's GDP. Shippers from different industries turn to FedEx for its capabilities to provide access through innovative and customized solutions, and our business certainly benefits from that. As demand from key sectors grow, FedEx develops specific solutions that better meet its clients' logistics needs. For example, recognizing the growth of the aviation sector in the region and now specializing in shipping requirements, FedEx showcased its Aerospace Solutions during the 2013 Dubai Airshow. Companies from the aviation sector can now access an extensive range of FedEx-tailored shipping services that meet the time-sensitive demands of acquiring components to manufacture, maintain, or repair aircraft back into service. Such innovative solutions have enabled companies across different industries reach new markets and fulfill the needs of their customers.</p><h4>In your last interview with TBY you said that “making every customer experience outstanding" defines your service quality. How do you apply this statement to your services?</h4><p>Over the 41 years of our existence, we have constantly enhanced every aspect of customer interaction that facilitates their shipping process and enhances their overall experience. We foster an environment of continuous improvement and innovation through all our customer touch points including online technology and automation tools, customer service, package pickup and delivery, sales, and customs clearance operations to ensure we deliver the best possible service to our customers. In addition, our 300,000 team members globally are our biggest strength in ensuring every customer receives exceptional service; therefore, it is extremely important that we continuously provide our team members with various quality enhanced tools and systems.</p><div class="quote">“The numbers are definitely growing and the UAE has quickly regained its economic foothold after the recession."</div><h4>Dubai is one of the largest trade hubs in the world, and the largest re-export hub in the region. What business opportunities does Dubai bring for new investors in the logistics sector?</h4><p>Dubai has certainly secured itself as a regional and global trade hub. Today, the logistics sector is in a better position to capitalize on the increasing trading opportunities of non-oil products as a result of Dubai's diversified economy. The World Bank and IFC's Doing Business 2014 report ranked the UAE fourth in the Trading Across Borders category. This is supported by several factors such as the free trade agreements (FTAs) and world-class infrastructure that is continuously upgraded to maximize the import and export of goods. Dubai's strategic geographic location and easy access is the perfect gateway between the East and West, providing the logistics sector with the opportunity to facilitate and boost trade. Additionally, the presence of free zones across Dubai simplifies the establishment of new businesses, and as such SMEs and international companies can set up without compromising on ownership, taxes, currency restrictions, or custom duties.</p><h4>The transport and logistics cluster is an important sector in the UAE economy, comprising 10.4% of non-oil GDP in 2005. What is your forecast for the logistics sector for 2014 in Dubai?</h4><p>The numbers are definitely growing and the UAE has quickly regained its economic foothold after the recession as a regional business center and is continually reinforcing its position as a global business hub. Dubai Customs reported that Dubai's non-oil foreign trade hit AED1.3 trillion ($354 billion) in value in 2013. The logistics sector in Dubai is expected to continue to develop with the government heavily investing in infrastructure to support the demand for international and domestic shipping. With plans for Expo 2020 underway, businesses of all sizes, from both the public and private sectors, will be involved in fuelling growth across all major industries in the country, including logistics. Express transport companies will need to continue expanding their operations and have the ability to cater to various key sectors. The industries that are expected to benefit the most from Expo 2020 vary from retail and banking to recruitment and transport. These all require very specific shipping requirements. Currently, we are also seeing an influx of SMEs being established in Dubai that require logistics solutions for both local and international customers. The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) has reported that, in 2013, over 95% of the companies that operate from the free zone are new to Dubai. These SMEs are expected to contribute to the growth of the logistics industry in 2014 and beyond as they expand their businesses in the country, throughout the region, and globally.</p><h4>The size and efficiency of Dubai's ports have made the Emirate the third largest re-export hub after Hong Kong and Singapore. How do Dubai's ports act as a key factor for your business?</h4><p>The ports in Dubai are crucial to our business as we connect the 69 countries across the Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and Africa to the rest of the world through our regional hub based at terminal 2 of Dubai International Airport. The hub is equipped with a pre-clearance facility that allows us to move goods quickly and efficiently in order to meet the demands of our customers. Jebel Ali Port is one of the largest in the world, and together with the airports and excellent road connectivity to the rest of the region, Dubai has established itself as one of the best multi-modal and re-export hubs in the world. To facilitate the growing trade, FedEx, in November 2011, opened a 48,000 square foot facility at the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza) that includes warehousing and cold storage facilities along with a dedicated FedEx clearance brokerage service. While this adds value to our shipping capabilities within UAE, it also gives customers in the free zone greater connectivity to the FedEx global network. Our presence there allows us to offer next-day service from Jafza to the GCC, Europe, and North America.</p><h4>In 2009, Dubai International Airport handled 1.9 million tons of cargo. Volumes are expected to surpass 3 million tons by the end of 2015. What is your approach to this forecast?</h4><p>A recent report from Dubai International Airport states that cargo volumes reached record levels in 2013 with approximately 2.4 million tons of air freight passing through the airport. As the logistics industry develops and the economy continues its forward momentum, we have developed the infrastructure required to match the growth expected over the next few years. In order to cater to the continued and growing demand for logistics, FedEx has invested in building its infrastructure across the UAE. We have been in the midst of a series of expansions. Last year, we opened our latest facility located in Skycity Business and Logistics Park at the Abu Dhabi International Airport. Strategically located, this facility provides enhanced connectivity to the FedEx regional hub in Dubai and aims at improving service coverage to the industrial areas and upcoming developments within the capital. We have also recently increased our flights through our Dubai hub to a total of 44 FedEx flights and 700 commercial flights a week. The growth of air cargo in this region has been exceptional, and we want to ensure that our capabilities continue to meet customer demand.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Dubai's logistics infrastructure?</h4><p>Dubai differentiates itself by investing in its world-class infrastructure, such as global airline connections, and has also created a business-friendly climate with the establishment of free zones such as Dubai Airport Free Zone, Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and Dubai Healthcare City, to name a few. The UAE government continues to make significant investments in infrastructure development to meet the demands of its growing population. The metro and rail network is being extended, more roads and bridges are being built, and the capacities of the two airports in Dubai are being expanded. A report by HSBC states that Dubai will invest over AED30 billion ($8.2 billion) in new infrastructure to host the World Expo 2020. This will significantly drive the growth of the logistics sector. With thousands of participants in addition to the 25 million visitors expected at the six-month long event, the demand for logistics services will also grow significantly.</p><h4>FedEx Express provided shipping and logistics solutions to exhibitors and visitors during Dubai Airshow 2013 in November and has been an official sponsor since 2005. How was your experience at this event?</h4><p>Being the preferred courier of the Dubai Airshow 2013 was a great experience. FedEx has been a key exhibitor since the mid-1990s, enabling us to be part of the growth in the aviation industry in the region. Our exhibit last year was the largest to date for us and illustrated our rich history of participation with this premier event. Sponsoring the event serves as an ideal platform for FedEx to highlight its core competencies and capabilities in offering innovative shipping solutions in the Middle East, and globally.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the recent completion of the Iraqi Kurdistan to Turkey pipeline affect Genel Energy's operations in the area?</h4><p>The construction of the additional pipeline, which links up to the existing one between Iraq and Turkey, was unthinkable just a few years ago. It is now complete and will initially carry oil from our Taq Taq and Tawke fields with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day. When compared with the past, we can see that there are more companies in the region now, most of which are making rewarding discoveries. The rate of exploration and production (E&amp;P) growth in Kurdistan and the prospects therein have seen a wave of oil majors move into the region. Therefore, we will be witnessing more small players being replaced or partnering up with large players. When we talk about our company, Genel Energy, having increased the number of assets from five to seven, we are today the largest holder of reserves in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). In addition to our best-known oil assets, we have two huge gas assets from which we intend to deliver gas to Turkey by the end of 2017. Genel is the first company to supply gas to local power plants in Kurdistan. Currently, gas is being delivered to Duhok power station. Additionally, conceptual design studies on a gas export pipeline are in progress in the Miran field.</p><h4>How do you see these energy deals between Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) affecting Turkey's role in the regional energy sector?</h4><p>The most outstanding development in 2013 is the signing of an Energy Framework Agreement with the KRG in March followed by a set of contracts between KRG and a recently established Turkish state-run company, TEC. In the meantime, a brand new crude oil pipeline was fully commissioned by the KRG. The infrastructure is ready. In January 2014, oil started to flow through this new pipeline connecting into the existing ITP to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Today, there are about 1.5 million barrels of oil stored in Ceyhan. Three-way mediations are ongoing between Ankara, Erbil, and Baghdad. I am fully confident that problems will be solved sooner or later. As one can easily predict, contractors in the KRG are looking forward to a lasting solution as they have been investing billions of dollars in this region for a decade now. Therefore, it is essential that they enjoy a stable and amicable business environment in Iraq. Let us not forget that any contract in this region would reflect positively on Turkey's energy sector. We are especially talking about a vital gas play in our immediate neighborhood. Nonetheless, we can highlight KRG and other East Mediterranean, Caspian, and Asian reserves to the East when the energy security of Turkey and even Europe is considered.</p><div class="quote">“We are known as the pioneer of the E&amp;P sector in the KRI because we have been actively engaged there for more than a decade."</div><h4>In March 2014, two additional Genel Energy wells became operational. What are your expectations for further drilling during the remainder of 2014?</h4><p>We have two very important producing fields in the region: Taq Taq and Tawke. The Taq Taq field is currently producing 130,000 bbl/d, but by the end of the year we will have increased this volume to 200,000 bbl/d. In Tawke, our maximum capacity is 130,000 bbl/d, and we are planning to increase this to 200,000 bbl/d—300,000 bbl/d is expected to be produced from the Tawke and Taq Taq crude fields overall.</p><h4>Genel Energy recently acquired the exploration rights for fields in Angola. Could you please elaborate on your expectations from this deal?</h4><p>We are known as the pioneer of the E&amp;P sector in the KRI because we have been actively engaged there for more than a decade. Things are a bit different today because we are now a public company and are perceiving the need for diversification. This underpinned our decision to invest in the Mediterranean, especially the western Mediterranean, mainly Morocco and Malta. The decision to become involved in the rest of Africa was made about two years ago, and now we are taking the steps to implement those decisions. The Angolan contract that we recently signed, as well as Morocco, Somaliland, Malta, Ethiopia, and the Ivory Coast, are merely a continuation of our growing forward policy. In most cases, we are looking to geographies where we become the pioneers and have the chance to duplicate our success in Kurdistan. The Angola deal is particularly different because our technical team has found out that the geology is directly analogous to that of offshore Brazil. As a result, the expectations on numbers in this concession are huge.</p><h4>How are the Turkish roots of Genel Energy defining your business activities abroad?</h4><p>Until 10 years ago, Africa was known as a continent of hunger and poverty, whereas today it is regarded as a potential economic and political partner. Turkey's intense engagement with Africa is interesting thanks to the government's new foreign policy. New Turkish embassies in African countries have resulted in increasing interest for commercial entities in the continent. With Turkish roots and an experienced British CEO, Tony Hayward, it is worth mentioning that we are building a high impact portfolio in challenging geographies such as Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Genel Energy's success so far has paved the way for other entities in Turkey to follow the same path, and today we see new companies active in neighboring countries in the E&amp;P sector. We can, therefore, position ourselves as one of the pioneers in this sector.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2014?</h4><p>For 2014, we definitely have higher goals and expectations. We are aiming to boost our production capacity in Kurdistan and concentrate mainly on the delivery of gas to Turkey. Regarding the remaining assets in Africa, we are expecting to post new exploration successes in all the concessions we have.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

What do Cali and the Cauca Valley need to do to become one of the most competitive regions in Latin America?</h4><p>I believe the most important infrastructure development we need in order to become more competitive is the completion of the dual carriageway to the Pacific port of Buenaventura, which has been under construction for a long time, while we also need to increase the depth of the access canal to the port of Buenaventura to receive the larger ships that will be passing through the new Panama Canal when finished. Although the geographical conditions are difficult, it would also be an ideal complement to the port's airport to have a longer landing strip to accommodate large cargo aircraft. Besides, of great importance is the construction of the La Lí­nea highway tunnel, which will cross beneath the central range of the Andes Mountains, easing traffic on one of Colombia's most important east-west connections. Unfortunately, it is being built in only one direction, for export cargo only, and ideally it should operate in both directions.</p><h4>How has the municipality rediscovered Cali's exemplary civic spirit following the troubles of recent years, and what has been the current mayor's role in this transformation?</h4><p>Firstly, we managed to elect a good mayor who has appointed highly competent and hard working people to all his cabinet positions. For example, Oscar Pardo, a very competent and serious professional, was named as head of EMCALI, our public utilities provider, and he has managed to rebuild that company, which was mismanaged by the corrupt officials of previous local governments, to the point that, in 2013, it produced important profits for the city. One thing that we should have done, following the Antioquia region's example, was to create publicly held corporations, which are now at the heart of its economy. Instead, the companies in our region continued to be family owned and did not open up to the Colombian retail investor base, not allowing us to grow as well.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia and Mexico are the only two countries that have solid and well-implemented fiduciary sectors."</div><h4>You founded De Lima &amp; Co. in 1953 in Cali, and it soon became the country's most important insurance broker with offices in the most important cities, as well as joint ventures with local partners in Central America, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic. An important milestone for the company was the association with Marsh &amp; McLennan. Could you walk us through this fascinating history?</h4><p>Marsh &amp; McLennan is the largest insurance broker in the world and our relationship began in 1957 when I was a true beginner in the business, although I did have some thoughts of how to improve broker services. Back in those days insurance was offered to friends over a drink or lunch and I felt that there had to be a more professionalized way to provide that service, so I began studying how the business was conducted in other parts of the world. One of the business practices that I felt should be changed was the exclusivity agreement that agents had at that time with insurance companies, which obviously limited the intermediary's capacity to offer different solutions and alternatives to its clients, so I began insisting, in a very courteous manner, to the insurance company I was working with, that I be allowed to act as an agent for other companies, because they didn't provide certain insurance products that I wanted to offer my clients. As a result of my persistent requests I was authorized to ask Seguros Bolivar if it would be interested in working with my agency, so I immediately went to see the management. I remember they received me with open arms and said “We've been waiting for you to visit us for a long time!" and proceeded to draft the required documentation to register me as an authorized agent. I soon had Colseguros, which is now Allianz, asking me to work with it and suggesting that I write a formal letter requesting that it consider the possibility of receiving some of my business, which I gladly did. This attracted other insurance companies like AIG and Assicurazione Generali, thus allowing my agency to grow quite rapidly, and so did the number of my employees. Naturally, this inspired other insurance agents who followed my path, thus professionalizing the industry. That is why I believe persistence is the key to success. Since I was offering a slightly better service than my peers, my business in Cali was growing rapidly. Besides, as a result of my passion for skeet shooting and hunting, I had many friends in some of the multinationals that at the time operated in Cali, and this allowed me to offer brokerage services for some of their insurance lines, but not all of them, since Johnson &amp; Higgins or Marsh &amp; McLennan were managing those lines from New York. So I'd ask my friends, have those chaps from the US ever come here or have you seen their faces? And the answer was always negative! I then decided to travel to New York, and visited the president of the Latin American Division of the American Foreign Insurance Association (AFIA), which represented the interests of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, whom I had met when he visited Cali. He was kind to put me in contact with Arthur Mayes, the person in charge of the then very small international division of Marsh &amp; McLennan, who first asked my age and, when I told him I was 24, he was really surprised at me being so daring! He then asked me what I had to offer them and I told him I would gladly service his clients in Colombia and in fact I'd brought reference letters from some of them. We had had a good long chat, and I believe I made a positive impression on him, as he quickly agreed to appoint me as their correspondent for Colombia, but he requested that I open an office in Bogotá. I nearly swallowed my tongue in shock, but I nonchalantly said “no problem," and soon I had an operation in that city, which was so successful that shortly thereafter I opened an office in Barranquilla, the country's fourth largest city. A few years later, I hired a North American, whose name was Roland Schambach, and although he didn't know the first bit about insurance, he was such a likeable person that he started to open doors, to the point that we had managed to get some international clients that were based in Medellí­n. At first we sent our technical people from Cali to service those clients, but we decided to search for a proper candidate to be in charge of that office and, after several interviews, hired a young talented man, who soon turned it into a very successful operation.</p><h4>Marsh, and the company you founded, DeLima Marsh, have received a number of awards such as the Business Insurance Innovation Award, the Global Infrastructure Insurance House of the Year, the Risk Innovator, and the CIR Business Continuity Award, amongst others. What allows Marsh to continue being a leader in so many of its business areas?</h4><p>It is true that the company frequently receives a number of recognitions and perhaps it is because it has always distinguished itself for being the leading global broker, providing superior service to its clients, and this is a fact recognized by the majority of the large insurance buyers in the world.</p><h4>According to Stella Villegas, president of the Fiduciary Association of Colombia, “the industry's assets under management in the country, as of February 2013, were in the order of Ps259 trillion." Could you comment on the importance of the fiduciary industry in Colombia?</h4><p>Strangely enough, Colombia and Mexico are the only two countries that have solid and well-implemented fiduciary sectors, a model that we actually brought from Mexico some 30 years ago. In Colombia, almost all important construction projects have a fiduciary company involved, which is not the case in other countries, including the US. I believe our neighbors should follow our path as it avoids the risk for investors in real estate properties to lose their money if the builders face bankruptcy, something which has frequently occurred around the world when real estate bubbles burst, and, as a result, the fiduciary companies here are quite successful. Alianza Fiduciaria is the largest manager of real estate fiduciary assets, and we also manage investment funds for our clients. We are currently working on opening subsidiaries in Panama and Peru, and recently the Investment Fund, Advent International, acquired a 50% stake in this company.</p><h4>Speaking about the real estate market, where do you believe one can find the best investment opportunities in the country at the moment?</h4><p>Unfortunately the country's centralism has affected the homogenous development of Colombia, because the ideal would be to have a fairly equal development of all our regions. In Argentina, for example, with the exception of the provinces of Rosario and Mendoza, we see how the majority of economic activity revolves around greater Buenos Aires, and in Peru we see the weight of Lima in the country's economy. Colombia is blessed because it has many regions with a fairly good level of economic development. However, 73% of new office spaces are being built in Bogotá, when it is only home to 17% of the country's population. This disparity is explained because many of the foreign companies that arrive in Colombia decide to settle in Bogotá. The real estate sector presents good opportunities for investors and, in other cities, like Cali and Bucaramanga, for instance, prices are less than half of what one would find in Bogotá. As a result of this situation, in 2012 Goodyear transferred its top management and offices back to Cali, and what drove that decision was the high real estate prices and mobility difficulties of Bogotá.</p><h4>You've spoken about Alianza Fiduciaria's asset management division, and the government has approved a new regulation that introduces some interesting changes to the sector. What impact do you expect this new regulation to have on Colombia, the fourth largest asset management industry in Latin America?</h4><p>I believe this new regulation is going to attract new players to the market. Precisely the reason behind Advent's investment in Alianza Fiduciaria was the interesting prospects that exist for Colombia's asset management business. This sector of the economy is becoming a very professionalized business and the majority of the country's banking institutions have asset management divisions that can be combined with wealth management, inheritance planning, and such. I believe the new regulation offers greater opportunities to the current players in the market. Besides, quite a number of new real estate funds are being launched, which allows investors to diversify the risk and exposure to their portfolios. Alianza Fiduciaria and Alianza Valores are currently working on a real estate fund to offer our clients this alternative investment.</p><h4>How important is the new alliance between Advent International and Alianza Fiduciaria for its future?</h4><p>Advent is one of the world's largest private equity investment funds, with a strong management and track record. This alliance provides the support of a very well-respected company, operating in 16 countries, which recently acquired a 22% stake in Colombia's Ocensa oil pipeline for $1.1 billion. Its presence enables us to compete with the majority of our peers that enjoy the support of strong banking institutions. In 1991 we created Datecsa, which imports and distributes office and sound equipment of different brands, including Kyocera, Sharp, Canon, and Bose. This company has a presence in the principal cities of Colombia with a total workforce of 800 employees, and is managed by my eldest son Ernesto de Lima Bohmer. In 1992 we purchased the oldest stock brokerage firm in Colombia, Luis Soto and Cia., which later changed its name to Alianza Valores S.A., and that company has a presence in six cities in Colombia and has 200 employees. In 1996 we created the manufacturing company Colbesa in order to produce Gatorade isotonic beverages on behalf of Quaker Oats, a company that was latter absorbed by Pepsi-Cola International. In addition, various shareholders of our group have investments in other businesses such as agriculture, cattle, and real estate, and most of them are very active in different type of civic activities.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>
