		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does education have within Intel and its operations?</strong></p>
<p>Our purpose as a company is to enrich people&rsquo;s lives through world-changing technology. By partnering and supporting the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of ICT, we are making our goal real inside Colombia. We have been able to help the programs to become more sustainable and to ensure timely delivery on their commitments. Supply has been a particular challenge over the past few years due to the pandemic, and we have been working to rebalance it up to a worldwide level. Our support for the winners of state bids has enabled them to comply with the expected delivery times. In this way, more than 0.25 million Colombians have been able to access technology over the past two years for the first time. In another segment we are active in, we work with governments to incorporate technologies such as AI into education to ensure that they develop essential 21st century skills. With this program, we have been able to work with 250 specialist academics to the benefit of the nation&rsquo;s educational community.</p>
<p><strong>How is Intel addressing supply chain shortages, and what is the strategy to fully meet demand?</strong></p>
<p>We have a few approaches under our main strategy called the IDM 2.0, the Intel Development Manufacture. We want to ensure that prevailing logistical challenges do not impact Intel and its production facilities. We have even been helping our suppliers set up assembly or production lines in order to realize timely production. And in our outward looking strategy, we aim to increase our own capacity and invest in new factories. In addition, we are working with a foundry approach as well, in which we will offer our manufacturing services to the whole industry, once we recognize the need to enhance the overall chip production capacity. Nonetheless, chips are what move the world we live nowadays. Over the past year, we announced multibillionaire investments in several countries to expand chip production potential. The digitalization of the economy is increasing demand for chips in general. Over the past few years, we have increased our production capability by around 50%.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is NTT&rsquo;s current business focus?</strong></p>
<p>The company has been in Colombia for over 15 years and has 1,400 collaborators, as part of a corporationa which is a top 10 global IT services provider with over 140.000 employees and operating in more than 50 countries. We cover the complete value chain of technology consulting: from the definition of the transformational strategy, new technologies adoption, and technology integration projects to the digitization and efficiency of back-office areas. This implies developing corporate culture projects, new strategies to approach clients, data analytics, implementation of architectures and digital platforms, among others. It is also important to build capabilities around emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, cloud or automation that our clients need to adopt. Through principles of digital transformation, NTT Data plays key role in making industries more innovative and productive.</p>
<p><strong>What does NTT&rsquo;s global experience bring to its operation in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>NTT Data serves as an expert partner that can help companies navigate transformation and avoid different pitfalls. From the moment we started to operate, in 1996, first as DMR, then Everis, and now as NTT Data; being a global company has always been an objective and that means having the capabilities to lead global transformation programs. Growth makes our model sustainable and now as NTT Data not only operate under the same brand, but also with a unique vision, sharing a corporate culture and sharing corporate values. We want to promote a more fluid collaboration among countries. This allows us to be stronger and to be able to develop global transformation programs for our clients. At the same time, we can offer our teams the opportunity to be part of the most challenging projects.</p>
<p><strong>How has the rebranding spurred NTT&rsquo;s ambitions going forward?</strong></p>
<p>The main challenge when you are in a company like NTT in which the main asset is the talent of our collaborators, is how to communicate the change of brand to the talent market without creating any confusion. At the same time, as we integrated the company, with its different operations across different the countries, it was important to retain those features that have led us to where we are now. First, our innovative and creative DNA has led us to be what we are now, and second our strong commitment to our clients. Proximity to clients; to understand their strategy, to understand what their strategic objectives are, and always with a long-term vision and building long-term relationships, based on trust. At the same time that we undertake these changes, we have to be careful not to change the company DNA.</p>
<p><strong>What is NTT&rsquo;s special approach to talent, and how is this key in offering good value and good service to clients?</strong></p>
<p>Talent is an absolutely key factor in the technology consultancy business. As talent is our main challenge, having a clear talent strategy makes the difference. In our case, we have worked hard on having our own culture, a very strong culture that has to be the same across the company&mdash;leadership based on values. Not hierarchical leadership. It is important also to have a clear career path and model. That means bringing every consultant that decides to join us the best opportunity, the tools they need to develop their full potential. The point is to find a way to break any kind of glass ceiling in terms of professional development.</p>
<p><strong>What potential do you see in Colombia as a talent hub?</strong></p>
<p>Colombia has highly qualified professionals with a very strong enterprising character. The Colombian market has started to capture the attention of foreign markets. That means a challenge for us because we compete not only with our traditional competitors but also with the start-ups, government offices, our clients, and now foreign markets. We find very challenging opportunities associated to the complex technology transformations that Colombian companies are undertaking and that we want to be part of but also we can collaborate in global project that some times are led from other geographies, involving our own local capabilities.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give an introduction to Teleperformance and the principles that guide business development for the company?</strong></p>
<p>Teleperformance specializes in providing services and solutions to the customers of our clients. We have more than 40 years of experience and lead this segment at a global level. TP is the largest company in its sector in Colombia, because we managed to seize the growth opportunities that the pandemic brought. The world is becoming more digital, and that digitization is a key factor enabling our growth. We have been qualified as a best place to work on five different occasions in Colombia. In terms of revenue, we are growing by 70% YoY on average. Many of our clients have expressed through surveys that they will recommend working with us to other businesses. As a matter of fact, most of our clients have been with us after many years. We are heavily focused on digital transformation. Moreover, we have a business line focused on B2B and B2C sales, as well as technical support, which provides services to many international companies. It is in our interest to improve our customer experience services. One of the services that has grown significantly is trust and safety, which includes services for fraud prevention, for example. We became a reference in that segment of trust and safety and we are heavily focused on that sector. We want to have a single platform to attend to all our customers&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p><strong>What is Teleperformance&rsquo;s impact in terms of job creation, and what is your approach to talent attraction?</strong></p>
<p>We offer our employees a great working environment. We offer them the best working climate that we can provide. We also offer opportunities for them to advance. We have many programs to enable our workers to progress within the company. Today, five of the vice presidents in the company in Colombia started in the company from the bottom. Among other training programs, we have a program tailor-made with Universidad de Los Andes that was developed by 100 business leaders. This program took nine months to complete, and some of the topics include soft skills. We provide job opportunities in more than 250 cities and municipalities. We have workers in places like Chigorod&oacute;, which was not possible years before as the area was heavily affected by the conflict that went on for decades in Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the industries that are the most important for Teleperformance&rsquo;s growth strategy in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>New economy is critical in that strategy. &nbsp;Within the new economy, we have a sub segment of focus such as e-commerce, fintech, and gaming. Industries like health will be influenced by strong transformation. &nbsp;There will be a huge business opportunity in healthcare by that matter. As for technology, there are other opportunities in addition to new economy. We have put a strong focus on Asia and Europe. In those continents, we are eying a potential market. We export 85% of our revenues, and most of it come from the US. However, we are starting to expand into Asia and Europe. In Europe, we have six clients, and we signed contracts with two new clients in Asia. These new clients are opening up opportunities for a huge market. It is worth mentioning that in Colombia, there are excellent English-language skills. Colombian workers are extremely professional, talented, and committed, which is why our clients are pleased to accept our services. Nowadays, more businesses know about BPO. In the finance industry, for example, there are great opportunities to grow because we possess a large array of certifications and tools that strengthen our value proposition for that industry, specifically security wise. Meanwhile, digitalization is a global trend that will continue to advance. The pandemic has increased the need to be closer to our clients, so that brings more opportunities for us in the US.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why did Fondo de Fondos decide to enter the venture capital industry? </strong></p>
<p>We have launched new initiatives in the last year, and our venture capital part has grown considerably. We are in every new &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; that has emerged, which I am pleased with. We operated in energy a little but decided to pause for obvious reasons, such as the petrol price. Following global tendencies, we launched fund for impact investing and made the first close at the end of 2021. We will make the last close this year. We will invest not only in funds that look for a market return but also in companies that want to make a social, ecological, and governance impact. They should not only comply with ESG criteria, but also value climate and social risks. They need to look actively for a positive impact.</p>
<p><strong>How attractive is Latin America as a hub for investment?</strong></p>
<p>Our interest area for investment lies in Latin America. We have a steady pipeline because there are funds in places such as Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico, which are pursuing adequate returns as well as taking care of social and environmental issues. We become signatories with some Mexican retirement funds administrators (AFOREs) for the UN for Responsible Investment program. This was another example of our progress. We have also seen opportunities to create an investment vehicle to finance Mexican SMEs with the same positive impact in social and environmental purposes.. There is significant interest from Mexican and foreign investors in technological innovation companies, and bigger funds that were never seen in Mexico before are entering the market. They are constantly looking for investment opportunities in Mexican technological companies, and this development has changed our company.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it important to promote the benefits of collaborating with investors in Latin America?</strong></p>
<p>The new initiative focuses on public investments, especially in public traded debt securities. For many years, the government used the legal reserve to finance its public debt but then stopped 45 years ago. At the time, the stock market was a huge financing source for SMEs, though this later stopped and was never brought back. If the stock markets started attending to smaller companies with short and medium-term issuances, for working capital or specific projects with a three to a six-year term, it would be an interesting financing source for these companies. These companies have had financing problems, and SMEs represent the majority of companies. Even if their productivity is lower than large companies, they attend to interesting markets and have positive impacts on generating employment. As a consequence, there should definitely be more financing sources than development and commercial banks and non-bank institutions. The investment vehicle that we will launch is a debt fund strictly related to the debt capital market.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways are you further diversifying your portfolio in 2023? </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the previously mentioned initiative, in the second semester this year, we will launch the Fund of Funds Mexico Venture III. It is a fund of funds destined to invest uniquely in venture capital funds and jointly co-invest with them. We are a comfortable co-investor for fund managers. We do not want to compete with other funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The pandemic crisis is about to end. How are you preparing for this transition?</strong></p>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to solve some problems we faced. In 2020, we was extremely worried, and we sought to start defense strategies for the companies we had invested in, rather than continuing to invest. We started working with some fund managers to arrange short time &nbsp;credit lines for companies to finance cash flow deficit derived from sales reductions. Hospitality and restaurants companies in particular were facing difficult times, and we helped with their shortage of cash flow. All this kept us from investing. In 2021, things improved for us, as we had accumulated resources, and companies showed a certain resilience. Now, for the change of administration, I expect some sectors to accelerate growth. In 2023, we expect to return to the level of investing we performed up 1Q2020. We are observing an acceleration in investments in technological innovation companies, though it is a complicated sector. However, the energy sector is an interesting area for us to invest in over time. Private equity should be reactivated, though rescuing it will require a great deal of work. It is not only about Mexico; all of Latin America&rsquo;s private equity is going through a difficult time. There is little interest from international investors, and most funds are having problems collecting capital to invest in all in Latin American countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What role does Portugal play within the European operations of Janssen?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We work for Portuguese patients to gain access to our innovations: This is our first mission. I am pleased that we have been doing so and increasing our reach within Portugal. We have been a successful company in Portugal, not just in terms of broader access for patients, but also developing our local talent and even exporting this local talent. Increasingly, we have a large group of Portuguese talent that start and develop here and are still based here. Almost 30% of our people have regional positions based in Portugal. Over the last two years, this part of our talent development was already strong, and then we experienced remote working and enlarging the scope. Janssen wants to support Portugal and its patients and aims to consolidate its growth in the country, adding value and bringing even more innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>How do you establish yourself in such a small and competitive market?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Janssen is an enabler and activator. We do not simply contribute via our scientific knowledge, but also with our broader knowledge on how to advance healthcare and healthcare systems. As in any other market, there are networks and everyone is connected, so it is important to make an impact within the operating country. We want to be partners of choice in terms of medical education, partnering with the system to advance value-based healthcare, and establishing new concepts of managing healthcare and advancing healthcare systems. We need to contribute to an evolving healthcare system in Portugal. We have the skills, competencies, and interest to enable the change. Sharing and instilling knowledge is crucial as well. We are part of a global healthcare company; therefore, we have access to the knowledge of best practices in other countries. We share best practices and positively influence the local system to make it better in the near future. Over the past few years, the dimensions and importance of healthcare to a country&rsquo;s economy has become clear. We are here in Portugal to accelerate the change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What should be done to boost the efficiency and performance of the Portuguese healthcare sector?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In pharma, innovation is at the at the heart of what we do. When we talk about innovation, we stick it in two different buckets. One is innovation in terms of therapeutic innovations such as new medicines, treatments, solutions, and increasingly personalized medicines. The challenge is that innovation is developing faster than the regulatory boundaries. The approval process was designed for the therapeutic innovations of the past decades. The time for approval of innovation in Portugal is a challenge; Portugal certainly ranks lower than the average in Europe in terms of patient access to innovation. The other part is innovation in terms of the healthcare system and its operation. Healthcare in Portugal in terms of data management is below what it should be. It needs to upgrade the health system up to the level that other areas in the public system such as finance, internal affairs, and so on that have a high level of digitalization and interoperability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What is the importance of establishing strategic partnerships with local institutions in the country?</strong></span><span class="s1">Wherever we are in the world, Janssen is committed to impact the local community. So, our priority is to partner with local academia, institutions, other companies, and decision makers. We want to not only make sure that our best knowledge is available, but also that we gain insights from them so that we also can be more efficient. Our priorities are research institutes, academia, mostly in life sciences, and hospitals&rsquo; administrations. We are a regulated industry, and the authorities are part of it; we need to have open conversations with the authorities and key decision makers, so that we can help in the necessary transformation of the country, focusing in regard to the health sector.</span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What value does the company add to the Colombian market?</strong></p>
<p>CLAUDIA FERN&Aacute;NDEZ We offer solutions to our clients through the sale and rent of machinery by offering regional technical support, the sale of spare parts and training. We have experienced technicians and the support of the brands we represent. As direct representatives of reliable and excellent quality brands, we have specific products through which we offer integral solutions to our clients. These 104 years have granted us the opportunity to know the Colombian market, the different types of clients, and their needs to provide them with the best solutions. We are authorized distributors for specific brands, and we have made sure our foreign suppliers fulfill the international standards for the machinery they supply. We have access to the best equipment for our clients and the ability to identify their situations and the right solutions.</p>
<p>CARLOS PE&Ntilde;ARANDA Right now, we are meeting multiple needs of the market. We offer services to almost every industry that needs material handling. We work in the development of solutions for manufacturing, logistics, and retail. We also see much potential in power trend solutions. And by making our battery synergy systems available to other sectors, we drive mobility across the market. Today, the competition has lead acid batteries. These are electric forklifts, but we are trying to introduce lithium technology to every aspect of the industry, which is more sustainable. This solution is especially relevant for the construction and agricultural machinery industry. Vertical farming is an important business field of the future. Currently, in Dubai, we see the first vertical farming initiatives. If we enter different automated sectors of the industry, we can add more potential to a country such as Colombia, that is already highly agricultural. If we enter these sectors in other countries and bring it to our country, we stand to bring technology to an industry locally that needs it.</p>
<p><strong>What do you focus on to be a useful partner to clients?</strong></p>
<p>CF We are most interested in providing our clients with the best services, and reliable equipment. They may need factory support, guarantees, and, most importantly the safety of their employees and mechanics. One thing that characterizes us is that our equipment provides confidence to the workers and operators. Poorly maintained machinery that does not meet quality standards can cause accidents at any time, which is a risk for both people and technicians. Our main concern is all about safe workspaces, safe work at heights, and cargo handling. This differentiates us and is what we are most interested in offering our clients. Many times, clients do not want to invest their CAPEX on products or machinery that are not related to their business. For example, Nestl&eacute; trades in food products but also needs lift trucks to move its merchandise. In this case, we offer it a fleet of lift trucks with an in-house technician for their installations. These rentals bring huge benefits to our clients, who can focus on what they are good at. Our value proposition is complete. In the event that one of the machines breaks down, we will swiftly replace it and avoid halts in production. Through our in-house technician, we gain exact knowledge regarding what types of machines are needed for our clients&rsquo; production.</p>
<p><strong>What role do tailor-made solutions have in your client relationships?</strong></p>
<p>CP Right now, we have an after-sales department implementing the Jungheinrich Connect App. This is a mobile app that will be integrated to enhance the existing Jungheinrich Colombia after-sales infrastructure. Today after-sales in the industry is done by phone or e-mail, so we are implementing this app to connect to the customer and make the routine after-sales and maintenance program easier. Emergency stops and customized processes will feature in this mobile app to allow the customer a direct connection with us 24/7. We are set to have many maintenance and orders triggered automatically via the app. We are, therefore, going to be able to respond to the customer even more quickly and efficiently than we are right now. The app is also set to give us considerable relevant data on customer schedules. We will, therefore, have a tool that gives us a first contact with the customers and live data on any difficulties trucks might encounter. We will also be in a position to effect preventive solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Vertisub an expert in risk management?</strong></p>
<p>Vertisub contributes with its more than 30 years of experience in the sector. The solutions we provide, as our slogan says, are &ldquo;Unique solutions to complex problems in risk environments.&rdquo; All industries are exposed to risks; manufacturing companies engineering companies, cement companies, refineries, and oil companies. Our core clientele includes steel, mining, construction, horizontal property, wind energy construction, hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants, iron and steel refineries, glass factories, mass consumption production plants, food plants, industrial parks, and locative maintenance. For all risk profiles, Vertisub provides simple solutions for each type of work. Furthermore, Vertisub creates an impact in that we not only solve the problem our clients have, but also train their people to do work in high-risk environments. We boast an important achievement: zero fatal accidents. Additionally, we hold all the strictest international certifications and have already reached more than 5,000 clients and are present in 17 countries. This is a great endorsement to Colombian companies, which can trust and work with us. We ensure that their projects run smoothly and without problems. We ensure projects meet all safety and security conditions, and guarantee an optimal execution of the work.</p>
<p><strong>What is the role of consulting within your services?</strong></p>
<p>We design fall protection programs and are indispensable partners in the design of work-at-heights. We start from consulting and planning to providing the optimum service. Companies tell us, for example, that they need to dismantle a platform, so we show them the program, we explain it to them, we advise them, and accompany them. This is high-risk work that causes anxiety, but we are specialists, and deliver the right solutions.</p>
<p><strong>What makes experience a seal of guarantee for Vertisub&rsquo;s partners?</strong></p>
<p>We provide viable solutions based on real experiences and experiences in the field. We are not saying we will do it because we believe it is so but because we have done it. That experience carries a lot of weight, and we most likely have already had a similar experience with a similar client in another country, or perhaps even in Colombia, and can, therefore, offer a proven solution.</p>
<p><strong>What role does Vertisub have in helping Colombian industry meet sustainability and health and safety standards and access global best standards? </strong></p>
<p>We hold ISO 9001, ISO 14001, did 45001, ISO 26000 certifications. Based on that, everything we do involves people, companies and the surrounding environment. The repair of a wind turbine blade means working with a company engaged in clean energy and so through repairs, dismantling of assemblies, inspections, repairs we are contributing to environmental issues. We contribute to making the industry in Colombia safer, more viable, and feasible in many cases and, therefore, expand the country&rsquo;s productive potential.</p>
<p><strong>What potential do you see in Colombia in terms of business development?</strong></p>
<p>We intend to work more extensively in the Eolic sector, now that Enel is set to open a new wind turbine park in La Guajira called Windpechi. Regarding such matters as renewable, clean energies, we are going to support such initiatives with cement, steel and oil companies. Eighty percent of our income derives from high-risk industry, and 20% comes from training people from these companies to do high-risk jobs.</p>
<p><strong>How do you approach innovation and how are you constantly updating yourself to bring Colombia the best practices?</strong></p>
<p>We are venturing into technology, having developed a platform called IVI, where people can receive virtual training from anywhere in the world. We have a practical topic that is a training track with a structure where people are tested on their grasp of the theoretical part. The practical part is essential, and they must know how to put on safety harnesses, hang on, ascend, descend. These skills are internationally relevant. We also work with drones and robots for confined spaces. We often cannot risk or enter because there is no capacity to put someone in a confined space, or else we make use of helicopters for heavy work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Grupo Alsea stand out as a leader in the restaurant sector, in Colombia and worldwide?</strong></p>
<p>Alsea has existed for 32 years, having been created in Mexico with the undertaking of two brothers. Currently we have over 4,000 outlets. What makes us successful in our segment is our drive and orientation towards the consumer: we are always looking for disruptive solutions to cater to their needs. Adaptability is also key. Whenever we enter a country, we become part of the landscape. Our brands adopt country-specific characteristics that ensure they are well received, a concrete example being Starbucks. Starbucks Colombia is the only branch that produces its coffee locally&mdash;our coffee is 100% Colombian. Alsea has a global spirit, but with local sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>What are the vital processes within the environmental responsibility strategy of the Alsea group, and how do they work to optimize not only the use of energy, but also the reduction of waste?</strong></p>
<p>Environmental management can be reduced to two aspects. The first being waste, and the second, energy. Regarding waste from Starbucks, for example, we use straws. For the materials with which we work, it is no longer enough for them to be recyclable, they have to be compostable. And in that sense, we are one step ahead of the industry. We are constantly looking for solutions, and each year we look at how to further reduce our use of cardboard, plastics, and oil. We already have several premises fitted with solar panels. In 2022, we hope to be able to fit 30 additional stores with solar panels. We also employ technology to reduce water consumption. As part of our corporate social responsibility, we submit an annual report showing our commitment. We have interesting software that measures the consumption of gas, water, and electricity. Today, technology allows us to see online how much we are spending on electricity, by store or by region. We are looking at how to technologize Alsea on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Alquer&iacute;a&rsquo;s business focus and development objectives?</strong></p>
<p>Alquer&iacute;a is a leading company in the food sector in Colombia, with 63 years in the country, with a national presence and a focus on the dairy sector. True to our purpose and good founding principles, this company was founded by a doctor who used to say, &ldquo;a bottle of milk, a bottle of health.&rdquo; The founding principles are based on nurturing the future of Colombia by transforming dreams and realities. That leads us to invest heavily in the quality part, combined with a strong commitment to society and the environment, to nurture the future of Colombia. Proof of this is that last year we were certified as B corporation, validating and certifying some of the practices we have been applying over the last decades, in line with our purpose and founding values.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give us an introduction to Alquer&iacute;a&rsquo;s Farmer Training program?</strong></p>
<p>Agriculture has huge opportunities in Colombia, though one of the problems today is the low level of dairy productivity, which means the business is not the most efficient or the most attractive for farmers. Two, due to different factors, including an issue of lack of infrastructure and opportunities and the issue of violence that the country experienced for many years, many of the ranchers and farmers are over 60 years old on average. Most of them and their children have migrated to cities looking for opportunities, and we must not only give them opportunities in the short term, but also in the medium term to ensure better productivity and so that they can see themselves as entrepreneurs. When we change this mentality, they will start to see themselves as rural entrepreneurs and say, &ldquo;I have a company, and I can cover the market.&rdquo; Part of that is Heirs of Tradition. Heirs of Tradition provides education to the children of many of these ranchers and helps them see it as a real business with better productivity and management of the entire business. Heirs of Tradition is an 18-month program that is done together with the National Apprenticeship Service (Sena). One year is theoretical, and the last six months are practical and what they emerge from this with a degree. We are giving them the tools to have a livelihood for life and excel.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the role of the company within the construction and infrastructure industry in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>MARCELA MEJ&Iacute;A SIDOC has 35 years of history. There are five steel factories in Colombia, one of them, Paz del R&iacute;o, considered a comprehensive factory. This means its work starts from the iron ore. We produce the steel that Colombia uses in infrastructure and construction of housing and buildings. In general terms, the steel factories are today capable of covering the demand of the national steel market. SIDOC currently produces around 20% of the concrete steel that Colombia needs, and our operations are located in the southwest region of Colombia. The vision of SIDOC is to be the leader in solutions for construction for the southwest regions, and not just in steel production.</p>
<p>FELIPE GONZ&Aacute;LEZ The main focus of our company is to provide opportunity to markets, enhance people&rsquo;s lives, and improve the future of our society. In that case, we need to be focused on products that are in line with global and national sustainability efforts. We not only want to create new products, but also improve on the current products in the market right and be aggressive with technical solutions. As a leader, we are expected to be ahead on helping customers resolve their needs. Current needs are closely related to sustainability problems. We are the first company to have a self-declared environmental declaration; no other company in Colombia does that with their products. We are also the only ones with an extremely comprehensive warranty program on our products. We are implementing a new approach in our relationships with our customers and partners, such as architects and civil engineering companies that develop and build projects in Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>How does Sidoc prioritize innovation?</strong></p>
<p>MM When you compete in the big leagues with big producers of Latin America, you need to be competitive and work on aspects such as continuous innovation and competitiveness. We have been doing this for several years with excellent results, relying on efforts such as benchmarking and leading manufacturing practices that ensure we can keep increasing productivity continuously. We are also implementing a mini-company solution. All these are part of internal developments within Sidoc. We have also been working heavily on digital strategy, especially aimed at guaranteeing our service. When you are responsible for the production of a commodity, you must build unique and differentiated positions in the market. This is what SIDOC has done over the last 35 years, and this has set us apart. If we look at the economic results of the five steel factories in Colombia, Sidoc has had the best results of the sector in the last 10 years. Steel factories are the second-largest consumers of electric energy in the country after Cerro Matoso. In the case of Sidoc, being semi-comprehensive, all our steel is produced in electric furnaces, making us the largest energy consumers in the southwest. We consume over 15 million kW per month. We have made important investments in CAPEX to guarantee environmental and productivity aspects.</p>
<p><strong>How does Acesco optimize production, and what is the importance of forming strategic alliances within that objective?</strong></p>
<p>FG In the industrial area where we are located, in the beginning we were the first ones to move them, and we have since built a cluster around us. Most of the companies in industrial park where we are based are steel companies, competitors, and some of our customers. In addition, in recent times, there is another manufacturing operation with a talent pool near us. There are many advantages and synergies for development. Mainly, they are in the logistics area because we are located in a &nbsp;cluster. All the logistics services that we need are extremely heavy, and having many similar companies based here makes it easy for trucking companies. There are also many technical services that we share between companies, like safety services, electricity, and maintenance services. All these synergies are reflected back as better service to our customers.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The arrival in Colombia of international companies that are leaders in their markets is a fundamental piece in understanding the increase in competitiveness in the country. In two decades, its economy has undergone a profound transformation thanks in part to the arrival of multinationals that have produced a spillover effect by transferring best practices and international knowledge to local entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Colombia is the Latin American country that has experienced the largest percentage increase in net foreign direct investment inflows between 2009 and 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. In that period, foreign investment has gone from USD1.51 billion to USD13.99 billion, an increase of 826%, higher than Brazil's 143% or Mexico's 111% in those 20 years, according to World Bank data. The result of these inflows is an increase in the economic openness and productive capacity of Colombian industry.</p>
<p>In the last four years, different regions of the country have received important investments to strengthen their industrial muscle, such as the USD158 million invested by PepsiCo to expand its production capacity in the departments of Antioquia and Cundinamarca, or the USD100 million to be invested by the Chinese pharmaceutical laboratory Sinovac to install a vaccine production plant in Bogot&aacute;. These types of projects filter into the industry by requiring local suppliers to produce products that meet the highest international quality standards.</p>
<p>In this way, Colombia has managed to raise its production standards above those of its regional competitors. &nbsp;Factories such as the General Motors subsidiary, GM Colmotores, created in 1956, have allowed the progressive emergence of local auto manufacturers that must produce parts for one of the largest companies in the world. This type of investment has caused SMEs in the sector to compete at the highest level. And nothing indicates that this situation will change, since GM has announced in 2022 an investment of USD50 million for the modernization of this light vehicle production plant.</p>
<p>In many cases the relationships established between SMEs and multinationals are long term, as evidenced by a study by the Business School of the Universidad del Norte that analyzes the impact that foreign companies have had on local businesses in Barranquilla. Through a survey with local entrepreneurs, respondents considered that the arrival of multinationals has been very positive for the region because, among other things, the establishment of strategic business relationships with them allows access to technology that helps develop the competitiveness of their SMEs.</p>
<p>One example is flat steel producer Acesco, a company that over the past 52 years has made significant investments in technology to stay at the highest level. With the intention of further expanding its business, the company has announced a USD20 million investment to catch up with global and national sustainability efforts. &ldquo;We not only want to create new products, but also improve on the current products in the market right and be aggressive with technical solutions. Current needs are closely related to sustainability problems,&rdquo; Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez, president of Acesco, said in an interview with this publication about the reasons for this investment.<br />Construction materials manufacturer Corona is another example of how a Colombian company, in this case more than 140 years old, has maintained its investments in order to compete in the global market. &ldquo;What has made Corona successful is the combination of these elements. The element of long-term values, the work force and culture, and the international partnerships,&rdquo; said Roberto Junguito, president of the Corona Organization in an interview with TBY. In the case of this company, it was not until 2004 that it began its international growth, explains Junguito. It was then that the company decided to take its most popular products, kitchens and bathrooms, and explored building production plants in the US, Central America, and Mexico. &ldquo;We knew we had a functioning business model and began to grow in these countries, to the extent that Corona is rated as the 5th most known / most sold product worldwide. There are few companies that start up in a country like ours and attain a global presence&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>Another success story is that of the manufacturer of architectural glass and aluminum products Tecnoglass, whose shares have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since May of this year. This company, which is the first Colombian company to be directly listed on the world's most important stock exchange, has announced this year a USD50 million investment to automate its manufacturing processes and increase its production. &nbsp;<br />This company from Barranquilla, founded in 1994, exports its products to more than 25 countries, an example that demonstrates how the arrival of multinational companies can be an important factor for the growth of local Colombian companies into relevant international players.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the special bond between Diageo and Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>PAULA REY Diageo has been in Colombia since 1995. There are four main themes in which we impact the industry and the country itself. First, we are driven to be the world&rsquo;s best brand builder, leading the way in premium drinks, bringing people together every day to celebrate life. We have evolved our business every day, and now consumers can find a complete portfolio for all occasions. Second, at the core of our approach is a commitment to positive drinking through promoting moderation and addressing the harmful use of alcohol: doing so is good for consumers and good for business: consumers should drink better and not more. Third is about working hard at the industry level to level the playing field so that we can all have more equal conditions to play. Our fourth aim is to positively impact our society and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Pernod Ricard owns over 240 brands and has more than 1,800 collaborators worldwide. What characteristics contribute to the company's international success and recognition?</strong></p>
<p>OLIVIER FAGES The characteristics of Pernod Ricard may be summed up in the term convivialit&eacute;, and this is truly the reality of the group. It comes from Paul Ricard, a founder of Pernod Ricard, whose brand motto was &ldquo;Make a friend every day.&rdquo; It is about making friends and discovering people and creating connections. We are in the spirit business. This is the strength of Pernod Ricard. Of course, with liquors, we have large competitors with big brands, too. But what makes Pernod Ricard different is our focus on lifestyle. It is about the way we work. It is about being professional, but without taking things too seriously. We are serious when we work but not arrogant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is Diageo&rsquo;s economic and social impact in the country?</strong></p>
<p>PR We have consistently invested in this country since, almost three decades ago. We have also invested in our brands and made them stronger and more culturally relevant. That means -in economic terms- that consumers demand has increased, and they look for them in those small entrepreneurships. We create demand by focusing on consumers and what they want, satisfying their needs better than anyone else, and investing consistently in driving that brand strength such that demand rises, our allies sell and profit much more. Again, we always keep in mind the responsible drinking part. It is not about selling more but rather about supporting our partners to sell better and profit more.</p>
<p><strong>How do you employ innovation to stay at the forefront of the industry?</strong></p>
<p>OF Innovation is key for business. Because we are consumer-centric, over the past two years we have greatly increased our use of the e-commerce channel. It is one of the three axes of innovation. It is about interrelation, the way you sell, experience, and new products, and over the past few years, we have launched many products. We launched the new Chivas Extra, a 13-year-old product, which is a different customer proposition. Usually, whiskeys are 12 or 18-years-old. We came in with a 13-year-old with a different finish to provide new experiences to the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the company&rsquo;s commitment to Colombia going forward?</strong></p>
<p>PR We believe in the huge possibilities that Colombia has to offer for this industry, and we are committed to continue investing in it. We partnered with Licorera de Caldas to locally produce Smirnoff X1 Lulo. We are proud to show our leadership in the vodka category with this groundbreaking innovation to continue to celebrate diversity and the idea that we all fit in this world. We made an important investment to elevate quality and facilities capabilities, and it is a win-win partnership with Colombian industry. We plan to stay here for a long time and continue with such initiatives. We will continue to invest in our brands, the country, society, and the environment.</p>
<p>OF The Colombian and Andean market have grown quickly over the past few years and there is real potential for a further acceleration of our business in Colombia and the region. It looks like the market is opening to the world. The liquor business, for many years, has been dominated by local products, like Aguardiente and Ron. Imported products, such as whiskey, are under a lot of fiscal pressure. The fact that Colombia integrated with the OECD has helped the economy open to the world. Society is also developing international preferences and a growing appetite for foreign liquor. The fastest growing liquor today in Colombia is tequila.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Coca-Cola working on in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working on three pillars in recent months as we pursue our overall agenda. The first is the economic recovery, in which we work closely with small and medium-sized retailers, carrying out plans to help them adapt to the new normal. The second pillar is sustainability. We have been working on this agenda diligently to reach the targets we set in 2018 for our sustainability strategy: World Without Waste. In Colombia, six out of 10 bottles we place in the market are recycled. Our bottles are 96% recyclable and are in 40% made from recycled material. We are proud of our work in that regard. The third pillar is product innovation, involving new products and entering new categories. Colombia is the fifth market in the world for Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, a new category in alcoholic beverages. We have also launched a new formula for Coca-Cola that is closer to the original taste, but with zero sugar.</p>
<p><strong>What programs outline Coca-Cola&rsquo;s commitment to adaptability?</strong></p>
<p>The world has changed over the past 18 months. We have been working closely with our retailers and the entire service chain. This is mainly due to the fact that there are distinct new trends, for example, takeout and delivery. It has been booming over the past few years, and moreover it has been a digital boom. It is totally different from three years ago. We have been working closely with digital partners to develop tools that adapt to the new standards in the value chain. For example, we are accepting more direct store orders digitally to facilitate the speed of transactions. We updated our offer to digital and are promoting more digitally as well. One great example of that is Wabi, a platform where you can order your favorite products with a direct delivery from your neighborhood warehouse. We are watching this adapt to the new situation and we note that the interaction is increasing. Another example is our B2C platform, Coca-Cola en tu Hogar, where you can order any Coca-Cola product to your home for delivery. This transformation has been key. Another important enabler for this transformation that we are seeing on the retail side is that we are moving toward a new network organization that combines the strategy Coca-Cola has with its knowledge of different markets. We are combining several units into one, in our case, now we work as a Latam operating unit, which is allowing us to be more agile and accelerate our transformation into being more digital, and quickly adapt global strategies to local operations.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you want to see Coca-Cola in the medium and long term in the country?</strong></p>
<p>Colombia is a key market for Coca-Cola, and not only because of its size. It does have 40% of the GDP of this region and the third-largest population in Latin America, but it is the resilience and the way our people behave that encourages the company. There is a can-do attitude here, and for us as Coca-Cola, that makes it key. Coca-Cola will also be important for Colombia. When I think of the coming years, I am envisioning much of the same: still moving forward, understanding our consumers, and designing products that offer a wide range of choices. Meanwhile, it is important to advance our sustainability agenda and look for new ways to make it happen. We also want to work in product and packaging innovation and launch products of benefits, be it low sugar or no sugar at all. We want to support communities and increase gender equality. Our agenda is about consistency in that regard, but we also need to strategize on how to advance and think differently. Fortunately, we have an amazing team working on that, which makes us all the more confident in the future in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Qatar Computer Services was established in 1978 and has been both a witness and a contributor to Qatar&rsquo;s ITC sector growth. What have been some of the most important highlights of the company in this journey? </strong></p>
<p>QCS has been diligently supporting Qatar&rsquo;s IT infrastructure development curve in all aspects for the last 45 years. Year on year, QCS has been strategizing to expand the technology arm in line to the country&rsquo;s digitalization movement. Regular market studies, customer feedback, and upcoming business digitalization have driven us to step into the cybersecurity zone to boost our offerings. In this journey, we secure legitimate attacks, threats, and suspicious activities across various industries and sectors such as healthcare, oil and gas, telecoms, and so on. We have successfully built our security intelligence center to enhance our managed security services portfolio to strengthen multiple customers&rsquo; businesses by securing them with the help of niche technologies and skilled resources. As per trends and statistics, high-scale industries that have a significant contribution to the country are the targets of hackers. They know industrial controls are easy to compromise due to various reasons. To secure such mega infrastructure, QCS has collaborated with one of the pioneer OT technology service providers to secure its legacy infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>QCS represents in Qatar a solid network of global technology providers. How have you introduced new technology while providing in-country training and maintenance needs to clients?</strong></p>
<p>Our major objective is to support various enterprises to overcome their skills and technology gaps. We have our own small research team that always does rigorous understanding and testing of various technologies map to various business aspects as well. We announce those new technologies through various platforms such as one-to-one communication, constantly broadcasting those technologies through digital media. In parallel, we have aligned with various technology partners who provide various awareness training programs for various enterprises to enable technology awareness. These awareness training programs not only educate employees but also enable them to use the same in their business needs. As an ICV certified company, QCS develops local expertise and acquires global talent to serve local industries.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 has accelerated the path toward digitalization. How can companies keep up with technological trends?</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 did encourage customers to accelerate the utilization of cutting-edge technologies like remote work environment, virtual meetings, online collaborations, and work environment security. This resulted in a boom in the technology business, though at the same time, this brings many gaps and risks to the business environment. One major reason is that a change in working style requires heavy investment in infrastructure along with process amendment to ensure a seamless operation. At the cost of risk, QCS allies with various cloud services providers to fill such gaps and risks.</p>
<p><strong>Qatar is at the forefront of technological implementation in many areas such as e-government, education, and logistics. What is your assessment of the local IT landscape?</strong></p>
<p>Qatar will host the FIFA World Cup 2022, and to ensure its success, it has transformed the country with latest world-class facilities running through the latest trend technologies powered by AI and machine learning. Our assessment in technology is not enough; Qatar realizes that skilled resources is a major key gap, without which it cannot achieve its goal. Moving forward, there will be a new wave of managed services business that will encourage greater collaboration and integrate the various industries to achieve the country&rsquo;s goal i.e., Digital Qatar.</p>
<p><strong>What are QCS&rsquo; priorities for the remainder of 2022 and 2023?</strong></p>
<p>Our priorities are to establish a robust cybersecurity team to support and secure our enterprise customers&rsquo; businesses in every aspect. Moving forward, our priority is to open a new cybersecurity fusion center where we will be able to showcase collaboration and integration of various cybersecurity solutions to level up security visibility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Over 140 years old, how has the company-maintained market relevance through changing market conditions?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most interesting company traits of Organizaci&oacute;n Corona is that the company has maintained the same shareholders through its 140 years&mdash;like-minded individuals that understand the importance of catering to consumer preferences. There are two key factors of value: the long-term vision of our shareholders and a commitment to innovation through proactive management. The organization started as a small tableware business and then diversified into ceramic sanitaryware and floors and wall tiles. Later, the company adopted a strong presence in the retail business in order to be closer to the customer, becoming a key player in the segment of home remodeling. Finally, Corona has made pursuing joint business opportunities with international partners an important part of its strategy to complement its know-how with that of its business partners in order to strengthen the company&rsquo;s competitiveness. What has made Corona successful is the combination of these elements: values, long-term vision, our corporate culture, strategic partnerships, and employees who believe in our company&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The company has the unique characteristic of being engaged in different sectors such as both retail and industry. What is the strategy to sustain presence within different sectors?</strong></p>
<p>The central purpose of Corona is to improve lives by transforming spaces. We have entered a variety of businesses that support this purpose. Our core business revolves around home and construction improvement and having an ample presence across the value chain ensures efficiency. At the moment, within the construction component of the business we are involved in cement, sanitaryware products, construction finishes such as tiles and paints, and a wide range of value-added industrial minerals for different industries. The intention is to continue expanding our value proposition, for example by being a key partner in Ikea&rsquo;s market entry in Colombia. These types of partnerships contribute to further raising standards across the entire value chain because our goal is to deliver quality products and excellent shopping experiences both online and in retail stores. We are partnered with Cementos Molins from Spain in order to combine its expertise in the cement business with Corona&rsquo;s robust distribution experience in Colombia. We also have partnerships with Falabella, a Chile-based group, in Homecenter. All these specialized partners share our core values and complement our industry and retail know-how with their sector-specific experience so that we can continue to grow, create jobs and deliver value to customers in different markets.</p>
<p><strong>How does Corona approach sustainability, and what is the importance for the group of having an impact on social development?</strong></p>
<p>When a company and its shareholders and strategic partners have a solid structure of values, shared long-term vision, and a firm commitment to creating value in social, environmental and financial terms it brings about a different and very special energy to the company. Our central purpose is to improve peoples&rsquo; lives by transforming spaces. In this sense, the DNA of the organization prioritizes sustainability and has been a key priority for more than 140 years even before the concept of sustainability existed. At the annual meetings of shareholders, we dedicate as much time to discussing the company&rsquo;s investments and operations as we do to discussing social and environmental projects. Several NGOs and think tanks in Colombia have been founded or supported by Organizaci&oacute;n Corona or our shareholders in line with our longstanding commitment to generating positive impacts well beyond the direct operations of our companies. It is important to factor social issues into business practices, and we are innovators in this, notably in terms of how we look after our employees and how we work hand in hand with the communities where we operate. Additionally, almost all of Corona&rsquo;s manufacturing plants in Colombia are ISO 14001 certified for their environmental management systems, and in 2021 Homecenter-Constructor became the first retail chain in Latin America to achieve the ISO 14001 certification in 100% of its stores.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the tenets that guide Primax&rsquo;s evolution in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to continue having sustained profitable growth during the next five years with investments between USD40 and 50 million per year. Our first goal is to focus on profitable business opportunities. Second, we must continue having internal financial discipline to responsibly handle our resources and processes, together with the governance dynamics that a strong and solid structure entails. Third, we want to continue developing a fresh, attractive, and evergreen value proposition to attract new and keep existing retail and industry customers and end consumers. Our value proposition encompasses various angles. One of them focuses on innovating in developing premium products and increasing our brand presence around the country. In the end, this should provide more possibilities to retail, B2B, and fleet customers throughout the entire Colombian territory. We also want to keep progressing with the implementation of new technologies across our network to enable maximizing our dealers&rsquo; profitability in their sites. Another key pillar is operational excellence. Finally, we focus on developing our human talent, as they are the engine that drives everything we do.</p>
<p><strong>Could you tell us more about Primax&rsquo;s impact at on economic and social level, regarding the development of Colombian regions?</strong></p>
<p>We provide employment opportunities through our 11 terminals across the country. They are development hubs in the municipalities and regions where they are located. Our dealers, with a network of around 850 sites, also generate around 15,000 direct jobs. In Primax&rsquo;s case, this year we have focused our efforts on supporting the Red Cross through fuel donations to enable the mobilization of health workers around the country. We also supported the Parque Biotematico Megua in the Atl&aacute;ntico department through funds to protect and care for an amazing array of tropical flora and fauna species during the pandemic. From an environmental point of view, we worked closely with the Colombian Institute of Technical Regulations (ICONTEC) to obtain the sustainability seal in the development category, as well as the certification as a carbon-neutral company. Finally, we are the only wholesaler in Colombia to sign with the Ministry of Environment a document to actively help the country meet its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, and enabling to be carbon neutral by 2050.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Alcanos help to guarantee safe energy for citizens, and what are its ambitions going forward?</strong></p>
<p>In the gas distribution chain, Alcanos has been the leader in achieving the connection of remote users. We are strong in the southern regions of the country where the transport of natural gas cannot occur. The development is strongly focused on attending to these populations with guaranteed service. First, we sign a supply contract, which allows reliability and continuity. This guarantees the service. Second, the diversification of methods. We have impacted the majority of the population through the national gas transport system. We have been leaders and pioneers in the development of virtual gas pipelines. We transport gas and connect these populations to natural gas. We have strong logistics and have specialized in transporting gas to zones that are not connected. This allows the company to continue to grow and bring coverage to these zones. A distributor from one principal city or a highly populated area will look positively on making this type of investment. It brings quality of life to zones that are difficult to access and costly.</p>
<p><strong>What social impact campaigns does Alcanos have, and what efforts did you make to maintain competitive prices, especially during the pandemic? </strong></p>
<p>Alcanos has a strong social mission, especially in the ambition to bring energy resources to remote populations. From an objective point of view, having Alcanos in remote zones has been fundamental. We connected populations that would hardly connect by offering them viable economic conditions. The competitive rate of the energy sector is marked by a regulation that makes everyone in the market compete and consume. If Alcanos did not have the option to make this transfer, we would reach them with non-competitive conditions. The strategy is to continue this expansion and have a competitive pricing framework compared to other fuels. It will not be the cheapest, but the rate can compete with other fuel solution offers that attend to this demand. We are heavily focused on this.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Cenit&rsquo;s role in Colombian oil midstream, and what is the importance of reliability in your relationships with partners and clients?</strong></p>
<p>Our hydrocarbons transportation activity is carried out through an organization that operates both directly and through a majority shareholding in subsidiary offices such as Ocensa, Oleoducto de Colombia (Colombia&rsquo;s oil pipeline), Oleoducto de Los Llanos Orientales (Los Llanos Orientales oil pipeline), and Oleoducto Bicentenerio (the Bicentennial oil pipeline). Cenit transports 100% of the refined fuels to distribution centers. It leads the midstream segment, and we complement the value chain of the business group by transporting hydrocarbons from production centers to refinery centers or export points. We are the segment that connects production to markets. In terms of reliability, we develop a value proposition for our clients through which we transport products with the highest efficiency, at the right price, and with the quality and opportunity required by each of our clients.</p>
<p><strong>The company recently announced an investment of USD382 million. What role does Cenit play in the infrastructure development of Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>Cenit has an investment plan drawn up until 2040 that was developed in parallel to the plans of the business group. We have certain investment niches aimed at increasing reliability and risk management in the oil and refined products&rsquo; transportation activities. The second element has to do with the expansion of the infrastructure. Our goal is to expand the polyduct network to supply the increase in demand. We currently transport 330,000bpd, but the country will need around 400,000 by 2030. Our projects require investment of over USD1 billion, with an investment plan that might reach the USD4-billion mark by 2030. Even though we have the capacity available in terms of polyducts, our goal with producers is to connect their new exploration and production activities to the current systems. We seek to propose innovative solutions so that producers have the possibility of incorporating, in the shortest possible time, production volumes to our systems.</p>
<p><strong>What makes innovation a focus point within the business development vision of Cenit?</strong></p>
<p>We have been incorporating a digital transition in the organization, and the objective is to go from physical assets to intelligent ones. Today, we have the Integrated Operations Center (CIO), the most modern operations center in Latin America for hydrocarbons handling. Cenit built this in 2021, and it is today a reference regarding technology introduction. This center is not only in charge of overseeing the operations across the country, but also has a digital intelligence center supported through data analytics to make operations significantly more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>What policies define the sustainability project of the company?</strong></p>
<p>Cenit wants to have an impact on resources, the environment, and the climate, namely being carbon neutral. To achieve this, the first thing we did was to implement this policy within the organization through political divulgation. The second thing was to quantify our volume of emissions, the equivalent generated by our operation. The next thing was to create a program of energy efficiencies, aimed at reducing and making more efficient the energy consumption. The next step was to develop power generation through non-conventional resources. In 2021, we built the biggest solar plant in Colombia, a plant of 61MW with cutting-edge technology, such as bifacial panels. In September 2021 we started up solar plants in six of our pumping stations, reducing 513 tons of carbon per year, which is equivalent to planting more than 84,830 trees. In August 2022, we will begin the construction of another six solar plants with 23MW for our clean power generation matrix. We began two studies for wind generation in Santa Marta and Cove&ntilde;as, with a generation of 5MW each and have concluded two studies for tidal power generation in Tumaco and Cove&ntilde;as. Our objective for 2024 is to have 150MW of power generated by clean energies. Additionally, in 2021, we closed the year with the planting of 1,157,000 trees. Finally, we have also purchased carbon bonds.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Expro is a leading full cycle provider in Colombia. How was its merger with Franks International key for business development?</strong></p>
<p>The most important point in this merger was the capability to provide more integrated services. Our services in testing and well construction were complemented because Franks specializes in a different technology. Today, we have the capacity to be in exploration, production, cement, and drilling services. This is extremely beneficial to clients because Expro can meet the entire spectrum of their needs as a one-stop shop. Today, we are able to have more clients and more opportunities. We can present Expro as providing integrated services.</p>
<p><strong>Expro&rsquo;s value proposition to the market is that it helps companies increase efficiencies and their profitability. How does Expro deliver on those two missions?</strong></p>
<p>The most important factor is price. When you are able to provide all services, it is better for the client because they will see improvements in mobilization, demobilization, and random costs. This is the best solution for the clients. If a company requests a job, they know that they only have one service provider and therefore only have one mobilization and demobilization. They are saving money.</p>
<p><strong>How do you provide novel solutions to the Colombian industry?</strong></p>
<p>Since Expro is an international company that has operations in many countries, Colombia benefits, because Expro brings a great deal of cutting-edge technology and tools to the industry. Colombia is not an easy country when it comes to introducing new technology, as technology is expensive. There are many local companies here, and they are extremely price conscious. Clients also prefer to pay less. Companies like Expro and other international companies spend large sums of money on technology. With the market changing for the production of exploration, perhaps this will benefit both companies and the operator. For exploration, clients need more technology. In Colombia, there is a plan for unconventional wells, and to be in the unconventional well market, we need more technology. No company today can provide all technology for unconventional wells. We have extensive experience in terms of unconventional. For example, in Argentina and Brazil, we are working in this area. We also have a significant market in the US. In the future, depending on the elections and the president, this can be implemented here as well.</p>
<p><strong>What is Expro&rsquo;s approach to technology, and how can data optimize operations and reduce uncertainty?</strong></p>
<p>For exploration wells, the information during drilling is the main driver for data collection to enhance decision making. Second, in offshore drilling you require cutting-edge technology to make decisions at the right time. Technology helps to improve the visibility of drilling and also the results that come with it. We can provide the client with excellent tools and reliable data.</p>
<p><strong>How can Expro help companies reduce their emissions and improve their sustainability objectives?</strong></p>
<p>The entire company is focusing on green energy. We have a special team that is looking to the future at how we can help clients reach sustainability objectives through new tools, technologies, and processes. Expro can play an important part in key processes; for example, the company is an expert in mercury removal processes. We discuss everything with our clients to better understand their expectations in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Where would you like to see Expro in Colombia in the middle and long term?</strong></p>
<p>When we prepared the budget in 2021, our focus was on abandonment and development; however, the merger changed our business focus completely, enabling us to offer drilling services as well. We are trying to drill more wells and extract more oil. Our merger with Franks was optimal and came at a great time. With the change in the market toward exploration, this technology replaces what we were doing.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>What have been the latest developments for FANR this past year?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">FANR has been achieving milestones in the UAE by regulating the nuclear and radiological sectors in the UAE. One of the important projects is the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant. Unit 1 is currently in commercial operation, and Unit 2 started commercial operation in 2022. The Barakah is now halfway toward its goal of providing 25% of the UAE&rsquo;s electricity needs. We are planning to issue the operating license for Unit 3 in 2022 and are currently carrying out rigorous assessment to ensure it is ready for the commercial operation. Following the issuance of the Operating License for Unit 3, we will start reviewing the operating license for the Unit 4 of the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant. Our goal is to ensure the safe operation of the four units and protection of the community and the environment alike.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>As a regulatory organization, how do you see the future of nuclear energy?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Nuclear energy is imminent and will play an important part globally and also in the UAE. We, therefore, have to make sure as a regulatory authority that we work closely with the sectors to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy. Furthermore, there will be other types of technologies as well, and that is something FANR needs to think about as well in terms of making preparations, issuing regulations, licensing, and so on. Another thing is to make sure we have learned all the lessons from Fukushima Daiichi accident. We also need to look at transferring all this knowledge and skills currently to the new generation. FANR and the UAE are making a great effort on developing the careers and futures of young people.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>How would you characterize the role of nuclear energy in improving the UAE&rsquo;s energy diversification going forward?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">The operation of the nuclear power plant will help reduce CO2 emissions. Nuclear power can make a significant contribution to reducing the carbon footprint in the UAE, because we can turn down facilities that today produce electricity using natural gas. This is a strong point. Nuclear power also gives a stable base load; it runs 24 hours all-year round in any weather condition. There are many technologies now in development, not only nuclear energy for electricity production, but also nuclear for desalination and nuclear for hydrogen production. That is the advantage of these new technologies: they are flexible and perfect for remote or small communities as well as small industries that require a large amount of electricity. Because everything is moving into electrification, we need to increase production of clean electricity. That is why FANR is here to regulate the sectors and ensure the safe and secure uses of nuclear energy to meet the country needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Where are your priorities for the next one to three years?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">The safety of the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant is a priority. This is a concern for not only us, but everyone. Lessons have been learned from previous accidents, so we are confident though we are not complacent. We have an active inspection program all the time at Barakah. Another priority is to be able to meet all types of challenges, though this is related to security and other evolving trends. Another priority is training young Emiratis, so we can localize all the skills and knowledge as much as possible. Skills and knowledge are scarcer now, and many countries have slowed down education in the area of nuclear energy. We are certainly leading that effort in the UAE, together with other countries. Today, we are at 70% Emiratis, and there have been major developments in this area. We have an interesting transformation and capacity building effort together with many organizations, nationally and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Gran Tierra Energy&rsquo;s company profile?</strong></p>
<p>Gran Tierra Energy is a publicly listed company trading on the New York, Toronto, and London exchanges. The company has been in Colombia for 15 years, and for the last two and a half years we have also been present in Ecuador. Our corporate office is located in Calgary, Canada. We find places to invest that align with our strategy that looks at various components including: proven, under-explored, conventional hydrocarbon basins which have access to infrastructure, and a stable economic environment that has competitive fiscal terms. And then, in that particular area we select, we apply proven technology and our proven international experience. Colombia meets these various components, as does Ecuador. We also look for a way to maintain flexibility to allocate our capital whether it is for capital, growth, development, or exploration.</p>
<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of your productive assets in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>In Colombia, we have activities in three basins: the Middle Magdalena Valley basin, one of the oldest and most prolific basins in Colombia; the Putumayo basin, which shares a border with Ecuador; and the Llanos basin. In addition, we have a few, non-operated assets. We operate 97% of our production, which is mainly oil, and we use the gas that we produce to generate energy. In the Magdalena Valley, we were producing an average of approximately 15,000bpd, which is 49% higher than a year ago, and the highest quarterly average production since 4Q2019, which is important to us. These are great assets that only get better as you invest. In the Putumayo, our two main assets are 100% working interest. Not only do we operate our assets with strict capital and financial discipline, but we also employ a Beyond Compliance philosophy, which means that wherever there are significant opportunities and benefits to the environment or communities, Gran Tierra voluntarily goes beyond what is legally required to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>How does Gran Tierra Energy work with communities, and what programs does it have in favor of sustainability?</strong></p>
<p>Our Beyond Compliance policy or our ethos is really focused on activating our philosophy whenever we identify material opportunities to protect the environment, develop communities, or respect human rights. With regards to social engagement, we split them into three pairs: environmental protection and biodiversity; economic development and social engagement; and respect for human rights. In terms of social engagement, the first thing we always maintain is open and constant conversations with communities so we can build trust, transparency, and partnership. That allows us to identify the opportunities and challenges in the regions where we operate so that we can implement our philosophy. More than 40% of our social investments have been voluntary; we go over and beyond the requirements and regulations. That is why it is called beyond compliance. We have reached 214,000 beneficiaries in the last three years for our programs, and in 2020, 50% of the people who benefited were women. In terms of sustainability, we focus on our impact on the air, land, and water. With regards to air, we power our main assets through gas to power, and in the other fields, we are moving in that direction as well. We calculate our greenhouse gas emissions and report those in our sustainability report. With regards to land, because we operate in the Putumayo near the Ecuadorian rainforest, we have formed an alliance with the international NGO, Conservation International for a USD13-million, eight-year program that focuses on conservation and reforestation. We expect during the life of the project to have the project absorb approximately 8.7 million tons of CO2, an equivalent to 10 million homes of energy use per year or 215 billion passenger miles driven. We have currently planted close to 900,000 trees as a result of Gran Tierra&rsquo;s environmental projects.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of Parex Resources and its impact on Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We are the second-largest producer of petroleum in Colombia, at more than 50,000 barrels of oil a day. We have a track record of investing heavily in development, appraisal and exploration year after year. For example, in 2022 we will be investing more than USD500 million, which will represent our record capital spending program.</p>
<p><strong>How is Parex representative of business confidence in the country, and why is the company betting so heavily in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>There are many things in Colombia that support our investment rationale for the short-and long-term. We have been in the country for 12 years now, and we are proud of our achievement of more than 50,000bpd in that period. Colombia offers a unique combination of advantages. Regulation is quite clear, and E&amp;P contracts with the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) are straightforward, which we appreciate them. Colombian institutions are strong and relationships with ministries and public authorities are transparent. There has been strong support for the industry over the past 20 years. Meanwhile, there is also a technical component to our business in Colombia, which boasts rich reserves of natural resources with many opportunities still to be identified and developed. The country has many productive basins. We mainly have a presence in the Oriental Plains Basin, and the basins along the Magdalena River. The strongest asset that we have&mdash;other than the blocks&mdash;is the persistence and talent of our people. We have been able to develop projects in areas that are not easy to operate in thanks to our social approach and technical expertise. The commitment to the country is also evident by Parex applying for and being granted 18 new contracts during the 2021 bid round.</p>
<p><strong>What projects of community interest does the company lead?</strong></p>
<p>Colombia has high precipitation rates and yet access to fresh water is a challenge, especially in many areas where we operate. One of our commitments is to improve the quality of living for people surrounding us&mdash;people close to our operation. Parex, through its ESG program, has improved access to quality water for more than 60,000 people (through Social Voluntary Investment and Work for Taxes programs). What we have done&mdash;and are proud to say&mdash;is that in some projects, we have provided a barrel of fresh water before we even produced a barrel of oil. We do that as part of our access strategy for people to get to know us, not just because we are going to do seismic study or drill a well, but because we can have a positive impact in the areas we operate. On top of that, local manpower and goods and services are ultimately what allows us to continue operating in different areas. All our projects have a high social component. We firmly believe that the growth of the company can also represent progress for the regions where we operate.</p>
<p><strong>What is the company&rsquo;s approach to energy efficiency and environmental sustainability?</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to providing energy to the world as cleanly as possible by setting clear emissions goals and including renewable sources in our energy matrix. Evidence of that, is that the company reduced its emissions intensity by 14% in 2021 vs. 2020. During 2021, we also made public our commitments to reduce our flares and emissions. Parex&rsquo; emission reduction strategy, focuses on optimizing carbon footprint, displacing carbon intensive power sources, and increasing power generation from renewable sources. We were the first in the country and Latin America to kick-off a geothermal power generation pilot project during 2021. In this project, we take advantage of the heat in the water that we produce naturally with the oil and we use it to produce energy. In 2022, we also started our first solar farm of close to 4MW&nbsp;<br />capacity.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Campetrol support the hydrocarbons industry, and how do you provide strength for the companies of the sector in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>The chamber is focused on five main aspects: building a better country; strengthening the hydrocarbons sector; acting with social and environmental responsibility; promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion; and promoting a sustainable development. We want to continue to feel proud of being part of this sector, as it contributes significantly to the country&rsquo;s economy. For the past 10 years, the sector has been responsible for 45% of the country&rsquo;s exports, 10% of GDP, and 28% of FDI. The sector makes up part of everyone&rsquo;s lives, well-being, getting our food on time, the health system working with the adequate quality, communications, and so on. Therefore, we are extremely proud of helping to build a better country. We are highly convinced of the energy transition, though we acknowledge this transition must be done hand in hand with oil and gas. We are proud that Ecopetrol and ExxonMobil have the responsibility of executing the ongoing pilot projects of comprehensive research with the best technology and of highest quality, with transparent information, so that the country can determine if it has the possibility of having these unconventional resources and if the deposits have the possibility of becoming commercial. In a short term, we are also putting our faith on Colombian offshore. In the next 12 months, we will start drilling three appraisal wells. If we have a confirmation that these new exploration frontier does have the resources, the country will have medium- and long-term resources that can generate the income it needs to maintain all its social projects. Campetrol is the communication channel between the government, the industry, and the territory, and by working as a team we are able to achieve a higher level of welfare for Colombians. This is our mission in the chamber: we want to build a new country, strengthen the hydrocarbons sector, work with inclusion and equity, mange the energy transition, and promote sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>How is Campetrol supporting the energy transition?</strong></p>
<p>Starting from 2020, the board decided to expand its statutory basis to companies working in oil, gas, and renewable energies. Through this change, we have now 140 affiliated companies. Campetrol supports all companies so that they can open a support line for goods and services focusing on renewable energies. This is a great business opportunity and a perfect way of showing support from Colombia to the new investments being made to change the energy matrix. We have outlined some 55 initiatives of our affiliates focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, grouped under three aspects (people, the environment, and planet) and have even carried out a social activity for goal number 11, where we encouraged donations that would then be used to improve housing. We handed out awards to the three best initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>How do the programs promoted by Campetrol translate into an impact for economic development for the regions and the country?</strong></p>
<p>The opportunities for the sector today are focused on different aspects. First, we must increase the recovery factor of our deposits or the deposits administered by operator companies. We have around 60 billion of original oil in place. The recovery factor in the country currently is 21%, and if we can increase that factor by just 1%, we will have 600 million barrels that could be used as reserves. The global average of recovery factor is at 34%, which means we have an interesting gap of 13 points to increase our production, based on the current deposits. The second-best option relies on unconventionals, through which we would be able to quadruple the country&rsquo;s reserves. The third aspect is offshore. With the bet of Shell that will be drilled with Ecopetrol, we would have the possibility of starting production on these projects with national purchase.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are Epiroc&rsquo;s distinguishing characteristics as a technology provider to the mining and infrastructure sectors?</strong></p>
<p>We take pride in leading the mining and infrastructure industries in becoming more intelligent, efficient, and sustainable. When our customers evaluate suppliers, they strive to improve productivity and lower the total cost of ownership while also improving sustainability performance. Our innovation leadership in areas such as automation, digitalization and electrification in combination with a strong record of accomplishment of quality and reliability is highly valued.</p>
<p><strong>What areas of the mining cycle are at the center of Epiroc&rsquo;s distribution strategy in the region?</strong></p>
<p>In the coming years, the expected increase in production of commodities such as gold, copper, platinum and nickel is expected to support the demand for Epiroc&rsquo;s products and services. The increased extraction of ore should increase demand for new equipment as well as for consumables, maintenance, refurbishment and overhaul; collectively known as the mining aftermarket. The aftermarket potential depends on total fleet of equipment in operation as well as on equipment utilizations levels. The equipment is frequently used in harsh environments, which drives the need for maintenance and replacement of parts and consumables. Higher utilizations also drive the need for maintenance and replacement of equipment to safeguard productivity. The aftermarket needs tend to be recurring and relatively stable trough the business cycle, and generally less discretionary than capital expenditure on equipment.</p>
<p><strong>What is the importance of partnerships for Epiroc and what principles guide Epiroc&rsquo;s role within the regional mining and industry ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>We collaborate with different stakeholders to accomplish our value chain purpose. In our region, we cover 13 countries, and we have to ensure a close relationship and support. In that direction, in some of these countries we have business partners that have the same service level and customer focus vision. Being a leading global supplier in our niches comes with a responsibility. Because of that, one focus area within sustainability is to live by the highest ethical standards even when it comes to our sales generation. Collaboration and commitment are keys.</p>
<p><strong>What processes and technologies is Epiroc focused on to reduce emissions and energy use?</strong></p>
<p>We are leading the charge toward sustainability in mining through battery electric, zero-emission equipment. Our electrification solutions are well proven globally and contribute to substantial reduction of CO2 emissions, leading to a smaller environmental footprint. Battery- electric vehicles improve workplace health, reduce emissions, and lower ventilation cost and as we provide the full service of battery that eliminates the risk if owning batteries, this is also about circular economy. &nbsp;We have high ambitious environmental goals to achieve until 2030 that include reduction of 50% of C02 emissions from operations, transport, and well as from customer use of Epiroc equipment.</p>
<p><strong>What impact does Epiroc have in the region through knowledge transfer and through the dissemination of global best practices?</strong></p>
<p>We collaborate with several equipment and service providers, technology companies and universities to drive further innovations in the industry. Examples of collaboration are with Ericsson for 5G technology, Orica for a semi-automated explosives delivery system, ABB for electric drive trains, Northvol for batteries and Saab Combitech. For information management systems. We are also engaged in the projects European Sustainable intelligent mining Systems, (SIMS) and sustainable underground mining (SUM). The SIMS project was a successful EU project within the research and innovation program Horizon2020 to create a long-lasting impact on the way we test and demonstrate new technology and solutions for the mining industry. SUM will be created in LKAB&rsquo;s underground mines in Kiruna and Malmberget and will also take the form of a virtual mine. Here, new technology will be developed and tested in a real mining environment to ensure that the Swedish mining industry can remain competitive and create jobs and growth, both locally in Norrbotten and nationally. This requires new control systems, new and improved mining equipment, as well as complex and efficient management systems that meet future demands for a sustainable industry.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is INSUCO&rsquo;s value proposition for the business community? </strong></p>
<p>INSUCO is a new type of consultancy being both a consultant and a think tank. We are specialized in the social components of sustainability in that to achieve a green economy and sustainability, we need to fully understand the social impacts of transition in sectors. We need to better evaluate the social impacts of diverse business projects, understand the challenges of sustainability, and create trust amongst the stakeholders. We need to rethink the way corporations and companies relate to the territories where they operate. In the region and particularly in Latin America, there is a huge gap between the level of investments of companies when arriving and the advancement of public services, education, and labor. INSUCO is here to close the gap. We make them understand that their competitiveness depends on the sustainability of their territories of operation and conduct considerable multi-stakeholder dialogue to discuss issues of sustainability. We work with private companies, local and national government, international corporations and civil society.</p>
<p><strong>What is the strategy to give matters of social consultancy a wider reach among the business community?</strong></p>
<p>About 50% of our clients come from the mining sector. Additionally, we work on projects in infrastructure, energy, hydro, tourism, and public services projects. The approach is always the same. We ask companies what type of business they intend to be: Do they want to be compliant with the regulatory framework and national obligations and conform to such a framework? They want to be more sustainable and, thus, more strategic. The social aspects have always been part of the problem and not the solution. The competitiveness and sustainability of a company depends heavily on the social sustainability of operations. We actively push for an agenda where social aspects are part and parcel of adding value to the business since it ensures fewer conflicts, better stakeholder relations, improved value chains, and better visibility for investments in territories of operation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the company&rsquo;s local focus?</strong></p>
<p>SRK is an independent, international, mining-focused consulting practice that aims to provide advice and solutions to clients worldwide. Specifically for mining projects, we offer a wide range of services from feasibility, concept, and detailed engineering, all the way to construction supervision and closure. We currently specialize in the management of mine waste and mine water, in addition of seeking to improve the local knowledge of these disciplines, and the way publics perceive such projects and technologies. We have more than 45 years of experience and around 1,500 employees in over 45 offices on six continents. Our main line of business is the provision of independent advisory; and the key word here is independent, as we have no economic assets in any of the projects we participate in. Instead, we deliver independent engineering and scientific research and services mostly to the mining industry. Our services are focused on delivering practical and experience-based understanding and expertise in pretty much all aspects of mining facilities.</p>
<p><strong>How can SRK help companies achieve their sustainability objectives?</strong></p>
<p>We approach projects not as a set of tasks, but rather see them as an opportunity to participate in something that will, undoubtedly shape a city, a state or a country for years to come. We are helping not only our clients succeed, but also the people around the project, while having our sights set on what the project will be after it ceases and we, as SRK, and also the client leaves the place or turn their attention in other opportunities. Having a local workforce affords us a sense of pride and commitment, because this is our house; and a special commitment to the project, to the people, and to the area, that we wouldn't otherwise see. And meanwhile, SRK has specialized groups in sustainability and environmental engineering, who are not only experts in local regulations, but also the state-of-the-art experts of decision-making standards in mining&rsquo;s best practices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the significance for Colombia of having a company like Muzo at the forefront of its mining industry?</strong></p>
<p>It is really simple. The world has changed. Many people will have seen the movie Blood Diamond, or at least be familiar with it. There was a situation in Africa where some undesirable and violent people were involved in black market diamond activities. People woke up to that, especially the people who buy luxury products such as these. They decided not to buy gemstones where people were being killed by organized crime, or suffering from bad mining practices. They want to make sure that if they spend thousands of dollars on gemstones that they are produced in an ethical manner, and not in a conflict zone. We took advantage of this and can certify that every one of our emeralds is ethically produced in our mine in accordance with local laws and regulations. We are able to document this, and if you buy an emerald from us, you get the full story of that emerald, literally from the time it leaves the mine to when it&rsquo;s sold to the owner.</p>
<p><strong>What social initiatives do you realize in your operations and the communities you operate in?</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of things. One of our favorite projects is the canteen for old people. In the vicinity of the mine, there are quite a few of older indigent people who have no means of support. Many of these people came to the mining zone 30 to 40 years ago hoping to get rich. They never did. And in that process, they lost contact with their families and are alone with no means of sustenance. It was obvious that we had to do something, and so we built a dining facility for them, and they have contributed by growing their own food and raising chickens. It is an interesting project. Meanwhile, we also work with local school children and through Fortuna Cacao with local cacao farmers.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How are you seeing mining operators introduce such technologies into their operations?</strong></p>
<p>In the past four to five years, there has been a lag of adoption for various reasons. There is a desire and need for these solutions to be implemented; the issue that mining companies are struggling with is how to implement the technology into existing operations and a business model. They are struggling with how to fit it into the operational flow sheet, because some of the solutions may disrupt something downstream in the process. We are currently at the stage where they are trying to figure out how to do this. Mine managers like to de-risk and see someone else be the first mover. We call that first to be second. To de-risk, we need to show the solutions in a real environment, and places like NORCAT in Sudbury, Ontario, are providing that opportunity. Also, mining companies want to make sure whatever they are procuring is being supported locally, and a country such as Colombia is no exception to this. Having boots on the ground is key to making this successful. That is why the majority of suppliers from Canada are looking for local representation. The key is to build up the capacity of skills locally to support some of these solutions A great deal can be done with technology such as using AR and VR to solve problems remotely but having a local person will be the preferred option for the foreseeable future, and that is where the opportunities for local employment lie.</p>
<p><strong>What opportunities are there in Colombia for Canadian and international mining suppliers?</strong></p>
<p>It all starts with opportunity. What we see in Colombia is a tremendous opportunity for the growth of developing the mineral resource industry in this country. It has such a large, untapped mineral endowment. We see Canadian mining companies coming here with their expertise to help develop these resources responsibly, which provides opportunities for the suppliers that will provide the needed supply chain. MSTA CANADA has always seen Colombia as an important emerging market, and we still believe it is. Hopefully, Colombia will see how resource development can be done responsibly and provide communities business opportunities as opposed to being a threat.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>During 2021, mining grew 10.4%, marking the second semester of double-digit growth. How do you evaluate the state of Colombian mining and to what do you attribute the positive performance?</strong></p>
<p>Growth is the result of a consolidation of the mining sector in Colombia. As you said, we grew by 10.4%. The mineral-specific focus is also important, where for example, in terms of gold, last year in Colombia we produced 2.5 million ounces of gold. In 2021, the figure was 1.5. million ounces&mdash;we grew by 1 million. The country is also making important strides in other minerals such as nickel and coal. Favorable market conditions and a mining ecosystem supported by the government and strong guarantees is propping up activity. Colombia ranked first in the Fraser Institute&rsquo;s mining attractiveness index in Latin America, which is positive in terms of attracting investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is government contributing to the investment attractiveness of Colombia, and what role does strong jurisdictional guarantees play within that development? </strong></p>
<p>Investment in exploration grew up to USD130 million. The government has been working hard with the private sector in coordinating exploration public policy. You cannot have exploration without private sector enterprise, without new investments in the sector. In a country of huge potential and mineral endowments, the regulatory framework must promote activity in a way that allows the development of that potential. ACM works heavily in the promotion of the sector through innovative strategies such as the mining rounds. And taking care of due diligence previous to the offering of titles goes a long way in expediting processes and making investment more attractive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What tools and strategy does the association focus on to support the development of mining in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>The public discussion in Colombia and worldwide revolves around the standards and protocols that frame mining activity. Over the past two years, ACM has focused on improving and putting in place all the Colombian sustainability standards in order to certify, and qualify the companies that are producing in the country. In order to be competitive, ACM helps companies in Colombia meet the global best practice standards that ensure that mining is carried out in a way that is harmonious with communities and the environment. Delving into the theme of sustainability; the association has a program called TSM that monitors mining operations along nine protocols. Those are the same standards that the industry follows in Canada, Australia, and Norway. It closely follows matters of water, biodiversity, climate change, health and security, mine closures, tailings facilities, and that is one of the most important steps that this sector is doing over the coming years. We are the only sector in Colombia to practice such self-regulation to improve our operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the unique role of mining within Colombia&rsquo;s economic development and how do you envision the evolution of the industry going forward?</strong></p>
<p>The mining sector in Colombia amounts to 2.0% of the GDP. With more exploration and interest from large international players, the sector is forecast to reach between 2.2% and 2.4% of GDP. That means that the mining sector is one of the most important pillars of the domestic economy. The average annual spillover by the mining sector in Colombia is between COP13 or 14 billion, for example in services or other components of the Colombian economy. Therefore, investments companies make in the region are important in supporting local economies and contributors.</p>
<p><strong>How can mining remain competitive in terms of exports in tomorrow&rsquo;s economy?</strong></p>
<p>The Paris Agreement, the climate change commitment, relies heavily on mining. For example, with increased copper demand, Colombia has a role to play in terms of strengthening output. Colombia is home to the largest untapped reservoirs of the mineral. The country, therefore, has to improve exploration efforts and invite companies to invest in local copper production.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Through what mechanisms does the ANM manage Colombia&rsquo;s mineral resources and promote investment in the country, and how do you promote potential projects to investors?</strong></p>
<p>Our main focus is to administer Colombia&rsquo;s mineral resources through its promotion, the evaluation and granting of mining titles, and supervision to ensure that all contracts and activities comply with the law and ensure sustainable mining. We receive applications for new mining titles, undergo the entire process by evaluating the legal, financial and technical aspects. We then address the respective mayors regarding the nature of the new applications and finally hold a public hearing with the communities to inform them of the potential of new projects. Finally, we decide on whether or not the mining titles are issued. In addition, we have established new and innovative promotion strategies in the form of business round tables, opening new markets internationally for different minerals and launching mining rounds in order to let potential investors and companies know which areas have a high potential in certain minerals. We then engage in consultation with the communities together with the environmental authority to establish a baseline for the environmental impact study and launch the bidding process for companies in compliance with the prerequisites. For the first time, Colombia is letting everyone know where there are areas with high potential in strategic minerals, with access to comprehensive technical information. The mining rounds not only help to maximize the exploration phase, but also include interesting aspects for local communities such as social investments for the region, as well as benefits for the country and for investors.</p>
<p><strong>How does the ANM strategically assist the government?</strong></p>
<p>The Ministry is tasked with regulating the sector, while we execute the policies and all of the procedures. We also participate with the technical information and insights in order for policies to be actual and pertaining to the needs of the sector. We also participate in the formulation of laws that are in Congress concerning the mining sector. We constantly assess the need for new policies and how to fortify existing ones.</p>
<p><strong>ANM is actively engaged in disseminating best practices among Colombian miners. What programs are targeted at formalizing the mining industry?</strong></p>
<p>These past two years we decided to work from the mining regions in Colombia. We have 11 different offices regionally. We have been taking all the vice presidents and the managers as well as the people who lead all the procedures to work from the mining territories. We invite all the local officials and generate an ecosystem in order to help out, resolve bottlenecks, and demystify the sector. We train people in security measures. We have different scenarios where we seek feedback from the mayors and mining operators. We have spoken to young people in the territories to create awareness of responsible mining in an attempt to involve them in the regulated mining sector. All of this occurs approximately every 15 days. This has contributed to efficiency and compliance with procedures.</p>
<p><strong>By 2030, you intend to become an international player in mining resources. What steps are needed to fulfill the mission?</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, we put a system in place that enables easy access to information on titles and applications, and the identification of both opportunities as well as restrictions present in Colombia. All procedures are done virtually through the system, which makes it easier for people to access information and more transparent. We also fiscalize our outgoing projects by leveraging advanced technology. We use satellite images for operational oversight, for example. We will soon implement drones for this operation. We receive information online from various companies around Colombia. We are also developing a traceability system that should become operational by the end of this year.

We hope to let investors know about these huge opportunities and that these opportunities will become realities.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main areas of opportunity for Fiserv in the Colombian financial sector?</strong></p>
<p>We face great challenges in the Colombian financial market. We are a global leader in payment processing and fintech, but there are always areas of opportunity in all the countries in which we work. As the number-one global company in the acquiring business, we aim to completely revolutionize the M&amp;E market in Colombia. The 1962 Decree related to low-value payment systems that was approved in December 2020, aims to create a digital ecosystem that reduces the use of cash. And this has allowed Fiserv to offer innovative products such as Omni-Pay, a payment processing platform that enables the acquiring entity the complete the management of its businesses. The Fiserv Gateway e-commerce platform accepts national and foreign credit and debit card transactions with high security standards and with high fraud risk mitigation. One of the great challenges is to remain at the forefront and constantly innovate to continue contributing to the digitalization of banks and businesses, while promoting the growth of online stores nationwide. We are also constantly reviewing regulatory schemes to serve as a growth base for fintechs, banks, retailers, and digitalizing unicorns to meet new needs. The democratization of the acquisition market definitely benefits financial institutions and businesses to increase payment options for their customers in person or online.</p>
<p><strong>What is the importance of Colombia within Fiserv&rsquo;s international strategy?</strong></p>
<p>In an increasingly digitized world, responding to demand for new types of financial services is no easy task. Our strategy focuses on generating technology for the growth of the financial industry while offering new payment channels. We are a strong partner to financial institutions that look to the future, and we aim to address today&rsquo;s realities. We have the privilege of working as our clients allies to achieve their goals, while providing better services to increasingly sophisticated and connected users. Specifically, the Latin American market is undergoing a strong digitization process in which Fiserv sees the opportunity to be the ally that institutions need to make a success of this moment of transformation. We seek to create enriching experiences for our clients to change the way their consumers view their money, time, and opportunities, while being active players and beneficiaries of market trends. Colombia has taken important steps in transforming its economy and its payment system. We are fortunate to be a strategic ally that responds to these needs of the financial sector, and an important player in the democratization of the acquiring market, where we offer more payment alternatives for the more assertive, efficient, and agile operation of banks, businesses, and retailers. We are also committed to the fintech industry, as a world leader in financial technology with over 35 years of experience in the market and of serving new financial clients. In Colombia, we have contributed to the transformation of the fintech ecosystem through our solutions, technology, and alliances with associations such as Colombia Fintech.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main challenges facing the Colombian financial sector as it adapts to the digital transformation and creates more efficient payment processes?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important challenges is to continue taking firm steps toward accelerating the digitalization of the Colombian economy. We work daily to enable banks, financial institutions, businesses, and retailers to offer a range of payment methods to improve the shopping experience and meet current demands. For this reason, we have incorporated FirstVision in Colombia. This is a platform for banks and medium-sized to large fintechs that provides credit, debit, promotional bank cards, loan management, and a loyalty program module with the latest technology in payment methods, including tokenization. Another big challenge is to make this migration to electronic payment methods, mobile banking, and digital apps so that debit and credit card transactions are easier. We are on our way, but there is still much to be done in the country.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Black Rock&rsquo;s contribution to the infrastructure development of the country?</strong></p>
<p>We launched our first infrastructure debt fund back in 2017. This is a fund that gathers the money mainly from institutional investors in Colombia to lend money to projects like road building&mdash;which benefits the entire country. At that point, it was an intersection between the government and institutional investors interested in having a leader in the asset management industry with experience in infrastructure to bring best fund management practices. It was a new asset class for the Colombian market. There were a couple of local players with funds in place already. The government and investors saw value in having a third manager who could bring international best practices to the industry. Today, we have that first fund, and we just closed a second one which is the largest private fund ever raised in Colombia with COP2.5 billion assets under management that translated into roughly COP640 million in commitment from investors. It is a significant milestone that demonstrates on the one hand, the interest that investors have in the asset class that is generating attractive returns with an interesting risk return relationship. Most of these projects are backed by the government, which provides guarantees for the income. More than 18 million people will see their pensions benefit from this return. This is one important thing to consider in terms of impact.</p>
<p><strong>What principles guide Black Rock in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>BlackRock continues to have impact on real economy and real people infrastructure by bringing alternatives of investment to the retail audience and allowing people to have portfolios that can help them achieve their financial goals. That is one area that can deepen impact to the local economy and the life of local people. Second, is advancing sustainability. Since 2020, BlackRock embraced sustainability in the way we manage our client&rsquo;s money and not from the values point of view. Not because we want to save the world, but from a value generation point of view because we are convinced that sustainability risk, including climate, social, and governance risk are financial risks, and we owe a fiduciary duty to take care of the assets that we manage. The world has been moving toward sustainability, and I envision BlackRock leading this transition toward a more sustainable world of investment.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Pei Asset Management innovative and a pioneer as an investment manager in Colombian Real Estate Industry?</strong></p>
<p>15 years ago, Pei Asset Management structured and introduced to the Colombian market a real estate investment vehicle that was completely different to what was available. One of the biggest premises we offer when structuring the vehicle is to serve both institutional investors and retail investors. In an important growth achievement, we have an investor base of 4,800 clients. Pei Asset Management has been exclusively dedicated to managing this vehicle; however, we also have a long-term vision of adapting ourselves to have a multiple-funds structure. We will always have our base in real estate, though our vision is to offer our investors different alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of investing in Pei?</strong></p>
<p>Investors do not have to worry about managing the real estate, and Pei Asset Management takes care of the commercialization, contracting insurances, and doing maintenance and repairs. We take care of the management and do all the work for investors&rsquo; benefit. Investing in real estate is attractive in terms of property but is generally linked to illiquidity, because there are few buyers for a large-sized real estate. On the other hand, when an investor buys securities from Pei, they have the great advantage of having physical assets that are stable and generate asset appreciation; at the same time, they are represented by securities that can be sold at any moment through the Colombian stock exchange.</p>
<p><strong>What are the unique advantages of real estate investment?</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, investing in real estate has been the preferred choice among investors not only in Colombia but also globally. It is tangible, which reassures investors, and it generates permanent cash flow, which is also an important characteristic. In addition, as it is managed professionally, investors do not have to actively manage the asset, and furthermore, because of the size of the portfolio we can diversify the risk, which is extremely important. As a single owner, if a real estate is vacant, you cannot collect rent, and there are costs to cover. When an asset invested through Pei becomes vacant, investors will still have cash flow from the investment due to its size.</p>
<p><strong>What makes Colombia an interesting jurisdiction for international investors?</strong></p>
<p>The main reason is diversification and having exposure to a high-growth country. Investors see developing markets as interesting in terms of diversifying their portfolios. Furthermore, Colombia has clear rules for investors, which makes the country attractive. Investors also value the qualities of the manager, and if there is a vehicle managed by an expert that has the knowledge and track record as the leader, that makes it interesting for investors. Currently, Pei offers a portfolio valuated in USD2 billion assets under management, and the tickets can be higher than those of pension funds. An international institutional investor has the possibility of complement their investment strategies, which also makes Colombia attractive to international investors.</p>
<p><strong>How does Pei contribute to the infrastructure development of the country?</strong></p>
<p>In these 15 years, Pei has created important partnerships with the main construction businesses in the country. At present, we can invest in assets that are in a development stage. That has allowed Pei, in partnership with construction companies, to hold new assets with best and updated characteristics in different regions with an important effect of generating jobs. One of the industries that generates most jobs in Colombia is construction. At present, we have more than 1 million leasable square meters, of which 40% are assets that have been developed. There has definitely been a positive impact in terms of generating jobs. Finally, a strategic pillar of Pei Asset Management is sustainability; more than 20% of the assets that belong to Pei&rsquo;s portfolio have environmental certificates. We have golden LEED certificates in almost all the real estates that belong to this 20%. Our goal is for a significant majority of our assets to have a LEED certificate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Insights specialize in and what is the company&rsquo;s value proposition to the market?</strong></p>
<p>Insights links Latin American investors to global capital markets and financial services. In Latin America, the best access to financial services is limited to high-net worth individuals, specifically in investments. As the emerging middle class and mass affluent population of Latin America continues to grow, this group of people do not have access to top financial services at typical and competitive costs. At Insights, we are addressing this need. Right now, our infrastructure allows people to download our app from the comfort of their homes, whether they are in Bogot&aacute;, Mexico City, or Santiago. In five minutes, they can have their own personal regulated account in the US that allows them to access investments and financial services globally. It is easier to open an account in the US with our service than it is to open a local account. Customers have access to better diversification, better products, and significantly lower costs. Advisory is not about telling people if the market is going up or down; it is about financial planning, transparency, and understanding the level of risk you should, or should not, be taking. It is extremely important to develop that understanding and financial education so as to become more knowledgeable and comfortable with your investments. Technology allows us to develop that with our clients in an efficient and scalable manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who can benefit from partnering with Insights?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone interested in investing is able to benefit from Insights. One of the advantages of having a fully digital product is that we can service at a reasonable cost any type of account. We have clients that are wealthy but do not want to be charged the high cost of private banking, clients that are young professionals that are building their savings for their future and the future of their family, and clients that are starting to learn about investments. One of the key points of our product is that you can use Insights all on your own, or you can choose to have someone to talk to and guide you. We are regulated. All of our accounts are fully regulated in the US under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are personal accounts. Each account is protected by SIPC insurance. In addition, from a regulatory point of view, we have adopted a strategy where we are involved with the local regulators to let them know what we do, what is happening, and where we see disruption taking place. Initially we are doing this in the four countries that are our main targets: Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p><strong>What is the importance of using technology to improve how clients interact with the platform?</strong></p>
<p>First, technology empowers us to open an account for someone in under five minutes with all the due processes still needed to open a financial account in the US. In addition to that, through efficient UI/UX we make it easy, simple, intuitive, for our users to set up investment portfolios, invest in real time, and understand their performance with full transparency. I have been in finance for over 25 years and one common issue is the lack of transparency from financial institutions with their investors on their performance, returns, the fees they are charged. Most people do not understand, or need help understanding, the statements they are sent by their financial institutions. This has started to change globally and we are part of a group of fintech companies driving that change in Latam. Finally, we have built technology to dynamically monitor and evaluate our clients&rsquo; investments and make sure their portfolios are optimized. We fully automate this process for our users and take away the bias from portfolio managers, which many peer-reviewed research has shown do not provide value but they do increase the cost to investors.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Avia intend to add value to the travel sector?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding travel insurance, we help our customers with anything related to assistance. In Colombia and around the globe, travels were interrupted, and travelers were heavily affected. We coordinated with insurers to come up with new products, so that travelers are not affected by problems related to COVID-19. The idea was to talk with the insurers, who come up with the products we offer to end users, and select the right products. We negotiated products and have some that are almost ready to be put in the market, offering a new coverage for our clients. In the event they are negatively affected by COVID-19, they can rest assured that their wealth will be safe. The idea is to ensure that the needs of clients are truly protected.</p>
<p><strong>Who forms the core of Avia&rsquo;s client base?</strong></p>
<p>We work with the public in general, be it corporate or individuals. As a result of our origins and our raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre, at the moment our most important coverage segment and what we seek to address is that market niche that travel agencies provide us with: travelers. This does not mean we are neglecting the corporate niche. Within our process and the companies of the group, there is a department focusing on transportation in aspects such as customs, cargo services, and so on. Avia is part of the Aviatur Group, and we also offer our services through these companies. When we enter the transportation sector, we have several clients who work in mobilizing products. We can also offer them our specialized services for this sector.</p>
<p><strong>What attributes help Avia stand out as a partner of choice?</strong></p>
<p>Experience is something that people recognize us, which is why they choose us. Second, we have a commitment to responsibility. Every client that comes to us is not only acquiring insurance but is also potentially part of a purchase chain within the organization. The idea is to provide the entire value chain to the client, so they do not need to find different operators for everything. We can comprehensively find the solutions for everything that the public might need.</p>
<p><strong>What has been your strategy to capitalize on the growth in tourism?</strong></p>
<p>We have made the most of the boom in internal tourism. The pandemic has led to greater awareness of insurance and served as a reminder that we are fragile before unexpected situations such as death or diseases. We want to raise awareness about the affordability of insurance. With a small investment, they can have peace of mind, knowing that if an unexpected situation arises, they do not need to spend their own money on medical assistance, home care, transfers, and so on. All these things have helped us significantly, and Colombians have been learning the hard way that being insured should be a compulsory part of their responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>What other products have you developed, and how does innovation fit in the company?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding health products for our clients, we have funeral services that make up part of the insurance market. We have tried to focus on individuals, as we want them to protect themselves, reminding them that even if they are in good health, they can still protect their assets and estate. We remind them to take care of their homes, their assets, or their companies. We have seen an increase in thefts in Colombia as well. These are things that you always think will happen to someone else, but in the end, we can also be exposed to these risks.</p>
<p><strong>What are the most important trends regarding product development and innovation?</strong></p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the current focus of business in Solunion, and how can partnerships help reach a wider market segment?</strong></p>
<p>JORGE ANDR&Eacute;S JIM&Eacute;NEZ We have a large project to launch concerning credit insurance solutions for SMEs. We are also working to launch two different distribution channels. So far in Colombia, distribution has been focused on the traditional channels of brokers and businesses. We are looking for different ways to perform distribution in the Colombian market, and are keen to introduce expertise, especially from Europe. We want to bring in a special line for factory companies, and are exploring niche products for specific sectors of the economy. Our shareholders in Europe have considerable expertise through close relationships with the banking sector. In Spain, the market is very much about banking and credit insurance lines, and thus channel banking has been important. We are trying to bring that experience to this market. We are looking at links between banks and liquid trading industries.</p>
<p><strong>CESCE, through Segurexpo, is a pioneer of credit insurance in Colombia. What is the strategy to maintain a market leadership in the segment of credit insurance?</strong></p>
<p>MANUEL AR&Eacute;VALO We have been doing credit insurance for more than 25 years and since then in partnership with the local government we have been offering domestic and export credit insurance and also coverage for political risk. Throughout these years we have been able to develop a deep knowledge of the market, its different economic sectors and companies from large and well known to medium and small ones which is one of our main competitive advantage besides with our offer which allows us to take more risk than our competitors thus giving more support to our insureds; this allowed in 2021 that our credit insurance business grew at a pace of 50%, twice as fast as our competitors, and our market share went to 29% from 25% in 2020. We are also working on process efficiency and improving customer experience as those are also critical factors to maintain and develop our leadership in the market.</p>
<p><strong>How does Solunion leverage new technologies and digitalization to improve its service for partners, and what are the efficiencies achieved?</strong></p>
<p>JAJ The entire industry of credit insurance is based on technologies. For us and the whole group that we work with, technology is the basis of our operations. The needs of the clients in Colombia are met on diverse platforms. Technologies play an important part in the strategy and branding of the company. We are close to the client. The technology is adapted to the local culture.</p>
<p><strong>How do you frame product innovation to reach new clients and expand access to credit insurance?</strong></p>
<p>MA Our intention is to offer simple products for small companies aiming to democratize credit insurance, a product that has common been for large and medium companies. Through targeted coverage and lower costs, we expect to form new business avenues. In other innovations, in 2021 we launched an API that facilitates the synchronization of data between our system and the ERP of clients. This cuts out mechanical data processing. If we use technology to facilitate the operations of our clients, we ensure repeat business and strengthen long-term partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Solunion is the credit insurance market leader in Colombia with over a 59% market share. What is your strategy to make sure that credit insurance reaches more beneficiaries?</strong></p>
<p>JAJ We are close to associations and all sectors, and account for 60% of the Colombian market. We are very active in promoting credit in the local market. We are active in the way we reach brokers and potential clients, and also in the way we develop new products. We constantly work to improve the service model, technology and specific product line. We still have a long way to go to create an established culture, despite having been working on this for 20 years. Thus, we still have considerable growth potential.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main ambitions and what are you focusing on to make those ambitions a reality?</strong></p>
<p>MA Our vision is to recover our market leadership position; for us, being the leader does not only mean being the largest or the biggest, but the most agile and the most supportive to our clients. To get there, we have in place a strategic plan that focus on efficiency, client orientation and the development of our main asset which is our human talent; so far, we have achieved major improvements in a couple of key processes, updated some IT tools, get closer to our clients, intermediaries and partners so we now understand better their needs and give more agile solutions.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Coface serve international trade entrepreneurs, and how is the firm&rsquo;s international network of offices an asset for them?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we have advanced over the past year is the data content of our database. This enables our clients to take better decisions quickly. In terms of credit insurance, we are working on a new product that will serve small export companies, providing access to credit insurance at reasonable cost for their new market. We are looking at their expansion in the export business, and that is how we will support company growth in the near future. Cross-border business necessitates both a private insurer and an information company. Not all exporting companies will meet the required size for credit insurance, require credit insurance, or wish to buy credit insurance. We offer a complete solution, having information as a first step and credit insurance designed specifically for SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>What is the strategy to promote insurance penetration and capture market share given rising demand for credit insurance?</strong></p>
<p>Having a policy adapted for SMEs is our first strategic lever in terms of supporting international trade. It is one of the market growth ideas. On the other side, helping our midsize company&rsquo;s clients to look for new business and safely using our tools of updated information as a plus for their safe growth. Credit insurance offers coverage but does not necessarily offer sufficient information to decide on what potential clients they will seek in the future. We have designed a product called Portfolio Insights that will help companies evaluate their existing portfolio, but also define the potential clients they should be looking for. The agrifood sector is one of the most attractive sectors for exports, and the region has an advantage here. This is what we need to work on in order for Colombia to grow as a country and as a whole. We want to support these mid- to smaller-sized companies keen to export agrifood production to countries where there is a clear demand. We are leveraging, starting from what we know are our traditional exports, like flowers, but also migrating products in terms of credit insurance to smaller companies in the same field or alternative ones.</p>
<p><strong>How does Coface lean on technologies of big data analytics and predictive tools to benefit clients?</strong></p>
<p>It is a matter of having the basic information available. Today, we have a partner that helps us with this in terms of having a tool to evaluate companies, while Coface has its own internal tool for this. What we need to obtain is the information, the basis for feeding our own analytic system. We have obtained more and more information at regional level. All of our local exporting companies can support their decision-making process by making use of it. Besides that, our clients are able to buy this information online whenever and wherever they are. For example, Portfolio Insight is an evaluation of your full portfolio. This means we require full information on the company&rsquo;s portfolio and have it modeled into our scoring system.</p>
<p><strong>How can Coface help companies reduce uncertainty and manage risk?</strong></p>
<p>Agrifood companies also need to dedicate themselves to selling. They must protect their suppliers while also pursuing the growth of their core business of selling. They need companies to be their allies, better choose their clients, and mitigate the risk of that uncertainty. The only way to mitigate this risk is to transfer it. Credit insurance companies charge a premium to assume risk, and that is where we come in. We also avoid future risk. The preventative aspect of our activities needs further development with our companies, clients, and prospects. Credit insurance helps manage risk and prevent non-payment. Finally, it strengthens the debt collection process, which is the most valuable difference between us and our competitors. We are much stronger, and our recovery rate is a healthy 57% of all claims in a year.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you evaluate BMI Seguros Colombia&rsquo;s growth, and what is the current focus of business?</strong></p>
<p>The company has had a positive growth trajectory; we had an excellent performance in sales in 2021, growing by 157% in individual life compared to 2020 and 99% in health, and we closed the year with growth of 108%. As a result of COVID-19, people became more aware of the importance of insurance, which was a key factor in this growth process. We provide protection to our policyholders through our broad portfolio of life and individual health insurance. We also offer group insurance solutions that allow us to meet the protection needs of employers and incorporate them into their employee benefit programs.</p>
<p><strong>What has been your strategy to capitalize on market interest within the segment of life and health?</strong></p>
<p>We have focused our efforts on strengthening our external sales channel nationwide, and we expanded into more than 15 primary and intermediate cities with a team of more than 800 sales advisors. The expertise of this team in providing excellent advice on life and health to our clients has guaranteed the effectiveness of our services. In terms of service and innovation, we have developed life and health products that meet the protection needs of the current market; for example, in life policies, we have term and universal products and riders such as return of premiums, total and permanent disability, and accidental death, among others, which allow us to guarantee surrender values and financial security for the insured and their beneficiaries. Regarding health policies, our individual products offer medical treatment worldwide and free choice of medical networks abroad and locally. In Colombia, additionally, we do not apply deductibles for services ranging from home consultations, telemedicine, diagnostic services, therapies, emergencies, scheduled hospital services, maternity, complications, and care services that guarantee the tranquility of our insured, to whom we offer our exclusive BMI Access Service, where a medical coordinator assists them 24 hours a day in the coordination of all benefits.</p>
<p><strong>What is the strategic importance of BMI&rsquo;s network of health partners, and why is service a core pillar of BMI&rsquo;s value proposition?</strong></p>
<p>We currently have more than 760 providers of high-quality medical services nationwide and access to more than 3,350 health services and specialties, including clinical laboratories, diagnostic aids, hospitalization, surgery, prescription medicine, physical therapy, and other services that complement the coverage at the national and international level. The strengthening of our medical network allows our members to access high-quality health benefits with timely care anywhere in the world, guaranteeing their peace of mind and that of their families at any time.</p>
<p><strong>How does BMI approach health through prevention and what are the advantages for users?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, our policyholders have access to our online platform, BMI en L&iacute;nea, a technological tool that allows us to provide webinars and content of interest related to the care and preventative care solutions of both, physical and mental health for our clients, advisors, and employees. Additionally, our health policyholders have access to different preventive medical services such as outpatient services that can be accessed without deductible in Colombia, such as home medical visits, telemedicine, medical consultations, among other services within their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Where would you like to see BMI Seguros Colombia in the mid- and long-term future?</strong></p>
<p>Today, we start from an approximate base of 77,000 customers, and in 2022 we want to reach up to 120,000 users, focusing on the development of new products and strengthening technological developments. In order to achieve our goals, we have implemented individual and group segments and a massive affinity line. Additionally, we must continue to position the company in the country, strengthening and exploring its presence in the intermediate cities.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Nacional de Seguros taken advantage of growth opportunities linked to increased market interest in insurance products?</strong></p>
<p>2021 was an opportunity to not only to strengthen the resources to meet market needs and clients demands, but also to show clients that our company is beside them. The company has seen sustained growth that has significantly impacted our clients. The key has been to gather and focus as a company on how to optimize our procedures and teams to the client&rsquo;s advantage. We, therefore, honed our technological infrastructure and team.</p>
<p><strong>Why do clients choose Nacional de Seguros, and what differentiates the company?</strong></p>
<p>Nacional is a specialized company that allows us to know our business well and focus on the opportunities and challenges in the market. The clients value this and understand that when a company sits down with them to look at their business one to one in detail, it offers better alternatives to more standardized services offered in the market. This is how a specialized company gains market strength and proves itself to be specialized. We look at what the client needs, and what the difficulties are in constructing that final product. Based upon an assessment of the benefits for both parties Nacional constructs the final product and assist its clients.</p>
<p><strong>How do you evaluate the current state of infrastructure in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We do not focus exclusively on infrastructure although we are strong in this field, and have worked on significant projects in Colombia. We are also strong in oil and gas and services. We can see that Colombia is still in need of infrastructural development, and the government has made a significant investment in this, not only on the major 4G and 5G projects, but also on public work. As we continue to advance, we note the sheer value of these large investments, but also see the need for other developments. Large infrastructural developments also bring connections to other private contractors and we work intensively with them, delivering our services across the value chain. Infrastructure is of course the key motor of any economy worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>What business plans is Nacional de Seguros pursuing?</strong></p>
<p>We are considering the potential of large markets. The country is growing, as is the middle class which means potential development beyond infrastructure. Housing is a vital important sector offering notable opportunities. During 2022, it is very possible that we will begin to work more with this sector among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the specific importance in Colombia of hiring insurance compliance products?</strong></p>
<p>This is extremely important, and each development project is accompanied by an insurance policy that guarantees the investor that the project will proceed as scheduled. Our company gives investors a vital sense of security in their commercial undertakings. The compliance policies are there to support national development and insurance companies have shown their value over recent years. That is why we are here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main pillars of Zurich Seguros Colombia in terms of its work with communities?</strong></p>
<p>At Zurich Colombia we work aligned with the sustainability strategy of the Zurich Insurance Group and in terms of social investments and efforts, with the support of the Z Zurich Foundation (ZZF), which enjoys administrative and financial autonomy, at the service of different projects. The pillars we pursue in terms of sustainability are: Our commitment to climate change and all the actions we can take to contribute to the Business Ambition 1.5ËšC Pledge; confidence in a digital society; and the work sustainability. In terms of our social investment management, the development pillars defined by the ZZF are also climate change with a special focus on the generation of community resilience in the face of flood scenarios; Mental health and well-being and social equity. In each of them, we have different proposals in development.</p>
<p><strong>How do you channel your social responsibility actions? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To work with communities, based on those pillars, we work to develop initiatives to positively impact or generate transformation in people&rsquo;s lives. A positive impact is when we reach someone via the efforts we make as a corporation; on the other hand, transformation is when the concrete situation or that which can generate a potential problem is changed, changing the lives of the people as well. The group globally has taken important actions that are in line with the three pillars, and we do the same locally.</p>
<p><strong>What main sustainable actions is Zurich committed to?</strong></p>
<p>In line with our commitment to generate a positive impact, we are currently committed to five specific actions. The first of those actions is to reduce our global air travel by 70%, reducing our CO2 emissions. The second action is in line with the previous one and is to have a fleet of electric vehicles to reduce fuel consumption. The third action is in restaurants to select organic foods that help reduce the impact of the carbon footprint. The next is to be a paperless company, and we are well ahead of the curve on this. We are heavily focused on digitalization in Colombia with the development of products that can be quoted, purchased and managed in a way 100% digital, as Zurich MOV, our mobility product; another one focused on micro companies, Zurich Cree; and our most recent launching: Zurich Home.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What partnerships do you have with other entities to create opportunities for collaboration?</strong></p>
<p>We have built extremely strong alliances with strategic partners in each of the three pillars of corporate social responsibility. With the support of the ZZF, Zurich has created an alliance with Fundaci&oacute;n Forge in the area of social equity. We seek to help young Colombians in conditions of high social vulnerability to develop soft and strong skills, preparing them to the labor insertion in entry levels. We also have an alliance with Un Techo Para Colombia foundation, an organization that works in the reconstruction of families. We carry out a process with the families to set up a stable home and, once it is completed, we give them a decent house as a donation. Also in social equity, we work with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support victims of the Colombian armed conflict. Within the Climate Change Pillar, we also work to strengthen the communities&rsquo; resilience and response capacities to possible flooding scenarios as a result of climate change. In alliance with the National Society of the Colombian Red Cross (NSCRC) we are working, with community committees and local governments in Atl&aacute;ntico, Antioquia and Cundinamarca, to respond to these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How does Zurich collaborate with stakeholders to further its positive impact?</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to making a positive impact on the planet and based on that, our purpose is to create a brighter future, together. Our purpose invites our stakeholders to shine and drives us and inspires us. Is about an optimistic calling to building a better world, together.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Zurich&rsquo;s story in Colombia, and what has been the company&rsquo;s strategy since arrival?</strong></p>
<p>Zurich arrived six years ago directly, which is different from our strategy in other countries. Usually, Zurich will acquire a company or a competitor in order to enter a market already within the top five spots when it comes to insurance rankings in that country. Today, we are in the middle of the rankings in Colombia, at 14th, in terms of the number of premiums. This is the first part of our journey here in Colombia. We have defined 2024 as a major milestone in the journey of Zurich Colombia: we want to have premiums that amount to COP1 billion by 2024. Today, we have about 60-70% of the portfolio represented among corporate clients, enterprises, and companies. The intention in 2024 is to become a company that is 50% corporate clients and 50% of personal insurance for houses, cars, and others. The insurance sector is not just about selling a policy; it is about protecting the dreams of the people. We are sending strong signals to the market that Zurich is an insurance company for personal alliance in Colombia, and not just for corporate clients.</p>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the importance for businesses and individuals in finding a partner in insurance?</strong></p>
<p>The insurance sector is important for people, the economy, and for the government. We do not just sell insurance but build and deliver resilience. Insurance is a financial tool that allows people, companies, the government, and the economy to recover the same situation that they had before. It is the way to help people to continue with their plans, dreams, and projects. That is the importance of the insurance industry. We are building resilience for society. Because of the pandemic, people today have more interest and knowledge about insurance and the benefits that it can provide for their future and their lives. The pandemic has, overall, been a negative experience generally; however, one of the good things to come out of it is the greater awareness around the importance of insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Zurich was the first insurance company to launch a 100% digital car insurance product in Colombia. How do you assume the position of being a leader in innovation?</strong></p>
<p>In Zurich Colombia, 60% or more of its people are millennials. This allows us to think differently by bringing different kinds of services to the market in order to differentiate ourselves. The most important part of that is our team and the composition of our people. We wanted to offer something that is different from the traditional car insurance currently in the market. The answer came from the millennials. In cities today, the main insurable object is not the car, but the individual. We have developed a car insurance that is not assigned to a car but rather an individual. At the end of the day, it is a mobility solution that allows you to commute from your home to work in a car, scooter, bicycle, or public transport whereby you are 100% covered by your insurance no matter how you commute. It is a new concept. In addition, it is 100% digital and 100% modular. You can design your own insurance based on your necessities. This is a different concept in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is Zurich contributing to the expansion of insurance penetration in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>Our car insurance program and our homeowners&rsquo; program all have the same intention and objective, which is to have a different product. They are different in that they are digital and modular. Most importantly, one can buy insurance with Zurich from anywhere; they don&rsquo;t need to come down to the office or get an inspection of their cars. It is different now because the process of insurance must be easy for policyholders and easy for us. As long as you have an easy process, you can increase your penetration in the insurance industry.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us a general overview of Electryon and its operations in the region?</strong></p>
<p>Electryon is a project developer at its core: We originate our own projects and apply our development expertise to bring them from &ldquo;greenfield&rdquo; to what we call the &ldquo;ready-to-build&rdquo; phase. Once we reach that phase, we usually hand our projects over to local and/or international investors interested in continuing with their construction and long-term operation. The scope of our development activities include: (i) securing the interconnection of our projects to the power system, (ii) carrying out the environmental and technical feasibility studies, (iii) obtaining the environmental licenses, (iv) negotiating the long-term lease agreements with landowners, and (v) carrying out engineering designs, among others. Upon completion of these activities our projects reach &ldquo;ready-to-build&rdquo; and construction can begin; construction of these type of projects takes between 1 and 2 years. Electryon can participate with additional equity in the construction stage to bring the projects to commercial operation date; however, typically our investors are large local/international utilities that may not be interested in having equity partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What projects is Electryon focusing on at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>We are in the field of PV solar and wind power generation projects and the production of green hydrogen/ammonia. Currently, we have a portfolio of 520MW of PV solar power projects that will reach the ready-to-build phase either at the end of 2022 or Q12023. Our green hydrogen/ammonia production project is based on a 500MW wind project currently in the feasibility stage, and we expect to reach &ldquo;ready to build&rdquo; in 2025-2026.</p>
<p><strong>What investment opportunity did Electryon identify in renewables, and what is the potential of the industry?</strong></p>
<p>Colombia wants to move toward renewables because there is no more room for large hydropower plants. The only way to expand the system is through renewables. The Ministry of Energy has a strategy to develop 10% of the total installed grid capacity through renewables; however, our field is larger than that because we are not only thinking about using renewables for electricity but also using renewables to produce green hydrogen for the national and international markets.</p>
<p><strong>How do you envision the role of renewables in the energy matrix development?</strong></p>
<p>Compared to fossil fuels, renewables are extremely competitive. The main difficulty in Colombia is our reliance on hydropower, which could also be seen as renewable: 80% of the energy generation in Colombia comes from hydropower generation. Generating energy with hydropower is cheap, except when El Ni&ntilde;o occurs. In that case, we must use thermal power plants, making the cost of electricity increase drastically in Colombia. Therefore, the combination that the government is looking into with our participation is using renewable energy sources instead of building more thermal and large hydropower plants. Renewables can supply this complementarity, which means that between hydropower, solar power, and wind power, we can have more green energy in the country.</p>
<p><strong>What makes Colombia special as an investment destination in matters of renewable energy?</strong></p>
<p>Colombia has extremely rich resources: We have wind, unfortunately only in the northern part of the country, though we also receive a great amount of sun all over the country due to our Equatorian location. We are also strategically located for the exportation of green hydrogen/ammonia in comparison with other countries in Latin America and the world. One of our main competitors for the production and exportation of green hydrogen/ammonia is Chile, but they are farther away from all the potential international markets than Colombia (US and Europe). The main challenges in terms of renewable energy are regulations. The government has been improving the regulations by making changes, and this has caused significant disruption in the market; however, this will also improve the competitiveness of the market because we need solid competitors&mdash;good companies coming to the market&mdash;and the regulations are working in that sense.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is GreenYellow&rsquo;s area of expertise and what is the company&rsquo;s mission?</strong></p>
<p>GreenYellow specializes in three lines of business. The first is the generation of photovoltaic energy, which we perform through two formats: the sale of self-consumption projects where GreenYellow assumes the project's investment and the customer pays a lower rate than the one offered by the grid operators; and the sale of clean energy from the solar plants that we own and are building in the country. The second line is energy efficiency, which focuses on helping our customers consume their energy in a smart and efficient way. With this service, we can reduce energy consumption between 20 and 35% in various types of industries by installing various types of equipment according to the industry and then optimize and monitor consumption according to every day&rsquo;s sunlight, temperature, and so on. We invoice a portion of the savings obtained by our customers; our customers do not have any initial costs, and we recover all the investment made only through sharing our costumer&rsquo;s energy savings with them. It is the perfect representation of a win-win scenario, so GreenYellow is not the client&rsquo;s counterparty; it is the client&rsquo;s solidary partner and all incentives are aligned between the two companies. The third line is Utility as a Service, where we offer energy in different representations other that electricity such as: refrigeration, air conditioning, steam, heat, and other thermal energies. Thanks to our business model, our client only pays a monthly fee for an all-inclusive service for a period of time determined by a contract, without investing capital. In Colombia, Utility as a Service is a business line that was developed with our own methods of innovation, and was then replicated to other countries within GreenYellow&rsquo;s footprint. Today, it represents a large percentage of our annual investments.</p>
<p><strong>How does GreenYellow help its customers achieve their sustainability goals?</strong></p>
<p>In the past, to meet ESG criteria, companies had to invest and spend more money in order to be able to say they were sustainable. Today, they can be sustainable and save money at the same time. For example, with our Utility as a Service business line, in refrigeration, we help companies reduce their carbon footprint drastically by transitioning to natural refrigerants with low global warming potential. This helps our customers to insert themselves in international treaties such as the Montreal protocol, the Paris agreement, amongst others.</p>
<p><strong>What is GreenYellow's track record internationally and what makes you experts?</strong></p>
<p>GreenYellow was founded in France over 15 years ago. The main activity of the company has traditionally been energy optimization through our services where our clients achieve independence, savings and sustainability. We have been working on energy efficiency and solar energy projects in Colombia for 10 years. The company has accumulated an outstanding technical experience and has already gone through the entire learning curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In which sectors do you focus on business development?</strong></p>
<p>We focus on sectors that have large energy consumption. At the beginning, we focused on retail but we have also worked in heath infrastructure, industrial facilities, food refrigeration, logistics and many more. All sectors want to and can save energy, and our business is applicable to any industry.</p>
<p><strong>What are GreenYellow's objectives in terms of business development and market leadership?</strong></p>
<p>GreenYellow is one of the leaders in energy optimization and energy transition in the country. The cornerstone of our business is the financial solvency of the company; it differentiates us from the competition in several ways. First, our profits and earnings are based on the savings of our customers. Secondly, we guarantee savings and this makes us offer an extremely differentiated proposal in the market, and to be leaders in the market and carry out our plan, we are always thinking about how to differentiate ourselves from others, with innovation. Today, we have a strong and innovative team that will thrive the company towards differentiating more and more every day from our potential competition.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes BlueFloat Energy an expert in offshore wind energy, and what are its plans in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We are the best partner for Colombia due to our experience in the development of offshore wind projects, where our global industry knowledge and locally focused project development approach come together. It is a company formed by a team of pioneers in offshore wind energy with extensive knowledge and practical experience in the development, permitting, financing, construction, commissioning and operation of offshore wind energy projects, both with fixed and floating structures that has developed more than 15 projects in 6 countries: the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of offshore wind energy?</strong></p>
<p>Offshore wind energy allows capturing a more valuable wind resource at sea than on land, and even more important in Colombia, since the country has the advantage of having an abundant resource along the entire coast. As a result, it allows better use of grid capacity and enables a more predictable and more consistent supply of electricity. Another advantage is that less interference with other activities or with local communities is required. Colombia has taken the lead in Latin America in the development of this type of projects and can take advantage to be the first to highlight an industry that exists domestically and can be exported to countries such as Brazil, the US, and even Caribbean countries.</p>
<p><strong>How does BlueFloat Energy plan to interact with the communities?</strong></p>
<p>This is a factor to which we always give a lot of importance in our projects in any country. This one in particular is an opportunity to create value and create quality jobs in the community. There is a need to train workers in construction, welding and operations at the industrial level. Second, we always carry out an exhaustive environmental impact study to understand the implications that the project may have within the different communities, and we propose solutions that allow us not only to limit these impacts but also to turn them into something positive. An example of this is the improvement of biodiversity at our sites through environmental engineering campaigns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide a general view of the Sumitomo Corporation and outline the company&rsquo;s principal objectives in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>Sumitomo Corporation is a Japanese company and was originally the trading arm of Sumitomo Group. Right now, each Sumitomo company is independent. The company has transformed its business model from trading to business investment. &nbsp;Our company Sumitomo Andes is in charge of three countries in the region: Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Our biggest business in the region is mining, with a large investment in a copper mine in Peru, and other traditional trading business such as automotive. We import cars from Mazda, which is also a group company, and we do some internal distribution business with cosmetic ingredients. We have invested in a European company called Fyffes, the largest distributor of bananas in Europe. Our other core business is the import and distribution of agrochemicals. Those are the traditional businesses that we have invested in.</p>
<p><strong>Sumitomo Corporation has between USD2.5 and USD5.5 million of product investment in Colombia. What principles guide your planning in Colombia? </strong></p>
<p>We are in the second year of the mid-term business plan outlined to 2023. The focus is supporting the country&rsquo;s ESG objectives and contributing to a sustainable economy. In South America and the region, we are focused mainly in two areas: de-carbonization, carbon neutral, or carbon free; and agriculture-related business. We would like to contribute to solve social issues throughout the business.</p>
<p><strong>What is Sumitomo&rsquo;s approach to partnerships?</strong></p>
<p>Sumitomo is a large corporation spread out all over the world. We have offices in over 150 countries and 70,000 employees. We rotate employees from one country to another every four or five years. Our business principle is to look for a local business partner where we want to make a business or investment. We place great importance in long-term business. We are not like a typical investment bank that makes an investment and then sells it after three-four years. As long as the investment is creating value, we want to stay long term, and it is important that our partner has the same philosophy. Making a profit is important, but we want to contribute to society. The philosophy of the executives of partners is extremely important when making an investment decision.</p>
<p><strong>What business synergies did you identify with the Colombian company, Promigas?</strong></p>
<p>Promigas has the same mentality and strategy as us; they are interested in developing business lines in the area of de-carbonization, especially in hydrogen. There are things that both companies can bring together and are on to the table for the project. That was the initial reason why we wanted to talk with Promigas. It is part of a big group in the country and has a good, solid reputation. After meeting with its executives several times and talking about the business opportunities and personal lives, we realized we have similar philosophy and have similar expectations. There is a good and similar chemistry between two companies.</p>
<p><strong>Sumitomo is a perfect example of FDI confidence in Colombia. What expertise can Sumitomo bring to the Colombian economy?</strong></p>
<p>Other than simple financial resources, our global network and the diversity of our business portofolio are key. We work closely with other regional offices as well as the head quarter. If we see a need for specific technology, for example, to produce hydrogen, then we communicate with our sister offices to find solutions. Promigas&rsquo; main business is in gas transportation. We have an energy business in Houston. We try to look for support that we may be able to do from energy business groups. That is our expertise.</p>
<p><strong>What makes hydrogen energy revolutionary, and what makes the field interesting as an investment opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>Sumitomo Corporation is extremely concerned about climate change. Japan always has an issue with energy, as we do not have much fossil fuels, and we has been investing in renewable energies such as wind and solar. Hydrogen has the great potential to replace oil and gas in the future. There are still many challenges ahead, such as the cost; the cost is much higher than oil, and there is still much to do on the supply chain side. It is coming, but we believe solution will be found in a matter of time. Even though it might be premature to make an investment at this moment, we wanted to get involved in the early stages.</p>
<p><strong>What are Sumitomo&rsquo;s targets for the medium and long term in Latin America and in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We want to increase our presence in Colombia and tap into our global network. We are discovering many opportunities here, with significant growth potential in the country. There are 100 million people in total in the three countries that Sumitomo Andes is in charge of. There are many ways in which we can contribute to the development of Colombia. Japan, as a country, can contribute more to the development of the region and the country. To do so, we have to let them know about the opportunities in both Colombia and South America.</p>
<p><strong>How do you evaluate Colombia&rsquo;s approach to investment attraction?</strong></p>
<p>ProColombia is extremely active not only here but also in Tokyo. In FDI, there are lot of competitions and other countries also want to promote different products and opportunities to Japan. We always need to evaluate why Colombia is the best destination for the investment, before presenting a particular product or opportunity. We still need to make great effort in that area and work with ProColombia and embassies in both countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the focus of Gutierrez Group during 2022? </strong></p>
<p>Our focus is to consistently strengthen our offer of investment vehicles, delivering exceptional and diversified opportunities to our client base. We have concentrated on several fronts. On the one hand, we began the promotion of our latest real estate project and we have been expanding our directly led holdings of real estate, which we have ample experience in. We also finalized the restructuring of a truly industrial-scale size forestry project for carbon capture. It had an interesting evolution from an early thermo-electric energy production project to now solely capturing CO2. This unique project offers attractive metrics to investors looking for environmental investments with a high ROI. Internally, we focused on strengthening our communications and marketing departments. The aim is to increase our market visibility in order to reach more investors.</p>
<p><strong>How can Gutierrez Group be an excellent partner for international investors looking for investment opportunities in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>We have been providing professional services even before there was international interest in Colombia, from medium, small-scale entrepreneurs that are coming in by the thousands now. We have been in operation for over 15 years. We have captured their attention and made ourselves a solid ally by demonstrating that we have great experience, linguistic abilities, skill sets, and a network. We can narrow that cultural gap that people encounter when coming from Europe or the US. When you combine that ability with what we have, which is an indistinguishable love for Colombia and excellent work ethics, it is an extremely attractive proposition for anyone looking for a partner.</p>
<p><strong>What is the importance of expertise when carrying out investments in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>Experience and expertise are key. Knowing how to navigate specific waters, how to deal with authorities, and having the right networks in order to secure those important allies that are necessary to accomplish your plans in Colombia will all be the key differentials in being successful or being frustrated all the time. You need to understand the local idiosyncrasy and know how to blend it with foreign culture to facilitate goals. They also need a high degree of sensitivity or emotional intelligence to bring those two ends together. When you have important deals on the line, you always want to have those type of people on your side of the table. Finally, there are principles and work ethics to consider. We have a pyramid of principles, and we do not entertain corruption or illegal shortcuts. We believe in old-fashioned values, and these have always worked for us. This has appealed to many people.</p>
<p><strong>What services do you offer to international investors?</strong></p>
<p>We are a one-stop shop and can do many things. We can help our clients with the entire chain of services that arise from the mere desire to invest or live in this country. An investor coming here or someone planning to relocate here will need help with opening accounts, transferring and properly registering incoming funds, creating structures, purchasing property, managing property, opening businesses, obtaining residency and citizenship, hiring employees, protecting trademarks, reporting, compliance, and accounting: we do it all. We also help our clients invest and manage their wealth in Colombia by putting together unique investment opportunities that offer returns that are far greater than what they are used to receiving in their own countries.</p>
<p><strong>What makes Guti&eacute;rrez Group&rsquo;s ESG forestry project, which is fully dedicated to carbon emissions capturing, so interesting as an investment opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>What makes it interesting is a combination of multiple factors. If ESG is what investors are looking for, then we are attractive because we are FSC and Gold Standard certified, and these are certifications that do not come around easily. We have had them for almost five years, which has proven to be a huge advantage. From an economic perspective, which appeals to most, we have an interesting track record with 10 years in this field. We have a proven thesis of over 5,000 has planted. We offer above average returns that start at 15% per annum. This is all quite appealing to people who are interested in the economic aspect of the investment. Now, I like to believe that the reason why people find us most attractive likely has to do with that personal fulfillment of emotionality that accompanies an investment when it is made with a superior purpose. Colombian Timber is a fully turnkey project that has an attractive yield but it is also an investment that you can make money on while generating a tangible difference to our environment. Moreover, it is also about supporting and making a difference in a community that has been historically neglected by the government, such as the community of the Orinoqu&iacute;a. We are making money while helping the environment through removal of thousands of tons of CO2. At the same time, we are providing long-term, meaningful employment to hundreds of people within these impoverished communities. When I talk about the emotion and the fulfillment around an investment, it has been priceless to see communities flourish and thrive. The government has actually noticed this and is slowly coming in to put in infrastructure and roads, education, health, and other amenities. For an investor that is seeking all that as a combination, Colombian Timber is the right choice for them.</p>
<p><strong>How is Guti&eacute;rrez Group capitalizing on Medell&iacute;n&rsquo;s tourism boom?</strong></p>
<p>Despite the 18-month slowdown due to the pandemic, Colombia and Medell&iacute;n have performed brilliantly in terms of tourism growth. The average annual increase over the past eight to 10 years has been close to the 15% mark, almost four times the global average. The city has greatly benefited from that. It is not hard to understand, as Medell&iacute;n is immensely attractive as a tourism option. Combined with the high purchasing power of Americans and Europeans, the available opportunities for entrepreneurs or digital nomads, and the highly qualified Colombian workforce, that is a tough combination to beat. We are playing an important role in that equation by putting together real estate projects that cater to customers that want to discover the city and enjoy maximum comfort. That would be here and for other parts of Colombia as well. What makes our projects special is our unique know how and a spotless reputation, which appeals to our investors.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does BA support clients in their business operations, and what are the advantages of the firm&rsquo;s focus on jurisdictional protection and legal advisory?</strong></p>
<p>The support to our clients is comprehensive and multidisciplinary and extends beyond legal advice. Within our team we have pharmaceutical chemists, veterinarians, agronomists, and personnel specialized in logistics issues. We support our clients in day-to-day issues, but also assist them in compliance with norms, the implementation of legal-regulatory strategies, and in the entire regulatory process not only in Colombia, but wherever our clients require advisory. We differentiate ourselves in that while our approach is legal, the regulatory technical team is robust, and able to assist the client in logistical issues, requests for quotas, seeds, and import or export licenses. Whatever the need we roll up our sleeves for our clients.</p>
<p><strong>Through which methods and tools does BA ensure its service is simplified, timely and of high quality?</strong></p>
<p>We understand the client's business, and think like company lawyers. We visualize the business, understand the needs, visit the facilities, and meet with the team. In this way our work has clear objectives, and our advice is of high quality and applicable to the client's objectives, always subject to legal terms and deadlines. Especially in terms of regulatory issues we prefer to think outside the box to provide legal and practical solutions to problems or situations that often have not arisen in the cannabis industry given its nascent state and complex and highly regulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>How is BA&rsquo;s specialty a good fit for companies in the cannabis space, and what are the main legal challenges and considerations for industry participants?</strong></p>
<p>We are excellent allies for cannabis companies because our team is multidisciplinary. With the support of our agronomists, pharmaceutical chemists, and veterinarians, we can cover products with cannabis components for both animal and human health. Currently, it is still a headache for clients to secure financing and open bank accounts. Aldo the response times from government entities regarding procedures and requests made is a challenge. For companies that aim to export cannabis derivatives in the short or medium term, logistical issues, quotas and export licenses are complex and require patience.</p>
<p><strong>What type of partnerships are most common in BA&rsquo;s legal practice, and why is it key to establish long term relationships with businesses when dealing with employee relations?</strong></p>
<p>Our relationship with our clients is always based on trust, professionalism, and the achievement of common goals. For us it is very important to know our client's business, help them strengthen their weaknesses and enhance their strengths. Especially by helping them to identify their business niche, which is essential since specialization within the industry is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p><strong>What is the firm&rsquo;s approach to technology and what makes this characteristic important when working in tech-savvy industries such as the cannabis industry?</strong></p>
<p>We have a CRM system in the cloud, which allows us immediate control of processes, including their traceability and immediate response. Among our clients are software companies specialized in ERP solutions for cannabis companies ranging from cultivation to sales.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you identify growth opportunities and what do updates to the regulatory framework such as Decree 811 mean for the firm&rsquo;s growth?</strong></p>
<p>The great opportunity with Decree 811 is the possibility of exporting dried flower for medicinal use. And with this authorization we are participating in the largest market for cannabis worldwide. The greatest challenge for exporters will be to adapt the cultivation models for the export of quality dried flower, complying with quality parameters of the destination country, for example, flower size, THC concentration, elimination of heavy metals, and so forth. Likewise, for the use of industrial cannabis, procedures and cultivation will have to be adapted. This is not the case for pharmaceutical-grade cultivation that requires high international standards compared to, say, the plastics industry; the genetics, cultivation size and procedures are different. It is very important to mention that thanks to Decree 811, it is now possible to export cannabis from a free trade zone.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>What are Buritic&aacute;&rsquo;s business development objectives?</strong></p>
<p>If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we have to be flexible, adjust to new realities and, regardless of medium or long-term plans, we must have the ability to adapt. BA&rsquo;s short and medium-term goal is to continue helping companies to export, seek alliances with other international companies (law firms, logistics companies, buyers, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and wellness laboratories), and consolidate and expand our network of international partners.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What responsibilities come with being the leading publisher of business news in Colombia?</strong></p>
<p>Portafolio specializes in economic journalism and economic information. Our analysis combines social and economic factors of current events as we follow the transformations of the Colombian economy, which began even before the pandemic but were accelerated. One of the consequences of this acceleration was the change of the economic agenda of Colombia; factors that were not prioritized by the community or businesses before began to gain importance, such as labor tendencies, digital transformation, and the digitalization of the economy. The pandemic also created more conversation about the sustainability of our energy supplies. We are seeing changes in the economic agenda of governments, including the Colombian government. The discussion of the public economic agenda transformed and helped financial support and financial reactivation programs become more accessible. Currently, businesses and the state are prioritizing different agendas, and the work of Portafolio at the moment is to bring these different agendas to the readers and provide information about the topics regarding the national economy and business agenda. Our role is to cover the transformation that is taking place and deliver insightful, rigorous journalism.</p>
<p><strong>How is the media evolving to provide quality content that is interesting and relevant given changes to the public&rsquo;s attention span?</strong></p>
<p>The economy began to be highly important in different media fronts and not only in specialized publications like Portafolio. Economic journalism has a long tradition in Colombia, and Portafolio will reach 29 years in 2021, being the leading publisher in the country for economy and business matters. Matters such as employment, inflation, cost of living, economic management, and the satisfaction of living standards are in the top-of-mind. We are seeing an interesting moment wherein readers are looking to get better information about the macro economy and also about business aspects, financial strategies, and the fight against inflation.</p>
<p><strong>What makes international alliances key in order to deliver quality journalism?</strong></p>
<p>The current moment that we are living in has emphasized the similarities between the economies of different countries around the world. This is precisely what Portafolio looks for with different alliances with foreign communications and content generators. We are the leader in Colombia for two main factors. The first one is our capacity to talk about the economy of Colombia truthfully and in a professional way. For our international audience, we are the path to understand and receive information about the economy of Colombia and Colombian businesses. The second factor is our capacity for persuasion. We need to strengthen the second and help Colombian sectors understand the avenues of contact that unite the economy with the rest of the world. This global connection is an important part of our strategy, and one key tool to create this is through alliances that we are working with.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main ambitions for Portafolio in the mid to long term?</strong></p>
<p>We want to maintain ourselves as the leaders of economic and business information in Colombia and carry on reaching out to the largest audience possible. The second objective is regarding our content and our commitment to our readers. We want our audience to receive information about the economy and business of Colombia that is useful for them when making business decisions and public decisions for businesses and for the people. We need to tell them about changes and give the professional information that helps to make these decisions. The third element is to confront these goals of the industry and keep adapting to the new platforms and ways of creating content to keep our commitment to our audience and reach audiences that are living far from economic information. We need to look at how we can persuade and make a way for this information to be useful for them too. In addition, we want to follow up on trends like digitalization, remote work, and start-ups; at the same time, we need to provide information regarding our macro economy and its situation within the different sectors.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What type of clients can benefit the most from the free trade zone?</strong></p>
<p>Any legal entity that makes part of the sectors for industrial services, technology and innovation, importers, exporters, and any company that carries out industrial activities. In ZFO, we offer the following advantages as an added value for our clients: Industry and Commerce Tax exemption for eight to 10 years, tailor-made construction warehouses, and offices without VAT for our clients. We are the only free trade zone in Cundinamarca with a green seal and are in one of the three main eco-industrial parks in Colombia. We have advantages such as rainwater supply from the buffer lagoon, collection and sale of recyclable material, tax benefits, information security, a logistically attractive park due to its infrastructure and design, a strategic location with hectares of available space for new projects, roads between 10 and 17m wide for heavy traffic, exclusive park space for the cargo entry of 8,500sqm, hydraulic and sanitary networks, unlimited storage space with no taxation, favorable options to nationalize subheadings, and international logistics distribution. In addition, exports through the airport do not require customs approval.</p>
<p><strong>What is the social and developmental impact of ZFO?</strong></p>
<p>ZFO plays a fundamental role in the FTZ in Colombia, as it contributes to the country&rsquo;s economy by creating jobs and investment. At the same time, it has allowed many interested entrepreneurs to create strategic alliances and expand their markets by increasing competitiveness and the economic growth of the country. From 2008 to this date, the Western Savanna has had positive growth in terms of the customs operations, which have been a source of success and recognition in different markets. We have increased exports in countries in Central America, North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. We had a considerable increase in the import of raw materials, goods, finished products, and essential elements for the mitigation of the pandemic. We have innovated in technology 4.0, guaranteeing agility in industrial processes and information security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Through what mechanisms does CEA support American investment in the country?</strong></p>
<p>We follow five strategic lines. One of them is networking, which is perhaps the origin of CEA. The second one is the business climate, because if we are able to provide and encourage a proper business climate in the country, companies will see the potential in Colombia. The third one is security; we have had a security committee for over 40 years and are still today the Bogot&aacute; Country Chapter of the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) since its creation by the Secretary of State of the US back in 1985. The fourth one is human resources; we are able to share best practices in terms of what these companies are doing for their employees throughout the world, especially during and after the pandemic. It has resulted in a great deal of positive experiences that we have been able to share with all our member companies. The fifth is social impact. All the American companies in Colombia are socially responsible. CEA provides them with that possibility through CEA Foundation where we bring together the different synergies that they provide. We can bring them projects as well as formulate projects for them.</p>
<p><strong>What mechanisms does CEA use to find new partners and attract new companies?</strong></p>
<p>After this pandemic, we have developed a strategic plan within our companies with three pillars. The first is the social impact bridge, namely American companies positively impacting the communities where they work, where they have factories, and where they sell. The second is building up the confidence of the people toward the private sector in multinationals. We have to raise awareness of what these companies bring to the development of the country and the wealth of people. The third one is how we can contribute more to the development of the country. We are trying to bring those small and micro-businesses into our supply chains to help them develop themselves through education and training to become members of our value chain. We are heavily committed to those three pillars, and given the challenges faced by Colombia and the new government to come next August, those pillars have become very important to our people and our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Medell&iacute;n a good investment destination?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons why we are an attractive destination to do business and attract investment. One has to do with a competitive and attractive environment. There are some enabling reasons for this. Some have to do, for example, with public policy, and we feature within the framework of a development plan at the center of which is Medell&iacute;n a Software Valley. Its objective is to support a city whose plan is to become the epicenter of Industry 4.0 in Latin America as be an engine of development for the country and wider region. There are also certain enabling qualities such as the city&rsquo;s robust economic performance. We have a strong production specialization and a business network and institutional trust earned over many years. We have sign agreements with the city administration, universities and civil society. We also have an excellent climate for doing business. The departmental competitiveness index, for example, has classified us over the past seven years as one of the most competitive regions according to various criteria, including human capital. Then there&rsquo;s the market and innovative ecosystem in the city. Talent is truly abundant. Furthermore, the city offers a high quality of life by national standards, which is an incentive for many companies looking to set up in the territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How does ACI Medell&iacute;n promote investment in the city?</strong></p>
<p>ACI Medell&iacute;n is a public agency which already has an important seal, differentiating it from other investment promotion agencies in the country. We have a mandate to attract foreign and local investment to the city, which we manage proactively. We focus on attracting investments in sectors that promote comprehensive development. In this way, we seek not only the contribution of investors, but also that these foreign companies contribute to the development of the city through social responsibility programs and strategies. Our contribution as an agency is to accompany the investor throughout the process. In other words, we also map and accompany them in the process of deciding to settle in our city. We have legal support, and proximity to a network of allies that can also support these companies&rsquo; strategies in finding talent and understanding the territory. Where they need dialogue with the mayor&rsquo;s office and city government, we as an agency are that gateway to the city.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What factors make Colombia unique and give business leaders the confidence to invest in Bogot&aacute;?</strong></p>
<p>The region received over USD481 million in direct and indirect investment within 1Q2021. The estimation that we have here at the Invest in Bogot&aacute; project is that the flow of new and expanded investment within the Bogot&aacute; region grew around 39% in 2021. Bogot&aacute; is also set to attract more indirect investment from sectors such as value-added manufacturing, e-commerce, and nearshoring operations, which is a new term that everyone is talking about because what is currently happening with worldwide logistics. Infrastructure is another key sector for us and our city. There are also creative industries, technology-based services, life sciences and entrepreneurship that are a part of the strategy to attract more investment to the city. Bogot&aacute; is the economic, cultural, and administrative center of Colombia. This is also the gateway for the Latin American market due to its location and political stability, as our neighbors are not in as good or stable a political shape. The pandemic established a new commercial landscape in which Bogot&aacute; has great opportunities to become a relevant player in Latin America for the aforementioned sectors. Bogot&aacute; bet on boosting the attraction of different projects in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>What is Invest in Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s impact? </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Invest in Bogot&aacute;, although the pandemic hit the development and growth of the city in 2020, we campaigned for the arrival of 30 new investments and expansion projects for the city, an estimated USD114 million in total. We also estimate that those companies generate over 5,000 direct jobs for the city. In 2019, we accompanied 48 projects, marking a personal record. And in 2021, we reached our goal and attracted 35 new investments in the city. Our goal for 2022 is to attract at least 40 new investments. We are growing rapidly. Since our creation in 2006, Invest in Bogot&aacute;, which is an initiative of the Mayor's Office of Bogot&aacute; and the City Chambers of Commerce, has supported the development of over 450 projects for companies in Bogot&aacute;. One in three projects that come to the city are brought in by Invest in Bogot&aacute;, amounting to 33% of the total.</p>
<p><strong>What type of business links are Invest in Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s focus?</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to attract investment in general, and we work to identify foreign companies keen to make Bogot&aacute; an operational hub for the country or wider region. On the other hand, we have a pipeline of projects for the city that we can offer companies such as private equity funds, venture capital funds, or any kind of investments participating in the projects the city has to offer. This includes infrastructure projects and entrepreneurship. Colombia is experiencing a boom in entrepreneurship, and we need to articulate the investments of those companies who are moving faster and forward that could be attractive for investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Through which mechanisms does Invest in Bogot&aacute; deliver and what processes are in place to help the business community?</strong></p>
<p>We align with the strategy of the city because our stakeholders are the Mayor and the Chamber of Commerce. We focus on the key sectors offering an appealing opportunity for international investors. We have different units in our agency that work closely and specialize in the different economic sectors to ensure that we have a deep understanding of the sector and its opportunities. On one hand, we are proactive and are very active in campaigns and visits to countries most likely to show interest in Bogot&aacute;. We are analyzing which countries, sectors, and types of companies that we need in Bogot&aacute;. We are generating content, analyzing trends, and making connections that allow us to receive actionable information daily. We develop content through our webpage and the media so as to position Bogot&aacute; internationally as a business-friendly city.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has ProColombia contributed to the growth and diversification of the Colombian economy during its three decades of operations?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to a talented team of professionals, a focused strategy, as well as the coordination with the national government, unions, and other partners, ProColombia has made great strides in attracting tourism and FDI, as well as in promoting non-mining exports and the Country Brand. We have contributed to Colombia&rsquo;s positioning as a leading destination for FDI in the region, and it has been an efficient investment which has positively impacted job creation and growth in Colombia. For example, employment opportunities from foreign investment supported by ProColombia have increased more than fivefold over the last 10 years. In 2011, the number of jobs created reached 21,000, while 2021 closed with 107,000 jobs created&mdash;a compound annual growth of 18%. The number of countries that invest in Colombia has more than doubled. In 2011, ProColombia supported investors from 16 countries, while in 2021, the number reached 35 countries. Additionally, every month, 72 new foreign investment opportunities are identified for Colombia, while 10 years ago there were 27 each month. For these reasons, Colombia is one of top 30 investment recipients in the world and the third largest recipient of FDI in Latin America. Exports have also increased. On average, with ProColombia&rsquo;s support, 24 foreign buyers acquired Colombian products and services every day in 2021, while in 2011 there were nine buyers a day. Currently, an ever-increasing number of Colombian companies are receiving export-related services from ProColombia. In 2011, ProColombia supported 2,441 companies from 20 departments; in 2021, this increased to 5,615 companies from all 32 of Colombia&rsquo;s departments.</p>
<p><strong>What strategies are the focus of export promotion, and to what do you attribute the success achieved during 2021?</strong></p>
<p>In 2021, we implemented an economic reactivation plan for Colombia&rsquo;s non-mining exports, which prioritized knowledge-based services, public procurement, biosafe goods and services, personal protective equipment, health diplomacy to achieve phytosanitary admissibility for more agri-foods, and online and in-person commercial activities such as Macro Business Matchmaking Forums, among others. We have made great strides in various fields, including harnessing the potential of e-commerce. Thanks to the "Colombia a un Clic" (Colombia at a Click) program&mdash;which supports and advises Colombian companies on entering international marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon&mdash;we have trained more than 3,900 business representatives in partnership with the marketplaces and in the e-commerce export training program launched in 2021. In addition, 485 companies have opened an account and 210 have achieved sales of USD24.4 million. Likewise, at ProColombia, we are overseeing approximately 56 admissibility processes for agricultural products in 27 countries, providing technical support and identifying real business opportunities as well as coordinating with embassies and health authorities in Colombia and the destination.</p>
<p><strong>What policy incentives and mechanisms have proven effective in increasing Colombia&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment destination?</strong></p>
<p>At ProColombia, we strive to promote our country as a leading destination for sustainable FDI. We are in the right path, as we are certain that currently we are the investment hub in the Americas. Due to our privileged geographic location, in the middle of the continent, which enables us to connect to any destination in the hemisphere in short periods of time, we are an ideal friend-shoring destination. That means that we are a unique platform to reach other markets, as Colombia has signed and enacted important commercial agreements that enable our country to reach over 1.5 billion consumers. Our government has implemented strategies to boost the arrival of foreign direct investment, offering tax exemptions to attract projects that promote the development of renewable energy, agribusiness, new technology, business services, tourism, infrastructure, and logistics, among others. This increased effort to attract investment also strives to further diversify Colombia&rsquo;s exportable offer and position the country as an export platform and provider of goods and services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been Tamara&rsquo;s experience growing through the pandemic and setting up in Kuwait?</strong></p>
<p>Tamara is the leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) player in the MENA region. Our core offering is enabling customers to split their payments at checkout, completely interest-free. For merchants, Tamara offers seamless integration with existing processes and ultimately an increase in key metrics such as average order value, conversion, and purchase frequency. Crucially, our service is also risk-free &ndash;partners receive the full purchase price up-front excluding a commission while their customers enjoy paying over time. The entire organization was built from the ground-up during COVID-19, offering seamless payments and facilities in a market that was quickly shifting its focus towards FinTech and the future of payments, so we have always prioritized careful and sustainable growth. In the two years since launch, we have quickly grown from Saudi Arabia to the UAE, with millions of customers and more than 3,500 merchants using our services. Kuwait as a market is a logical extension for us and the next step in Tamara&rsquo;s growth journey.</p>
<p><strong>What has been the reception of this model in Kuwait compared to other markets that Tamara operates in?</strong></p>
<p>Financial literacy is an important component of what we do. For Kuwait and the greater GCC region, the concept of saving is important, so we want to educate our customers while also widening access to the latest payments products. For example, if one receives a specific amount of cash or income every month, they can start saving and utilize Tamara as a way to support their long-term financial goals. We must work to educate the market, and the youth will pick up on this quickly once they start utilizing our platform. We are also proud to be sharia compliant. Looking at the banks in the Kuwaiti market specifically, those that are capturing new segments and target audiences are Islamic sharia banks. For example, Boubyan Bank has done a fantastic job in capturing the youth and promoting the concept of Islamic sharia as something which is cool and tech savvy.</p>
<p><strong>What is your assessment of the fintech regulations in Kuwait, and how do they help Tamara develop its operations?</strong></p>
<p>At Tamara, we work very closely with governments to not only benefit from existing initiatives, but also to help shape the future of regulation in the fast-moving payments industry. For example, Tamara started in Saudi Arabia and acquired a license to operate as part of the FinTech regulatory sandbox, and we did the same thing in the UAE &ndash; this has been critical to our success. In Kuwait, there are many FinTech companies on the rise, and the start-up scene is booming. It is still a young landscape with significant opportunities. The players that come into the market post COVID-19 and manage to gain a solid foothold in the market will see success in the region in the next five to 10 years. There are many great examples of start-ups, such as Floward, which was initiated in Kuwait and grew internationally. That is a successful and great example of the start-up scene in Kuwait.</p>
<p><strong>How would you distinguish Tamara from its competitors in the payment and fintech sectors?</strong></p>
<p>We recently fully established and incorporated a company on the ground and plan to go live soon with our full operations in Kuwait. We are ahead of the game in terms of the competition. On the merchant side, our unique partnership approach emphasizes growing together and offering an unparalleled level of support to every business that works with us, whether they are a multinational retailer or small e-commerce startup. Something else that distinguishes us is the combined experience of our team. We have more than 50 nationalities working in Tamara, with more than 200 employees globally. We work on a hybrid model whereby most of our teams work remotely, and some go to the offices. Being a youth-driven company, we know what we need and aspire to deliver that.</p>
<p><strong>How important is Kuwait to Tamara&rsquo;s global portfolio of operations?</strong></p>
<p>A payments player that is strong, understands the market, can support, facilitate, and provide different products for the market, and actively supports different communities is key for a strong post-COVID-19 recovery in Kuwait. We hope to be that player and take care of all needs and all segments of Kuwaiti society.</p>
<p><strong>What trends do you see driving BNPL forward in the region, particularly in Kuwait?</strong></p>
<p>The trend will grow toward having fast cash disposal in your hand and a seamless experience whereby payment platforms can immediately onboard and facilitate customers. We facilitate this by having a quick KYC process online and a seamless operation for the customer to click and get their item as soon as possible without any friction.</p>
<p><strong>What are Tamara&rsquo;s priorities for the next six to nine months?</strong></p>
<p>We see ourselves as a win-win solution for all segments of society, whether it is the customer or the merchant getting more revenues, especially at times where customers are not spending as much as they used to. We offer flexibility to our employees with a remote work model, we are conscious of their lifestyle and want them be happy. We aspire to support society and promote financial literacy to all segments, particularly the youth graduating from university. We want to instill the concept that they need to save money for a rainy day &ndash; Tamara can be their support system to purchase low-ticket items. We aim for a long-term presence within the market, and would like to work with local universities in Kuwait to facilitate and provide courses, lectures, and workshops on financial literacy. We seek to work with the government and private sector to identify areas to bolster financially conscious spending and defining a framework that supports innovation in Kuwait. I strongly believe in Tamara&rsquo;s mission, and that is why I decided to join the company. As a team we aim to support the economies and societies and educate our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>ADINOVA sells sewing machines, fabrics, and haberdashery among other products, but what prompted you to create a textile company in Angola?</strong></p>
<p>Along with food and shelter, clothes are one of our most basic necessities. As long as human civilization exists, the need for clothing will remain. There is a big gap in the Angolan market, as textiles are being sold at extremely high prices and there is no way that any local producer can buy the products, make garments, and sell them locally at a reasonable price.<br />As an established entrepreneur I understand this business and creating a supply chain was a natural progression. This is where Adinova comes in - to supply quality machinery, fabrics, and accessories at an affordable price.</p>
<p><strong>Who are your main clients and strategic partners in the country?</strong></p>
<p>Every textile distributor has dream customers they would like to land. It is essential to first understand your current customers, what they seek and why. Understanding this gives an insight into gaining new customers. We have a wide range of clients from large-scale garment factories and garment manufacturers to mid -size and micro industries. These small -scale tailoring shops often operate from smaller premises but supplement the income raised and play a significant role in the economy of developing countries. Our aim is to provide our customers with equipment, raw materials and technical know-how which is easily available to them all under one roof. We are committed in providing total customer satisfaction, both external and internal with quality products and services conforming at all times to clearly established company norms.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing quality local talent in the market?</strong></p>
<p>Currently the garment manufactures in Angola are solely concentrating on the production of Work wear and Uniforms. However, we believe that the textile sector in Angola has an immense potential in fashion, sports and daily wear. There are talented designers here who can create a diverse range of clothing from hi end fashion to sports, from lingerie to daily wear which will play a huge part in the growth of this sector. Angola imports over USD300 million worth of finished clothing, per year, we can provide the market with a wide range of fabrics, machinery and technical support to help the market reach self -sufficiency and in-turn reduce dependency on importation and support development of products &ldquo;Made in Angola&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>You have participated in the FILDA event for a number of years. How does this event help the company to grow nationally and internationally?</strong></p>
<p>International Fairs provide a unique networking platform and have helped us in promotion, marketing and publicity efforts. FILDA has provided Adinova with a platform for conducting business on a national and international scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Given the current logistics crisis, how have the changes in transportation prices and distribution affected the company?</strong></p>
<p>Put simply, transportation affects the price of goods because it is a key component in a supply chain. Higher freight costs affect every aspect of this chain, which in turn affects what companies must charge for goods to break even or make a profit. While there isn't necessarily a one-to-one correlation between higher freight charges and higher consumer costs, there's certainly a relationship. With freight costs up, companies must make up for that increase, and they generally will pass those increases on to the consumer. One of the measures undertaken by us to offset the increase in transportation costs and maintain our prices is negotiating vigorously with our suppliers, and buying in bulk to pass on these benefits to the customer. Another measure implemented by us is revising packaging and product design to reduce weight and increase shipment density to maximize transportation costs.</p>
<p><strong>You have mentioned that when you entered the sector, prices were incredibly high and that you're trying to change this. What actions should be taken within this sector in other to strengthen the local economy?</strong></p>
<p>Angola is a country that has emerged from civil war, but it is still economically one of the best countries to be in right now. &nbsp;Countries that import clothes suffer from loss of jobs and a lack of independence in production. At the level of strengthening the local economy, the direct benefits include improved economies, increased GDP and more employment. Setting up an increased number of training centers to educate the labor force, provides direct and indirect employment and improves growth and income which in turn improves the economy of the country. We work closely with the government, suppling equipment for these institutes and fabrics for the public sector. We also supply Communities and NGOs with machines which lead to financial independence.</p>
<p><strong>How would you convince foreign investors to come to Angola and exploit a textile sector of considerable potential? </strong></p>
<p>Regarding foreign investors, this is certainly the right time to enter the country that's screaming for foreign investment. Competition is healthy, in what is effectively a virgin market. Angola is still a country of opportunity and foreign investment would bring in the capital needed to enhance the local industries, boosting infrastructure and productivity and creating employment opportunities in the process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you introduce Aljazira Capital to our readers?</strong></p>
<p>Aljazira Capital (&ldquo;AJC&rdquo;) is the investment arm of Bank AlJazira (&ldquo;BAJ&rdquo;). It is a full-fledged investment bank, licensed by the Capital Markets Authority (&ldquo;CMA&rdquo;) to conduct all regularized securities business activities in Saudi Arabia. We started as a brokerage house for the Saudi market; we were, in fact, amongst the first in Saudi. We maintained leadership in the brokerage market for several years, and still operate as a prominent broker in KSA, holding position among the top five brokers in terms of market share despite the fierce competition and increasing number of players. More importantly, we have a clear vision and plan to expand our product offerings, in brokerage and other business line, to achieve the aimed diversification of the organization&rsquo;s products and services. We are particularly keen to expand on the asset and wealth management side, providing proper and diversified investment solutions. In such as a striving effort, AJC started to facilitate transactions across a much wider value propositions that were formerly exclusive or catered for by specific players in the market.. This will allow us to enhance the well-being of targeted client segments by supporting their investment needs for the coming years. As such, We have a long term commitment towards our clients&rsquo; needs, at the heart of which is transparency. Therefore, &nbsp;we consider investing in step with our clients as our root philosophy. I assumed the position of CEO back in March 2021, and my particular interest is to expand into additional business lines and support the team&rsquo;s activities to position AJC as the prominent diversified Islamic Investment Capital of KSA that offers integrated investment solutions to our clients. Hence, we intend to maintain our position as a leading brokerage house, and to capitalize more on the digital side of the business. We are, also, keen to innovate and come up with new solutions in other business lines that meet the diverse needs of our clients and will allow us not only to consolidate, but also expand our market position.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In the local market, what important projects have you completed and what do you have in the pipeline?â€¨</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on diversifying our investment solutions, which is focused on the local and international arena. To achieve this objective, we decided to pursue a comprehensive investment program and commenced its execution in Q4, 2021. In formulating our investment strategy, we defined particular segments of interest to focus on. In the Asset Management space, we have launched one of the unique real estate development Private fund aiming to develop residential units in Riyadh in partnership with Mohammed &amp; Mosab Abdullah Alajlan Investment Company (&ldquo;Alajlan Riviera&rdquo;). We&mdash;as a financial institution&mdash;are committed to the development of the housing sector in KSA, in-line with Vision 2030 initiatives. In addition, we are the first and perhaps the only financial institution to have introduced an asset backed sale-leaseback transaction where the underlying assets are local gas stations: this was over a USD100 million transaction with the Saudi Automotive Services Co. (&ldquo;SASCO&rdquo;), one of the most respected listed companies. There are numerous reforms concerning gas stations and their maintenance. Accordingly, we identified this as a great opportunity for our investors. I would also draw your attention to two recent transactions in strategic and prime locations in Riyadh involving multi-purpose buildings, confirming our commitment to the local real estate market and asserting our position as a pioneer company in local real estate investments. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In the Advisory space, we were the Financial Advisor, Lead Manager, Bookrunner and Underwriter for the IPO of Naqi Water Company in Saudi Stock Exchange, the Kingdom&rsquo;s first bottled water production company to go public on the Saudi Stock Exchange Main Market. We were also appointed by Alajlan Riviera as a Financial Advisor for its planned IPO in the Saudi Stock Exchange. This exemplifies our activities in the local market during 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How are you working to expand your business beyond national borders?</strong></p>
<p>Internationally, we have concluded a transaction to acquire seven Built to Suit logistics assets in the US, leased to FedEx Ground Package System Inc. for around 15 years. Moreover, we have offered our clients an opportunity to participate in an income generating, asset backed opportunity in agricultural finance in Australia. These two investment opportunities will give our clients exposure to international income generating investments with attractive cash distributions. Meanwhile, we have about 10 international deals in the pipeline that are perfectly in tune with our diversification strategy, and that include Pre-IPO, private credit, leasing, venture capital and real estate opportunities. At AJC, we do not act as a distributor of investment opportunities presented to us by other international investment houses. Alternatively, we identify unique investment opportunities, underwrite them and later invite investors to participate in these investments. Our main focus is the US markets and to some extent the UK market. We are also looking closely at the GCC region as opportunities are developing extremely quickly in the region.</p>
<p><strong>How do you educate your existing and potential partners regarding your services and solutions?â€¨</strong></p>
<p>As far as market education is concerned, technology is helping us considerably to reach and communicate with our clients and partners. We have designed a program called &ldquo;10+&rdquo; that caters to the mass and affluent segments alike. The program is about enhancing the financial and business knowledge to meet the common need of the society. The name &ldquo;10+&rdquo; comes from the idea that we want people to start investing at least 10 percent of their income at an early stage. These are the solvent and defining roles of the themes of &ldquo;10+&rdquo;. We intend to make &ldquo;10+&rdquo; digital platform ready by Q4, 2022. Clients, through this digital platform, can get on-boarded and start investing. Online contact will be available with relationship managers and investment advisors. There will also be a tailor-made service to advise clients on how to virtually invest their money throughout their journey. As part of our commitment to the educational component, we have hired a special team not only to develop the digital platform, but also to educate community about our service. &nbsp;The educational component is fundamental, we are building a strong network involving universities, government institutions, and foundations.</p>
<p><strong>What is the main target set in your agenda for the short term? </strong></p>
<p>My first priority is the focus on diversification of products and services offered through AJC. We are also re-visiting our approach to the market, designing and launching new initiatives for the local and international markets. Meanwhile, we will continue to cultivate our human capital. It is important for me that our people are comfortable working with us, motivated and enthusiastic. Second, we want to remain among the leading investment banks that employ financial technology houses in Saudi Arabia. And third, we will continue to confirm that we are always there for our clients. We want to enhance and boost the way we communicate with our clients and the wider community.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has your company evolved over its 15 years in business, and which projects have stood out? </strong></p>
<p>I established the company in 2006. At the time I was working in San Francisco and returned to Spain and set up the office. In the architecture sector, it is difficult to get clients to notice you at the outset. Ultimately, you can only showcase your abilities with completed projects to convince potential clients that you are a viable option. It is important to keep in mind that it takes three or four years from the time you start planning a project to the time you finish it. Fortunately, the demand for projects that reach the office is so high that it gives me the opportunity to choose the ones in which I am most interested in working, especially large villas. In the beginning, it is normal to start working for family and friends. Word of mouth is fundamental. In 2008, the financial crisis hit hard in Spain, and the demand for projects slumped. There were many architects for a few projects. That situation made everything more difficult, but we managed to sustain our momentum. The evolution of the firm has been on the rise since 2012. Each year has been better than the previous one since then. Many of the projects are single-family detached homes, and this is where our flagship projects are. Our firm has been working on multi-family housing work, especially over the past five years, as there has been demand in the market. Currently, we are seeing much increase for real estate in the island being driven by investment funds that are seeing Mallorca as a great destination for investment. We have designed numerous projects for promoters, investment funds, and private clients, from Mallorcan families to elite athletes or internationally successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>How did COVID-19 affect your demand for projects and the overall real estate sector of the island? </strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, work has increased. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreigners have been all the more eager to live on an island in the sun. They want to have a garden, a swimming pool and live in a place where they can do outdoor sports. We have seen a lot of interest from foreigners to have their second home here. There are many foreigners who work in England or Germany during the week and then come to their second home in Mallorca for the weekend. And this situation has only grown with remote working. In fact, remote working has made many of these second homes into first homes. Because of COVID-19, there is now considerable demand for houses with outdoor spaces, gardens, and a place to work. Videoconferencing means that people require a separate space to work. These are some of the things we are looking at today.</p>
<p><strong>What types of architectural designs are more sought after in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is becoming a hub for architecture and design in Spain, given the availability of funds for investment and innovation. Among the 300 most significant architectural firms in Spain, many are located in Mallorca. There is much potential to develop the island, and what people are looking for with these properties is exclusivity. There is also heavy demand for integrated home automation services that allow residents to set devices such as air-conditioning or heating remotely as they board a plane. In Mallorca, there is now a push toward building more sustainably, and from our firm we want to provide more sustainability options in the house. Fortunately, regulations are increasingly focused on sustainability. Secondly, an important factor is the guild&rsquo;s responsibility to advance sustainability issues. Sustainability should be implicit in good architecture. Another factor is technology, as houses have evolved significantly in terms of home automation, and insulation for heat conservation, and ecological illumination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Garrit Lab, and what sets it apart from other studios in the sector?</strong></p>
<p>Garrit Lab is an architecture studio bringing a new concept to Mallorca&rsquo;s construction landscape. I not only focus on designing projects, but also work on providing maquettes to the clients, to give them a proper feel of the space and scale, and also experimenting with the trend of including parametric architecture to my design. I also spent several years working in a construction company, where I have learned the ins and outs of a site. For example, the investment has to be higher in the beginning, so that the monthly cost gets to be much lower when the house is finished. Many clients are asking how they can make their houses less humid and have lower energy costs, like in the case of passive houses, which uses about 10W as opposed to typical houses using about 150W. Another important feature of my work I place an emphasis on is not only thinking about a project in 2D. With a model, you can express the volumes, spaces, and the relationship between these spaces. To envision the final outcome, it is easier and faster to do an online rendering, and details can be changed with a click. On the other hand, doing a physical model is much more complicated, but much more comprehensive. For example, in Mallorca the land is often uneven, and it might be difficult for the builder, the client, and even the bricklayer to understand or envision the different spaces with a 2D rendering. There are many tools that allow you to work with 3D quickly and have a result that anyone can understand, but I am trying to differentiate myself from others by working with 3D, renders, and physical models. Many architectural offices use models as a post-construction object when a building is finished; but I try to implement is as part of the process.</p>
<p><strong>How do you conceive the concept of sustainability in your projects? </strong></p>
<p>Sustainability can be seen in multiple ways. There are many foreign clients who talk about sustainability and want to do something &ldquo;green&rdquo;; however, they bring in carpentry from back home, or they order huge windows, which have to be cooled in summer, and end up using more energy. Being sustainable starts with using zero-kilometer materials and understanding the house as a machine, in which the less consumption you have, the better it will be, all the while making sure it is a beautiful house. What differentiates an architect from an engineer and a quantity surveyor is this more aesthetic part.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give someone considering buying a house in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>In architecture, Mallorca has a bit of everything. If you walk through the most touristy areas, the architecture there does not have a stamp, so to speak. It is all about understanding the true identity of Mallorca, its climate, the different areas of the island, and, more than a direct aesthetic style, understanding spaces and knowing how to take advantage of the seasons that Mallorca experiences throughout the year. Budget naturally plays a great role and doing thorough research on the clients&rsquo; desired lifestyle is key. A visible trend we are witnessing lately is restoring townhouses and rural properties, where architects not only need to preserve the style, but also require creativity and resourcefulness to keep as many of the initial items of the house intact. These properties require greater dedication and for me personally are more interesting, space restrictions become inspiration and open new possibilities. As an example, about a year ago, an old townhouse in the center of the island was renovated for about EUR1.5 million and then resold for EUR4.5 million; the architects dedicated a great deal of time, took great care of the original details and restored it to a more Mallorcan brand.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has GRAS Reyn&eacute;s Architecture Studio influenced the architectural scene of Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>My father and great-grandfather were architects, and we have been working for three generations not only in Mallorca, but also on the other islands of the Balearics and in Spain. Our brand has been growing alongside the rapid development of Mallorca as an investment destination for real estate. Before I started my practice in Mallorca and Spain, I lived and worked abroad in the Netherlands for five years and learned many other aspects of the job abroad. When I came here, I had a different mindset. I am proud of my family heritage and the great group of architects that work at our studio. The name is not completely linked to me; it is a brand. I pride myself on being the leader and CEO of the group, but there are other great talents here as well. GRAS - Reyn&eacute;s Architecture Studio is a young company doing architecture in Mallorca that brings value.</p>
<p><strong>How is the portfolio of GRAS - Reyn&eacute;s Architecture Studio changing as Mallorca receives growing interest from investors? </strong></p>
<p>Our core business is in Mallorca, and the island has seen great momentum since 2010. I have seen exponential growth in quantity, quality, and the concepts of what is happening locally. When I first started, we were mostly doing high-end residential, mostly single villas, which is a core business in Mallorca. However, in the last few years major international players have come to the island. Now, we have projects for villas and highend villas in Calvi&agrave; and other premium locations as well as larger projects like hotels for international brands such as Virgin Limited Edition. We are working with Virgin on two hotels. Another important project for us is the Plaza Gomila development in the west of Palma, where a client is investing in seven buildings that will focus more on lifestyle options, with restaurants and other facilities.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent have you noted greater demand for projects in other fields? </strong></p>
<p>In terms of sports, we have been engaged in the tennis project Country Club by Emotions Group. In connection with that project, we are developing the hotel that will serve Country Club. It is a new hotel focused on sports because of the location on the other side of the Mallorca tennis club. GRAS - Reyn&eacute;s Architecture Studio is working on tennis, golf, and pools. Recently, we were contacted for a horseback riding club. Architecture is a reflection of society, and society today is more into the outdoors, sports, and nature, and our studio is capturing that trend.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see international investments taking shape in the island? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is a consolidated area. It is not easy to find bargains, and we still see many investors coming in. Most of our projects are not new builds; they are restoring existing buildings or demolishing old buildings and building new ones. Most of these buildings are 40 years old, so they need refurbishments, and there is a big business opportunity there. Soon, there will be an opportunity to convert old hotels into housing, and there is a cyclical economy emerging in this direction.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent do you see international trends in design and construction taking place in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>For example, in Mallorca we have a project in Gomila where the same investor buys buildings and mixes the profiles of residents, from young and old to families and singles and less expensive and more expensive, all mixed together. Such unique concepts have been brought in mainly by foreign investors. Additionally, there is a debate in Mallorca on the topic of vertical building. It would be a good time for Mallorca to start allowing more vertical building taking into consideration environmental issues and the overall harmony of the island to tackle at once sustainability and the housing shortage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the island evolved in terms of design and know-how in architecture? </strong></p>
<p>I started working in Mallorca in the 1970s. At that time, the architecture of isolated housing was basic. In the early 1980s, the tourist boom began, which led to the construction of large buildings and hotel complexes, generally facing the sea. Urban planning regulations were later regulated, becoming more restrictive and ecological and regulating single- and multi-family residential typologies and mandating the minimum size of plots and the maximum buildable area on them. All this caused an increase in the value of the land and also became more restrictive. Today, single-family houses more than 20 years old are being demolished in order to build new houses on the same plots in line with global demand that has made Mallorca today a pioneer in terms of architecture, design, interior design, and construction, all at the level of the best economies in the world. To this end, the entire construction industry has caught up with new demands and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>How would you assess the presence of the Miguel Arenas brand throughout the island of Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>The presence of the Miguel Arenas brand is evident in the more than 800 projects carried out between Mallorca and Ibiza in our 52 years of work. Our typology is varied, featuring the new Endesa offices in Palma de Mallorca (25,000sqm of construction), the first building of 60 houses in the marina of Ibiza Nueva, multi-family housing in the form of villages such as the Marina de Malgrats complex, and Valle Dorado, both on the seafront. In the 1970s, the College of Architects selected the 10 best works done in Mallorca, of which three were by me: a single-family home in Cas C&aacute;tala, a single-family home in Costa d&eacute;n Blanes, and a multi-family building in Palma. In the 1990s, I was already a pioneer of the avant-garde design today called &ldquo;open plan,&rdquo; with double heights and large windows. It maximizes the spectacular views and is fully integrated into the wonderful landscape in which it is located. In Mallorca, most of my works can be found in the southwest of Mallorca, Calvi&agrave; and Puerto de Andraxt. In addition, we have rehabilitated historic buildings such as Es Casat Nou, in Puigpunyent, with a completely avant-garde interior design, while protecting the whole monumental building.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent has COVID-19 boosted interest in the Mallorcan real estate market? </strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has changed habits and the way of living and working around the world. Years ago, in Mallorca there was a change with an influx of foreign families who decided to create their new homes on this wonderful island. One of the few great things that the pandemic has taught us is that face-to-face meetings are not always necessary and that technological tools allow us to work at home. This has changed the model from Mallorca being people&rsquo;s second homes to being their first. Consequently, housing needs will be different not only in homes, but also their surroundings. At the same time, homes will need to be more spacious. Logically, the budget of this approach to housing will be higher than before, but there is no doubt the quality of life with this new approach to life will be infinitely better than the past.</p>
<p><strong>What would be your prospects for the development of the architectural business in Mallorca in the coming years? </strong></p>
<p>I sincerely believe the prospects for the architecture business and its environment in Mallorca in the coming years are extremely promising. Our sector is perfectly capable and prepared to take on this challenge. Today, there is a high level of professionalism in our work not only at a project level but also at the execution level. The projects are developed in multidisciplinary teams, with a high level of demand and quality. If we are also able to protect this landscape, Mallorca will be a reference for the high standard real estate sector, worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>With more than 50 years in the construction sector in Mallorca, how has the company&rsquo;s project portfolio evolved? </strong></p>
<p>Each and every one of the projects that Siles has carried out has made us one of the leading companies in our sector today. From large residences, multi-family, single-family, luxury, and regular homes to unique projects, health centers, hotels, and warehouses, they have all made us the leading company in our sector. Siles Construcciones is a family business that was founded by my father-inlaw, Pedro Siles Davia. It has been operating for 40 years now, and it has transformed from a family business into a modern company, with management and control systems and state-of-the-art technology. We are in the third generation, and both my sons are architects and on the management team. We want it to continue to be a family business, because the family business fabric is extremely important in Mallorca.</p>
<p><strong>What characteristics mark the current demand for new construction in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>The search for an excellent and sustainable product today is in fashion. However, within this line of seeking sustainability and the best product, clients increasingly seek quality and adherence to the budget and deadline. That is what we seek to achieve in every project. That is why our slogan is: &ldquo;Siles Construcciones. We comply.&rdquo; We comply with the maximum in quality, the deadline, and the budget. Every day, customers seek higher quality, tighter deadlines, and greater demands in terms of products of higher standing and greater sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the main advantages of investments in real estate in Mallorca, especially by foreigners? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is the Miami of Europe. Because we are accessible from all of Europe, and we have an extremely attractive climate zone for Europe. We also have everything one is looking for: a great climate, safety, excellent infrastructure, and all kinds of services of high quality and without excessive costs. Mallorca is attractive to all foreigners.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for further implementation of sustainable practices by the construction sector? </strong></p>
<p>At the moment, everything to do with sustainability and an increase in quality is booming. All the projects now surpass the previous one in terms of sustainable characteristics, the implementation of improvements in quality, and the final product. This is already the case, and in our action protocol we adjust accordingly. In fact, our seals for quality in the environment, in ISO 14001, are focused on actions within our protocol with continuous improvement in sustainability and quality.</p>
<p><strong>What projects in Siles Construcciones can we expect in the short term, and what innovative features do they bring to the island? </strong></p>
<p>The fundamental thing is that we will continue along the same lines in luxury residential, family, public works, health centers, and hotels because we have the divisions within our construction company to serve each segment. In terms of things that are improving, these relate to our differentiating factor: the design, character, and qualities that we provide. We ensure continuous improvement in quality and new concepts of habitat and life. After the pandemic, the vision of people&rsquo;s lives have changed. We want better homes, more open spaces, and a different kind of life. The pandemic has shown that people need much better homes, with other differentiating characteristics than what we were used to. Now, we want more open spaces, with outdoor terraces, more shared common areas, and, above all, more open air. Historically, areas such as Palma and Port d&rsquo;Andr&aacute;tx have always been in great demand; however, now areas like Alcudia, Pollen&ccedil;a, and Cala d&rsquo;Or are seeing unique projects that are extremely attractive to foreign buyers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>With more than 25 years working in the yachting business in Mallorca, how would you describe the evolution of the island as a yachting destination, especially after COVID-19? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca used to be more like a parking spot for large yachts, which used to head to the south of France, Corsica, and Sardinia. That has changed significantly in the last few years. There was a regulatory change in Spain that allowed yachts to charter in national waters without paying the so-called registration tax. This created an increase in large yachts coming to Spain, specifically the Balearic Islands. Many owners are coming to Mallorca as a destination and not only as a repair and refitting base, which has always been strong in Palma. After COVID-19, there was a large increase in yacht sales and yacht charters, because many people see them as being a safe home. 2022 looks extremely promising. Camper &amp; Nicholsons International has many charter bookings, and sales figures of yachts over 24m almost doubled in 2021 globally. This year should be a fantastic year for the nautical industry and for Mallorca. Camper &amp; Nicholsons International is a long-standing business in yachting brokerage.</p>
<p><strong>What does the island mean for the company&rsquo;s business? </strong></p>
<p>Camper &amp; Nicholsons International has been on the island for about 35 years now and is committed to promoting Mallorca as a destination for large yachts. Mallorca is a fantastic destination that offers something different than the south of France. Our company is seeing interest in Mallorca grow by the day. Numbers of large yachts coming to Spain for the summer have tripled, a development that our company is pleased to have contributed in terms of pushing for the change in legislation and allowing these yachts to come here and enjoy what the islands have to offer. Also, as a company, we are seeing clients coming from all over the world to Mallorca: northern Europeans, Americans, and Middle Eastern. Now, Asian yacht owners are also increasingly visiting Mallorca.</p>
<p><strong>How is the Palma Super Yacht Show contributing to further placing Mallorca on the map of the super yacht industry? </strong></p>
<p>The Palma Super Yacht Show is a part of the Palma International Boat Show, which has been operating for six or seven years now. Before, the Palma Boat Show was a show of small boats, and we brought in a completely different type of yacht and a completely different clientele to Palma. The show itself brings in many visitors and shows Palma from a different perspective, including its beautiful old town, luxury hotels, quaint boutique hotels, and restaurants, all located near the show area in the city center.</p>
<p><strong>What is your opinion on the future of Mallorca and its potential to further develop its yacht industry in terms of both repairs and as a destination? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is becoming increasingly important as well as a base for super yachts and as a home for them, not only as a refit and repair base. There is new infrastructure for super yachts coming up, such as Club de Mar and other existing ones like Port Adriano. Our sector needs to work more and harder on keeping super yachts here and create the right environment and keeps these owners satisfied. We want them to enjoy cruising here and choose to stay here. As a company, we keep pushing hard to promote yachting; at the same time, legislation and the public authorities need to work in the same direction, because if the environment is not favorable for super yachts to come, they will simply choose somewhere else. The economic impact of these large yachts on the local industry is enormous, and they bring a higher quality of tourism to Mallorca. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Port Adriano established a positive reputation among yacht owners coming to Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>Port Adriano was established in 2012 to service both large and small boats, ranging from 6m to almost 90m. Our reputation has a great deal has to do with the location and the infrastructure, as well as the team and the services provided to boats and users. There are many activities in the port like concerts and events all-year round. There is also a retreat facility and a fitness center. Port Adriano has an area for kids and capacity to provide nautical sports activities like paddle surfing and sailing. Port Adriano is like a small city; there are many activities happening here all the time. There are few places in the world where you can go from a place like Menorca to Mallorca or Ibiza within a hundred miles of each other. The close proximity of everything makes it highly attractive.</p>
<p><strong>How did COVID-19 affect Port Adriano in terms of demand, and what changes have you seen? </strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 accelerated the demand for yachts as a way of traveling in a more isolated fashion, and that had a positive impact on the demand for spaces at ports and marinas around the world. That trend was really felt in the Balearics when restrictions were progressively lifted. However, COVID-19 also had a negative impact on our business. Many of our services and businesses like restaurants really struggled. Now, the prospects for 2022 are positive. However, there are many things that have an impact on our industry, especially fuel and electricity prices.</p>
<p><strong>How is Port Adriano working on the island&rsquo;s advancement toward sustainability? </strong></p>
<p>Port Adriano has a geothermal system that provides heat and air conditioning to the entire new commercial area. This system reduces our carbon footprint by 30% approximately. The port also has all the environmental certifications like ISO and EMAS. We are working to have a full plant that will generate energy from waves using a new system by an Israeli company. Preliminary studies have shown that up to 50% of our consumption can be produced by wave power. Also, Port Adriano is the base for silent yachts, which are most advanced solar powered and hybrid solar powered catamarans made by an Austrian company. In 2022, we will also have 5-6m electric charter boats manufactured in the Balearics.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the nautical industry in Mallorca moving forward? </strong></p>
<p>We are a 365-day industry, and more than 60% of the revenue from the Port Authority of the Balearic Islands comes from nautical leisure tourism. Port Adriano is considering technology applications and ways to start and promote a rental or boat share. This is the way the industry will develop further. It is also about fully democratizing the industry. This not only has to do with environment and infrastructure but also the mindset of the new generation. By chartering or being more active in the way we manage our marinas and our space, we will likely continue to see more growth. The Balearic Islands need to make a move in improving the infrastructure for refit facilities, because there are other areas of the world that have made big investments. The Balearics have a unique opportunity to have one of the strongest sectors of refit and repair the world.</p>
<p><strong>What has the expansion of the company been like? </strong></p>
<p>We started with Port Adriano, and we quickly moved to Ibiza. Adriano was a big investment for us, made during the downturn in 2008, and, since then, we have been looking at opportunities to grow. We acquired Port Tarraco in Tarragona two years ago because we felt we could add value. The ownership structure and management there was a good fit. It is a different marina for extremely large yachts plus offices. We also recently acquired 50% of Marina Santa Eul&agrave;lia in Ibiza. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the reasons behind the establishment of the Balearic Marine Cluster? </strong></p>
<p>Balearic Marine Cluster was established in 2019, as the government of the Balearic Islands defines it as a strategic sector to boost the entire nautical industry of the islands. The government commissioned a market study that confirmed the feasibility of creating a cluster and went ahead with it. The Balearic Marine Cluster was created to give more visibility and promote the island as a destination, from training to innovation and the foundations on which it is formed. We have taken political issues out of the equation, so we are only focused on issues of sectoral development. The Balearic Islands have the potential to improve nautical tourism in terms of charters or large yachts and everything related to it in terms of revenue generation for the island, such as the boat maintenance business. The cluster comprises everything that has to do with the marine industry, including charter companies and broker companies. The three basic ways to strengthen and develop a well-established industry across the islands is to innovate, train the workforce, and sell the product overseas.</p>
<p><strong>How is the Balearic Marine Cluster taking forward the promotion of the island as a yacht destination? </strong></p>
<p>Over the years, we have participated in different events such as Monaco Yacht Show, which is one of the main events in the Mediterranean for the mega yacht industry. Every year, we have a stand called Balearic Yacht Destination, which was founded about seven years ago. We travel and carry out interviews with various chambers and clusters, such as those in the south of France, Monaco, and Germany. With the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca, we created the first virtual nautical fair in 2020. In 2021, it was again held again online, though in 2022 it will be an in-person event. Many conferences were held with the participation of many relevant people from the sector, not only locally, but also nationally and internationally with 100-150 people at each conference. They have been a success, according to the feedback received. Now, we are continuing to work with a platform that we have been developing for a year, and we will include these conferences as all the training programs developed with SOS IT and the UIB. However, one issue in the nautical sector is that it is difficult to find talent. As a result, a specific training commission has been created.</p>
<p><strong>How would you compare the infrastructure of ports and marinas in Mallorca compared to other islands in the Mediterranean? </strong></p>
<p>The port of Palma de Mallorca was the place where people went to repair their boats. Around 15-20 years ago, a 50-m boat was considered a super yacht. Nowadays, it is considered a medium-sized yacht. In addition, we have facilities to improve in Mallorca due to the existing boat market. One obvious case in point is the refurbishment of Club del Mar, which is focused on large boats. The island needs to revamp its port infrastructure in order to welcome bigger yachts and the benefits that will come with them and their spillover effect on the local economy.</p>
<p><strong>How are you working to enhance synergy with the tourism sector? </strong></p>
<p>The Balearic Marine Cluster has specific collaborations with the tourism administration of the island to carry out specific promotion activities. There is work being done in the fields of tourism and sustainability, as we have a specific agreement in collaboration with the Institute for Business Innovation of the Balearic Islands (IDI) that will help us to carry out tests to analyze waste produced by the nautical industry. Therefore, we are looking to work on the circular economy. One of the goals of the cluster is to promote public-private collaboration. We act as intermediaries for the companies and collaborate with the Spanish Public Administration, where we present the companies projects of interest.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Mallorca&rsquo;s yachting industry grown in recent years, and how did COVID-19 shape its trajectory? </strong></p>
<p>In the last few years, the naval sector has experienced consistent global growth. Shipyards have seen an increase in orders, especially for bigger yachts. The crisis has strongly affected the smaller yacht sector, which is just starting to recover. The sales of yachts grew considerably in 2020 and 2021. Many yachts were bought and sold, probably because the delivery time was extremely long. People who wanted to buy decided to go directly to the market. The fact that yachts were in ports, needing repairing and maintenance, created high expectations. As for Astilleros de Mallorca, in 2020 and 2021, there was a significant halt in activity. Yachts still needed maintenance, but there was a consistent fall in big projects. People wanted to evaluate the situation before starting more complex projects. The situation is changing in 2022; the stagnant demand from the past two years is driving the market to be stronger than in 2019. The nautical&mdash;and more specifically the ship repairing industry&mdash;will experience significant growth in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>What does Astilleros de Mallorca mean to the industry in Mallorca, and what has been its role in the sector&rsquo;s growth? </strong></p>
<p>Astilleros de Mallorca is an old company with 80 years of experience. Over the years, we have built wood, steel, and merchant ships. In the 1980s, we started building yachts, and in the early 1990s, we started to completely focus on yachts. The path has always been to adapt to changes in the market and look for the most profitable and productive sector possible. This means Astilleros de Mallorca has been the engine behind the yacht repair industry and the status of Mallorca as yacht hub. Currently, we are not the only shipyard, though we are the only one offering it all. We take full responsibility for the work on the yacht, and that makes us unique. Almost 80-85% of our activity is with external companies. We select companies that can carry out the best possible work according to the price and quality that clients want. We have a powerful team on our shipyard that comprises the core of our business and part of our tradition. We work with metal, mechanics, and piping. We maintain this tradition and develop new professionals, which is also important.</p>
<p><strong>What measures is taking Astilleros de Mallorca to comply with the increasing sustainable and green economy standards? </strong></p>
<p>Our department is highly focused on sustainability improvement. We have had environmental certifications for over 15 years, and we also offer to improve the sustainability of yachts that come here. Yachts built 20-30 years ago need to include technological improvements that make them more environmentally friendly. We want to adapt these clients&rsquo; yachts to the new standards. Yachts have a life expectancy of 40-60 years, and the market is still operating on them. There is no reason for them not to adapt to more modern systems found on new yachts. Many clients are interested in this and are ecologically aware. Yachts are not looking for profitability in their usage, which is why it is easier to improve their technology compared to old merchant yachts that prioritize profitability.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges for the island to maintain its privileged positioning in the Mediterranean? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca has a broad perspective in the sector. Its potential and strengths come from an ongoing improvement in services from companies. The challenges we are facing are linked to the dedicated yacht facilities on the island not growing the same way the market is. Other destinations have invested in infrastructures in the last few years to keep up with the increase in yacht length. Our main challenge is to adapt quickly to new demands arising from larger yachts.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess Mallorca&rsquo;s position as a yacht repair destination, compared to other competitors in the Mediterranean?</strong></p>
<p>Being located in the Mediterranean works well for us, as it receives 70% of the world&rsquo;s yacht fleet. Mallorca is an island in the occidental center of the Mediterranean with almost 300km of coast and highly developed services. We have a first-class airport, an amazing climate, and fantastic places to moor. Mallorca&rsquo;s positioning is enviable for repair and recreational business for yachts. Yet, we face some challenges, as many cities abroad are improving their nautical facilities becoming known for their offering.</p>
<p><strong>How does the nautical sector contribute to Mallorca&rsquo;s economy? </strong></p>
<p>This sector is an increasingly important part of the Balearic economy, strongly represented by tourism and industrial services. Specifically, the repair industry is one of the engines for the Balearic economy, generating employment and industrial activity. There has been notable growth in the repair sector, being Mallorca one of the most relevant hub globally. We grew by 220% among repair companies, saw a 300% rise in this sector&rsquo;s workforce and a 250% increase in repair sites. There has also been a growth in the quality and quantity in repairs itself. Yacht repairing deseasonalizes and complements tourist activity, and, therefore, our business is a continuation of the tourism season. We have to consider every boat&rsquo;s yearly usage according to length. We can accommodate up to 100m length in water yacht-repairing and 60-70m length land-based. Yachts of 30-40m require EUR1-2 million per year in maintenance cost, those around 40- 60m require up to EUR2-4 million, 60- 80m require EUR3-6 million, and those longer than 80m require EUR6-10 million per year. Repair, insurance, taxes, consumption, and mooring are 10% of a yacht&rsquo;s purchase value. This is an economic activity that Mallorca is excelling at, and it needs further development. The turning point in Mallorca was 2008. IPM Group bet by expanding to an area of 130,000sqm, an increase in length to 100m for ships and 60m for shafts and weight capacity from 150 to 700 tons for boat repair. There have been both qualitative and quantitative changes. Mallorca is now one of the most important yacht repair center of the world by number of repair centers per square meter, and in term of quantity and quality of the industry, technology, and space.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s makes STP Shipyard Palma a unique model for the development of the nautical industry on the island? </strong></p>
<p>What makes STP Shipyard Palma special is its open model. The company does not undertake repair work. It handles services within its state-of-the-art shipyard. This model makes the specialized repair companies choose our shipyard and yacht owners have a wide offering. For example, STP Shipyard Palma has available to about 30 painting companies, 15 mechanical companies, and 10 electronics enterprises. This model definitely invigorates competition between companies and improves quality while creating more competitive prices. Companies have to continue specializing if they want to compete. This is what has increased the growth of Balearic GDP. This sector has a large multiplier effect on employment and a labor-intensive effect. We handle the hoisting, the launching, the repair space and the coordination. We hold 9001, 14001, and 45001 ISO certification.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges for the development of the industry going forward? </strong></p>
<p>The Balearic government has declared the nautical sector a strategic one. STP Shipyard Palma created a model that contributed significantly to the professionalization of the repair industry in Mallorca; however, the entire Mediterranean is investing in this, which means Mallorca will enter into competition with other destinations. For us, it is mandatory to continue investing, especially in making a transition to sustainability in terms of our infrastructure and capabilities. We need to maintain this quality threshold for rules and handling.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Mallorca evolved as a nautical destination, and how has its popularity among yacht owners grown amidst COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>Over the past seven to eight years, Mallorca has seen high growth as a destination for yachts, especially medium to large vessels. We have a positive advantage, which is our location at the center of the occidental Mediterranean. In addition, in terms of tourism, one key component is that the infrastructure and businesses in the Balearics and Mallorca have been improved greatly in recent years to accommodate such large vessels. The improvements have also reflected in other touristic entertainment like golfing opportunities at our many golf courses, cycling, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>What role do sailing regattas play in the development of Mallorca&rsquo;s nautical sector? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca hosts high-level regattas such as Copa del Rey and Palma, which attract huge audiences from all over. Thanks to Mallorca&rsquo;s many ports and marinas, there is also room to hold racing for smaller boats. Meanwhile, as IPM Group we organize the Ibiza Joysail Regatta, the only competition for super yachts of over 24m that includes an offshore race between Mallorca and Ibiza and races around Ibiza and Formentera. Ibiza is well-known as a fun destination with a great leisure offering. The idea was to create a different, fun, and attractive event that also allows an extremely high quality of participants to enjoy themselves beyond the competitive angle. The 2022 edition will take place from September 22-25, with the perfect blend of sailing and lifestyle at the end of the season in an extremely special destination that has never been used for this kind of events. It promises to offer thrills and fun among owners and their family and friends to enjoy Ibiza in the most relaxed way.</p>
<p><strong>IPM Group has two marinas in Mallorca: Marina Port de Mallorca and Marina Palma Cuarentena. What do these two facilities mean for the inland&rsquo;s overall nautical infrastructure? </strong></p>
<p>These two installations are important for various reasons in terms of the client profile they attract. We wanted to work with mid to high-end clients and provide a great port experience from start to finish. Having an extraordinary team such as ours makes ports or any other business function optimally. Our facilities have been updated, and our focus is on customer experience at our two main locations in Mallorca, both of which are strategically located: Marina Port de Mallorca and Marina Palma Cuarentena. Complementary services at the ports are also a key component of our customer experience, such as shops, restaurants, communication and information centers, rental cars and, of course, golf. Mallorca as a whole has achieved great progress in this regard and has significantly expanded its offering for high-end visitors, and not just yacht owners.</p>
<p><strong>How is IPM Group working for its recreational ports in Mallorca to be more sustainable? </strong></p>
<p>This has been undertaken by ourselves and also by the owners. Our business and the experience of our visitors is essentially based on having clean water. From this, for many years now we have moved to modifying and adapting our facilities with all the environmentally friendly options available in the market, such as solar panels, automated taps, and LED lights. IPM Group has implemented carbon footprint actions to address this issue. Additionally, we believe that much of the work has to do with raising awareness and educating young generations on the importance of protecting the sea for the future of Mallorca. Our aspiration is to have a port that is almost wholly self-sufficient with solar energy and other green components that will set an exemplary example for our industry</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your view of the transport infrastructure on the island in terms of connectivity? </strong></p>
<p>At a general level, the Balearic Islands are extremely well connected to the rest of Europe. It is one of the European regions that quickly recovered its sea and air mobility services despite the challenges faced after COVID-19. In fact, the maritime sector has recovered rapidly. The Balearic Islands have a unique geographical location in the Mediterranean, with excellent weather in the summer. Our islands strongly support the nautical sector, and our ports are unique destinations by themselves, due to the quality of the facilities, being a reference in the Mediterranean Sea. We provide a high-quality service, and there are excellent maintenance services for yachts and boats, as well as repair services for boats. Our regional government manages about 29 ports, and there is also an indirect management by nautical clubs and marinas. Recently, the government has focused on improving the quality of the port facilities under its management. It has worked to improve their services to bridge the gap with those managed by nautical clubs and marina. There have been significant investments from the governments in the ports of the four islands, including 55 different projects for EUR49 million in total. These projects seek to equal the quality of the services. Ciudadela Port, for example, saw a complete revamp.</p>
<p><strong>What work is being done at Ports IB to increase the standard in terms of sustainability? </strong></p>
<p>Ports IB is a self-sufficient regional government company that generates its own resources for its management. There is a study on climate change on Spain&rsquo;s ports that has a view for 2045 and 2100 to evaluate the effects of climate change. It studies the effects of climate change on our ports. In our future plans, we only have investments in the Balearic Islands that take into account the effects of climate change. The region has advanced significantly in this area, having developed an infrastructure project that includes the effects of climate change. According to the study, our facilities are ready for the effects of climate change by 2045, though we have to make other investments to cope with the effects of climate change by 2100. We will have some pioneering facilities to cope with the effects of climate change. One of the goals is to develop new management methodologies to provide services to more individuals without having to significantly expand our current infrastructure. One of our main goals is to democratize access to the sea, making ports available for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>How does your company work to promote the private nautical sector of the island? </strong></p>
<p>We have special coordination with all the business sectors related to the nautical industry. It is important to connect and generate synergies. The nautical sector has sought the government&rsquo;s assistance to educate more young professionals to have the required skills for the sector, from conducting maintenance works to ports management. The first one, the first master&rsquo;s degree in the nautical sector, has been approved and will be offered by the University of the Balearic Islands. In addition, we want to have more people trained in vocational school studies for the nautical industry, while doing the necessary works to improve or facilities. There are those port projects that are being carried out that will contribute to the upscaling of the Balearic Islands as an ideal destination for tourism. People who like sailing must have the capacity to easily reach out to our island and enjoy our nautical sector. This sector has managed to recover quickly and has proved its potential for the long-term growth of the Balearic Islands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Club de Mar-Mallorca, as one of Palma&rsquo;s most emblematic clubs, contributed to the development of the local nautical industry? </strong></p>
<p>Since our founding in 1969, Club de Mar-Mallorca has managed to combine two important aspects in the world of marinas perfectly. First, we have been the vanguard in Mallorca in terms of the development and reception of nautical tourism at the highest level. With an investment of EUR60 million, the major refurbishment of the club, slated to reopen in 2023, is the most important private port work in Spain right now, and it will no doubt make us one of the five most-important marinas in the Mediterranean. Second, at Club de Mar-Mallorca, we place vital importance on the nautical tradition, the feeling of an authentic club, and a great family of people in love with the sea. In fact, we have discovered the perfect combination of nautical tourism and seafaring tradition with the Illes Balears Cl&aacute;ssics Regatta. Every summer, it brings the most beautiful classic boats in the world to our port with their crews. This regatta has turned the club into an international reference point for the classic boat circuit. Club de Mar-Mallorca is currently undergoing remodeling.</p>
<p><strong>What are the objectives of this project, and how is it intended to integrate the club into the city and its surroundings? </strong></p>
<p>The remodeling of Club de Mar-Mallorca will position us alongside other premium sports marinas such as Monaco. Our project has two fundamental parts: we want to accommodate boats up to 170m in length; and we want to update our strategy as a yacht club. We have reduced the number of moorings to give more space to larger boats. We have not left out small boats, although we are more focused on the larger boats, which are more in demand in the Balearic Islands. As part of our update and modernization of the club, we intend to open Club de Mar-Mallorca in the city. We will open our doors and turn our facilities into a place for everyone to enjoy, while reserving an exclusive access area for our members. The club has always distinguished itself by the discretion and familiarity with which we treat all our visitors, whether they are English families on holiday or members of a royal house, as happens every summer. Leisure also plays an important role in our new strategy. Club de Mar-Mallorca has a children&rsquo;s club and nautical sailing and canoing schools. As for catering, the project that we will inaugurate in 2023 includes a new restaurant that will feature a Michelin-starred chef.</p>
<p><strong>How are sustainability and digitalization being included in the modernization project of Club de Mar-Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>The new Club de Mar-Mallorca project will also feature technological and environmental innovations. We have carried out a comprehensive planning of digitalization. Our technical services will have alarms controlled by state-of-the-art technology, for example, the change of filters and revisions. In terms of safety, Club de Mar-Mallorca has been inspired by the work in football stadiums, always at the forefront in this field. We will equip the new facilities with a state-of-the-art surveillance system with AI. As for the boats, the system will integrate cameras that will warn us of arrival, the stay forecast, mooring assignment, and much more. It will be spectacular and offer yacht owners a more fluid and comfortable experience when mooring at Club de Mar-Mallorca. In terms of sustainability, we have made great efforts to ensure the recycling of water and waste, while meeting environmental specifications with high standards. In this respect, we have just renewed our registration in the EMAS Register of the EU for another three years. Our commitment to this environmental certification is clear, so we are also a reference in that aspect for marinas and the entire nautical industry in Mallorca.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Mallorca attractive for the practice sports such as cycling, and how can the island better integrate this sport in its tourism strategy? </strong></p>
<p>The weather of the island is an important factor for cycling. The climate is excellent for riding bikes, and most of the people who come to Mallorca are from the north of Europe, which do not have good weather in autumn and spring. In addition to the weather, another important factor is the different terrain within a few kilometers. One can reach most of the mountains of Mallorca from any hotel. The different terrain in such a short distance is unique. Additionally, cycling can play an important role in contributing to the evolution of tourism in the island. In terms of spending, those who travel to cycle spend more than standard tourists. They stop in different towns during the day, buy things, and have lunch and dinner in different villages, which are usually far away from touristy areas. On top of that, many rent a bike or a vehicle while they are on the island, creating more opportunities for locals. The season for cycling runs from February through June. Then, it falls during summer and picks up again in September and October, which helps the island receive tourists during non-peak season.</p>
<p><strong>How is Mallorca evolving to present itself as a cycling destination, and what role can cycling events play? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca has been doing extremely well thanks to its infrastructure and the complementary services offered on the island such as rental services. There are hotels that are open during the season for cyclists and have adapted their offer to this type of clients. The island&rsquo;s government and the private sector are working together to create the best conditions to transform the tourism sector. Things are changing, and the sector is constantly coming up with new ideas. As for international events, Mallorca has the Challenge Ciclista, which takes place in February. It is an excellent starting point for the island to be better known in the world of cycling. Many cyclists come here and see our routes.</p>
<p><strong>Your store Cycling Planet has become the go to destination in Mallorca for cycle fans. How did you achieve this level of acknowledgment?</strong></p>
<p>Cycling is a sport that has become popular over the last few years, and our store has served to cater to the needs of people that want to keep practicing this sport or get started. We have managed to achieve a great presence via social media, and word-of-mouth has been crucial for us to become such a well-known destination for cyclists on the island. For cyclists, it is normal to stop at places and have a coffee. When we opened this concept of store and bar exclusive for cyclists, it was unique. We are pleased to have achieved such a level of recognition and contributing to make cycling in Mallorca better known.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Throughout his career, he won six ATP titles in singles and another five in doubles. Costa was a member of the Spanish Davis Cup team for six years and participated in the 1996 Olympic Games.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the academy been working to train tennis players for professional competitions? </strong></p>
<p>We have gradually improved to offer an optimum service to the players training here with us not on the tennis side, but also in other areas that are essential, such as fitness training, nutrition, sports psychology, and the application of technology in sport. The initial goal is still the same&mdash;to get the best out of every tennis player&mdash;but with a focus on academics and the human touch. We are extremely proud to have had great success with players such as Casper Ruud (top 10 in the world), Jaume Munar (top 100), and young promising talents that have already won Junior Grand Slam titles, such as Dani Rinc&oacute;n and Alex Eala; however, we are not resting on our laurels, which is why we work every day to continue improving.</p>
<p><strong>How do the different facilities and coaches available at the academy support the journey of the next generation of elite tennis players? </strong></p>
<p>For us, it was essential to have a firstclass technical team that could teach young players the training methodology that has worked so well in Rafael Nadal&rsquo;s career. That is why Toni&rsquo;s role as director is extremely important, as are experienced coaches from the tour such as Gabriel Urp&iacute;, Joel Figueras, Marc G&oacute;rriz, Joan Bosch, Tomeu Salv&aacute;, and Gustavo Marcaccio. As far as the facilities go, we have grown to the point of having two tennis and sports centers of a worldclass standard. We recently opened a new building with seven new covered clay courts, three indoor hard courts, a new gym, and a modern medical center for elite athletes.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for the academy to be located on Mallorca, and how does it relate to the island&rsquo;s growing sports tourism business? </strong></p>
<p>We never considered building the academy anywhere other than Mallorca. It made all the sense in the world to have it here, as Rafa wanted to be involved in the day-to-day work on the project. Also, it is where he trains and comes every day to use the facilities such as the tennis court, gym, spa, and so on. The fact that the academy is in Mallorca also means the Nadal DNA is present and that Toni can be involved in the management. It also achieves another of Rafa&rsquo;s goals, which was to give Manacor international visibility and generate tourism and employment for Mallorca and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p><strong>How can Mallorca better integrate sports tourism into the island&rsquo;s promotion and development strategy? </strong></p>
<p>At the academy, we have worked on deseasonalizing sports tourism, which always used to happen in the summer months. As well as providing services to the 150 young tennis players at the academy, we have a sports tourism center with 67 rooms where adults and families that travel to Mallorca all-year round to take our tennis programs can stay. We offer a package that is extremely attractive in fitness, tennis, and leisure. All of this happens in idyllic surroundings close to the sea. In addition, we organize tennis tournaments throughout the year that attract many players and fans of the sport. Another fundamental pillar is the Rafa Nadal Museum, which is located on the premises of the academy and attracts 50,000 visitors per year.</p>
<p><strong>How is the Rafa Nadal Academy supporting the further practice of sports in other countries? </strong></p>
<p>By means of these projects, Rafa wants to leave an important legacy, and not only for tennis fans close to Mallorca. That is why our second academy in the world is located in Kuwait, because the goal is to help grow the sport in the Middle East and for more people to become fans of tennis. In the same way, we have created a concept called the Rafa Nadal Tennis Center so that fans around the world can enjoy tennis as well as their holidays in first-class resorts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

<p>Arabella Golf Mallorca is a subsidiary of Arabella Hospitality, and we chose Mallorca as a strategic enclave for the development of our golf, hotel, and real estate activities. Here, we operate four golf courses with 63 holes. Arabella relies on its location in Palma, in an urban area in which it also owns two five-star hotels managed by Marriott, ensuring an unparalleled environment for the convenient enjoyment of golf. On top of that, Arabella is the largest golf resort in Spain with four completely different courses, each with its own personality and character. The golf experience that we offer is extensive. Tourism and golf have an enriching association in three main areas. One is that it is seasonality, where peak occupation of golf courses is in spring and autumn. The second is that it is a tremendously transversal sector creating value for transportation, restaurants, consumption, retail, accommodation, and numerous other areas. Third, it creates quality employment. Around 95% of our workers from the sector in Mallorca have permanent employment. For these three reasons, golf is essential to the economic health of Mallorca. Arabella benefits from this close relationship. The abovementioned hotels, Castillo Hotel Son Vida and the Sheraton Mallorca Arabella Golf Hotel, are largely occupied in spring and autumn by golfers. We provide golf courses, family offers, and packages for groups of friends. And in March, April, May, September, October, and November, the vast majority of customers are golfers.</p>
<p><strong>How do your golf courses adapt to the wide range of golfers visiting Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>Our facilities include different types of course, starting with a &ldquo;golf nursery&rdquo; called Golf Son Quint Pitch + Putt, where players, after learning how to hit balls, start to play. There are nine very short holes between 60 and 90m in length. People can start practicing there, and thanks to the increasing popularity of golf and our competitive prices for this course, it is full every weekend. In addition, we have Golf Son Quint, which is a fun course on an open layout without many challenging obstacles. It is also available at an affordable price. Next is Golf Son Vida course, a traditional course and the oldest in Mallorca, and among the oldest in Spain&mdash;in fact, it hosted two European Tour Events. And finally Golf Son Muntaner is a course that belongs to European Tour Destination (the only one in Mallorca) where international tournaments can be hosted, which it has indeed done. It is the signature course of the Arabella Group, and a wide, long, and more challenging layout, exquisitely maintained. With no buildings in the neighborhood, it ranks among the top courses in Mallorca, without a doubt.</p>
<p><strong>What is your vision for combining sustainability and golf in both Arabella and Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>Arabella has a dynamic sustainable program called Green Evolution, started five years ago and is based on four pillars inspired by NATO Sustainable Development Goals. We create a series of activities to show that golf is actually environmentally friendly. Contrary to popular belief, in Mallorca golf uses a small percentage of the island&rsquo;s territory, and makes use only of recycled water. When we water the golf course, the water is filtered, we keep the nutrients, and the aquifers are refilled. The land on which our golf courses are located was completely abandoned before, apart from landfills. Today, they are a green, natural environment home to flora and fauna.</p>
<p><strong>What is Mallorca&rsquo;s potential to continue attracting world class golf events? </strong></p>
<p>Mallorca has considerable potential for sports, and proof of this is the many events hosted on the island for tennis, cycling, marathons, or sailing, to name a few. What draws people in are the big names and events. The local authorities have taken note and are actively supporting us. And ultimately this has contributed to the international renown that Mallorca enjoys as a golfing destination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>After COVID-19, what interest in celebrations and events have you seen from foreign people and organizations as a catering provider in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>During the pandemic, one of the most affected sectors was the wedding and event catering sector due to the high number of government restrictions on celebrations of such events. These limitations, in addition to the restrictions on mobility in travel, resulted in almost all events being canceled in 2020, postponing most of them for the coming years. 2021 was somewhat better. Starting from June, restrictions were reduced, and we were able to hold some events while adapting them to the limitations. For the 2022 season, with the improvement of the pandemic situation, we expect a significant increase. The number of reservations has skyrocketed. A large part of this growth is due to the increase in bookings by foreign clients, especially for all the weddings and events that had to be postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>How is Mallorca positioning itself as a destination for weddings among its traditional tourist clientele from Europe? </strong></p>
<p>For a few years now, Mallorca has positioned itself as one of the most popular destinations in the Mediterranean for the celebration of weddings and business events. The excellent weather, plus the convenient air connectivity and the large number of farms and Mallorcan properties in recent years, along with amazing reforms for the celebration of these events, make it an extremely attractive destination. The profile of foreign clients who come to Mallorca to celebrate a wedding is usually one with a medium to high purchasing power. They are extremely attractive clients, not only for catering companies but also for all companies that participate in the celebration of an event, such as hotels, transportation companies, kitchenware, decoration companies, florists, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>How important is AIRE with its culinary offerings of traditional Mallorcan products and the use of local producers in general? </strong></p>
<p>Our policy is to give top priority to using local products. When our kitchen designs the menus, this is a premise that we always keep in mind. Using local products has a number of advantages that benefit the company: pollution is reduced; we help the economy be fairer; local products are tastier; and their nutritional value remains intact. We favor agriculture, livestock, and local gastronomy, as one euro spent on products nearby generates twice as much for the local economy. All these arguments make us great advocates of the consumption of local products.</p>
<p><strong>What prospects do you have for the 2022 season? </strong></p>
<p>The 2022 season looks optimistic. We hope to return to 2019 pre-pandemic numbers&mdash;even surpassing these numbers in some summer months. We want the pandemic to be behind us, and we are able to face the coming years with complete normality and celebrate again with all our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>Chef Marc Fosh is one of Europe&rsquo;s most exciting and creative cookery talents and without doubt one of Britain&rsquo;s most successful culinary exports. He began his culinary career at London&rsquo;s Greenhouse restaurant, before moving on to the Michelin-starred Chelsea Room at the Carlton Tower Hotel. Living and working in Spain since 1991, he developed his own unique style of cuisine focusing on fresh ingredients and quality of produce, to which he adds a touch of inspired genius. The result is a modern, yet simple cuisine with clean tastes and big flavors. In 2002, Marc became the first and only British chef to be awarded a Michelin star in Spain.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was your motivation behind establishing a gastronomy business in Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>I was working in San Sebasti&aacute;n, in northern Spain, which is a celebrated gastronomic destination and was then offered the opportunity to come to Mallorca and open a new hotel. I soon I realized Mallorca was quite an inspiring place to be, located in the middle of the Mediterranean with great produce on your doorstep. My task in Mallorca was, first of all, to understand Mediterranean cuisine and the local ingredients and, then, to develop my own style. When I first came here 28 years ago, Mallorca was a different destination in terms of gastronomy. One of the interesting things, certainly over the past 10 years, has been the realization of the importance of local gastronomy. I opened the Marc Fosh restaurant in Palma 13 years ago, and felt very much in my own in the city. There were not, at that time, any Michelin-starred restaurants in the city. Yet today, Palma has three Michelin-starred restaurants, and the city is starting to develop a very vibrant gastronomic scene.</p>
<p><strong>What role can gastronomy play in the longterm development of the island&rsquo;s tourism industry? </strong></p>
<p>Both the city of Palma and the island as a whole are embracing quality when it comes to tourism. I opened here in 2009, right after the financial crisis, and was afraid of offering a restaurant that felt exclusive. And then a couple of years later, we got the Michelin star and it made us realize that Mallorca could become a culinary destination. When we are promoting tourism and gastronomy, everything trickles down from the top. If we are going to have people traveling to the island for gastronomy, there is a need for high-level restaurants of great appeal, but also for tapas bars and other types of eatery that all together create an attractive culinary offering. The top-end of the market, and the quality tourism, have bounced back quickly since the worst of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>How do you cater to the wide range of tourists that Mallorca receives, while providing a local taste? </strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of Mallorca is that it is an eclectic mix, as there is a large and diverse tourist profile. When we first opened, I think 60% of our clients were probably German, 30% British, and 10% from the rest of the world. Now, we have noticed over the past few years, a much greater diversity. Although every chef will have their own style and way of doing things, I think that if we can give everyone visiting the island a little taste of the local produce, hopefully they can leave having tasted something very personal, and unique to the island with a clearly Mediterranean feel.</p>
<p><strong>What would be your outlook for the future? </strong></p>
<p>Generally, we have a great clientele supporting us in our endeavors, and motivating us to keep pushing forward. I am hoping that over the next five to 10 years we are going to see an acceleration of Mallorca&rsquo;s tendency to attract more quality-oriented tourism. Moreover, seasonality will be less of a factor, too, as all stakeholders involved work to create an appealing year-round offering. Hopefully, then, we can transform Mallorca into a 12-month destination, by ensuring that Palma remains a vibrant city, that also has much to offer for weekend breaks. The cultural and gastronomic dimensions will clearly help with this. And starting with Palma as a 12-month destination, we should be able to extend the success to rest of the island.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did you start a career in the gastronomy sector before eventually becoming one of the bests chefs in Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>It has been a process linked to my family. My parents owned a nightclub, and the ground floor was a restaurant. It was a family business; my brother worked there, and I later joined as a waitress. I subsequently ended up working in the kitchen because I have always enjoyed eating and being surrounded by people. I embarked on culinary studies in University of the Balearic Islands and spent 11 years working off-island every winter because it was low season. During these times, I worked at Michelin-starred restaurants in the US, France, and Asia. This gave me a great perspective of restaurant management, high-end cuisine, and international trends. It was also a wonderful surprise for my own restaurant, Maca de Castro, to receive a Michelin star. The process of starting my own restaurant and gaining such recognition was an extraordinary learning process, and today we are fortunate to be in an incredible location in the north of Mallorca where cuisine is king.</p>
<p><strong>Having been awarded a Michelin star, how does the restaurant contribute to Mallorca&rsquo;s tourism offering? </strong></p>
<p>In Mallorca, every high-end restaurant is located in a different spot. The Maca de Castro restaurant is located in the north, which sees all types of tourists and many foreign residents. As a restaurant, one of our strongest aspects is knowing the products we have locally and offering them through our cuisine. Every outsider is surprised when they realize the huge variety and diversity the island can offer. In terms of tourists, we are used to seeing German and English tourists, though recently we have started to see more Nordic, American, French, and Italian tourists, which is an interesting change for the island in terms of the diversification of its client base. As per the local products, Mallorca has an important role in Mediterranean products. We are located in a favorable place for fruits and vegetables. Mallorca&rsquo;s tradition is again present in the restaurants. We must showcase the true island in order to make people fall in love with it. Therefore, we must continue to value our local products and not import foreign ones if they are available locally. You can quickly realize how different local products are simply by their unique smell.</p>
<p><strong>Which local products would have more demand in a foreign country? </strong></p>
<p>It depends on the season. In spring, we have almond trees. Later, we have oranges, blossom, peas, and broad beans. In winter, we have the vegetables we started cultivating in spring and finally in summer we have tomatoes, strawberries, lemons, and figs. Mallorca also locally produces rice, olive oil, and much more. It is also important to mention the Mediterranean Sea. Fish and seafood have a unique flavor. The Balearic Islands have a Mediterranean focus, and, therefore, we have a really strong local product. The Mediterranean diet is really important due to the ease with which we are able to source outstanding products.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about Hipotels Hotels &amp; Resorts&rsquo; presence in Mallorca and how the company achieved its current presence beyond the island?</strong></p>
<p>Hipotels Hotels &amp; Resorts was established in Cala Millor in 1970 thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of my father, Juan Llull. Today, in Mallorca our company has 19 hotel establishments of the total of 29 that we have across the Canary Islands, Andalusia, and Canc&uacute;n. Mallorca still accounts for 62% of the rooms that we offer to visitors. Our Mallorcan origin is important to us, from the investments that have been made in Mallorca, which have gone well, to the capacity that it has given us to develop projects in other parts of Spain as well as internationally with a presence in Canc&uacute;n, where we inaugurated our first hotel in 2018. In 2017, we opened two hotels in Playa de Palma under a new concept with a convention center, and the results have been great, despite the context. Hipotels Hotels &amp; Resorts continues to bet on the island by investing in new projects and renovating our existing portfolio. Despite COVID-19, the island continues to be a highly sought after destination.</p>
<p><strong>How is Hipotels Hotels &amp; Resorts contributing to the reformulation of Mallorca&rsquo;s know-how in tourism and making the industry a top reference in terms of sustainability? </strong></p>
<p>We are not reinventing ourselves, but rather moving ourselves toward a more sustainable tourism model, but not only in terms of the environment. We are also concerned about the tradition and culture of the island and that our team feels fulfilled working with us. We strive to provide greater value to the customer in terms of extra service, comfort, and attention. Our sustainability model integrates environmental protection, workers, clients, vendors, and local culture. Local sourcing is an important component for us. For example, we are rehabilitating farms and recovering the native fruit species of the island, and we are restoring old houses to convert them into rural hotels that are closely connected to the traditions of the island. Apart from our policies in the company in terms of equality, internal promotion, and the environment, we have ISO 9000 and 14000 in most of the hotels. Back in 2014, my father signed a sustainability, environment, and quality policy, and that is what we have been working on since then.</p>
<p><strong>What other activities can the island reinforce to ensure its tourism sector is more dynamic?</strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is more than just the sun and beaches: this is what we also want to convey with the policy we want to implement. Palma is great, but rural Mallorca also has a great deal to show, and our company is interested in unlocking the potential of our inner island. Rural Mallorca will certainly be a trend in the coming years. For 2022, we predict to be at 75-80% of 2019&rsquo;s capacity, because of the great interest that the island generates as well as its great combination of top quality along with its proximity to European markets. Mallorca, in general, has an audience that is extremely loyal, and that has helped us spread the name of the island further by word of mouth. As for Hipotels Hotels &amp; Resorts, we will be extremely busy in the short term, as we have three renovations currently underway. Furthermore, in our hotel in Canc&uacute;n, we are building 100 more rooms as well as a medium-sized convention center.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Son Brull Hotel &amp; Spa established its reputation despite Mallorca&rsquo;s highly competitive hotel sector?</strong></p>
<p>Son Brull Hotel &amp; Spa means many things for Mallorca. First, it is a hotel established in a historic building, specifically a Jesuit monastery. The hotel opened its doors in 2003, and since then we have been thriving, except during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, we have seen a strong recovery, given that it is a hotel with great quality that offers considerable privacy and intimacy. Another distinctive feature of Son Brull is that it is the only hotel of its kind owned and managed by the same people. We are a family, my father is the founder who chose quality tourism, and my siblings and I have continued his legacy with a hotel that is part of the luxury tourism landscape of Mallorca. Being managed by a family makes a significant difference to Son Brull. I have always believed that even the most wonderful hotel must be completed with quality staff. We are extremely happy that about 30% of our clients return having become a part of the family.</p>
<p><strong>What is the significance for Son Brull Hotel &amp; Spa to be part of the Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux brand?</strong></p>
<p>Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux is an association of establishments such as restaurants or hotels that share supreme service standards and strong values that go beyond service, we are committed to the local economy, sustainability, and preserving local culture at all levels, and Son Brull Hotel &amp; Spa shares these values. There is a set of requirements to meet the quality, sustainability, and gastronomic standards of the Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux brand. Our hotel is audited, and we are proud to be carrying its seal of quality</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the process of restoring the old palace of Can Marqu&eacute;s and transforming it into a flagship hotel at the heart of Palma&rsquo;s old town like?</strong></p>
<p>The palace dates back to the second half of the 18th century and is a special building architecturally speaking. Most of the old buildings in Palma are typically square with a space in the center and stairs from the center to the sides. Here, we have an architectural masterpiece with six- and 11-m ceilings at the entrance to the palace. It is hard to imagine how this was built in the 18th century. The German owner, Kim Schindelhauer, fell in love with the island and bought this palace 20 years ago, and it was his home up until three years ago. His wife is an interior designer, and bearing in mind the boom of boutique hotels, they decided to turn it into a hotel. The priority has always been to maintain the history of the building rather than converting it into as many rooms as possible. The garden areas, the living room, and 75-sqm rooms were maintained. Many of our competitors are based in old buildings in Palma that have been restored, but we are fortunate to be a palace. We are a far cry from the typical hotel. Here, we have tried to maintain the original pieces, such as the wooden doors and the handrails. In addition, one point is that each room is unique has different characteristics, while incorporating amenities such as air conditioning and heating in a non-disruptive way to preserve the charm of the palace.</p>
<p><strong>How has the hotel been adapted to cater to an increasing corporate demand of tourists in Palma? </strong></p>
<p>At the corporate level, we are not a business hotel, though we do have a 380-sqm room with plenty of space for meetings. In fact, it is the space we use to accommodate those who come to the meeting, since it has three rooms inside. This gives space for special business meetings at a higher level that can easily create a positive atmosphere for business to happen and people to come to agreements.</p>
<p><strong>How did the hotel deal with the pandemic, and what measures did you take? </strong></p>
<p>The German owner did not feel they could deal with the pandemic sufficiently and passed the hotel management to Puro Group, the most prominent hotel group in Mallorca that is investing heavily in the five-star sector. The pandemic has helped us to target customers who have not been affected economically by the pandemic, have continued to travel, and are not only looking for sun and beach, but also a gastronomic and cultural experience. In this process, Puro Group is working to promote the five-star segment. Puro Group is not only present in Mallorca, but also Denia, Barcelona, and Vilamoura in Portugal, and there will be further expansion in the future, which is a sign of the group&rsquo;s commitment to the tourism sector despite the recent difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What is your outlook of the long-term prospects of the tourism sector in Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>Currently, restrictions and vaccinations are the order of the day, and although people are willing to travel, they remain extremely cautious. Everything is last minute. We are optimistic and strive to keep the hotel open in the long term. We are determined to continue offering our services to the whole world. As an island, it is important that we have the support of the public sector. We need both the Mallorca Turismo Foundation and other associations to get involved and promote Mallorca as a destination, because there are many people who make their living from tourism. The long-term vision of the tourism sector is to develop a more sustainable economy and find new offerings for tourist so that they can live new and different experiences in Mallorca. At the end of the day, the kind of tourism we offer is not just for the summer, but all-year round.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hotels VIVA is a well-positioned hotel chain brand on the island. What has its trajectory been like before reaching your current positioning?</strong></p>
<p>Hotels VIVA is a family-owned business, with the family having been both in the tourism and construction sectors for more than 40 years. As a brand, Hotels VIVA was created 20 years ago. Currently, the company owns six hotels under the Hotels VIVA brand, and we have a stake in the Caribbean in Excellent Resorts. That gives us a significant capacity to implement in Mallorca some of the trends being implemented in the Caribbean. There are certain areas in which the Caribbean is one step ahead and vice versa, and great synergies are created by being present in both locations at the same time. Currently, it is key to have a sustainability proposition in your hotels, and this is something that we have focused on. Hotels VIVA has always focused on the importance of protecting the environment of the island. Taking care of our ecosystem has always been part of our DNA as a company. There are many requirements to build and revamp hotels now all in a bid to preserve the island. Our facilities have many outdoor locations, for example. Almost everyone in Mallorca today understands the importance of protecting the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>How is digitalization being embraced at Hotels VIVA?</strong></p>
<p>Hotels VIVA has accelerated its digitalization efforts. For example, a QR code can be applied to see our menu, and services as food and beverage can be included via cellphones while sunbathing by the pool. To become an important tourism destination, one needs to digitalize their services. We have divided our digitalization strategy in three areas: internal operations, customer experiences, and commercial purposes. In terms of internal operations, we have a system through which we have significantly reduced the number of paper invoices. Invoices are now sent digitally. Our maintenance teams check daily the energy consumption with a dedicated software to optimize our resources. In terms of the customer experience, guests come to Mallorca to relax. We have check-in and check-out services that can be done online, though we cannot do away with the human touch. And then there is the commercialization area, which has grown due to the pandemic. There are much more online reservations, and we have doubled our growth in online reservations.</p>
<p><strong>What is your long-term view of the tourism sector of Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>We are extremely positive about the future of Mallorca. Whenever there was been a window of opportunity to travel during the pandemic, many tourists started to come. People look forward to traveling. At a psychological level, people need to travel. Many are even willing to pay slightly more and come to Mallorca. We are extremely well positioned to continue to be a key destination in the Mediterranean. The sector has invested heavily in improving its services. In addition, there has been a heavy focus in Mallorca to invest in sustainability. We are working to have solar facilities in all our hotels; for example, we already have installed in two of them and in the next couple of years, they will be installed in the rest of hotels, which will mean charging stations for electric vehicles completely free of charge for our guests. Sustainability is the right path. You have to progress in that area if you want to have a destination of quality. There is a consensus over the fact that the islands need to attract guests who are willing to pay more for a better service. At the same time, there are extremely large high-end brands arriving in Mallorca, and that will improve our competitiveness. We continue to have hotels that have a unique location, and we must seize on that opportunity. We are committed to continually investing in our hotels every year and promoting a more sustainable operation.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe Meli&aacute;&rsquo;s history as a Mallorcan company and its success in exporting its tourism knowhow to a large number of countries?</strong></p>
<p>Meli&aacute;&rsquo;s history can only be understood based on its foundation in Mallorca, one of the cradles of holiday tourism on a global level and the land that witnessed the birth of visionary entrepreneurs such as my father, Gabriel Escarrer Juli&aacute;, founder of the company, and many others. From Mallorca, and after achieving hotel leadership in the Baleares and Canary Islands, we took the leap to the peninsula, and subsequently in the mid-1980s, we built our first international hotel in Bali. From that moment until today, in which we operate over 380 hotels in 45 countries with almost 100,000 rooms, our Mallorcan origins have marked us. They have allowed us to apply our pioneering know-how in some of the best holiday destinations of the world, such as the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, and allowed us to take our Mediterranean essence of hospitality and savoir vivre to other regions of the world, merging with other cultures and environments. I am proud to also say that we have always been ambassadors of the Spanish brand, which holds a high power around the world regarding tourism.</p>
<p><strong>What does the island of Mallorca mean today for Meli&aacute; Hotels International? </strong></p>
<p>Although Mallorca remains a popular destination, it keeps on improving its position as a quality destination. Meli&aacute; Hotels International is still present here, with 22 hotels, additionally betting on the innovation and diversification of the tourism model of Mallorca, with cutting-edge hotels, introduction of lifestyle brands, a growing focus on the luxury segment, and high-potential products to diversify and de-seasonalize tourism with infrastructures such as Palau de Congressos de Palma and its annex hotel, Palma Bay, which we have been operating since its inauguration. Finally, it is important to highlight our commitment to Mallorca, which is reflected in ambitious and committed projects such as the reconversion of our entire hotel offer in an area such as Magaluf. It has gone beyond being a hotel renovation and has become an exemplary project of how to reconvert a &ldquo;mature&rdquo; coastal destination in a quality, competitive, and sustainable destination, thanks to public-private collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Despite the tourism recovery process, Meli&aacute; Hotels International continues to bet on international expansion. What can we expect for 2022 in this regard? </strong></p>
<p>For us, Spain is the main market, both as a tourist feeder market and as a destination country. Meli&aacute; is a leader and specialist in holiday hotels, which is why in the next 10 years around 80% of our expansion will take place in three major regions: the Mediterranean arc, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia, where we are one of the top hotel chains in countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia. For 2022, as we recently present in FITUR, we have 11 openings planned so far in said regions.</p>
<p><strong>How is Meli&aacute; Hotels International accelerating its plans in the transition toward a sustainable hotel sector?</strong></p>
<p>For Meli&aacute;, sustainability is a priority issue that has formed part of our strategic plans since 2008; however, ever since the 1980s when my father made a first contact in Bali, our company assumed a commitment to the world and the communities in which we establish ourselves. Today, we are the most sustainable hotel chain in Europe and Spain for 2021, according to the Corporate Sustainability Assessment drawn up by Standard&amp;Poors Global, and the second one worldwide, and we will maintain our commitment to improve and progress on an issue that is not only increasingly important for our clients, but also subject to a stronger regulation as global awareness toward climate change increases and in accordance with the UN Global Compact, which establishes the SDGs for 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does it mean for RIU Hotels &amp; Resorts to be a company with origins in Mallorca and having been part of the creation of a successful tourism model?</strong></p>
<p>I am proud to have been able to sustain the family business and make it thrive. At the same time, it is a huge responsibility. My father and grandfather were great entrepreneurs and visionaries who were able to see the great opportunity presented in the 1950s by the hotel industry in Mallorca. They defined our philosophy of service, to which we are still faithful today. From the beginning, they bet on reinvesting all the profits into the business. This has continuously marked our way of managing. Reinvesting means growing, diversifying, betting on new destinations, and constantly updating the product. My brother Luis and I have followed that philosophy well, and we have been able to adapt it to each moment. The holiday model of Mallorcan hotel companies is a world reference. We have managed to create a standard of service and a successful business admired by many other countries.</p>
<p><strong>With a presence today in many countries, what milestones have RIU Hotels &amp; Resorts achieved?</strong></p>
<p>The key is in the reinvestment of profits. Even now, having had to close all hotels in 2020 due to the pandemic and having worked hard for recovery, we continue as before. We do it to stay strong and grow since we have the will to continue as a source of employment, stability, and opportunities for our workers. During the 1960s and 1970s, we grew significantly in the Balearic Islands. It was not until 1985 that we opened the first hotel outside the Balearic Islands, the Riu Palmeras, which was a key step prior to the international jump. There, we learned to operate a hotel allyear round. That prepared us for the international leap, which was made in 1991 with the opening of the first hotel in Punta Cana. This marked the first step in the great growth of RIU Hotels in America, where we currently have more than 40 hotels. The most recent projects we have launched were two urban hotels, a sector we first entered in 2010. These are the Hotel Riu Plaza Manhattan Times Square, which opened its doors February 11, and the Hotel Riu Plaza Chicago, which is slated to open in 2024. We have other exciting projects like the opening of the first hotel in Senegal in 2022, as well as continuing to grow in Mexico, our main international destination and our salvation during this crisis.</p>
<p><strong>What is your assessment of the hotel sector&rsquo;s role in implementing best sustainable practices and, more specifically, of RIU Hotels &amp; Resorts? </strong></p>
<p>Working to achieve sustainable management is no longer voluntary; it is an obligation for all. The first sustainability to look for is that of companies, which the pandemic has taught us. At RIU, we firmly believe sustainability involves the environment, the community, and our employees. For many years, hotel entrepreneurs have been implementing sustainability measures. We are already looking for efficiency in energy and water use and have invested in ergonomic changes for employees. We have started circular economy projects that depend, for example, on local agriculture, and we separate the hotel&rsquo;s organic waste so that it returns to the earth as compost. It is not a question of getting attention for what has been done. Hoteliers have a driving role, but we are calling for a broader, truly ambitious look. For a real reconversion of the tourism sector to take place, many more agents must be involved.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the recovery of the tourism sector?</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, we expect the level of activity to be good, barring any further surprises from COVID-19. However, profitability will not recover. Costs have increased significantly due to shortages of raw materials and energy costs, but quality cannot be touched. That means all extra costs will be charged on the profit margin. </p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the reasons to open Hit Mallorca, and what added value will it bring to the existing leisure landscape of the island?</strong></p>
<p>Mallorca, as a top-level tourist destination, needs to have an excellent leisure offering for tourists coming to the island. We felt it necessary to bring together a combination of services under one roof, ranging from restaurants to nightlife. Mallorca has a wide range of tourism types, though in the last few years there has been a significant increase in what we refer to as quality tourism. These people seek more unique and memorable experiences on the island. Hit Mallorca comes into play exactly to fill in that gap and offer the extra special experiences that high-end visitors to the island need. COVID-19 resulted in a pause of our project, though the growing interest in Mallorca as a premium tourism destination means we are returning at full speed. Hit Mallorca is a unique space and will revolutionize the leisure sector in the island. There are five businesses under one roof with five different areas, which will make it possible for visitors to enjoy the location from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day. We have a pool, a pool club, a restaurant, and the club all developed along a 30,000sqm surface, divided between outdoor and indoor spaces and private parking. Hit Mallorca is close to the airport, and there are 50,000 beds spread across different hotel infrastructures just a few minutes away. On top of that, Hit Mallorca has a strong commitment to sustainability, working alongside local and international brands. For example, we have established a partnership with BMW for electric company vehicles, offering onsite charging stations. Hit Mallorca is also working on a project involving solar power installations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will Hit Mallorca adapt its offering to business visitors to Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>Considering the demand for MICE tourism sector on the island and the numerous requests we have received from globally renowned brands and agencies, around 4Q2022 there could be a soft opening, allowing us to host corporate events. This will make it possible to start up this great machine, and we could use these events as a warm up prior to the grand opening in 2023. For a few years now, our sales department has been working to promote the project to different agencies that oversee bringing in such companies to the island, so we are already exploring these sales channels area for the MICE sector. This sector is extremely important for the island and for Hit Mallorca, as it will encourage commercial activity even during low seasons. This helps to de-seasonalize tourism, which many businesses have been trying to address. With our efforts, we can also help achieve this. The space is suitable for many uses, and both the indoor and outdoor areas are ideal for events, offering also a state-of-the-art technical rider.</p>
<p><strong>With a renowned chef such as Mart&iacute;n Berasategui, what type of culinary experience will Hit Mallorca offer?</strong></p>
<p>Having a figure such as Mart&iacute;n Berasategui and his entire crew is an important asset for Hit Mallorca. Being able to bring in a chef with 12 Michelin stars has been momentous for Mallorca&rsquo;s image. For this project to be top class, we had to bring in the best. At an architectural level, we have a figure such as David Alayeto. However, this is not enough, and we need to compliment it with the gastronomic offering to ensure the client can have the full experience, which is what we are offering. This combination is designed to meet the expectations of the clientele we expect to have, making it an out-of-this-world experience. Right now, our group can provide added value to the island through the gastronomic and complementary leisure offers in a strategic moment of rethinking tourism after COVID-19. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What importance has the MICE offering gained in Mallorca&rsquo;s tourism diversification strategy?</strong></p>
<p>The Convention Center of Palma was conceived more than 10 years ago as part of transformation efforts toward a much more sustainable tourism model. The government of the Balearic Islands and the city council commissioned the construction of the convention center, and Meli&aacute; was awarded a 15-year operation concession. In 2017, Meli&aacute; started the operations with a vision to position Mallorca and Palma as a unique destination for MICE-related activities. MICE tourism would not only to break the seasonality of tourism on the island, but also allow it to enter fully into the world of large congresses, with all the benefits that they bring. We have a great opportunity to integrate scientific congresses and meetings of large international companies with local companies and scientific society. As a result of the opening of the Palacio de Congresos, we have gained extensive experience, new infrastructures have been developed, new congress centers have opened in areas that were before purely tourist areas, and complementary facilities are being opened.</p>
<p><strong>How successful has the Convention Center of Palma been?</strong></p>
<p>The convention center did not stop, even in the period of global shutdown with COVID-19. We have played a fundamental role to support the island&rsquo;s healthcare infrastructure. We have medicalized the convention center, along with its hotel Meli&aacute; Palma Bay, and helped expand the capacity of healthcare spaces to attend to COVID-19 patients. In June 2021, we reactivated an important part of tourism activity on the island, and the immediate public response was positive. Palma is the number-one destination in Spain in terms of recovery and also in terms of MICE activity. We saw eagerness from both companies and associations to get together again, and Mallorca was in a great position to capture that growing demand, thanks to its unique selling points. We expect to move forward further with the consolidation of MICE in 2022, and for 2023-24 we have extremely optimistic projections for MICE, not only for the convention center, but also for the other venues on the island that are ready to take on MICE activities.</p>
<p><strong>What added value has Meli&aacute; brought to the management of the Convention Center of Palma? </strong></p>
<p>What we have done for the first time is bring the excellence of our hotels to the congress centers. This is indeed innovative and also involves key components such as the entire food and beverage offering. Meli&aacute; also operates 1,500 rooms close to Palacio de Congresos, and that allows us to move forward, push harder to get groups, be much more agile in our response, and achieve greater consolidation of events. Undoubtedly, Meli&aacute;&rsquo;s greatest strength in the management of the Convention Center of Palma is its ability to apply all its sustainability policy practices as a company recognized worldwide. Our goal is to play a key role in the economic transformation of Palma city and the island of Mallorca through business travel, and to become a new social and cultural hub for residents and a benchmark for innovation and sustainability in the international travel industry. That is why we are working in several areas such as enhancing the employability of vulnerable people in society, promoting measures to advance in the circular economy, combating climate change, and providing access to quality social and leisure events.</p>
<p><strong>How the MICE sector has grown in Mallorca to hold corporate events of any size? </strong></p>
<p>The Convention Center of Palma has encouraged the private and public sector, not only in the city of Palma, but throughout the island, to create new facilities for the meetings and events industry. New facilities that serve to support all this business have also emerged, and also it is worth mentioning the enormous quality, cutting-edge technology of the complementary offer of Mallorca for business visitors.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Palma mean for the island&rsquo;s tourism, and how has the positioning of Palma&mdash; and with it Mallorca&mdash;changed over time?</strong></p>
<p>It is a piece that is not understood separately. Palma contributes to the tourist positioning and the tourism strategy of Mallorca as a whole, considering that the city is a year-round urban destination, open 12 months of the year. During the pre-pandemic period, Mallorca closed with 14 million tourists, according to official data. In 2019, we received 2.2 million cruise passengers, 1.2 million tourists slept at least one night in Palma, as well as 4 million tourists who were staying in other areas of Mallorca but came on day trips to Palma. Palma has 40,000 beds, the second highest after Calvi&agrave;, and 90% of those in Palma are four stars or higher. There is no destination in Spain with a concentration of tourist and hotel product of four stars and above. Almost the entire hotel offerings are modern, renewed, and of quality. We are a premium, cosmopolitan destination for a client looking for urban vacation experiences whose main focus and interest is contemporary art, gastronomy, and the enjoyment of a city, because Palma is of a manageable size, where you can walk everywhere, but with spectacular services. The approach of restoration in the city is impressive. For a capital of almost half a million inhabitants, what the city offers is impressive.</p>
<p><strong>What is your assessment of the recovery of the tourism industry of the city of Palma?</strong></p>
<p>Palma started the whole process of repositioning the destination 10 years ago. In fact, 2022 marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of Fundaci&oacute; Turisme Palma 365, with the mission to articulate an organization that allows a real public and private collaboration and a strategy around what is all the tourist activity 12 months a year, while ensuring long-term planning for the city&rsquo;s tourism activity regardless of the political context over the years. The main aim is to position the destination as urban vacation spot for long weekend city breaks, within two and a half hours maximum direct flight time. Our backbone is this: we are an urban holiday weekend destination allyear round. Regarding COVID-19, when people could travel, reservations really boomed. In the summer of 2021, we saw occupation levels close to 80%, thanks to our strong brand, promise of value understood, and quality and price ratio. We were able to create a safe environment in which customers felt safe. Palma has recovered quickly and much faster than other areas of Mallorca. For June, July, and August 2022, we already have a 75% of committed occupation, and we expect to reach 90%. Palma currently has occupancies at 85% in the city, and the beach area of Palma is at 45% at the moment. In the end, this demonstrates the resilience of the brand and the sector, a job well done not only on our part but also on the part of the private sector. In other words, we have a fantastic private sector.</p>
<p><strong>How is Palma gaining prominence to attract more long-haul tourists and reduce its dependence on nearby European markets? </strong></p>
<p>In 2019, we had a strategy plan for the east coast of the US, though plans were put on hold because of COVID-19. For us, the cities of Chicago, New York, and Miami are interesting markets to attract tourists. Palma receives nearly 90,000 Americans annually, without any real promotion activity. They had visited Palma through cruises and had come back, and they were really interested in boutique hotels as well as the five-star hotels in Palma. Many of the boutique hotels in Palma are either Relais &amp; Ch&acirc;teaux, Virtuoso, or part of the Amex Travel network. Soon, Palma will have direct flights to the US. We will intensify our promotional activities in New York and better capitalize on this market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the relevance of Calvi&agrave; in Mallorca in terms of key aspects such as tourism?</strong></p>
<p>Calvi&agrave; is the quintessential tourist town on the Balearic Islands. Despite being a municipality with a population of over 50,000 people, Calvi&agrave; is home to over 60,000 hotel beds in some major tourist locations: Peguera, greatly influenced by the German market; Santa Pon&ccedil;a, with a varied market but heavily connected to British tourists; Palma Nova Magaluf; Portals; and Illetas. Calvi&agrave; has great potential regarding tourism, taking into account that in the pre-pandemic years, it was able to attract 1.5 million tourists and over 9 million overnight stays in 2019. The strength of Calvi&agrave; lies in its beaches and sunshine. We have over 30 beaches of various features, and 15 of them hold Q quality. We are the Spanish municipality with the largest number of beaches recognized with Q quality.</p>
<p><strong>What is your assessment on the recovery of tourism in Calvi&agrave; beyond traditional indicators and focusing more on tourism as a social-impact activity?</strong></p>
<p>Calvi&agrave;&rsquo;s economy went from 100 to 0 overnight. The service sector, hospitality, and tourism employ around 80-85% of the citizens in Calvi&agrave;, directly or indirectly. Calvi&agrave; focused on two strategies aimed first and foremost at saving lives, and then looked for ways to revive the economy. In the municipality, we focused mostly on providing social care to the people suffering the most. In 2020, we increased by six-fold the assistance we refer to as &ldquo;basic necessity aid&rdquo; aimed at helping with food and housing costs. Unanimously, in 2020 we allocated over EUR10 million to the recovery of Calvi&agrave;. In a municipality such as ours, the total budget is around EUR100 million, and allocating EUR10 million of that to face the difficulties of the productive sector was a wise choice. Calvi&agrave; was the tourist destination with the highest occupancy rate in 2021 with respect to the total number of available beds, allowing us to preserve a large share of the social impact of tourism on our people. We were prepared to receive the first stages of recovery 2021, and we are now prepared to receive the full recovery.</p>
<p><strong>How is Calvi&agrave; rethinking its tourism industry to make it more dynamic and diverse throughout the entire year?</strong></p>
<p>A top tourist destination should offer the quality the tourists require as well as the experiences they seek. Calvi&agrave; has been working to create tourist products and experiences that make our destination more desired and enjoyable. Sports is a tourism product that, aside from the sun and beaches, can open more possibilities, especially if we want to extend the tourism season. In 2022, we are dedicating over EUR800,000 to the promotion of sporting events, placing us as a municipality that can welcome large sporting events. These will have a direct impact on overnight stays in touristic infrastructures as well as an indirect impact on the creation of a destination brand. In 2021, we were fortunate to host a golf tournament, one of the three major tournaments in Spain for the PGA circuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is Calvi&agrave; working to have its tourism industry embrace sustainability on different fronts?</strong></p>
<p>Calvi&agrave; accelerated our efforts on this front in 2015, and our vision implies an adaptation of Calvi&agrave;&rsquo;s territorial plan, resulting in a municipality with contained and sustainable growth, correctly analyzing where growth should be and where it should be limited, and establishing the type of growth needed. Through this approach, we declassified thousands of square meters to direct the spotlight to a protected Great Calvi&agrave;, to the interior Gran Calvi&agrave;. Over 70% of our municipality has some degree of protection, which is why the territorial aspect is extremely important. For some years now, we have been convinced that one of the quality aspects of the destination brand should be the commitment of said destination to the sustainability of the territory that welcomes the tourist. Through an environmental consciousness, Calvi&agrave; is making investments to commit to the ongoing ecological transformation</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Fundaci&oacute; Mallorca Turisme play in the internationally renowned tourism industry of Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is a leading tourist destination, and the Fundaci&oacute; Mallorca Turisme, together with the island&rsquo;s government, is committed to making it more well-known around the world. We are working to be smarter and more sustainable in tourism as well as implement improvements in terms of health and safety. We have an important alliance with the United Nations World Tourism Organization, which has given us a certificate of excellence. Mallorca is also member of the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). Our objective is to make this better known across Mallorca to further engage our private tourism sector. Regarding Mallorca joining the network of world observatories of sustainable tourism, it is worth mentioning that there are currently 32. However, Mallorca is the first one to apply tourism intelligence across its entire development. Fundaci&oacute; Mallorca Turisme is also heavily engaged in the promotion of alternative tourism products beyond the sun and sea. Mallorca has a great offering for nautical tourism, gastronomy, congresses, conventions, and as an audiovisual destination. Mallorca is a leading destination in many aspects and can have tourist coverage 365 days a year.</p>
<p><strong>What will be the role of sustainability in the tourism economic model that Mallorca is heading toward?</strong></p>
<p>Public and private initiatives agree that tourism must be sustainable, and the initiatives that have been taken are aimed at achieving these goals. The transition to sustainability must follow a specific process, and it must not only be environmental, but also economic and social. The diversification of our tourism offering is vital in order to reach a more sustainable model. As our climate and location are the most attractive thing for tourists, the public administration is working on adding value to that. The average tourist who comes to the beach also needs to find reasons to play sports such as golf or learn more about the local culture and gastronomy. In the sports arena, for example, golf has great potential, as Mallorca has 24 golf courses. Mallorca is already a global leader in nautical tourism, attracting world competitions. To sum up, economic diversification must be based, as a fundamental idea, on the main product. We must take advantage of our core and, from there, diversify our business.</p>
<p><strong>What potential does Mallorca have to become a leading audiovisual destination that can attract world-class productions?</strong></p>
<p>Mallorca is currently attracting many productions. Many producers are interested in Mallorca because of our weather conditions and our beautiful location on the Mediterranean, coupled with a great infrastructure and connectivity with Europe. The development of the audiovisual industry in Mallorca is essential. We have great spaces for the filming of adverts, series, and movies. We are extremely interested in big platforms wanting to shoot in Mallorca. However, in order to achieve this, we need to develop further infrastructure or give financial support to the sector. The development that the European Next Generation projects will bring is also important in this regard, and this has a great deal to do with transformation of the tourism model of Mallorca that we are aiming for.</p>
<p><strong>In the context of the reactivation of tourism, what measures have been adopted to reassure tourists that it is safe to visit Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working with the government of the Balearic Islands to bring the pandemic under control. This allowed us to have a better monitoring of those affected by the pandemic, while reducing the pressure on medical facilities. In addition, there are extremely exhaustive measures throughout the entire Mallorcan tourism value chain, which all means we have few cases in comparison to the volume of tourists we receive. Looking forward, it is necessary to work on measures to avoid concentrations of young people in leisure activities that could increase the number of infections on the island.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has SOFT LINE become involved in the digitalization of the Balearic economy since its creation?</strong></p>
<p>SOFT LINE was founded in Palma de Mallorca in 1989 with the objective of specializing in offering differentiated and high value-added services in the IT sector. Taking as reference my experience in insurance companies, banking services, and different business departments such as commercial and marketing, I decided to apply my experience to develop the creation, design, and maintenance of a commercial and financial management software adapted to each company&rsquo;s needs. We understand that every business project is the same in its concept, but different in terms of the system on which it develops its strategies, making this the main reason for our daily work. That software must be simple and useful to meet the needs of the client every step of the way, meeting their basic needs by paying special attention to the company&rsquo;s dynamism and its controlled growth. For this reason, our implementation strategy is mainly based on the creation of the minimum viable product (MVP) that meets our clients&rsquo; needs. Once the management system is implemented, we establish a dynamic maintenance system to modify the applications according to our clients&rsquo; needs, always looking after the continuous evolution of their businesses. SOFT LINE encompasses all IT areas, which constitutes the key factor for the proper functioning of their company, in order to avoid compatibility and coordination problems. The &ldquo;Digital Kit&rdquo; is becoming one of Spanish government&rsquo;s main initiatives to digitalize SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>What are the expected results in the medium term? </strong></p>
<p>In the process of continuous improvement that we have been working on, we assess daily our trajectory and our product portfolio, the experience we have had, and the evolution together with our clients. In this approach, we appreciate the fact that the need lies in optimizing resources and controlling management times. Flexibility and rapid change in decision making processes becomes a key factor in today&rsquo;s business world. Therefore, the digitalization is an essential tool to prepare, control, and cross-reference all the information in order to make decisions quickly and minimize the risk. In this sense, the Digital Kit is the first step to make companies aware of this need, helping them make the decision through simple solutions to optimize management processes and at the same time allow them to open their doors abroad to increase their capacity for expansion. At the same time, in the circular economy we are currently in, that digitalization becomes a necessity to aid with recycling and the optimization of existing resources.</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect in the following years in terms of a greater integration of technological advances in the economy of the Balearic Islands?</strong></p>
<p>Digitalization in companies has stopped being an option to become an obligation. Digitalization is not a project with an expiration date, and that only involves the marketing or IT departments. It is about teamwork, internalization, and the application of a digital mentality in every possible aspect. Digital transformation allows the implementation of digital tools or technologies to inefficient processes. It is about adapting processes to the possibilities that the new tools and technologies offer. In a simple way, we can say that company digitalization is the processes of transforming a business organization in depth, based on technological tools and directing the different facets of the business toward the digital environment. It necessarily entails a transformation of the business culture, where the company&rsquo;s management necessarily needs to be the first player involved in the change. The potential benefits of the digitalization process are many and varied, such as to better reach all customers, access new business opportunities, save costs, or improve customer satisfaction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How important is the Turistec cluster in the long-term planning of tourism in Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>The cluster was born as a response to the concentration of knowledge in tourism technologies in the Balearic Islands and is the fruit of the entrepreneurial spirit of the tourism companies here. Under the premise that sharing or transferring of knowledge is necessary, the cluster offers an ecosystem to manage information much more effectively, since the starting point is not competition as such, but cooperation. Turistec is a generator of synergies because of an ongoing and intense networking oriented toward innovation and growth. Its importance lies in being able to act with a single voice, integrating the business strategies of the sector and using the proposed criteria to generate traction with the public sector. It is about being a catalyst for public-private collaboration, an aspect that has become much more important in the post-pandemic years.</p>
<p><strong>What role does digitalization play as a component of Mallorca&rsquo;s competitiveness as a tourist destination? </strong></p>
<p>Digitalization must be approached from a holistic perspective, whether from the point of view of a company, sector, or destination. That said, elements such as technological &ldquo;catch up,&rdquo; process improvement, commitment to the client/resident, and the exhaustive review of relationships with human capital are presented to us as four areas of work in which to develop strategies aligned with all change agents with a long-term vision. Digital transformation, therefore, is a vehicle for growth and generation of business models much more adapted to sustainable growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>How can the EU Next Generation funds be leveraged to drive a digital transition in the island&rsquo;s tourism sector?</strong></p>
<p>These funds are essential for the recovery after the prolonged shutdown that the sector has suffered worldwide. To ride out this crisis, it has been necessary to assume large levels of debt, which will inevitably hinder any ability to increase leverage for innovation or expansion. In addition, there has been a transfer of human capital that has sought refuge in sectors less impacted by the pandemic, which includes the public sector. That said, opportunities will come from the ability to offer projects aligned with the strategic proposals of the EU and the Spanish state. The funds are there, but our impression at the moment is of a certain bewilderment, because we do not see how the capillarity of investment can be generated. Furthermore, the intensity of some aid is really short, once they manage to reach companies. This is a worrying element, given that our country has a record of returning money for innovation for not having the ability to present bankable projects. We hope there is still time to redirect this situation, and for this to occur it is necessary to persevere in the dialogue with the public sector with effective projects. Turistec is committed to finding a way to redirect ideas on the effective management of funds.</p>
<p><strong>What priorities will be presented to the cluster in the 2022-23 biennium?</strong></p>
<p>The priority will be to recover the levels of competitiveness and be more resilient before any new blows occur from COVID-19. For this, we must reduce leverage in order to propose investment in innovation and transformation to first recover and then begin to transform. The sector is demonstrating a great capacity for anticipation and courage by undertaking ambitious projects of sustainability, transformation, and even adaptation or improvements of the model itself. The projects are based not only on significant investments in technification but also on the improvement of processes and the formation of human capital with a clear focus on sustainability and protection of the environment. These two years will be years of recovery, though at the same time of preparation of the company to undertake improvements or transformative projects aimed at adapting or generating new business models in line with the demands of client and the destination on which its competitiveness will depend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you detail some of the highlights of the company&rsquo;s work in the field of digitalization and sustainability?</strong></p>
<p>ROBOT is a technology company specialized in building automation systems and inmotic and was established in Palma de Mallorca in 1983. The company had been engaged in sustainability-related projects for many years before the term became popular. It was established in response to the oil crises in the 1970s. In Mallorca, hotel chains were using oil as a raw material, the price of which surged dramatically. At ROBOT, we had started using technology and informatics to monitor hotel facilities to curb excess expenditure. Software was developed that led to savings of 30% on average. Soon, ROBOT started working with other business lines such as wine cellars, hospitals, and every other industry where energy consumption could be optimized digitally. The 1990s were yet another crucial moment for ROBOT, as we shifted to the hotel sector, starting work in the Caribbean through the hotel chains of Mallorca-based companies that had established businesses in the region. These hotel chains developed projects in the Caribbean, and ROBOT became a partner on their journeys. The hotel complexes in the Caribbean were huge and required careful monitoring of their expenses. In the 2000s, we began to work in the leisure area, including the acclimatization of recreational spaces. For rooms, we have systems to save energy depending on whether the space is occupied. We manage the air conditioning system, as well as the mechanisms to control levels of humidity. ROBOT provides a comprehensive control of the building through our system. The company has always worked with its own designs for both equipment and systems, all manufactured at our facilities in Palma. We then install the system and provide maintenance services. Right now, we have offices in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Earlier in 2022, we opened another office in Malaysia both locally and as a springboard for Indonesia, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>How has ROBOT navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, where the hospitality sector has been severely hit, and what is your assessment of the digitalization process of hotels since the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>During 2020, contact with hoteliers was very limited, as facilities were mostly closed. However, we have noted hotels&rsquo; needs to manage temperature, for example, and overall there has been greater attention to ensuring a safe environment. In that regard, ROBOT has developed products oriented toward those services, while creating solutions to promote hotels&rsquo; transition toward sustainability as is the case of our newly developed systems to control CO2 emissions. Additionally, we have developed systems to improve the quality of the air that tourists breathe, as well as to measure energy and water consumption levels. Today, it is easy to identify those areas that are consuming the most in order to reduce expenses.</p>
<p><strong>What factors have contributed to ROBOT winning the award for SME of the Year from the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>In February 2018, ROBOT was listed on the Spanish stock exchange, under the BME Growth Market (formerly known as MAB). There are two companies from the Balearic Islands listed on the exchange. One of them is the hotel chain Meli&aacute;, and the other is ROBOT. Following this development, the private sector and government administrations started to pay greater attention to ROBOT and recognize the company&rsquo;s achievements, despite its relatively small size. Our strategy is to expand our operations by entering new markets, which is fairly challenging considering that ROBOT is an SME. However, we are succeeding. Additionally, part of our ethos is to control what we manufacture to guarantee high standards, which is why our products are manufactured locally, having a higher spillover effect on the local economy. We have no intention of relocating our manufacturing facilities to Asia. With that in mind, we want to continue growing our business locally because the Balearic Islands are a perfect location for innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the Mallorca Preservation Foundation contributing to the proliferation of more sustainable practices across its economy?</strong></p>
<p>The Mallorca Preservation Foundation is a replica of Ibiza Preservation, which was the first foundation of its kind established in Ibiza about 15 years ago. The success of Ibiza Preservation spurred the creation of a similar model and structure in Mallorca, connected to a network of sister foundations in other places. Preservation Foundations in general rely on locals, and their missions are to bring forward environmental initiatives through various resources and connect them with people and companies that have the capacity to finance or provide logistical support for environmental projects.</p>
<p><strong>How would you assess the involvement of Mallorca&rsquo;s private sector in environmental protection projects?</strong></p>
<p>The foundation is celebrating its fifth year, and our main objective has been to raise awareness to preserve our island&rsquo;s natural beauty. Our steering committee is made up of people actively involved in the sustainability of Mallorca that share the same values. COVID-19 was a blow to our initial operations, though businesses on the island soon realized that the way forward for Mallorca was sustainability. In addition, the economy of the island comprises many family businesses, which at beginning saw us as a foreign entity but soon realized the opportunities for collaboration that we offered. Their collaboration has positively affected our work, and we appreciate that it goes beyond the financial sphere.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Garden Hotels started in 30 years with sustainability being part of its DNA. How has this materialized through your day-to-day practices?</strong></p>
<p>The company was initially a construction company established by my fatherin-law, who placed great importance on sourcing locally. When the company diversified into hotels, this translated into efforts to source food products through local farmers, thus giving greater visibility to Mallorcan traditional products. However, the challenge lied in aligning hotels&rsquo; necessities with farmers&rsquo; production. This was a long process, and finally in 2015 the first alliance with farmers started focused on growing organic and zero-kilometer products. Farmers could not produce ecological products because they did not have ecological compost, and in light of this, we started using organic waste from our hotels&rsquo; activities to generate the compost needed, which has created a virtuous circle that has become a great sustainable practice. This took us a year of working together, and in 2016 we already had a compost product and a finished product swapped with compost. Logically, we need much more than what we can afford with compost, and we buy the difference. This is costlier for us, but the ecological benefits compensate for the costs, which we are not burdening on our end clients. Garden Hotels is providing great quality to the customer, and gradually customers are becoming increasingly more aware of what it means to be sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>What has the geographical expansion of the company been like, and how have you been able to replicate circularity models in other locations?</strong></p>
<p>It has been less difficult than expected. We have been able to replicate the model in Menorca and Ibiza without any problems. Regarding shampoo, from example, we source it from a local artisan. We explained the whole process to him, we provided him with personnel paid for by Garden Hotels to help him, and he created the product that is 100% ecological and local. We created a packaging that is recycled, recyclable, and refillable. With all this, we have managed to eliminate all single-use plastics in our hotels. We already did it in 2019, and with this artisan we are also using local products at the same time. We are looking to replicate this in Huelva as well but have not yet found anyone who wants to do this. We are looking for a product whose packaging is reusable to eliminate all plastics.</p>
<p><strong>What is your general vision of this transformation of Mallorca into a sustainable tourism destination, and what would be your message to other hoteliers?</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that there is no going back on the issue of sustainability; we have to do it for the world. Hotels have to reduce their carbon footprints and bet heavily on this, being highly conscious that we are doing it for the future of our generations. On top of that, tourism offers a great opportunity to repair the damage that has been done already to the planet if more effort is put into it. That is the aim of the so-called regenerative tourism. Garden Hotels is pleased to be implementing ground-breaking initiatives, and we are not secretive or protective of our projects; we want everyone to do the same. If someone knows how we can improve further, tell us and we will improve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Fundaci&oacute;n Impulsa Balears serve long-term planning and decision-making for the benefit of the economy and society of the Balearic Islands?</strong></p>
<p>Fundaci&oacute;n Impulsa Balears is a platform of strategic knowledge related to the decision making process for public and private organizations. We play an important role in boosting collaboration and fostering public-private partnerships. Our position on the archipelago is unique, as there is no any other institution tasked with the same objective. We have been inspired by existing platforms in Europe similar to ours and work to promote economic, digital, and ecological transition. The Balearic Islands has achieved significant milestones of prosperity. At the start of the 21st century, we were among the 50 richest regions of Europe. But since then, we have seen a decline in terms of GDP per capita and the region ranks 98th today. We have slid many positions in the European ranking of GDP per capita, in part due to a decline in our levels of competitiveness. One of our main tasks is to monitor the level of competitiveness of the archipelago in order to improve those rankings. In order to do so, our organization shuns short-term factors and promotes long-term planning for the Balearic Islands based on knowledge, trends, and data and with the input of a wide array of stakeholders. All of our analysis and projects have a mid-to long-term outlook. SMEs are positioning themselves as the backbone of many local economies.</p>
<p><strong>How do you work to support this important sector?</strong></p>
<p>SMEs represent 99.9% of the economy in the Balearic Islands, which is a high percentage. Of that percentage, only 6% are mid-sized companies. Numerous micro and small companies represent 93% of our economy. The reality is such that it is impossible to achieve economic change without taking SMEs into account. However, with our work we provide support to any size of company. We assist in legal matters, but also in terms of labor, digitalization, coaching and research, and do so with a sector-specific approach, be it chemicals or agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Which sectors are better positioned to support economic diversification of the Balearic Islands?</strong></p>
<p>Our standpoint is that each economic sector can contribute to the transformation of the region&rsquo;s economy; none should be left behind by this transformation. We have analyzed several factors to identify the most relevant sectors for the transformation process. In tourism, and specifically in the industry of experiences we see many opportunities to interconnect numerous areas of knowledge that the archipelago has, in terms of accommodation and leisure, for example. We can compare those areas with other bodies of knowledge that would add value to the tourism offering in terms of experience-related tourism. There are also many opportunities for the film industry. And meanwhile, we are big supporters of the so-called blue economy, which pertains to sea sports.</p>
<p><strong>With tourism the main economic sector of the Balearic Islands, how do you propel its transformation toward a more sustainable business?</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable tourism is among our main objectives. In our view, sustainability and competitiveness are not at odds with one another. Countries need greater competitiveness to become more sustainable and vice versa. In fact, we view sustainability as a tool that fosters sustainability. The circular economy is paramount to our organization, and it is important to apply its principles in the service sector. Much has been said about the circular economy in the industry sector, but not that much about how those principles apply to a hotel, for example. We have worked with the World Tourism Organization and global tourism company and hotel group Iberostar to develop a circular framework to better comprehend how those principles apply to the tourism sector. It includes a business tool enabling constituent companies to conduct their own analysis. This analysis helps them to perform self-diagnosis. It helps establish a benchmark to understand how their efforts to promote the circular economy evolves, as compared to other enterprises within the sector.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Tirme managed to make Mallorca &ldquo;greener,&rdquo; and what is the significance of your work in the current context?</strong></p>
<p>Tirme was born out of the concern of the local government of Mallorca to advance in sustainability at a time when the issue of sustainability was not yet on the table and only really a concept. Being on an island makes us realize quicker than other places the negative impacts generated by people. Consell de Mallorca took a decision to close the different landfills for waste, of which there were about 50, and centralize waste management in order to transform materials into energy. At that time, Mallorca did not have electrical connection to mainland Spain. There was an opportunity to solve a problem and take advantage of an opportunity to generate local energy and close down the uncontrolled landfills all over the island. That was the mission of Tirme, which operates as a public concession, with the philosophy of going beyond our mission and trying to anticipate the future of the regulations and what the environment needs. Today, Tirme is pushing for the Mallorcan economy to move toward a circular economy and greater sustainability. Through our mission of zero waste, Tirme has become the largest producer of renewable energy on the Balearic Islands; however, the situation needs to improve, as we only make up 6% of renewable energy on the islands. Tirme is an important actor, though in the end just one more actor. The important thing to develop the circular economy and improve the world we live in.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the relationship of Tirme with Mallorca&rsquo;s tourism sector?</strong></p>
<p>All the waste generated in tourism comes to us in the end, and we seek to provide the highest value, continue to reduce plastics, and recycle what cannot be reduced. In addition, we have had a longstanding relationship with organic matter, which makes up about 40% of the waste. It is the product that is circular by definition. In this regard, Tirme has a project called Finhava (finite). We are working with several hotel chains that are working intensively on the environment and are extremely concerned about reducing their footprints. We place smart containers in these hotels, and we measure the amount of waste that the hotel produces and the organic proportion of that, and the relevant data is sent to our cloud. We know for each ton of organic matter how much compost we produce and sell to specific farmers, and we have been measuring for years their production levels of different products per hectare for each ton of compost they apply.</p>
<p><strong>Taking into account European funds, how can the transformation to sustainability be accelerated?</strong></p>
<p>The European funds open the door for new test projects that might work at same level of expectation than Tirme. In addition, there is an opportunity to embrace digitalization to see, for example, where the secondary raw materials that we produce end up and how we get that circularity to return as a product. Digitalization should allow us to better track all this.</p>
<p><strong>What is Tirme&rsquo;s outlook in the short term?</strong></p>
<p>Tirme has two major lines of work. One is the circular economy, and here our priority is to better interlink the network and look for partners with whom we can not only treat the waste and return it to an anonymous system, but also to ensure that these raw materials really gain circularity. The other one is the carbon footprint. Our system has managed to reduce the carbon footprint of waste management in Mallorca by 60% in the 30 years that we have been operating, so we have already met the objectives of the EU. Our goal is to reach neutrality before we are asked to do so. Apart from that, Tirme is working on green hydrogen production through microalgaes, which is one of the projects to push and help the society of Mallorca.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Estel is a Mallorcan company with a strong international presence. What milestones have marked the growth of the company?</strong></p>
<p>Estel was founded in 1995 as a telecommunications engineering company. Today, 26 years after its foundation, we are extremely satisfied and proud of our trajectory. It is a company faithful to its principles with a remarkable client portfolio. This has been possible thanks to the personalized treatment we offer to each of our clients. Our main objective has always been to adapt to their needs. Bearing in mind that we are a Mallorcan company, our growth has been closely linked to that of the large hotel chains in the Balearic Islands, such as Meli&aacute;, Excellence, Palladium, and Iberostar. Estel started working in the telecommunications installations of these companies. When these companies began their international expansion, they trusted Estel to carry out the installations of their new hotel complexes. This was a significant step for the company, as it meant entering a phase of internationalization. The first project we carried out in the Americas was in the Dominican Republic for Iberostar in 1999, and our growth has been continuous since then. In 2000, we started to expand into Europe with a presence in France and the UK through the Meli&aacute; Hotel chain. This period marked Estel&rsquo;s new way of doing business. We are a company capable of adapting to new cultures and legislations. This ability to adapt is one of our main values today. At that time, Estel entered a phase of diversification to also provide electrical and mechanical services. We experienced strong growth in the Caribbean, starting to work with non-Spanish capital companies. With COVID-19, we have taken advantage of the drop in production to do internal engineering and reformulate the different business areas. Specialization, sustainability, digitalization, and the circular economy will be the basis of our business in the coming years. With this objective in mind, we have created three business lines: Esteldome, Estel Energy, and Estel Green.</p>
<p><strong>What does Estel mean to the economy of Mallorca today, and how has the company helped the strategic sectors of the island become more competitive? </strong></p>
<p>Our main strength has always been our ability to adapt. We try to anticipate the needs of the market, particularly in the hotel sector, which is our main client, and a strategic sector of the island. We are adapting to offer this sector the services that we know it will demand in the near future. Our strong specialization in the hotel sector has helped us to be pioneers in this field, and therefore, that hotel chains trust us to continue executing their projects. Clear examples are sustainability, the circular economy, and digitalization, which Estel has in its DNA. That is why we have been working for years on the brands launched in 2021, such as Estel Energy and Estel Green, which allow us to carry out the objectives set by the 2030 Agenda and offer what hotel chains need to optimize resources. These brands help them to be more efficient and reduce their carbon footprints. The implementation of automation and control systems is an example of services that will help make buildings more sustainable and therefore more environmentally efficient.</p>
<p><strong>What are Estel&rsquo;s priorities for 2022? </strong></p>
<p>We are confident that 2022 will be a year of recovery of turnover figures to the preCOVID-19 stage. Our major client, the hotel sector, is resuming its activity and, therefore, also its investments, which are so necessary for our business. Our geographic diversification in countries such as Aruba, St. Martin, Barbados, and others should begin to bear fruit. The new brands, especially Estel Energy and Estel Green, should lead another major area of growth, designing and executing either power generation or industrial waste recovery plants. We therefore expect 2022 to be a year of growth, expansion to new horizons, and consolidation of the new business lines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Econom&iacute;a de Mallorca specializes in the economic aspect of the island. What are the trends marking the island&rsquo;s economic performance?</strong></p>
<p>For some years now, the business sector has been working on exploring new business areas and diversifying Mallorca&rsquo;s economy, evidently marked by the tourist activity, which determines our growth rate and wealth creation. The pandemic has accelerated this exploration process and the openness to new paths. We have realized there are other development options based on, for instance, the industry of knowledge and technology. This diversification is still in its first stages and requires a continuity that private initiatives and the public administration must support. In any case, tourism will still be the main economic reference, and we do need to safeguard it. In this sense, an authentic revolution has been taking place in the last few years, marked by two key factors: quality and sustainability. There is no longer a rush to bring in more tourists, but rather those who spend more on the destination, stay in better-quality hotels, and leave more foreign currency on the island. In this process, the unprecedented investment that hotel entrepreneurs have made to renovate the hotel infrastructure has been fundamental, making it one of the most competitive infrastructures in the world. Additionally, the hotel managers are now committing to sustainability: Meli&aacute;, Barcel&oacute;, Iberostar, Riu, and others have become symbols, pioneers in adopting measures to preserve the environment, even long before the public administration saw it coming. Now, there are moves to regulate these sustainability measures, even though hotel owners have been applying them for a long time, not to mention the thriving circular economy with never-before-seen projects, such as the one executed by the Garden Hotels chain.</p>
<p><strong>What features characterize Econom&iacute;a de Mallorca as a source of economic information on the island? </strong></p>
<p>Since we started our journey in 2015, we have been committed to being a media that works with and for companies. We want the work carried out by companies and entrepreneurs to create wealth and job positions for society, either via corporate social responsibility actions or analyzing the reality and working to improve it together with the public administration. We remain true to our values and the need to offer precise and truthful information, while at the same time always trying to give a personal point of view. We recently started a new business phase in which Mar Nicolau, our commercial director, and I became editors and operators of the media, in an alliance drawn up together with the Grupo Zambudio, the owner of the media up to this date.</p>
<p><strong>What communication trends are you observing on the part of Mallorcan companies?</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, when we started, the information we published about CSR was scarce, though oddly enough we noticed that they generated high interest and many views. We therefore decided to increase its focus by creating a specialized section, and time has proven us right. The contents in this area have seen a five-fold increase. The same is true with everything related to sustainability and the environment. Sustainability and CSR are no longer an added value of the DNA, spirit, and values of a company; they have become main objectives, especially when we consider tourism companies.</p>
<p><strong>What is your forecast of the business outlook of Mallorca in 2022?</strong></p>
<p>It is tremendously complicated to make forecasts in these times with so much instability. Only a few months ago, we were seeing the light at the end of the tunnel that the pandemic put us in. It seemed we were returning to the path of growth and full recovery. Now, with the war in Ukraine, everything has turned upside down. Beyond the humanitarian and geopolitics aspects, it is evident that recovery will be delayed, and growth will slow down. With the prices of electricity, gas, and fuels skyrocketing, it is complicated to think of considerable growth.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does family business represent for the economy of the Balearic Islands? </strong></p>
<p>At the Balearic level, 91% of private companies are family owned enterprises, which by our estimations account for 35% of GDP, directly, and 91% of private employment in our region. Clearly, family businesses are the engine of the economy. Each has its origin in one person and continuity in the next family member to take the wheel. There are large companies, such as Barcel&oacute;, Grupo Pi&ntilde;ero, Iberostar, Camper or Meli&aacute;, to name a few, that have started as local family businesses and have made their way to international markets successfully.</p>
<p><strong>How does the association work to promote the value that the family model brings to the wider economy of the islands?</strong></p>
<p>Our main objective is not only for companies to be profitable, but that they have family continuity. And for this, we explain the importance and train them to adopt the same management structures: a board of directors, executive committees, and direct management committees and also management bodies specific to family businesses such as the Family Council, Family Assemblies, and the use of Family Protocols that set the rules that link the family to the company and that seek to ensure that there are no disagreements in this relationship so as not to endanger the continuity of the company. If family businesses have continuity, they have a hugely positive impact on the local economy. That is why our association tries to instill in its members the importance of family protocols that addresses sensitive topics such as who can work in a company, what requirements they need to meet, the training required, and who can and cannot be a shareholder. Consideration of these issues helps ensure that family companies successfully pass from generation to generation. We work to promote the significance and image of family businesses. We also undertake lobbying work to raise awareness of our role as an economic engine.</p>
<p><strong>How are family companies being guided to engage in corporate social responsibility for a greater positive impact?</strong></p>
<p>We always say that in family businesses we work to strike a balance across multiple dimensions. Obviously in economic terms, because without generating business we cannot exist. And yet the social and environmental balance is vital, too. At the 24th Congress of the Family Business held in 2021 in Pamplona, all the regional associations signed a manifesto under the slogan &ldquo;we work for a better society.&rdquo; To record our commitment to the challenges posed by the global society in which we live, and to commit ourselves to managing our companies sustainably. This is understood in terms of three inseparable elements: business, social and environmental. We also encourage our members to commitment to promoting diversity, gender equality, and social inclusion. And of course we work to ensure stable and quality employment for the next generation. The environmental perspective is a commitment to reducing CO2 emissions and decarbonize, which is especially important in a location such as the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p><strong>What is your overall message on the economy of the Balearic Islands as we gradually emerge from the shadow of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>I am positive and look to our economic future with optimism. The Balearic Islands have returned to their leader position in tourism, with positive data on job creation to match. At an international level, there are logistical problems, increased costs, including those of energy, which has led to high inflation. As such, our future economic performance will depend on how these factors pan out. 2022 marks a recovery for our tourism industry that stands to have a knock-on effect on our other industries. I am optimistic that we will finally emerge from the pandemic and its economic fallout. Family businesses will continue to operate with the familiar passion, pride and responsibility of the past, committed to the present, and optimistic for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does APD Balearic Islands bring together the region&rsquo;s business community to promote its social and economic growth?</strong></p>
<p>APD is an association working toward the progress and development of the Balearic Islands since 2008. A national association, it began in Madrid, and then extended to other regions of Spain. In the beginning, APD Balearic Islands was connected to APD Catalonia. However, our islands grew in prominence and new associates were added, whereby the association gained traction to be independent about eight years ago. APD is dynamic organization that organizes events, conferences, and training, including in-house training for its members. Its objective is to further develop the business community of the islands and serve as forum in which to meet, discuss, and network.</p>
<p><strong>The association is working to raise the level of engagement of businesses in the region in social and environmental matters. What is your assessment of this?</strong></p>
<p>At a national level, APD sends guidelines on social and environmental responsibility. I believe that APD Balearic Islands has the autonomy to choose its content, and at the regional level we are also opting to advance these topics and raise awareness among our members. In addition, our members are active in proposing new ideas, and highly engaged in contemporary issues, such as ecological and social responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>What is the nature of collaboration between private and public sectors to drive the local economy for the long run, especially in tourism?</strong></p>
<p>The Balearic Islands, no doubt, are dependent on tourism, and there is a major challenge to address the implications of this. Public and private investments, including the upcoming EU funds, need to be apportioned so as to rethink tourism in the islands and make it as competitive as possible, while paying attention from a sustainable perspective. Therefore, public and private stakeholders need to collaborate, and Mallorca provides a good example of this. That said, the process of economic transformation and diversification takes time. We have to be smart so that the Balearic Islands can be an exemplary and desirable destination. This will help us compete with Mediterranean destinations beyond Turkey, Greece or Croatia, and set our sights on high-end cities such as Monaco or Cannes.</p>
<p><strong>What other sectors attractive to investors could be developed further on the islands?</strong></p>
<p>I believe that the strength of the Balearic Islands is its advantageous geographical location, as well as its political stability and international nature. Many people have their second homes here, which makes it a perfect place to live abroad, while working remotely, as we have observed during the pandemic. So, it is safe to say that this would have a knock-on effect on the wider local economy. Mallorca&rsquo;s tourism is no doubt the largest part of its economy, to which may be added construction and restoration; most of this is mainly connected to tourism. Yet, it could also become a hub for marine and environmental projects, for example. The nautical sector, high-end construction, healthcare, or the circular economy could also prove attractive for the investor. At the end of the day, APD is a platform in search of associates from all sectors. The good thing about such an association is that it offers networking opportunities for those who are already in Mallorca and those keen to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Banco Sabadell differentiate itself from other players in Mallorca&rsquo;s private banking ecosystem? </strong></p>
<p>Sabadell Urquijo Private Banking, with assets under management of over EUR30 billion, is one of the leading entities in the private banking segment of Spain and the Balearic Islands. From the Balearic Private Banking Service Center, located in Palma, we provide our services to clients across the archipelago with assets under management of over EUR500,000. We also have a private banking director located in Ibiza and two managers who cover Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera. Sabadell Urquijo Private Banking stands out for its clear commitment to the global client advisory model with a strong focus on sustainability. Our value proposition is focused on the client&rsquo;s perspective, enabling us to offer products that match their risk profiles, time horizons, and performance expectations, without neglecting the tax component. Our team is recognized as being made up of highly trained consultants, certified by the European Financial Planning Association (EFPA). In the service center, we are able to serve clients in six languages, which is a determining factor in a territory such as the Balearic Islands. Globally, rising attention is being paid to so-called ESG investments.</p>
<p><strong>How does Banco Sabadell see this trend evolving in the Balearic Islands?</strong></p>
<p>For us, it is a fundamental trend that is here to stay. COVID-19 has acted as a catalyst to make us more aware of the impact of human activity on our environment, and how important it is to preserve it. We have entered a virtuous circle where all market players&mdash;companies, shareholders, clients, and investors&mdash;are keen to play an active role in improving society. At Banco Sabadell, we have been investing in ESG investment vehicles for many years. Furthermore, as a result of the agreement signed a year ago with Amundi, we have given our clients access to opportunities in ESG thematic and social impact funds. We see it as a great opportunity to invest in companies with good social and ethical criteria, which should benefit from their lower exposure to regulatory risks, an improved brand image, and employee satisfaction. In the Balearic Islands, ESG investments has become an increasing point of note for our clients. In addition, the preservation of the environment and natural resources is essential to maintaining the quality of life and the islands&rsquo; current economic model.</p>
<p><strong>With your knowledge of the investment landscape on Mallorca, what changes have you noticed during the emergence from COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>In general, the Mallorcan economy continues to rely on its two traditional drivers of tourism and real estate. That said, we note a paradigm shift to a greater interest in providing a quality product both in tourism and real estate. Yet, meanwhile, prevailing negative interest rates have favored the flow of capital into investment in property. We see a lot of activity in the purchase and sale of hotels, while in the construction sector we see a clear commitment to high-end, single-family housing. At the same time, we are seeing new investments in co-habitation, renewable energy, local products, and the maritime sector.</p>
<p><strong>The islands will have the opportunity to promote the reconversion of their economy thanks to European funds. How will Banco Sabadell support this process?</strong></p>
<p>The European Recovery Funds, NextGeneration EU, has as its main objective the digital and ecological transformation of companies and the self-employed, which will involve adapting the economies of countries and improving their competitiveness and employment prospects. At Banco Sabadell, we want to be by our clients&rsquo; side to advise them throughout the process and thereby comply with the guidelines for access to the European Recovery Plan. In our lines of action, the following stand out: Free service for assistance with personalized identification (machine learning). Assistance processing service through the PwC&rsquo;s European Funds Office. Creation of the new position of director of European Funds in each Territorial Directorate. Training for 3,500 specialized commercial managers at the bank.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe the progress made by the firm over these last 42 years?</strong></p>
<p>Our lawyer&rsquo;s office was founded in 1979, and since then it has become a leader firm in the region. It has had a steady evolution for an office that has been working with high volumes of work. We can appreciate the growth of a personalized firm at the beginning, though this changed as we began introducing new generations. One of best things we did is the generational transition and the inclusion of new professionals who today have already matured and are now developing a new generation. It has changed from a business led and managed by me to consolidated, solid society of hardworking, young, and specialized professionals. This characterizes us.</p>
<p><strong>Bufete Buades covers different areas of specialization, including arbitration and mediation, labor and criminal law, and tourist law, among others. Which one is most in demand, and what is your expertise?</strong></p>
<p>On the Balearic Islands, offices do not really have a specialized area. Here, the tourism sector is the most important one, and, therefore, this is one of the areas where we are more relevant. This is a lawyer&rsquo;s office mainly centered around companies, and we clarify that we tend to accompany our clients throughout the whole process. However, we have a criteria to send clients to other offices that we collaborate with when the issues are too specialized for us. We cover the demand for everyday legal services, and in other situations we rely on more specialized firms that have an agreement with us. Our main work comes from companies, although we also have private clients.</p>
<p><strong>What are the trends and legal challenges with regards tourism investment in the island, and how does Buades assist these investors?</strong></p>
<p>The tourism sector has been one of the worst affected by the pandemic. It had a model that was highly dependent on traveling, and first thing that was restricted was mobility. This lead to many questions, and most of them remain unanswered. Our aim is to accompany investors and aid in the process, such as the asset situation, the legality of investments, the potential of the project, administrative issues, and everything involving labor issues. In addition, we also aid in the selling process. It is usually harder to buy than sell, because there is a higher risk when buying. We are a Balearic office, and, therefore, we have advantages such as knowledge about cities and their town halls, the urban and tourism regulations, and much more. Thanks to this, we feel comfortable when assisting with these processes.</p>
<p><strong>Are you giving assistance to those investors or companies that are planning to acquire European funds? </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. For those clients seeking this assistance, we provide personal advice together with other departments such as the fiscal department. We are actively participating because most of the sectors affected by the crisis are present in the Balearic Islands and are waiting to receive these funds. Some of the funds will help with economic problems and others will help start new projects.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to the firm that you were named in a recent ranking by Best Lawyers as Lawyer of the Year in Corporate and M&amp;A Law in 2020? </strong></p>
<p>To begin with, it was gratifying because we were nominated and did not submit ourselves for the award. We are talking about a prestigious and global ranking, and we were selected. One of our biggest focuses is to never lose sight of what we are aiming for. We know our limitations and how to act if a project exceeds them.</p>
<p><strong>What are Buades&rsquo; priorities and goals for the rest of the year and 2022? </strong></p>
<p>We have a plan called Horizon 2030 that involves steady growth, introducing new professionals, forming a solid group, and giving our clients the best service. We are well aware that we will gain new clients as well as lose some of them. However, we do not want to lose sight of our steady and safe progress plan. Therefore, the goal is calm and solid growth and keeping the company secure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does KPMG support the dynamization of the main economic sectors of the island of Mallorca?</strong></p>
<p>This is the 50-year anniversary of KPMG&rsquo;s presence in Spain and KPMG has been in the Balearic Islands for the last 30 years. Our main purpose has been to support the economic development of the islands and, in doing so, we have evolved as a company. Most of the services we have offered traditionally have been in the auditing area, which is one of the main businesses of a Big Four. However, for the past few years we have sought to give more relevance to other divisions through other professional services such as strategic consultancy, transformation and innovation. Additionally, KPMG Baleares has been providing tax and legal services over the last years. It has all been part of a strategy to boost the presence of KMPG on the islands with more local team and specialized professionals in the main economic sectors. One of this is sectors is tourism, which accounts for 35% of the GDP of the Balearic Islands and up to 70% of the economy indirectly. However, there are other important sectors such as the energy industry. There are some leading companies in the energy sector in Mallorca, as well as manufacturing companies that we are happy to have among our clients.</p>
<p><strong>Which sectors can be best positioned as more attractive for foreign investment on the island of Mallorca? </strong></p>
<p>At a global level, the pandemic has become a turning point. It has had the positive effect of showing that society is flexible and resilient to change. This new world is opening the opportunity for tourism destinations to offer the possibility of showing a huge demand of foreigners who would be interested in spending long periods in these places. People can spend two months in a hotel or in an apartment working. They spend more time in a tourist destination, which opens an opportunity for built-to-rent buildings. This, at the same time, brings an opportunity to Baleares to revamp old hotels into apartment buildings to rent for long or short stays for people who want to spend their time on the island. We have seen a lot of interest in Mallorca from US citizens, as well as from Asia and the Middle East. Other sectors are drawing a lot of attention, as it is the case of the audiovisual industry. A British TV series being aired in international channels was shot in Mallorca. Audiovisual productions have a great spillover effect over the economy, bringing more jobs and helping diversify the economy away from tourism.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent can European funds lead to a remodelling of the island&rsquo;s economic model, and what role can KPMG play in it?</strong></p>
<p>The EU recovery funds represent a huge opportunity to invest in Mallorca. Spain will receive EUR140 billion from the EU, and half of that amount is a direct investment, while the other half is provided via loans. The funds will be focused on strategic areas, such as sustainable mobility. We see opportunities for investment in infrastructures for mobility in the Balearic Islands. KPMG is positioned as a strategic partner to help investors navigate their investment journey in the Balearic Islands, first, because of our capacity of analysis and market knowledge to provide consultancy services. KPMG Baleares assists local governments in the process of accessing the European funds. We are in constant touch with the ministries involved and already supporting organizations to access EU funds. The EU has already approved the plan presented by Spain. As for companies, we can support them in identifying the funds that they can apply for and make them eligible for them. KPMG has a wide experience in many relevant areas, including sustainability, innovation, education and digitalization, which are strategic pillars of the EU funds.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe the presence of Seguros Bilbao on the Balearic Islands?</strong></p>
<p>An insurance company, Seguros Bilbao deals with risk management, which is a fundamental factor in the smooth running of our lives and also businesses. Grupo Catalana Occidente is the owner of Seguros Bilbao after acquiring the company in 2004. Seguros Bilbao has been operating for over 100 years, and Catalana Occidente has over 150 years of history, so both of them bring a great wealth of expertise in the sector. The Balearic Islands has great importance within the company, as it is one of the places with highest business volume. Our business model is based on the proximity of highly qualified professionals that distribute our products through commercial offices. It is a model based on client service so that advice can be given directly. One thing that clients demand, nationally and foreign, is excellent post-sales service. Our professionals and the services that we cover are what differentiates us. The main economic income of the island is tourism, and that makes it attractive for investors seeking a second home. There are many foreigners from different countries here, mainly European, and culturally these clients place greater importance on insuring their belongings. They also want a service that can explain the regulations of Mallorca in their own language, and we have employees who are able to speak different languages. The more business-orientated clients are usually linked to hotel or hospitality investment and also seek someone who can directly advise them and solve any problems that might occur. Right now, we are ranked the fifth insurance company in Spain, which shows we are an important company within our business.</p>
<p><strong>How has Seguros Bilbao been experiencing the boom in Mallorca&rsquo;s real estate sector?</strong></p>
<p>The main demand has always come from German and English buyers, though we are now seeing more Nordic interest. In general, foreign investors look for luxury properties located on the coastal areas. Personally, I have noticed certain changes that depend on the origin of the investor. For example, there has been more interest from a certain client in more rural areas. In the larger places like Palma, there is a Nordic presence. For example, in Santa Catalina, the old fishing town, we have seen a process of gentrification and more shops and services dedicated to them. Depending on the investor, there are different options within real estate investment. As a result, there are companies and estate agents that specialize in this. There has also been a great impact on prices. When someone request our services, we study the case and offer solutions for potential risks that may happen in the future in any area of their life: the equity of a property, business, or of any other area. We are connected to every sector and receive large amounts of information. Also, throughout COVID-19, we were helping companies manage risk factors and reduce protection costs. We have remained close to our clients and helped them with the information that we have.</p>
<p><strong>How are new sectors in the islands such as sports being reflected in Seguros Bilbao&rsquo;s portfolio?</strong></p>
<p>The Baleares is extremely sport focused, and we have many local athletes as well as people who come here to do sports. Nautical sports are the main star, and we work in this sector via nautical clubs and advisors. It is an important sector due to the advice for boat insurance and also the nautical and marine businesses in the area. There are other sports like golf that are also important, whereby we work with the golf courses. Another sport is cycling, which is common in summer, and we have products that cover cyclists. In 2021, we held Joysail Ibiza for the first time, the first super yacht event ever. We sponsored this event along with Marina Ibiza and STP. The nautical sector is growing significantly right now and creates large sums of money. We also cover the maintenance of these yachts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2022 marks the 10th anniversary of THIQAH. How would you define the evolution and trajectory of the company?</strong></p>
<p>It has been a tremendous 10 years of growth, value creation, and innovation, as we managed through our innovative business model to successfully become the most reputable and fastest-growing company in the digital market within the region through an innovative business model. In 2022 THIQAH will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary. In the past few years, the Kingdom has made major strides according to various global indicators; it is an honor to be a key contributor to that success. Over 10 years we&rsquo;ve grown with our partners and clients in both government and the private sector across 27 countries to provide the most suitable and innovative products. As technology makes life easier for everyone and helps grow the economy, we will continue to learn and create value for our partners and customers.</p>
<p><strong>In Arabic, the word THIQAH means confidence or trust. How do you generate trust among your existing and potential partners?</strong></p>
<p>THIQAH has two main pillars, which are its human capital and the development of successful cooperation. As our team consists of qualified, competitive, and motivated individuals, that adds the human touch to create value in our partnerships. At THIQAH we believe that the concept of trust starts from within, as the human element is essential in choosing the best features such as self-confidence, responsibility, and spirit of cooperation. As trust is the basis of any successful partnership, that achieves our common goals and makes a real impact by providing digital and smart solutions.</p>
<p><strong>What role does sustainability play in your daily operations?</strong></p>
<p>Digital transformation and the enablement of technology is one of the main drivers toward more sustainability, and THIQAH as an organization has made that more possible by leveraging technology and creating a more sustainable ecosystem. We also take pride in being an integral part of society as we have been part of many social initiatives that have a great impact on our community.</p>
<p><strong>How do you instill awareness about your services among the community and partners?</strong></p>
<p>As the demand for technology and digital transformation becomes more and more prominent, we try to showcase our value by providing solutions in a unique way that is flexible to meet market changes through innovative business models that are tailored to enable all stakeholders and create exceptional impact. Over the years this competitive advantage, coupled with our knowledge of the sector, have been an attribute that helps us stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Where are you looking at to expand your operations with new partnerships?</strong></p>
<p>Working with our current partners from the government and private sectors in Saudi Arabia has been, and remains, an amazing journey. We have learned a great deal, and we have been doing a great job in delivering value for our clients, partners, and customers. The market is dynamic, demand is evolving quickly, and we will keep growing and dealing with our partners from the public sector. Additionally, we have expanded in two different directions: we started focusing on the private sector within the kingdom, and we also looked at expanding internationally after the success we&rsquo;ve accomplished locally. We do not look at international opportunities from a general perspective, but rather they are targeted specifically and our impact has reached more than 27 countries around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, you signed different agreements to empower SMEs in the Kingdom. What is your strategy to support them?</strong></p>
<p>We look at SMEs from two different aspects. THIQAH is a growing company, one of the leading players in technology sector in Saudi Arabia, and we believe we can lead the digital transformation in Saudi Arabia. We need a strong SME market within the country so that we can keep growing, and I am pleased that a big part of our projects within THIQAH are in collaboration with SMEs in Saudi as we need a stronger SME market that can support our growth, help us flourish, and achieve our partners&rsquo; and clients&rsquo; objectives and dreams. We want to bring that quality of life by producing great digital products for everyone, as we have remarkable products that really change the game within the sector. A big part of that is developing products that are tailored for SMEs to help them grow locally and internationally. For example, there is an amazing digital platform called Wathq, an online data platform that gives SMEs the ability and opportunity to integrate their products and services with any data set, whether it is private or public. We have also just received an award for this particular product, as the &ldquo;best data management solution provider&rdquo; in the Middle East. Osus, Almwathiq, Maroof, and Etikal are also products that aim to empower the SME market and support them to grow their businesses. These are great examples of how much we pay close attention to SMEs to provide them with the right products to help them flourish.</p>
<p><strong>Consolidating your presence internationally is part of your key priorities. What is your strategy to expand your activity beyond national borders?</strong></p>
<p>In recent years we&rsquo;ve collaborated with different partners in many different countries across the region to solve key problems with our solutions, where in order to leverage our capabilities we need to understand the many aspects in different countries such as the regulatory environment, market needs, adoption of technology, as well as the government strategy toward digital transformation. We&rsquo;ve also expanded our horizon through many different initiatives such as the DCO, which allowed us to collaborate and exchange knowledge with many incredible, impactful organizations internationally as we also monitor new trends in technology, business, and digital transformation to help us learn and adapt our business practices in different regions.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges and obstacles do you expect to face while expanding your business?</strong></p>
<p>Different challenges may come in different forms, as we have learned from past years dealing with the pandemic, but what we have always been able to do is stay focused on the value we generate for our partners and users of our platforms. Different political, social, and economic factors have an impact on the market and in order to deal with that our agility and resilience has been key to our success. One key challenge that has always been at the forefront is people&rsquo;s willingness to change, whereby we have learned in previous years that the market will eventually adapt where the true value of change would be an undeniable proposition to our stakeholders no matter what challenge may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share some of your key priorities set in 2022 agenda?</strong></p>
<p>THIQAH&rsquo;s vision and long-term goals are important for us, as we value long-term goals over short-term ones. We are constantly learning and making sure we will deliver consistent value to our clients, as in the near future we are making sure we expand locally and internationally. We want to expand the reach of our impact and extend the value to partners who truly want to implement positive change as we have with our current partners in many different sectors. Our aim is to lead the digital movement and provide the right context for positive change in that regard. Today, even locally we have expanded our operations as we have opened the largest tech talent center in Jeddah in order to harness the talent in that area and expand our capability to innovate as we plan to create more centers around the kingdom and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you elaborate on AML&rsquo;s significance in Lisbon?</strong></p>
<p>AML is an inter-municipal entity that represents 18 municipalities from the Lisbon metropolitan area. In our metropolitan area, there are almost 3 million people who represent 30% of the Portuguese population and more than 30% of Portugal GDP. We are the most important Portuguese region in terms of contribution to GDP. We are the only region on the Portuguese mainland that is a developed region according to EU Cohesion Policy: we attract many tourists and a large number of economic enterprise and economic sectors. At AML, our main drivers are in three different sectors: mobility and transportation, climate action, and territorial planning. Lisbon was the 2020 European Green Capital Award winner.</p>
<p><strong>What projects do you have in your pipeline to reaffirm AML as a leading player in the field of sustainability?</strong></p>
<p>Our second great driver focuses on climate action and sustainability; we are among the first ones in Portugal to develop a metropolitan plan regarding climate change adaptation. We worked with the central government, municipalities, NGOs, and Lisbon University, among many others, to draw up that plan and have identified the key pillars of action that will underpin the strategy related to the sustainability of Lisbon Metropolitan Area. And now, we are identifying forms of financing for that project. We are working to renew the fleet of buses circulating within our municipalities that will be more technologically advanced and have lower emissions. We are now coordinating series of activities focused on the theme of food security and agri-food parks; we want to rethink our approach to food consumption. We are designing a framework to optimize the production, consumption, and distribution of food in all the schools operating in our municipalities. We are also developing a project with territorial stakeholders with the goal to support local producers, stimulate the central government, gather nutritionists, design new meals, create sustainable packaging, and educate the community of students about the concept of sustainable consumption.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the highlights and milestones of the company since its inception in 2004? </strong></p>
<p>Since our foundation back in 2004, and until 2012, we operated only as developer of highend residential projects in city center prime locations. Right from the start, I decided to hire an internal team of architects and project managers to give me full control of the licensing process and control the quality of works during the construction process. This allowed us to reach a level of experience and knowledge quite distant from most of our competitors, who usually hire external architect and management team to take care of their projects. In 2012, we decided to create an internal team to develop our short term rental business unit, with our brand Lisbon Best Apartments, and since then our operation has grown with enormous success: currently, we successfully manage 45 apartments, the majority of which belong to Coporgest. Later, we started a project of a five-star hotel in Chiado that I expect to open in 2023. More recently, we invested in a magnificent location in Comporta: a property in two minutes away from the beach that will include 71 apartments, 37 villas, and a five-star hotel with 58 rooms and suites.</p>
<p><strong>How does the company shape its competitive advantages in a market characterized by fierce competition?</strong></p>
<p>Our quality of construction has reached a level that is difficult to achieve for most of our competitors. For example, we invest heavily in noise insulation systems, thermic materials, and highly efficient heating solutions, which are extremely important for the final quality of an apartment. We have also learned how to accelerate our production process. For example, our latest investment in Lisbon, in Rua Sousa Martins, was purchased in January 2022, and construction started on June 1. Most of our competitors are miles away from this kind of capacity and concerns, and the fact that I have my internal teams has given us the possibility of accumulating knowledge and skills that are not easy to find among the competition.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

<p>The focus of Avenue&rsquo;s activity is the real estate development, acting mainly in residential and offices sector, in Lisbon and in Porto, that has become a new and appealing market. Currently, we are developing approximately 70,000sqm, in both cities. In the beginning of our activity, we were focused on the redevelopment of historical buildings. In 2017, we decided to increase our activity in the offices sector due to a lack of demand and to the scarcity of good office spaces. That is why we developed Exeo, our flagship in terms of upscaling. EXEO Office Campus has a strategic and central position on the eastern shore of the Lisbon. It has state-of-the-art facilities with a contemporary design including leisure and retail spaces, restaurants, and green areas. Inspired by the concept of well-being and flexibility, the three buildings, Aura, Lumnia, and Echo, reflect these themes. We have completed the first and largest building, Lumnia. The other two buildings, Echo and Aura, are under construction but were sold to BNP Paribas in April 2022.</p>
<p><strong>How many projects do you have today in residential and how many in corporate?</strong></p>
<p>We have completed seven residential developments between 2015 and 2020, and all are 100% sold. Lumnia was completed a few months ago. Currently, under construction, we have five developments: three in Lisbon (two office developments and one residential) and two in Porto (both residential).</p>
<p><strong>How do you shape your competitive advantage in such a small and dynamic market? </strong></p>
<p>There are approximately 20 relevant players in the market. We think that the competition has been stable over the last years. Since the beginning, we always wanted to focus on demand. When we started in 2015, we noticed interest from both local clients as well as international clients in the high-end residential segment and in city center locations. That is why we developed our activity mainly in the premium residential segment. At that point, we decided to invest in Porto as well, because there was less competition in a context where new demand is increasing, and this market turned out to reveal better yields from the client&rsquo;s investment perspective. At the same time, we looked into the office segment. We realized we could anticipate demand by doing excellent quality developments. We also invested in retail, although it is a complementary activity, as our main strategic focus is on residential and offices. We are now working on having residential offers to lease and to sell focusing more on the local demand and less dependent on the international market.</p>
<p><strong>Limiting and containing the environmental impact is turning into a priority for every business.</strong> <strong>How do you apply to your projects?</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is a pivotal aspect of our approach to the way we think and implement new projects. We need to be sustainable in the way we build. To achieve that sustainability and, furthermore, neutrality, it is critical to have reliable suppliers, compensating every single step of the construction process. We make sure that the buildings that we create will be efficient not only during the construction process, but also when in operation. Exeo is a good example of that approach. We worked hard on the concept of the building, and we considered all the details. The architecture of the buildings was designed to benefit from the sun&rsquo;s exposure and to collect rainwater, which is then recycled to irrigate the gardens, just to mention some of the sustainable measures that were implemented.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main objectives for 2022?</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, we intend to continue the developments in progress and reinforce our commitment with additional investment in new opportunities in both residential and offices. Alternative segments can also be considered. Sustainability will be a priority in the agenda for 2022 and for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you elaborate on the operations of PTPC? </strong></p>
<p>PTPC&rsquo;s mission is to implement R&amp;D and innovation initiatives and projects promoting the cooperation between companies, R&amp;D entities, associations, public and private entities from the construction and public works sector. Currently, it gathers more than 50 associates that represent the sector in all segments of its value chain (technical, technological, research and development). PTPC is the mirror association of the European Construction Technology Platform (ECTP), thus fostering new collaborations between the members of PTPC and other European entities. PTPC is the managing entity of Cluster AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction), recognized by Portuguese government.</p>
<p><strong>Was the pandemic an obstacle or an opportunity for the Portuguese business community?</strong></p>
<p>Just like other industries with the pandemic, we have learned to work in different ways, with more flexibility; however, almost all of the activities in the construction process are physical (onsite). Digitalization, and especially the adoption of building information modelling (BIM), opens the opportunity to spend more time in planning (off-site) and less time executing (on-site) so construction could be a more virtual activity. In addition, prefabrication and automation will reduce the demand for labor, which is hard to find.</p>
<p><strong>How does PTPC innovate and apply the concept of innovation in its daily operations? </strong></p>
<p>One great example of how PTPC innovates is the Rev@Construction&mdash;Digital Construction Revolution consortium, a project led by Teixeira Duarte which includes two other major construction companies, Mota-Engil and Grupo Casais, and other construction and design companies, universities, RTO, and public entities, in a total of 20 members of PTPC, which will jointly cooperate in order to promote the digital transformation of the AEC sector. This mobilizing project will promote the &ldquo;democratizing&rdquo; of everyone&rsquo;s access to digital methodologies in a movement never seen in the construction sector in Portugal. It will be developing tools and a platform that standardize and systematize rules for digitization; applications for the digitization of construction processes; development of the Digital Twin concept in the construction and facility management; tools and a platform that will standardize and systematize a set of rules, which are essential to reach the desired level of digitization in design, tender, construction, and operation; digital applications representing the construction and operation specialties, which allow considerable gains in productivity (5- 17%). The Digital Twin developments will allow framing of the principles of energy efficiency and circular construction, being a powerful support tool for lifecycle analysis and benefit-cost analysis, as well as for maintenance and asset management activities.</p>
<p><strong>What are the expansion plans of PTPC?</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing is to intensify the activity of Built CoLAB, our technical team of more than 25 high qualified human resources for innovation. This year, we will create a digital innovation hub focused on contributing to the twin transition of construction, according to the European Commission strategy for the Digital Europe Program and supported by competence and skill creation; innovation ecosystem and networking; support to find investment; and allow SMEs and Public Administration Entities to test before investing. DIGITALbuilt&rsquo;s general objectives are the digital capacitation and inclusion of the built environment agents involved in the construction, mineral resources, and railway sectors.</p>
<p><strong>What are your targets for 2022 and your medium-term outlook?</strong></p>
<p>To face the huge challenge of the twin transition (digital and ecological) in construction, the main trends are, in the short to midterm, the digitalization automation (re-industrialization) to increase productivity within the construction industry and at the same time working on proceedings, mechanisms, and measures to promote ecological performance. In the long term, we need to fully integrate the principles of circularity so that new buildings should be designed for deconstruction and reuse. For that, we need to develop adequate standardization, create materials passports, and with the digital twin we will have the traceability of these construction components that will be the &ldquo;gold for tomorrow&rdquo; for construction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>With more than 240 years of operations, Garland is one of the oldest Portuguese companies operating in logistics. How has the company evolved over time?</strong></p>
<p>We have seen continued growth in the last 10 years and restructured the group such that we are currently focused on three sectors: logistics, transport, and shipping. The focus of the group in the last few years has been to improve our infrastructure in two areas. One is the IT side, and we have been investing heavily to upgrade our IT infrastructure. We have a plan all the way through to 2025. The other side has been in infrastructures of logistical centers. We have invested in this because the market does not necessarily offer the best solutions. By the end of 2022, we should have anywhere between 135,000 to 150,000sqm of logistic infrastructure that have all the necessary requisites to be cost effective and productive in offering solutions. Outside of Portugal, we are in two countries, Spain and Morocco, where we are quickly growing and expanding. In both cases, it was because customers drove us to those places. We are looking at possibly creating a transport hub in Spain and looking at where opportunities emerge.</p>
<p><strong>What factors distinguish Garland from the competition, allowing it to lead the market? </strong></p>
<p>The key factors are people and technology. We place great importance on the way we look after our staff and give them the conditions to work in the best possible way with training and other benefits. We consider ourselves a family. Garland also has the know-how and a solid reputation. We are a flexible company, which is extremely important. We are small in the global market, but reasonably big in our local market. We have a strong market position in all three sectors that we are involved in. We are fairly different from the other multinationals in that we have built up an asset base. We own about 50% of our properties and warehouses. This makes us strong financially, especially when there were economic crises in the country. Considering our history, we have built up a large network of global partners, several of which we have worked with for many years. This gives us a global reach where we can do transport basically wherever we want.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the key emerging trends and challenges in the maritime industry?</strong></p>
<p>The natural trend will be towards increased shipping, regardless of the necessary investment in new and more efficient technologies to increase the environmental sustainability and energy efficiency of this sector. From an environmental point of view, maritime transport will always be the most efficient for long distances and high volumes of cargo. In cruises, the recovery has been gradual, but the industry looks to the future with confidence and enthusiasm, with cruise lines forecasting to have 100% of their fleets back in service by spring/summer 2022 and estimating occupancy rates to steadily increase month on month, and even return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels by late summer 2022.</p>
<p><strong>What impact did the pandemic have on the port&rsquo;s operations?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding cargo operations and after a 37.25% reduction in general cargo in 2020 compared to 2019, 2021 was a year of recovery for the Port of Lisbon. In 2021, approximately 9.4 million tons of cargo were handled, an increase of 4.5% compared to the previous year. With regard to cruise activity at the Port of Lisbon, after more than a year without commercial calls cruise activity was authorized in the ports of the national mainland territory as of May 2021. The first call at the Port of Lisbon after the stoppage caused by the pandemic situation took place in July 2021, with the arrival of the World Navigator.</p>
<p><strong>The Port of Lisbon won, for the sixth time, the Europe&rsquo;s Leading Cruise Port 2020 from World Travel Awards Europe. What factors underpin this achievement?</strong></p>
<p>Port of Lisbon has worked and will continue to work, together with the concessionaire LCP and the remaining partners, in pursuit of a common goal: to enhance the port and the city of Lisbon as a sustainable cruise destination of excellence. This award represents the determination and commitment of all stakeholders who contributed to the success: the port authority, the terminal operator and all partners committed to a structural development</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have you been working on diversifying your portfolio? </strong></p>
<p>Our traditional sector has been exports of food and beverages. We also have an distinct characteristic in the market in Portugal in that we have a significant customer base outside Portugal, mainly importers. They are distributors or retailers at end destinations who need a reliable partner to coordinate supplier management and logistics from the point the origin. Lately, we have expanded into construction&mdash;a strong sector in Portugal&mdash;and other Portuguese products such as cork and textiles. We have also diversified services across trades, expanding from our traditional trade which has been and still is with the US and the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Here in Portugal, you represent COSCO SHIPPING, one of the largest shipping lines in the world. What is the importance of this partnership? </strong></p>
<p>COSCO SHIPPING Lines is a multinational company, based in Shanghai, mainly engaged in domestic and international maritime container transport services and related businesses. It has nine overseas branches in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, West Asia, South America, Australia, Japan, Korea, and Africa. By April 2021, it owned and operated 403 container vessels in and out of 558 ports with a total capacity of 2.2 million TEUs, ranking fourth in the world in terms of shipping capacity. The collaboration between our companies and COSCO began in the 1990s. Despite being an independent agency, we are deeply interconnected. Recently, COSCO transferred the intra-Europe Services to Diamond Line (a wholly-owned subsidiary) to be in a better position to improve overall customer service in Europe. We identify with its mission, customer focus, digitalization, and end-to-end to enhance customers&rsquo; experience and continuously create greater value for customers and partners. The secret ingredient to this long partnership is trust. That, and some hard work, has made us obtain improving conditions to develop the market in Portugal. As a result, our market share has grown, from less than 1% five years ago to over 8% in the Asia trade. What does innovation means at Euroatla, and how much are you investing in it to make your operations more agile? It is fundamental to invest in digital technology. This industry is moving away from paper and adopting digital. Seven years ago, when we rethought our strategy as a company, we decided it was strategic to be on top of every technological development in the sector. The way we adapted to the pandemic confirmed that we made the right investment. Thanks to online communication tools, technology enables us to work remotely without any loss of productivity. Connectivity is better now than it has ever been. We believe technology will divide the industry between the companies with a vision, and those not willing to invest. There is also the challenge of cyber risk management that we have been addressing. The supply chain is a very fragmented market with participants who largely rely on paper; the biggest issue now is how do we share the data? Probably blockchain will have a long-term role to play.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main targets and ambitions set for 2022? </strong></p>
<p>Demand has picked up heavily, and scarcity of supply is a big issue. Our budget and activities plan for 2022 were initially conceived with the optimistic expectation of getting back to a situation more similar to the pre-pandemic. We are monitoring the impact of the inflation and interest rates, the price of commodities such as wheat, the chaos in global food markets brought on by the war in Ukraine, and the long-term disruption to Russian energy flows and its impact on what was already a tight global oil market. Volatility and uncertainty have become a way of life, We might continue to experience for a while longer voyages and lead times, and problems of availability and cost, but we think it is feasible that customers will remain well served. We will keep aiming to create agile and creative solutions to our evolving customer&rsquo;s needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We promote the research and comprehensive broadcasting of logistics knowledge and supply chain management, in general and on specific topics, in collaboration with public entities, universities, and institutes. Our main purpose is also to foster debate, knowledge sharing, and experiences between companies and professionals from different activity sectors, as well as national and international researchers and experts, to enable innovation and knowledge transfer in the field of supply chain management.</p>
<p><strong>How does APLOG help companies improve the quality of their logistics management? </strong></p>
<p>Our strong training programs, both certified and customs developed, are a reference in the market and continue to prepare logistics professionals to face all the new challenges in the sector, supporting them in their careers and qualifications at a European standard level. Additionally, APLOG conducts several events, seminars, webinars, and conferences, covering the major trends and challenges that companies are facing in the current environment (e.g., last mile and city logistics, sustainability, decarbonization, risk, and resilience). We hold an annual two-day congress with more than 300 attendees where we present and discuss major trends, issues, and challenges that the logistics sector is facing. This has been a reference event in the Portuguese logistics community for more than 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>How is the ongoing digitalization process shaping and boosting the performance of the players operating within the local market?</strong></p>
<p>This is an area where we still have a long way to go. Small steps are under way to respond to high growth in e-commerce, but major digital transformation projects are still a vision to pursue, regarding analytical capabilities to deal with demand volatility, short and agile planning cycles, use of AI in logistics process management, and so on. A large investment program is expected to happen in the Portuguese economy taking advantage of the European funds available. There is awareness and a sense of urgency, so we hope it will be accelerated in the coming years. Looking at the logistics function capabilities, a step change will probably occur soon as the platforms as-a-service business models increase their relevance in the market.</p>
<p><strong>What are your short- and medium-term targets? </strong></p>
<p>Customer centricity and experience are now part of the strategy definition for companies in almost all sectors. Today, consumers are better informed, more connected, and more demanding. Exposure to new business models and the preponderance of digital channels has created high expectations. The answer to these challenges implies the orchestration of a set of capabilities, internal and external, and different, more collaborative and more segmented models: the strengthening of demand planning capacities as a whole and response agility and speed are key factors to succeed, recognition that &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; models are unlikely to be efficient and effective in dealing with multiple customer segments, resulting in the creation of micro supply chains, physical and/ or virtual. Portugal has a fundamental challenge to smart invest the available budget in the European funds, choosing the right bets to transform the economy in a much more modern and competitive model. Particular attention in the logistics sector in selected investments in key fundamental infrastructures along with transformation of services providers capabilities and solution offers are mandatory in the coming three to five years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In Portugal, IBM is focusing its operations on hybrid cloud and AI. Can you tell us more about these divisions? </strong></p>
<p>We changed significantly over the last year; we changed the company totally and our strategy is particularly focused on what we call hybrid cloud and AI. The two main areas in our strategy are to bring technology to the market and customer and, in addition, introduce the idea of expertise. Therefore, we put together these strategies with the best people to implement it. Accordingly, we created a new consultant group with people with considerable experience in building projects around these areas, among others. Thus, we combine the best of the technology with the best of expertise into dynamic solutions. Another important aspect of this change for adding value to the strategy is the overall ecosystem. So, working with local or international partners that can bring value to this change is also crucial. Bringing people with wider experience and other software that can integrate with ours and who can work inside our completely open hybrid cloud always brings value to us and our customers. We have identified the need to change our culture internally as well, having changed the culture to focus on this. We create new roles with people who have considerable knowledge, who are always studying developments, and who become part of this transformation from the outset. These collaborators are responsible for taking the message to the customer. Also of great importance as part of our new strategy at IBM was the change in our go-to-market model. The net effect of the change was better communication with the customer.</p>
<p><strong>What are your short-term objectives and the main targets on your agenda? </strong></p>
<p>What I have in mind for 2022-2023 is to grow by single digits, as the corporation has set this as the acceptable minimum. I want to increase the number of employees in Portugal. We have around 100 openings at the moment, even if the applicants do not speak Portuguese. We have four innovation centers in Portugal, and we want to open a fifth, and probably a sixth in 2023. One of my objectives is to grow and boost the performance of these centers. There are many opportunities in the interior of the country that, if tapped, will work to the advantage of Portugal as a whole, while bringing considerable local benefit.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What specific division currently drives the growth and expansion of BI4ALL? </strong></p>
<p>Data analytics drives our growth. Since the beginning, we have had a strong specialization in pharma and life sciences, one of our biggest client is one of the Top 10 Pharmaceutical companies in the World. Over the years, we have been acquiring a unique experience and extensive knowledge of several business sectors and business functions. BI4ALL allows companies to have competitive advantages by turning their data into insights. Focused on goals, value creation, innovation and delivery, we help organizations to achieve better results by optimizing their organizational structure and control systems, allowing them to have solutions that optimize decision-making. Along its path to success, BI4ALL has helped many clients accomplish their goals. We have the competencies and know-how to be the strongest company operating in data analytics. We provide services in the analytic spectrum to national and international community. Innovation is part of our DNA. When we started this project almost 20 years ago, our dream was to be the best in the market. We want to deliver quality to our customer. Even today, it remains our main goal, which is why we are successful. Our projects depend on our quality and culture.</p>
<p><strong>What are the competitive advantages of BI4ALL that gives the company a leading position in the market? </strong></p>
<p>Knowledge and quality are the key elements that underpin our success and leading position in the market. We cultivate talent, we constantly train our human resources, and we are able to retain them. The competencies and know-how of our team ensure our success. That is why we established a knowledge center, that also create a bridge between universities and the business community where through our Talent Academy, we intend, in 2022, to support the entry of more than 40 young graduates into the job market, through an intensive and paid training program, with a theoretical and practical basis developed by specialists and dedicated to young people passionate about technology. We train dozens of promising students every year and prepare them for the market. We are picking people from the best universities in Portugal at this moment. There are more and more competitors and companies coming to Portugal to acquire resources. Despite the growing competition, we are able to retain the best human capital&mdash;that makes the company efficient and competitive. BI4ALL bets on the continuous appreciation and the hiring of the best talents, and its team is made up of highly qualified professionals. We see the company as an extension of our family. It is more difficult today because we are a big family with more than 300 people, and it is a significant challenge for us to maintain this morale. Our main asset remains our people.</p>
<p><strong>Can you shed some light on your internationalization and expansion strategy? </strong></p>
<p>More than 50% of the company revenue comes from outside Portugal, and in the next five years, we expect to get 85-90%. Portugal is a limited market. Our strategic plan for the next five years is to strongly invest outside of Portugal. We need to expand and open offices outside of Portugal. We plan to start with Switzerland because we already have customers there. With the pandemic, this development outside of Portugal has slowed down. We have a high level of knowledge so we can penetrate international sophisticated markets: by doing that, we will ensure both the solid growth of our operations and allow our human capital to sharpen its know-how. Our team will be enriched by new international challenges and experiences related to the most dynamic and demanding markets in the world. Throughout 2022 and in the coming years, we want to continue to reinforce our strengths in the area of specialization we dominate, always keeping in mind the objective of continuing to grow and evolve our clients, nationally and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us a brief summary on the evolution of SoftFinan&ccedil;a?</strong></p>
<p>I founded the company 31 years ago in 1990. We perceived an opportunity for a company to be focused on developing software for the financial market. Fintechs did not exist when we started, but today we see what they are all about. There were only two companies in Portugal at that time focused solely on the financial market, and we were one of them. We started as a project company developing projects for the financial market, namely banks and insurance companies, covering solutions from the mainframe to the branch. We&rsquo;ve been doing this for many years, so we&rsquo;ve acquired the knowledge and skills to make the shift that we made some seven, eight years ago to being a product driven company. With the majority of the projects we have done at SoftFinan&ccedil;a, we realized there was a middle ground between the institution and the client. That wasn&rsquo;t a strategy as such, just something that happened a couple of times, and from then on, we capitalized on that specific know-how. Those were and are the channels of the bank or institution. This kind of relationship between the institution and the client is even more relevant today. Key factors in this business are user experience, convenience, and ubiquity. Predictions are that around 80% of physical banks could well disappear by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Considering this premise, what is the impact of digitalization on local financial institutions? </strong></p>
<p>That vision would be the trend and I also agree with it. Things are moving more in that direction daily. That&rsquo;s the reason why the relationship between the institutions and clients is so important. We are specialists in self-service solutions at SoftFinan&ccedil;a. To simplify, let&rsquo;s say that we have fewer bank notes in our wallet, even though there are still some ATMs in operation. We are constantly heading toward a paperless world. We have seen many changes with the relationship dynamics between customers and the banking industry with customers coming in and out of their branches. One example is having ATMs outside the financial institutions. Even though it takes the customer out of the branch, it speeds up the transaction process, provides convenience and is less expensive. Then, all of a sudden, clients were pushed out of the branch and started to do other things like online banking from their home computer. Again, that took clients out of the branch, so banks didn&rsquo;t have them on their premises and were struggling to get them back.</p>
<p><strong>Since they couldn&rsquo;t speak with the clients, how could they sell their products? </strong></p>
<p>This is the cycle of an app, as the relationship between institutions and clients is a delicate balance. When we look into the evolution of the number of bank branches per inhabitant in Madrid, for example, we see branches from the same institution on both sides of the street in close proximity. The same phenomenon exists in Portugal. The ongoing challenge is to establish a digital connection with your customer. I have no doubt that physical banks will tend to disappear, and banks for day-today retail banking lean more toward digital options for cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main targets for 2022-2023?</strong></p>
<p>We are focused on selling abroad, but we are not looking to open offices here and there. We believe that one of the keys to success is having good local partners because there is a culture and a local network that you can&rsquo;t ensure yourself in another country. You share what you should share, build trust through relationships, and reap the returns on that. We opened in Senegal because we thought it was the best path, and the objective is to broaden our client base there and sell abroad. We are selling increasingly in Portugal even though the market is not particularly elastic. In 2022, we expect to significantly increase our international revenue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Intelcia started operating in Portugal in 2018. How have the operations of the company evolved? </strong></p>
<p>I was the first employee of Intelcia in Portugal, challenged to start it from scratch, taking care of all legal aspects, finding the right space, managing the logistics and construction work, and finally recruiting the team to set up the company. The goals behind establishing Intelcia in Portugal were to be the main supplier of Altice, a hub in terms of multilingual skills for international projects, and the most reliable supplier for the local market. We work with international players, and we are the preferred supplier of Altice, managing its stores, the customer experience, technical back office, retention telemarketing, and all the services for the entire customer journey of its clients. In just three years, we have established a team of 7,000 people, and we currently have one director for the Portuguese market and one director for the international market. The business is divided into 5,000 people focused on the Portuguese market and 2,000 with multilingual skills, where we provide services in Spanish, English, Dutch, French, and German.</p>
<p><strong>What is the key factor underpinning the positive performance of Intelcia in Portugal? </strong></p>
<p>As CEO, my main concern is not to lose the human touch while growing more successful. Intelcia is a big company, with EUR120 million in revenue forecast for 2022. In Portugal, we have had rapid growth in the last two years, and our team drives our business with the support of technology, and we only achieve that because we have excellent people who are involved, engaged, and committed. It is fundamental that they believe in our strategy and we have some measures in place to ensure that, since 80% of our product comprises a human component and the remaining 20% technology. Our values are simple: we dream, we care, and we do. We dream with boldness and ambition for a better tomorrow; we care for our people, as it lies at the heart of our management; and we do, working hard to provide the best service to our clients. We are a human focused company, which is why we involve engaged people to be part of the company to provide the best service to our clients as we believe that this is how we differentiate ourselves in the market. The strategy to retain our talent is to provide a great environment for our employees, and follow closely the changes. We have implemented weekly engagement and satisfaction reports, and we analyze them with each business director to prevent turnover. To better understand the levels of engagement of our talent and be able to retain them, we have implemented a program called Intelcia Journey where we define the journey of each employee and make sure to ask them during every touchpoint their opinion of the company and measure the NPS. We measure that every six months per project and share the result with the rest of the teams so that we can take actions and share best practices. </p>
<p><strong>How do you embrace the concept of technology without losing your human touch? </strong></p>
<p>We combine and merge the two concepts of people with innovation. Our challenge for 2022 is to implement E-voluciona in the Portuguese market. This is our brand that supports clients to implement a successful customer journey combining people and technology to provide an efficient and delightful customer experience. If we want to be ready for the future, we need to embrace technology with a human touch, and we will continue our implementation of analytics tolls and processes, RPA, and automation in the company. For our clients, there is also customer experience consultancy, namely technology to facilitate the power of the human touch of the company</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you support the financial sector in rethinking the business paradigm and applying digitalization to their operations?</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 served as an incentive to accelerate current developments, and it will certainly proceed in this direction. We will continue to have a deeper role in this particular sector, and we want to do our best by supporting banks move forward through advanced digital technologies. To stay relevant, banks need to establish a radical transformation. We will continue what we have been doing for the past 30 years, but focusing on speeding up procedures.</p>
<p><strong>How would you assess the level of digitalization of companies in Portugal specifically?</strong></p>
<p>As far as the concept of digitalization is concerned, the Portuguese economy has a long way to go. Examining banks in general, the sector should focus on redesigning processes having digitalization in mind. That might make sense for both financial institutions and the final customer: a renewal is mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>In 2021, Asseco PST acquired a majority stake of Finantech. What is the importance of this acquisition?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, we had a strong year. During the pandemic, we acquired Finantech, which has been operating for the past 25 years and is the market leader in Portugal providing tech solutions for capital markets. For us, as a core banking software developer and producer, there was a natural fit and great synergy between these two companies, which is why we felt a union would be beneficial. While we are present in Portugal, we have a strong presence in Portuguese-speaking African markets, and some are leaning to capital markets. Finantech will serve as a platform to leverage our expertise in these markets.</p>
<p><strong>How do you establish your leadership within the sec-tor in such a small country?</strong></p>
<p>Competition is high. Portugal is relatively a small country, but it has, I believe, seven unicorns, while Spain has one. We can see different global providers setting up offices in Portugal, and all these global competitors place a substantial pressure in terms of human resources. It is important, as a country, to graduate more people in the IT sector by creating ways to encourage them to switch careers into this area. We must continue to do what we have been doing successfully in the past.&nbsp; </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the current developments defining the Portuguese renewable sector?</strong></p>
<p>The market of renewables is quickly becoming one of the most dynamic segments of the national economy. Ease of doing and starting a business in Portugal is much easier today, and the renewable market has become more transparent since the auction system was implemented in 2019. Based on the national energy mix and outstanding local resources, renewables are a necessity and an opportunity at the same time. In 2018, Akuo decided to set up a branch in Portugal. When we entered the market, the sector was not as regulated as it is today. The main challenge was related to the grid connection, which is the main bottleneck for a quicker penetration of renewables. In 2019, the government realized the importance of allowing companies and operators to bid on the grid and get the best value for this scarce public good. It was a good time for us, as we entered the market in 2018, we had all the time needed to prepare for this auction securing land across the key solar regions of the country. We managed to be among the awarded bidders with 370MW (three lots) of grid connection in Alentejo region. For the group worldwide, we have currently 1.2-1.3GWp in operation. So, after ensuring 450MWp in Portugal, we can proudly declare that 20-25% of the group&rsquo;s total capacity will be in Portugal. Winning this auction cemented Akuo Portugal as a leading contributor to Akuo worldwide. It is a major achievement for the company.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main ongoing projects, and what is Akuo&rsquo;s business model?</strong></p>
<p>The main projects of Akuo in Portugal are the three projects secured at the 2019 solar auction. We aim to start construction this year following the last two difficult years. In November 2021, a public session with the presence of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Environment and Climate Action, and the Secretary of State for Energy was held in Monforte, which is the most advanced of the three projects. It has 180MWp, and construction should start shortly. We are facing challenges mainly linked to increase of investment cost and disruptions of supply chains driven by commodity prices increase and the war context. On the other side, the importance of renewables is currently emphasized given their fundamental role for the EU energy independence. Akuo&rsquo;s business model, is always the same: we keep the assets. We generate our revenue selling electricity. This model implies that we will develop, finance, build and operate the asset. Traditionally, companies operating in the sector developed and sold the asset to other companies. They make money from the sale of the product. We make money from the sale of electricity. We have a long-term vision, characterized by a long-term positioning in the market. Akuo has a strong commitment in Portugal. We are developing projects to operate them in the long term&mdash;30 years&mdash;we took the decision to set up our internal operation in maintenance. The O&amp;M and Asset Management local company will provide services to our three projects and will also be able to sell service to third parties in the market at competitive price.</p>
<p><strong>How will do you differentiate yourselves in what is a small, competitive market?</strong></p>
<p>The market is getting increasingly competitive. To make a difference, a long-term vision is key. Even 25 years might not be long enough to make a return on an investment. It would take 30 years to bring out the big players&rsquo; financial power that had a long-term vision to make a difference. It is not a market or investors that want a high return quick. It is a market for the very long term at a steady pace. Second, we are a private company. Akuo&rsquo;s two owners offer the company flexibility, which is an advantage. We are quick to take decisions and are able to take risks, which is key in a fast-moving, changing environment.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the current scenario and the trends related to renewables in Portugal?</strong></p>
<p>The deployed capacity in renewable energies has increased significantly in recent years, more specifically an increase of 59 % from 2005 to 2021, which demonstrates the investment that has been made in the sustainable development of the energy sector and that shall continue, to achieve the decarbonisation targets for Portugal by 2050. In 2021, we must mention the high increase in installed solar photovoltaic capacity, which increased by 73% YoY. Alongside this increase in renewable power, there was a fall in the installed capacity of technologies dependent on fossil fuels. In addition to the increase in installed renewable power, the country is setting new targets and defining new paths that aim to ensure a fair and secure energy transition to answer to the Fit for 55% and more recently the REPowerEU, which will disclose opportunities on all generation value chain, including decentralized production of renewable electricity through self-consumption and renewable energy communities, energy storage, green hydrogen, and ocean energy technologies. Currently, Portugal has about 63% of its electricity production from renewable energy sources. According to the Portuguese National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP 2030), the target for incorporating renewables into electricity consumption is 80% by 2030, supported by an increase in the deployed capacity of renewable energy technologies, mostly solar photovoltaic (9GW) and onshore wind (3.6GW). However, due to the current situation in Ukraine and the following energy crisis, the Portuguese government, in response to the Commission&rsquo;s initiative REPowerEU, anticipated the 80% target to 2026, published a Decree-Law to simplify the permitting process of renewable energy projects and announced the intention to hold a capacity auction for offshore wind that will allocate 2-5GW, which is a much higher target than the 0.3 GW pointed out in the NECP 2030.</p>
<p><strong>How is APREN positioned to promote a higher share of renewable electricity in order to support the reduction of CO2 emissions and fight climate change?</strong></p>
<p>APREN&rsquo;s mission is to promote the deployment of renewable technologies for electricity and green hydrogen generation; support, encourage and collaborate directly with policymakers and government entities to create a sustainable and cost-effective strategy for the renewable energy sector; support, advise, and promote renewable direct and indirect electrification; and enlighten and disseminate the importance and quality of the Portuguese endogenous energy resources. APREN has an important role as the representative of the renewable energy sector near the official entities, working daily to ensure an open dialogue between the various stakeholders and the sustainable development of the sector, having always represented the view and strategy of its members. Considering that Portugal is a privileged country, given its geography and investment in the renewable sector, renewables are already contributing to a significantly greener Portugal. Nevertheless, there are still hot topics that barriers to the sector deployment which APREN works to guarantee that it is always on top of relevant issues to properly find and propose solutions that promote the direct and indirect electrification since it is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>What are the medium-term objectives of APREN, and what are the targets of association set in your 2022 agenda?</strong></p>
<p>In regard to our medium-term objectives, our central goal of promoting the renewables deployment in the country and underlining the central role Portugal can have in this sector remains on the top of our priorities. Given the actual context, where it became even more urgent to not only diminish all climate impacts but also to create an energy independent Europe, we intend to do so by maximizing renewable energy deployment on our national energy mix, following the key topic that currently constitute the main blockades such as an adequate and resilient network and energy integrated systems, market and regulatory stability, energy literacy across the society and adequate knowledge creation and human resources training to complete all tasks mentioned.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the outbreak of the pandemic impact the local economy in general, and specifically, what was its impact on CCIP?</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 gave us a good and bad results. The good news has been the digitalization process; we never would have grown so fast on that side without the obligation to do so. During these hard times, we worked to support everyone, opening lines directly for members and non-members to get in touch with us for support to overcome difficulties. CCIP is fully supported by private interests; we do not receive a cent from the government. This means that we have the capacity to really help if someone comes to us for support. The pandemic impacted the activity of CCIP as well, and we are trying to get back to the way we used to work. We have developed digital capacities, but, at the same time, have lost many relationships. The digitalization we have pursued is ideal in building the capacity required for us to be flexible, but not as a substitute for the way we used to work. This is what I expect: a return to the way we used to work. Being human, we must continue to cultivate relationships in person. Ultimately, we need human, not digital, relations.</p>
<p><strong>How would you evaluate the Portuguese business community&rsquo;s capacity for internationalization?</strong></p>
<p>Portugal has an extraordinary capacity for building relations and creating bonds. If you go anywhere in the world, you will likely find a Portuguese person solving issues because it is our very way of living. We also have one strong characteristic; we always worry about the other person&rsquo;s feelings. This is something that gives us knowledge and an understanding of what you need. Therefore, it is extremely easy for us to supply your needs. This is what makes the Portuguese so successful in commercial activity and problem solving. We were rather closed for some years in Portugal, but now we are rebuilding this capacity. We have been growing our internationalization over the past decade, and we have a huge capacity to do so. Moreover, Portugal does not have a big market, so we really need to look abroad. We have to transform Portugal into a platform that can bring people together. This way we can return to the global stage and also send our people to build bridges between people, companies, and countries.</p>
<p><strong>How are you expanding the member list of CCIP, and which sector do you wish to see grow in terms of representation within the chamber?</strong></p>
<p>We are both open and global. And while we are here to serve small and medium-sized companies, we need the larger ones to give us the capacity to serve the others. We therefore try to mix our members not based on sector, but on respective strengths. We do not care whether we have more industrial, commercial, or agricultural companies on board. It is unlikely for us to have tourist companies, because there is a confederation of tourism in operation. They do not really need much support, but we have a number of firms who are members for networking purposes.</p>
<p><strong>What are your main objectives for the chamber? </strong></p>
<p>The first is to secure sufficient capacity of influence; I would like the government to ensure that the money that we will reinvest in our country in recovery from the pandemic is genuinely used for development. The second objective is to work toward larger firms here achieving similar productivity levels as any other country in Europe. We also want to develop an educational initiative concerning the leadership of small and medium companies. We have already started a post-graduate course with NOVA University, with classes designed for managers and owners of small and medium sized companies. I truly believe that by doing this, we can foster productivity and support the national economy as a whole.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe current bilateral relations between Italy and Portugal?</strong></p>
<p>Relations between Italy and Portugal are based on a solid friendship between the two countries and on an alignment of views that is reflected in the coordinated and convergent action carried out by our two countries within the EU and in the main international fora. In the last two years, there has been an unprecedented strengthening at all levels of the already excellent relations. An indicator of this qualitative leap is the number of institutional visits: 11 members of government visited Portugal. The economic and trade indicators also clearly show this new stage in relations. In 2021, bilateral trade increased from EUR5.9 billion in 2020 to a record value of more than EUR7 billion, an increase of 19%, even surpassing the EUR6.8 billion in 2019. In 2021, our exports rose by 17.8%, allowing us to maintain our position as Portugal&rsquo;s fifth-largest supplier and to obtain a surplus of EUR1.3 billion. Our imports from Portugal also grew in 2022, proving the complementarity and mutual attractiveness of our markets. Investors from both countries are looking with growing interest at the opportunities that their respective production systems can offer and are developing projects in various sectors. At the end of 2021, Italian company Kerakoll invested more than EUR11 million in a production plant in the north of Lisbon, while, during the same period, the Portuguese utility EDP announced the launch of two 70-MW wind farms, bringing the company&rsquo;s installed capacity in Italy to 385MW. More recently, Endesa, a subsidiary of Enel, won the tender for the green transition of Pego power plant, the country&rsquo;s last coal-fired plant. This renewed focus on Portugal by Italian companies and investors is also accompanied by the choice of professionals, digital nomads, researchers and families, who, attracted by the quality of life of the fourth-safest country in the world, are increasingly supporting the growth of the Italian resident community here, which has now exceeded 21,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>What specific sectors of the Portuguese economy can Italians support?</strong></p>
<p>The two economies offer great potential for collaboration, and there are complementarities in many sectors, also due to the structure of the industrial system of both countries, mainly composed of SMEs. The areas in which Italian expertise, technology, and creativity can contribute to the Portuguese economy include both traditional and emerging sectors linked to the twin transitions&mdash;energy and digital&mdash;and the EU Recovery Funds. Among the sectors in which relations are already consolidated and new spaces for cooperation may emerge include automotive, textile, footwear, and construction. In areas related to the twin transitions, Italian companies can provide a valuable contribution regarding decarbonization technologies, renewable energies, the digital sector, and ICT. Opportunities are emerging also in relatively new sectors including pharmaceutical and biomedical, real estate/tourism, and the blue-economy, which is particularly relevant in view of the UN Ocean Conference taking place in Lisbon.</p>
<p><strong>As the head of the mission, what is your main target set in your 2022 agenda?</strong></p>
<p>The objective I have been pursuing since my arrival has always been to stimulate the already excellent bilateral relations in all their aspects. This means involving both the entire Italian Institutional and entrepreneurial system present in Portugal&mdash;including the Italian Institute of Culture, the ICE Agency and the Italian Chamber of Commerce for Portugal&mdash;as well as the main Portuguese players in the economic-commercial and cultural sectors. This creates a virtuous collaborative network that will surely increase the Italian interest and knowledge of this extraordinary country. In the economic-commercial sector, I will continue the activities already implemented, whose positive results are reflected in the statistics of bilateral trade and investment, placing Portugal even more in the spotlight of the Italian economic system. I am sure that this increased attention toward Portugal will enable our companies to know the country better and fully understand its great potential in terms of trade and investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The international context in which we are holding our discussion has changed profoundly, and we cannot ignore the Russian Federation&rsquo;s unjustifiable aggression against Ukraine. We stand by the Ukrainian people and, while the fate of Europe is at stake, it seems more necessary than ever to have the courage to look to the future, to imagine how culture can be a vehicle for peace.</p>
<p>For our countries, therefore, the theme chosen for this year&rsquo;s meeting could not be more stimulating. Indeed, we have always considered culture to be an engine for growth, research, and development.<br />I believe that it is impossible to reflect on the future of mankind without considering it connected to the world of innovation and technology. Innovation and technology are two elements that are powerfully driving this phase of our lives and I believe that, if properly governed, they can act as multipliers of knowledge and drivers of growth.<br />Creativity and innovation feed, as is well known, lines that are not only virtual or service-based, but are organically linked to production chains of goods. Think, for a moment, of design products or fashion. From yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;technical&rdquo; tools, innovation and technology now find themselves defining parallel worlds, in the virtual and cyber domains, with a revolution in the logics and hierarchies that have traditionally governed this space.<br />The intertwining with areas that have grown in importance over time is flourishing. Such as education and training, tourism, health and well-being, and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>In the same reaction to the pandemic, innovative models of cultural and educational use have emerged, towards an integration of knowledge. The use of innovation and technology makes it possible to overcome, in complex territories such as those of our countries, the very notion of center and periphery, of metropolitan areas with an intense quality of modernity, and the development and inland or rural areas destined to be marginalized.<br />It is enough to think that, in Italy, the cultural industry as a whole accounted for EUR84.6 billion in 2020. The EU appears to be aware of the link between innovation and culture, with initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus. This is a recent proposal by the Commission which, through innovative and interdisciplinary solutions, aims to link culture, technology, innovation, art, and science. We need to invest in this direction, and we need to do it today.</p>
<p>Italy, with its National Recovery and Resilience Plan, has decided to allocate substantial resources to the culture sector&mdash;more than EUR7 billion&mdash;including measures for digitalization, innovation, and competitiveness, together with the regeneration of small villages with initiatives to enhance and restore their artistic and architectural heritage. It is my increasingly strong conviction that we need to accelerate towards achieving &ldquo;European sovereignty&rdquo; also in the technological field.</p>
<p>The pandemic crisis and the war crisis tell us how crucial cooperation is. Our ability to compete and provide our fellow citizens with a solid framework of security depend on innovation. It is essential for the EU to give itself strategic autonomy.<br />We have moved beyond the phase in which innovation means merely automating production processes. Today, we are being challenged by AI and machine learning, raising fundamental questions. How can we reaffirm the centrality of the person in models determined, so often, by superintelligence and potentially autonomous development?</p>
<p>At a time when war has returned to the European continent, with thousands of victims and devastating destruction that so rips apart human lives and places, we must tenaciously reaffirm that culture and innovation must be instruments of dialogue, peace, and the future.</p>
<p>Our three foundations must continue to play a valuable, stimulating role. I hope that in such a difficult international context, we will be able to make it our own and reaffirm the threads that bind the peoples of Europe together, which cannot be broken by those who have resorted to the brutality of violence and war.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Just a few months have passed since the last COTEC Europe Forum. At that time, we were celebrating, with all due caution, the return to a certain normality, the fact that we were able to meet again at our traditional annual meeting. It was there, in Malaga, that we analyzed the lines to advance in the transition toward an intangible economy in Europe and also where the three COTEC entities, Portugal, Italy and Spain, committed themselves to work together for talent, the &ldquo;most valuable of the intangibles, the one that makes all the others possible.&rdquo; On this occasion, we met under the theme &ldquo;Culture at the meeting point of innovation,&rdquo; promoting precisely this commitment to talent and giving continuity to a humanistic perspective, essential to respond to the various challenges of our time and which is a sign of COTEC&rsquo;s identity. However, in order to improve things&mdash;processes, products, environments&mdash;we first have to know them. Hence the importance of remembering, now more than ever, that nothing can be taken for granted and everything may be at risk if we do not continue to work to defend and protect it.</p>
<p>A culture of innovation also entails knowing that progress does not only occur when knowledge helps to identify and take advantage of opportunities but also when it is used to prevent and counteract threats such as those that are so close at hand in these turbulent times. And in this context of culture, of innovation, of European cooperation, I would also like to remember the Ukrainian people, who are suffering a terrible aggression, and we cannot but think of the suffering that is happening to them these days, and in doing so we appeal to our principles, peace, collaboration, respect for human rights, and the desire for a peaceful settlement of differences.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest legacy of the three organizations since their foundation is precisely to have fostered this kind of culture in our countries. Or, to put it another way, to have incorporated innovation among the main attributes of our culture in the hope that, if not for our own, at least for the next generations, innovation will be a behavior&mdash;an attitude&mdash;assimilated with closeness and full normality, like the rest of the customs we share.</p>
<p>What is now presented as a valid aspiration was not so valid just a few decades ago. Prejudices had to be overcome, complexes had to be shaken off, and examples had to be set. First, for the three countries linked by COTEC to show themselves as imminently innovative economies and societies and, more recently, and in a context of evident complexity, to unite to propose and share from COTEC Europe their own model of innovation inspired by the best values of our shared culture: open and supportive.</p>
<p>It is a model that does not aspire to impose itself, although it does aspire to leave its mark, because in southern Europe, as far as innovation is concerned, we have to continue learning, but we also have some things to teach. COTEC plays an important role at different levels of the education system in the three countries, working to facilitate society&rsquo;s access to all the tools, knowledge, and skills that will enable them to cope with the demands of an ever-changing environment.</p>
<p>Although our language is one of the few things that we do not share with our dear friends from COTEC Italy and Portugal, beyond their common roots, they have similar and complementary visions that enrich the constructive and transformative conversation that these annual meetings entail.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, these are times in which culture is also key to economic progress and social well-being. Fora such as this one go into this in greater depth and show that it is possible. Let us therefore promote synergies between culture, innovation and business. Let us therefore promote continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In May 2022, political leaders and business leaders came together in COTEC Europe 2022 in Braga, Portugal, to exchange ideas about business, innovation, and&mdash;quite interestingly&mdash;culture. In attendance were dignitaries such as the President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the King of Spain, and the President of Italy, among many businesses people from the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>This was not the first meeting of its kind. COTEC Europe is a body dedicated to entrepreneurship and business innovation in Spain, Italy, and Portugal. The joint body was established in the early 1990s to create a space for a common dialog among the three Mediterranean nations, particularly given the similarities between their economies and the common challenges faced by Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese companies within the context of Europe. COTEC Portugal, Italy&rsquo;s Fondazione COTEC, and Spain&rsquo;s Fundaci&oacute;n COTEC represent the three member states in the body.</p>
<p>COTEC tries to advance the economic realities of Southern Europe, which are not identical to the rest of EU. Since its launch, the summit has successfully created some synergy between the three member states, coming up with recipes for the empowerment of businesses, the expansion of innovative practices, and the regulation of community policies which are tailor-made for the economic climate of Southern Europe. First, COTEC annual meetings were held in Rome (2005), Madrid (2006), and Lisbon (2007), and have continued on the same rotational basis to this day.</p>
<p>It was once again Portugal&rsquo;s turn to host the meeting in 2022. In keeping with the tradition of the event, a theme was selected: the meeting point between culture and innovation. &ldquo;A participative relationship with the culture sector could mean a bigger retention and talent development for companies, as well as [the] customer&rsquo;s preference and greater reputation and placement,&rdquo; explained the holders of COTEC Europe 2022, adding that &ldquo;the perception of culture as a factor that stimulates creativity and innovation may generate competitive differentiation, positive economic results, added value creation and social cohesion for companies.&rdquo;<br />The tradition of giving annual summits a central talking point helps COTEC steer clear of discussing generalities, snd instead talk about the most important issues of the day that affect business. The first COTEC summit in 2005 was inaugurated with the theme of &ldquo;innovation in Europe,&rdquo; but the next six summits did not have a theme until 2012, when &ldquo;innovation in SMEs&rdquo; was announced as the big talking point of the summit. The 2021 edition of the event was entitled &ldquo;Transition to the Intangible Economy in Europe.&rdquo; This naming came after the cancellation of COTEC in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had also paved the way for a wave of intangible economic activities.</p>
<p>The 2022 summit marked the first time that culture was chosen as the connecting thread of the presentations. Every previous meeting had been concentrating on the economy, industrial matters, or business activities. However, with the maturation of the Southern European markets, culture is playing a greater role in the economy. The entertainment industry, which is by nature cultural, is currently a money-spinner in all three nations. Tourism and travel, meanwhile, contribute 17.1%, 13.3%, and 12.3% to the economies of Portugal, Italy, and Spain, respectively. And above all, the ongoing culture change in Europe is redefined the meaning of work, employment, and business. The 2022 summit in Braga tried to address all of these issues and more.</p>
<p>The event was affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the three heads of state in attendance expressing their concerns about another act of military aggression in the continent. &ldquo;While the fate of Europe is at stake, it seems more necessary than ever to have the courage to look to the future, to imagine how culture can be a vehicle for peace. For our countries, therefore, the theme chosen for this year&rsquo;s meeting could not be more stimulating. Indeed, we have always considered culture to be an engine for growth, research and development,&rdquo; said President Sergio Mattarella of Italy.</p>
<p>During the event, a number of round tables were held. In the round table &ldquo;technology at the service of creativity,&rdquo; a particularly cultural issue was brought up: the Spanish, Portuguese, and&mdash;to a lesser degree&mdash;Italian languages are spoken way beyond the Mediterranean region. Portuguese speakers in South America and Africa, for example, outnumber the Portuguese citizens by twenty to one. Concha Andreu, president of La Rioja region in Spain who pitched an initiative known as Valle de la Lengua, described Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, &ldquo;languages of great potential that can also become an economic engine,&rdquo; in areas such as education, tourism, and AI, among others. With some 200 million speakers in Latin America and Africa, the Portuguese language gives a strong cultural influence to Portugal in places beyond Europe. The country can leverage on this to find a target market for Portuguese businesses active in software, entertainment, and education.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>When, on October 26, 2019, the government that ceases its duties today took office, I said: &ldquo;This is a government for the good and the bad times. [...] And the greater the storm, the greater our determination in overcoming it.&rdquo; When recalled today, those words seemed a prediction of what we would have to face with the terrible pandemic that two months later took over the world and hit us hard as well.</p>
<p>My first words are, therefore, of acknowledgement and profound gratitude to the team that ceases its duties today for the determination with which it braved the storm by: ensuring the NHS&rsquo;s response capabilities and the success of the vaccination process; ensuring, through an exceptional mobilization of the assistance measures to companies, employment, and income that the economy could resume its growth, that corporate investment and employment are at historically high figures, that public debt is now being cut again, and the deficit is below 3%; and championing at the EU an extraordinary program to assist with investment and the essential reforms to strengthen recovery, via a twin climate and digital transition and responding to the main social vulnerabilities, the productive potential, and our territory.</p>
<p>The storm did not keep us from leading the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of Europe with distinction, from drafting and negotiating the next PT 2030, nor did it steer us away from the major strategic goals we undertook.<br />These weren&rsquo;t just years of fighting crises that we faced. They were also years of deep reforms that structurally changed our society and our economy. Today, we are a more qualified, more sustainable, more innovative, and less unequal country. That is why we grew again above the EU average, which is why we multiplied 10-fold our technological balance of payments surplus, why we achieved new records in attracting investment, and that is why the European Commission considers Portugal to be the best placed country to become carbon neutral.</p>
<p>At this time of handing over a new government, I would thank everyone who is now taking on the responsibility of governing the country, as well as expressing my gratitude to everyone who leaves office. We are still facing the pandemic, healing the wounds, and yet we are already countering the effects of the war triggered by Russia by invading Ukraine.<br />And once more, just as during the pandemic, the Portuguese people have shown their huge sense of solidarity and their capacity to be united and overcome, ensuring the hosting and integration of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. And once more, also, we need to adopt on a national and European level the response measures to this shock, especially ensuring there are no ruptures in supply, controlling the cost of energy and essential raw materials, and helping the companies most in need and the most vulnerable families.</p>
<p>That is what the Portuguese expect from us again: that the government is able to respond day to day to the difficulties felt, without overlooking the building of a better future in the middle and the long term&mdash;a government that fixes problems and creates opportunities. The Portuguese people want a government that works hard for the country to protect its citizens, ensure their freedom and safety, and mobilizes them in the collective effort to modernize Portugal. The Portuguese people demand that we make up for lost time due to a political crisis they did not want, continuing on the path we have been on and moving toward a fairer, more prosperous, and more innovative country where everyone feels fulfilled and that harbors hope and confidence in the future.</p>
<p>It is this courage and ambition that this government guarantees. That is the commitment that I and all the members of government take on here, today, before all the Portuguese women and men: working without hesitating, against storms and torments, keeping Portugal on the path of growth and progress it has known over the last six years and facing the four major challenges that the future places on the present: respond to the climate emergency, ensure the digital transition, counter the demographic winter; and fight inequality.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s program is known. It is the electoral program we presented to the Portuguese people and that we shall approve formally in the Council of Ministers, so that we can discuss it in its proper setting&mdash;in Parliament. We approved the Stability Program that pursues the trajectory of budgetary balance and sustained cut in public debt, which we have made compatible with economic, social, and environmental ambition. The State Budget proposal for this year is ready, honoring the commitments undertaken, such as the extraordinary rise in pensions with retroactive effects, a cut in income tax for the middle class or the start of free day care for children.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, the country has unique conditions to break away indefinitely with a development model based on low wages, ensuring dignified and quality jobs, increasing the potential of its productive fabric, and breaking down the barriers on economic progress based on innovation, the modernization of administration and justice, internationalization, and leaving no one behind. This is our brand: modernization with social solidarity.</p>
<p>The fruit of years of investment in skills and strengthening our science and technology system, combining structural funds with resources from the RRF, the recovered international credibility for attracting investment. Today, Portugal has the conditions it has never had before to turn the page on a new cycle of sustainable and inclusive development. A new development cycle with an economy that produces greater added value and a fairer sharing of this value with the workers.</p>
<p>These are the conditions that offer us full confidence in the capacity to reach such ambitious, quantified, and scheduled goals, such as the ones associated with the government program or undertaken with the EU.<br />We must use this stability to anticipate uncertainty, bravely facing the structural challenges ahead of us. We have the duty to innovate, modernize, ensure dignified jobs, and generate wealth to progress together, with inclusion and balanced accounts. This means working together, with democratic humbleness and institutional loyalty, with the engagement of the political parties and social partners to create solutions that help us face the challenges the country has to deal with. Only by committing to social dialogue, mobilizing civil society, and harboring the positive contributions of the other political parties will we be able to move forward.</p>
<p>The international setting is new and places new demands on us. Yet, our path remains unchanged. We have a strategy to implement, commitments to meet, and goals to fulfil. We have turned the page on austerity, we are turning the page on the pandemic, and we will turn the page on the war. Only together will we be able to write the pages of a future we want to be bright.</p>
<p>It is with renewed energy, determination, and enthusiasm that we are now starting this new stage, always with the willingness to serve Portugal and the Portuguese people. Together, we move forward, and we will make it.&nbsp;</p>]]></richbody0content>
