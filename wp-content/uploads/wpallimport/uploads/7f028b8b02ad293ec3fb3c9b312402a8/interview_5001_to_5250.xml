		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>MAPIEX has managed to close the last few years with solid growth. What are the main factors that drove that growth?</h4><p>MAPIEX continues to grow year after year, thanks to our market understanding as well as our relationship with both suppliers and customers. Trust is the main element in these relationships and has enabled us to work with some of the most important aviation companies around the world. As a company, we do our best to stay updated with our clients' demands and continuously restructure our organization and services to comply with their needs.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your services?</h4><p>We have different business segments; we sell airplanes and helicopters from top brands such as Beechcraft, Cessna, Viking, and Airbus Helicopters. We also cover aviation spare parts and have the most important lines of engines and spare parts, such as Pratt and Whitney and SAFRAN HE for aircraft and helicopters. Additionally, we provide aviation services in eight airports in Panama. The main services provided include charter flights, aircraft repair service, ground handling, fueling, and crew and passenger VIP services. Today, we manage 73% of all international corporate air traffic in Panama. Even though we are based in Panama, we have also provided complete ground handling services in 10 airports in Cuba since January 2016. One of our main strengths in Cuba is that we serve some of the most important international companies operating in the country by providing services such as ground handling, fueling, hotel reservations, and transport coordination, among others. We could sum ourselves up as being a one-stop shop for VIP services.</p><h4>Which are the main destinations that you service within the country with Skymaxx?</h4><p>Skymaxx has a complete fleet of airplanes and helicopters with different specifications, which allows us to adjust to our clients' needs. Our customers use our airplanes or helicopters to fly to remote parts of the country, main cities, or specific areas of their interest. In this context, one of our main strengths is our flexibility due to our variety of aircraft. Most of our flights are business-related within Panama, but we also provide aircraft for tourism or vacation purposes.</p><h4>How much do you invest in maintenance and in ensuring international safety standards?</h4><p>As a company, we are committed to delivering high quality and safety standards throughout continuously revised and certified processes. We take pride in our excellent safety record and we keep working to make it better everyday for each one of our services. As an advantage, we have a certified repair shop and we also represent some of the top manufacturers in the aviation industry, which give us a direct connection with the factories; therefore, it makes us work at the required international standards.</p><h4>What is your strategy to further expand your business operations?</h4><p>We use our knowledge and experience in the industry to look into opportunities to expand our operations in the region and with our customers and suppliers. For example, we are working with the French company SAFRAN on new and better features for our distribution network. We believe there is a great deal to do at the regional level in terms of distribution and coverage.</p><h4>What are your top priorities for 2017?</h4><p>Right now, we are working on ensuring a stronger company by getting ISO certified, among other safety certifications, which will leverage on our capacities, as well as strengthening our position at the international level. In the meantime, we keep adding more value to the services we currently provide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Metro reshape the infrastructure landscape of Panama and what is its importance for the country?</h4><p>The long-term view for the Metro is a total of seven or eight lines, depending on certain factors. However, it will be a pretty robust network and we have done the planning for this through 2040. The first line was a USD2 billion investment that included an 8km tunnel and another 8km of elevated way. Line 2 is longer than the first, at 21km, and will have 16 stations and 21 more trains. We have been increasing ridership and are now at double the expected number of daily passengers. For Line 1, we originally calculated around 140,000 daily passengers, but have had days with nearly 300,000 and the average hovering around 275,000. We are buying 70 new cars for both Line 1 and to cover extra demand for feeding passengers from Line 2. We will change the fleet from trains of three to five cars each, thus increasing the capacity of each train considerably. In this way we can cope with the estimated demand: in terms of national polls, the metro is the number-one entity in public satisfaction. We are always above 80%, which gives us great satisfaction. We are proud to have done something that has really changed people's lives for the better in Panama.</p><h4>How are you working to instill a metro-related culture and promote its use?</h4><p>This is one of our strong points even though it had never been done before. We have a program called Metro Culture that has many different facets. There is free opera in the Metro on Saturdays, which people have really taken a liking to. We also have installed free libraries at the Metro where riders can pick up and drop off books. This was done in alliance with the Lions Club and 20-30 Club and has been successful. We also bring underprivileged children from other provinces who have never seen the metro to the capital, give them a free ride, and teach them about how we built it. There is also a strong teaching system for teaching the people how to use it.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges and obstacles you face?</h4><p>We should not forget that we are running one line right now and going for the second and third at the same time. We started Line 2 a year and a half ago, and Line 3 is even longer; it will go over the new Panama Canal and be the fourth bridge over the Canal. Line 3 is 27km long and will be a monorail instead of a normal train because there are many hills in its path. Our metro is the only one in Central America, and the monorail will be the only of its kind in all of Central or South America, bar Sío Paulo. This will be a robust monorail with the latest Japanese technology and the biggest model. We consider this project a case study; it is important for us with the help of the Japanese International Corporation Agency (JICA). We are going to do the award for the pre-qualified companies in the coming months and will then have a period of about six months for participants to submit their proposals. We hope to award the contract to the winning contractor at the end of 2017; construction would start in early 2018.</p><h4>What are your main targets, ambitions, and goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our immediate goals are to finish Line 2 and the extension to the airport. The airport will go from 13 million passengers to approximately 18-20 million passengers once the new terminal is open; we must capitalize on this. Then we ideally want to have Line 3 completed by 2021 or 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main milestones that Canon has achieved over the last year?</h4><p>This year we celebrate our 50th anniversary. Our challenge is to work tirelessly to be leaders in the national market and encourage our staff to provide our customers and business partners with the best in technology and solutions. We have internal and external factors that sometimes do not allow us to meet our budgets or complete our projects; however, our platform in the country is one of the best in the world because of our geographical position. For us, it is important because we not only have domestic operations but also support our international operation from here in addition to the different activities we undertake. We support sales for Latin America and the Caribbean and also have a call center for Latin American countries. We have specialized staff that support sales operations, marketing operations, and software development for Latin American countries, which are all a result of our position and the talented people who work for us.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the leading projects you are currently focusing on?</h4><p>Domestically, we want to cover all the vertical market with new products; for example, Canon acquired Oce Products and we want to launch this printing solution in Panama. Another project that we are working on is to enhance customer satisfaction in the services area following Canon Inc., OIP Human Capital Project. In order to improve the efficiency of our technicians, reduce costs for our customers, and respond timely to customers, we are also working to launch an e-commerce project. One of our latest projects is to improve the sales of professional cameras EOS and CINEMA, working with professional photographers and providing better services to our customers in this segment.</p><h4>In the printer business 53% of the local market is controlled by Canon. What are you doing to increase this solid position in the market further?</h4><p>Our position is due to our corporate philosophy, which is oriented to customer satisfaction; one of the key points to survive in an environment where there are many competitors is to support the customer. We want to explore new opportunities, collaborate not only with our staff but also with our business partners, and build up our infrastructure to support not only the sales but also the service that we provide to customers. This is the key if we want to maintain our leading position across all our lines. Service is everything and as soon as a company provides excellent service it is quickly recognized as a market leader; word of mouth has been extremely helpful to us.</p><h4>What is your strategy for e-commerce to widen your portfolio composition and reach new clients?</h4><p>We are penetrating the e-commerce segment; we will soon begin training for the staff involved in this project. E-commerce is related to millennials; according to studies and analysis, by 2025 54% of consumers will be millennials. Panama is not yet a mature market for e-commerce; we do not have a complete infrastructure to provide timely deliveries, which is something that we are studying and preparing for. Some of the logistics companies that we receive quotations from want to enter this segment but do not have a great deal of experience. In the US, for example, everyone buys through the internet and we need to change the mindset here and educate people because Panamanians want to go to stores, test a product, or feel it before purchasing and this mentality will not help e-commerce sales. However, e-commerce is the future and we need to start taking steps in order to develop this part of the business.</p><h4>How do you work to cement your leading position in the corporate segment?</h4><p>In the corporate segment, we have specialized people who take care of specialized business that we call major accounts and global accounts. For example, from here we have local customers that have global accounts that Canon needs to take care of around the world; our experts in software manage global accounts not only in Panama or the Caribbean, but also from other countries beyond Latin America. We are focused on solutions; everyone now wants efficiency, productivity, and lower costs. Our main responsibility is to understand our clients' needs and improve their business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the current government working to foster the concept of innovation in the Panamanian economy?</h4><p><strong>JORGE A. MOTTA SENACYT </strong>strengthens the National System of Innovation by promoting programs to financially support entrepreneurs and companies that develop business innovation to create or improve a process, service, or product. Furthermore, SENACYT encourages private companies to invest in innovation and technology. Even though the path has been difficult, the effort of the government in this respect has yielded significant results, such as the recognition awarded to innovative companies every year for the last 10 years.</p><p><span></span><strong>VICTOR SANCHEZ URRUTIA</strong> The Department of Business Innovation of SENACYT has worked closely with the National Authority for Government Innovation (AIG), the private sector through the Panamanian Chamber of Technology, and local universities to establish the Panama Digital Hub Strategy, which will strengthen the development of the IT sector in Panama for the next 10 years. The strategy defines the guidelines to create programs that will make the IT sector of Panama more competitive internationally. The first step is to establish an IT observatory that will help us understand the current state of the IT sector in Panama. The data collected by the IT observatory will be used to elaborate public policies and to develop the market strategies to follow.</p><h4>Thanks to fruitful collaboration between SENACYT and CAF, Panama will soon position itself as the fourth country in Latin America for the number of registered patents. How did this come to be?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAM </strong>It is a culture-changing initiative. Our society has been oriented toward providing service instead of creating patents. Therefore, we do not have the infrastructure to deal with the patent process. For this reason, SENACYT has collaborated with CAF in an effort to generate more patents.</p><p><span></span><strong>VSU </strong>We already have 230 patent applications thanks to the alliance with CAF. What follows is working on strengthening the patent process so that it becomes easier for innovators to generate more patents. Due to the fact that patents are a viable commercial strategy, this is a priority for the Department of Business Innovation of SENACYT. </p><h4>How are you fostering the growth of the healthcare sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAM</strong> Together with the Ministry of Health, SENACYT gives scholarships to healthcare professionals to continue their studies in the medical area. We are also working on activating a simulation center to train local medical doctors. The medical schools have simulation areas but the size and sophistication of the simulation center we are planning to build will set it apart from anything else in the region. </p><p><span></span><strong>VSU </strong>Together with the Institute of Scientific Research and High Technology Services (INDICASAT), SENACYT promotes health research in areas such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, malaria, and others.</p><h4>How can SENACYT use science to deal with the lack of use of technology and innovation outside of the capital?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAM</strong> Infoplazas are community centers that provide internet access as well as educational training for kids and adults to help close the digital breach in Panama. More than 200 Infoplazas exist all over the nation, including in the indigenous regions. Together with the Department of Education of SENACYT, the Infoplazas offer courses to improve digital literacy in the Panamanian society. To attract participation, the Infoplazas launch competitions in coding, math, and videogame programming with high acceptance among young people. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the impact that your new mine will have both at the national and regional level?</h4><p>We are currently about halfway through the construction of our copper mine; once it is fully operational it will produce about 320,000 tons of copper and about 100,000 ounces of gold per year. Even by global standards, it is a large-scale copper mine and at current prices represents USD2 billion in export value for the country. In macro terms, that would make up about 4% of GDP in today's dollars. The future impact of the project aside, the project also contributes a great deal to the country today; our budget is over USD1 billion for 2017, we employ over 5,500 Panamanians at the site, and our salary bill including social security amounts to about USD17 million per month. In the past 12 months, we have spent around USD170 million on purchases from Panamanian suppliers and have contracts and commercial arrangements with about 500 Panamanian companies. Therefore, on a macro level, we already have a large economic impact on the country before we even produce. More pronounced is our economic impact on the region. The mine is in the district of Donoso, near Penonomé, the closest regional town. Compared to four years ago, the city is growing and changing dramatically. There are now four shopping malls, the government has plans for a new hospital, residences, and houses are going up, and Panama University is building a campus there and expanding, so there is a huge impact. Of the 5,500 people we employ, about 1,000 live in the nearby area and spend their money at local businesses, malls, restaurants, hospitals, clinics, and so on. The impact and growth as a result of the mine can truly be seen.</p><h4>How are your infrastructure projects progressing?</h4><p>There are two primary pieces of infrastructure that are required. One is an international port that enables us to import coal and export the copper concentrate, while also allowing us to bring in large-scale equipment that cannot be transported through the road system. The construction on that is going well and is due to be completed in 3Q2017. The first terminal of the port is already operational, and we have international certification to operate the port. The second critical infrastructure piece is a power station. We need about 200MW of power to operate the whole facility and are building a 300MW power station down by the port. The first stage of that will be completed by the end of 2017. We have effectively completed the transmission line and our power station provides power to the project while also connecting to the national grid. Those are the two large pieces of infrastructure that are required, and they are progressing well. A third component is road infrastructure; however, for some time now we have had a fully sealed road from Penonomé all the way to the site and the port; hence, the road infrastructure has been there for some time now.</p><h4>In the mid term, will Panama be recognized as a center of mining excellence as a result of your operations?</h4><p>I can see our mine becoming a regional reference in the next 10 years in terms of how to build a well-run and environmentally and socially sustainable mine in the region. However, I expect the hubs of mining in this region to continue to be places like Chile and Peru. We are the only mine here for now; still, we would like to set an example as a profitable, well-run, and well-supported mine. However, we shouldn't be much more ambitious than that.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>The goal for us in 2017 is to have the first part of the power station up and running, complete the construction of the port, and be well-prepared to start running the mine in 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Maxia was the first Panamanian company to develop solutions in the field of high social technology. Can you tell us more about your business?</h4><p><strong>PETER A. DIAZ A.</strong> We are socially driven. The business model that we developed was a formula or equation that was always there but had so many variables that it was difficult to see it as a whole. We started working with internet and telecommunications to help solve social issues and provide a value proposition that can be managed end-to-end based on telecommunications. We started with five brilliant-minded people and after we started becoming more well known in the market, there were tenders and customers who invited us to work with them on small projects. Our first project was related to video surveillance in 38 schools across the country. Then, we did other important projects, such as electronic police records of the citizens in Panama.</p><h4>How do you work to inform, educate, and attract new potential clients that might boost their business operations thanks to your services?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PADA</strong> Results are everything for a company. The way governments are set up is difficult and it will take a while to embrace the wholeness of solutions. In the past, the government talked about turnkey products; however, this used to be more a financial kind of term in the way the government is evolving. In terms of tenders or new things coming up with the present government, it is getting there as the focus is mostly on the project; but this goes beyond, with sustainability and managing the aspects that have not been considered in the past. The potential and difference a solution makes have to be communicated; hence, we have to take into account key elements, such as change management, results mindsets, and objectives.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>ADRIANO DEL VALLE D.</strong> The current government is attempting something interesting that no government has done before. For example, when developing a tender, it started to include three years maintenance to ensure that the project will be produced correctly. This is something important in regards to the project's execution and guarantees a positive impact on people's lives. This is something we like and it really impacts the project through development and care for the design. Sometimes there are elements that are not included, so we focus on ensuring maximum impact. The reputation of a company can change quickly, which is why we manage our projects carefully every time.</p><h4>Where would you like to expand your operations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PADA </strong>We have expanded in different areas. We target the regional market as well: Maxia has not focused on Peru as a market for the last few years; however, it is definitely a country about which we have market knowledge. Maxia's next step is to have a broader business; we have a great track record and if we do things beyond our borders we can have people come over and talk. The Dominican Republic is a country that is similar to Panama; we have that Caribbean essence. We are also looking at opportunities in Ecuador. Our range of projects for next year will include international expansion and also bring such solutions into the private sector here in Panama.</p><p><span></span><strong>ADVD</strong> We are now developing two verticals plans. The first one is e-government, which is about BPMS and electronic documentation for the government, while the second is water solutions within utilities. The idea is to introduce a new technology to this sector, which is an open sector as there is no experience in Panama. It is something done in Europe: taking care of water in every river as, in the end, this has an impact on the population. We are also working on a project regarding the expansion of a hospital: it involves building new facilities, providing, and installing new equipment while the hospital is in operation. We want to go to new tenders and, as matter of fact, we plan to have new tenders in all the verticals this year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the sector evolved since Soluciones Seguras started operating in 2001?</h4><p>We see technology not as the driver of other sectors but as the enabler. We are transversal. Everyone needs technology. In 2001 I was approached by a group of companies to be in e-commerce, which was not in high demand then. I worked in the e-commerce sector developing websites and I saw an opportunity and the need to go into the security market. The most valuable asset of a company is its data; however, people had not taken into account how important it was to protect themselves. The level of security training for personnel was also lacking. We wanted to be a training center and one of the first things we did was to become an official training center for one of the largest IT security companies in the world.</p><h4>How did you establish your reputation as the ideal platform to train people at the regional level?</h4><p>There are two points here. The first is attracting great engineers. Our interview process is simple; we want to see how someone thinks, not necessarily what they know. We want people who can answer questions quickly and without hesitation. If they can do that, then they can learn most of the rest. We require more networking basics but absolutely no security foundation. We want to train people in everything related to security. Many engineers started out as interns, and new hires will wait three and four months before they can see cases of their own. Before that, they have one month of learning and then they have to shadow someone to get up and running. Nevertheless, in IT security everything changes so fast that we all are constantly learning.</p><h4>How is your portfolio of partners, allies, and clients evolving and where do you see the greatest opportunity for your company?</h4><p>The three top segments right now are government, finance, and telecommunications. We have clients in all sectors of the economy, including large companies, but those that have high-value information are our prime potential customers.</p><h4>What is your strategy to promote the company at the regional level?</h4><p>We have a conservative philosophy. Our philosophy is to be in a limited amount of areas because we want to be experts in those areas. New geographies are about finding the right local partner. We want someone who is invested in the country and the company, who knows the country, and who can be there for the long term. South America is full of challenging markets, and much larger than Panama. We need larger investments, and there is much more competition and risk. We thus naturally looked north to Central America as a natural expansion platform. Costa Rica is the closest country to Panama, with almost 11-12 daily flights, and where we found a strong local partner that manages the operation. Even though we have worked there for almost 11 years, we opened the office five years ago. In 2016, the Costa Rica office grew by over 50%, and we are satisfied with those results.</p><h4>What is your main priority for the year to come?</h4><p>2016 saw healthy growth for us. However, growth can be as bad as it is good; it needs to be managed. If a company grows too fast and does not know how to manage it, then it can be disastrous. We have experienced continued growth through the past five to 15 years. We need to manage that and continue to establish the infrastructure and have people at the right points. We will probably have someone in charge of coordinating regional offices because we do not have that now. In Costa Rica, we might need to implement an operations manager. And, we are looking to open at least one new country office in 2017. Overall, these are great problems to have, and 2017 should be another great year for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key highlights for the secretariat in 2017?</h4><p>It is essential to have a long-term plan to guide the energy development of Panama in a sustainable way and in the sense of leaving future generations an economic system that is able to increase the well-being of its inhabitants in a harmonious way with the physical and social environment, while also promoting a more just and equitable society. The elaboration of a long-term energy plan, based on a participatory process, is the main achievement of this period. The preparation of an energy plan is a permanent task that will have to be updated frequently to adapt to the economic, political, and constant technological changes.</p><h4>What key projects is the government currently focusing on and investing in the most?<br></h4><p>Over the last 40 years the energy system in Panama has undergone dramatic changes. Despite the fact that energy prices have increased significantly throughout this period, energy consumption has grown overwhelmingly, achieving a general improvement in the standard of living. Life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, the literacy and schooling rate, as well as the percentage of the population with access to safe drinking water and electricity have risen sharply, as has healthcare coverage, while poverty rates dropped significantly. This level of progress, far from being satisfactory, is related to the levels of energy consumption. Between 1970 and 2013 electricity consumption multiplied by 11 and that of petroleum products by four and a half times due to the increase in disposable income of citizens, which allowed them to increase their purchasing power. These figures show that all the energy the country consumed throughout 1970 is being consumed today in just over two months. As a result of increased energy consumption, the country has become more dependent on oil imports with the consequent negative effects on the economy and the local and global environment.</p><h4>How much is the current government investing in and promoting renewables?</h4><p>According to figures from the National Energy Secretariat, Panama handles approximately 70% of its electricity from renewable sources, much of it from hydroelectric power plants and recently from wind or wind energy, the contribution of which, although modest, is timely and complements the service during the dry season, when the best wind regime is recorded and hydroelectric generation decreases due to the lack of precipitation during this period. The wind farm near the city of Penonomé just completed its expansion; the operations began in 2014 and by 2017 will operate at 100% capacity. It will have an installed capacity of 270MW.</p><h4>What is the potential for Panama to turn into an energy hub in the region?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, our geographical position, the expansion of the Panama Canal, and the proliferation in the use of LNG, due to the advantages of its properties, are the greatest opportunities for Panama to be an energy hub. Natural gas reserves have expanded greatly with the exploitation of non-conventional gas deposits (shale gas) thanks to the hydraulic fracturing technology better known as fracking. It is estimated that, with the contribution of new reserves and their lower impact on the environment, natural gas can become the most important fuel in the first half of the 21st century.</p><h4>Can you anticipate your priorities and goals for 2017?</h4><p>An important achievement to date is to negotiate contracts under equal conditions to conduct seismic studies on Panamanian coasts, under the multi-client mode. This is to obtain information on the possibility of the existence of oil and natural gas in our country, without incurring costs by the state. The multi-client mode allows companies to take the risk by trying to recover their investment, through the sale of the information collected for a defined term space. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the trends and the performance of the financial sector in Panama in 2016?</h4><p>Despite the slowdown, we have the second fastest-growing economy in the region after the Dominican Republic. Though we are not in double digits as we once were, 5.2% GDP growth is still excellent. The impact of the Panama Papers combined with the Waked scandal had a negative impact on the country's reputation; however, the financial sector is still performing well. Bank deposits and credit have had significant growth in comparison to 2015. As for the capital markets, the local exchange represents only 20% of the total investments volume reported to our local regulator (Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores de Panamá). The remaining 80% is represented by trades executed in foreign exchanges. Despite the difficult year, we have still increased our volume of negotiated transactions by almost 41% in comparison to last year.</p><h4>A stable investment climate is the main premise taken into consideration when investing in a country. What actions should Panama take to improve its transparency among the international community of investors?</h4><p>Promotion is fundamental; we need to disclose the actions taken by our government and regulators in an effort to comply and strengthen anti-money laundering and tax transparency. Latinclear (CSD) has an important agreement with Euroclear (i-Link) and in an effort to disclose to them these actions, we have been sending them and other interested parties a periodic newsletter. This will be an ongoing effort from our part until we are no longer rated as a high-risk country.</p><h4>What is your strategy for promoting a greater participation of the private sector?</h4><p>As a small country with little education on capital markets, the local exchange, and issuers, we have always been oriented to the banking sector and its savings culture. We are working on an education strategy for the long term with the objective to be top of the list, not only for investments purposes, but also as an employment opportunity for the younger generations. As for issuers, having a strong regulatory system is fundamental. Our regulator will soon require ratings for debt issues and this should be an important tool for investors when making their investment decision. Our vision is to be the financial hub of the region. Consequently, we are focusing on bringing regional issuers to Panama in 2017 and also completing our market integration with El Salvador.</p><h4>The main sectors represented on the stock exchange are the financial segment, followed by industry and energy. How is BVP working to diversify its portfolio?</h4><p>We need to work on liquidity, as having liquidity in the market can make us more attractive. The integration with Bolsa de Valores de El Salvador will provide the liquidity our market needs and also provide the inclusion of new industries for diversification.</p><h4>What measures is BVP taking to promote synergies within other financial markets in the region?</h4><p>We are in the process of launching the market integration between the stock exchanges of El Salvador and Panama. This integration will allow the approved stock members of each country to trade in the other country's exchange system on behalf of their clients, without double registration of the securities listed in each country. When concluded, we will continue to explore other regional exchanges to integrate with our market</p><h4>What targets and priorities have you set for 2017?</h4><p>We have identified several priorities for 2017 and will be focusing on education and the promotion of our market, not only in Panama, but around the region, including efforts to increase liquidity in our local market by concluding the integration with El Salvador and listing new issuers, both local and regionally, to the stock exchange. </p>]]></richbody0content>

That was the first impact I saw in how Panama was moving fast toward plastic money and making life easier for customers. It was not a shock like I was expecting; people welcomed it with arms wide open and in less than a year were used to paying their public transportation with electronic money. From two years ago until this day, the market has exploded; many people want to go into e-commerce, and think that they are going to make millions. We know it is a hard business. We are pioneers in terms of security and have secured all our transactions; we use a company called Cardinal Commerce and the type of transactions are called Verified by Visa and MasterCard Securecode. We recommend our clients not use e-commerce without these tools.</p><h4>How is the market for smartphone payments evolving in Panama?</h4><p>Even though Panama was the last country in Latin America to have smartphones, we are top of the class in mobile payments. The use of mobiles for payments per capita in Panama is the biggest in Latin America. We are a small country; we have 6 million cellphones for 4 million people. Whether or not that is true, our online payment industry is growing by at least 10% per month. </p><h4>In which specific segments are you working to expand your operations and activate new partnerships?</h4><p>We have a plan to do virtual money and have our own payment card; that is where we are moving. We want to work for people who are not yet in banking. We are looking at the risks and are talking to lawyers to see the best way to come out with a card that can serve as payment in taxis, for example, for people at risk of receiving counterfeit money. Therefore, our main challenge is convincing people to use plastic money. We are now installing several kiosks to help people to execute their daily transactions in every corner of Panama; though 60% will be inside the city, we are also targeting areas outside the city such as Chiriquí­, Coclé, and many other provinces with our new kiosks. We have new significant projects coming up: we are developing a new tool for the media industry that will allow subscribers to pay for subscription to the virtual news via the internet or using special kiosks. We are also working with the government and with the public sector: We are developing a special platform to allow payments related to companies' operating licenses.</p><h4>What new countries and markets will you be exploring outside of Panama?</h4><p>We get many proposals to go abroad, but I do not think that 2017 will be the year we do so. For 2018, we are thinking about Colombia and possibly Mexico, but Colombia will be our first step.</p><h4>What are your main targets, goals, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>In 2017 we should first have five banks working for us and using our payment machines. We have 91 billers or clients within our Epago alliance, not to mention the virtual coin coming out. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define Panama's economic performance in 2016?</h4><p>The IMF has estimated that global growth was in the order of 3.1% in 2016, partly as a result of the deceleration in world trade. Meanwhile, Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole recorded an economic recession (-0.7%). In spite of this context, Panama showed growth of 4.9%, making us the second fastest-growing country in the Americas and one of the highest in the world.</p><h4>How is the ministry working to boost the perception of Panama as a transparent and globalized country?</h4><p>The transparency of Panama and its financial system are the keys to attracting investors. This is why it has been subject to the evaluations of financial regulators such as the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to ensure our commitment to the fight against money laundering and terrorism. In this regard, Panama has complied with the recommendations of the FATF. In 2015 we were taken off this agency's gray list.</p><h4>What is the ministry's strategy for diversifying the national economy?</h4><p>Panama already has a fairly diversified economy; no single activity accounts for more than 20% of GDP. Standing out for their contributions are: wholesale and retail trade (17.4%), construction (16.5%), real estate business and rental companies (14.7%), and transport, storage, and communications (13.9%). This level of diversification allowed Panama's economy not only to continue to grow, but to be one of the fastest growing on the continent, especially during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the global instability of 2016, and despite the recent animus against foreign trade. At the sectoral level, the most important activities are concentrated in the service sector. In order to strengthen other sectors, the government has developed actions to promote and encourage agricultural and industrial sectors. With regard to the latter, we are currently working on a new industrial policy. The government also approved a modernization of the Colón Free Zone Act to update its business model and diversify its target markets and competitiveness.</p><h4>Panama has proven itself a leader in the financial platform of the Americas. What is your strategy for attracting more international financial institutions to Panama?</h4><p>Considering strategies to attract investment and maximize our competitive advantages in the financial sector, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has presented a proposal to review and diversify our financial services platform. We thus developed a consultancy that evaluates 11 new products that were created through the interaction of public and private sector actors and are related to legal, regulatory, private banking, insurance, payment, and reinsurance compensation, among other things. To strengthen our banking sector, we have four pillars to update our regulatory framework, according to international standards (Basel III): implementing standards for solvent and more liquid banking; achieving optimal levels of macroeconomic stability; improving the transparency of the resources of the banking institutions; and preventing systematic crises.</p><h4>In relation to FDI, what incentives should be promoted to enhance the country's appeal?</h4><p>Panama offers an unparalleled logistics platform for rapid and efficient maritime distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific for the distribution of imports and exports. There is also a hub at Tocumen International Airport with direct connections to Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and America. Our Law on Multinational Businesses (SEM) has incentives on taxes, labor, customs, and immigration through special areas such as Panama Pací­fico, free zones, the Colón Free Trade Zone, and the promotion of research and innovation in the City of Knowledge. </p><h4>What are the ministry's main objectives this year?</h4><p>The Ministry of Economy and Finance promotes the fundamental objectives of the government insofar as it ensures sustainable growth and low levels of inflation; maintains transparency and discipline in the execution of fiscal policy; fulfills and enforces our commitment to the ongoing fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism; and implements the open government policy of access to information, accountability, consensus construction, and citizen participation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main vision and mission behind Sumarse?</h4><p>Sumarse is a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to promote CSR through sustainable development to develop the country. The objective of Sumarse is to help companies implement CSR best practices and global compact principles as well as be a platform to generate public private partnerships (PPPs) for development. Sumarse has 158 companies, 72 NGOs, the chamber of commerce, and various universities that are members. That is what makes us a broad organization and gives us a peculiar role when either international organizations or government institutions want to start a dialog with the private sector. It is thus important that the financing of Sumarse is fully private.</p><h4>Are local companies investing enough in CSR?</h4><p>If you had asked me five years ago, the answer would have been no. Now there are a handful of companies that are very mature and oriented toward sustainability, and there is a large group already implementing best practices.</p><h4>As far as CSR is concerned, what specific aspects should be a focus for local and international companies operating in Panama?</h4><p>The main topic is always governance; that is where everything starts. It is hard to make companies understand this. They start by implementing practices, but when you make them go through the whole process they understand that if you make a plan and an analysis you come back to the starting point, which is governance.  It matters how you align your mission, vision, and values, and then how you transmit these through the whole organization to allow the company to become socially responsible. It should start in governance but usually does not. Here in Panama we have been very successful with a few topics, such as corporate volunteering, a hot topic in Panama</p><h4>What are your plans for this year and what will be the focus of your activity for 2017?</h4><p>The main focus for 2017 is the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We started working on these since they came out in late 2015 and in 2016 it was more about understanding what it was all about and making the connections and getting all the info from the UN, studying the tools. This year we want to start working with Panamanian companies and show them how to implement the SDGs. I would say most of them have heard about the SDGs, but we want to show them what to do make an impact and take that further. The CSR week is the broadcast of what the companies do and will be a reflection of what we are working on. Last year we had 1,200 people for CSR week, the business conference, and the universities.</p><h4>What role does e-learning play in your information and communication activity?</h4><p>We are part of the Central American CSR network (Red Integrarse) and have done several projects together. We even have a common strategy in Central America on CSR. One of the issues here was how to share the learning experience and bring our knowledge together. About 5,000 people in the whole region have taken e-courses. It is focused on CSR, and there will probably be a human rights module as well. They are all specifically oriented to Central America.</p><h4>What do you want to achieve before the end of this year?</h4><p>My wish list is to be able to give companies the means to understand the SDGs and their importance in their strategies to make them more competitive and sustainable. At the end CSR is defining a triple bottom line, so it assumes that as a company you have a social and environmental impact on top of an economic one. A huge challenge is human rights because people generally think of human rights as merely child labor. Our other wish is to be successful in bringing our organization beyond the capital and into the interior of the country. We especially want to expand into Chiriquí­. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Public construction tenders in Iran]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[kambiz-salehi-managing-director-sekaf-technical-construction-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute the successful transition of SEKAF from a small family business to the diversified holding it is today?</h4><p>Our success is based on our commitment to quality and on time delivery to our clients. Customer satisfaction is a crucial focus for us. We also consider every employee a member of the family. We trust them and expect that this is mutual. Customer satisfaction, transparency, and the relationship between personnel and management are the main pillars of our continued success. After the end of the Iran-Iraq War there was a high demand for the construction of new buildings. SEKAF's policy was to diversify, so that if one sector of the economy faced problems, the company could profit from other sectors, allowing the company to continuously grow.</p><h4>What are the main projects in which SEKAF is involved at the moment?</h4><p>SEKAF has three departments, namely energy, road, railways, and buildings. In the oil and gas industry we have two EPC contracts in gas compressor stations. Next to this, we work on the refinery and polishing system in the Kangan area. To the southeast of Iran, we will build a 75km 36" pipeline in the second part of 2017. We are constructing a 110km railway project from Tehran to a nearby city called Varamin. This project is important to the country. We are also constructing the Shiraz Metro and a 25km highway in hilly area near the city of Kerman. In our building department we are working on a business mall with 65,000sqm in the Pasdaran area. We are building the Tajrish Police Station and 1,456 flats in Karaj. This project consists of four phases. In each phase we construct seven buildings and each building has 52 apartments. Our strategy is to get involved with projects that are of strategic importance to the country.</p><h4>How do you respond to the volatility in oil and gas prices?</h4><p>The ups and downs in oil and gas do not have much effect on us. Iran has been under sanctions for many years already. As a major construction company, the government needs our services. The fluctuation of the oil price has of course affected the country and the cash flow of the government. We are focusing on performance and because of our good reputation, the oil and gas sector will call upon us for future tenders. Our further development depends on the entrance of foreign companies to Iran. In partnership with them we can develop our resources and our company in a better way. Currently these companies are still somewhat reluctant to invest in Iran.</p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching foreign companies to partner with?</h4><p>It is in the mutual interest of foreign and domestic companies to close partnerships. Companies entering Iran need a local partner that knows the rules and regulations and understands the business environment in Iran. At the same time, we are looking for new knowledge, innovation, and management systems, with which foreign companies can help us. Foreign companies choose to partner with SEKAF because we are trustworthy and transparent. We understand the nature of partnership. Our experience in different industries demonstrates our capabilities. We are currently in touch with Japanese and South Korean companies, who want us as their construction partner. We are also negotiating with an Italian company for gas-related services. It is in the mutual interest of foreign and domestic companies to close partnerships. Companies entering Iran need a local partner that knows the rules and regulations and understands the business environment in Iran. At the same time, we are looking for new knowledge, innovation, and management systems, with which foreign companies can help us. Foreign companies choose to partner with SEKAF because we are trustworthy and transparent. We understand the nature of partnership. Our experience in different industries demonstrates our capabilities. We are therefore collaborating since one year with a company named Ferramedia. This is an organization that creates cross-functional enterprises of several kinds of businesses worldwide. It manages the full cycle of a project, from inception to funding and all the way to the final execution with the support of a strong community of private and institutional partners. Ferramedia is helping SEKAF to develop the Iranian market and is bringing in Italian companies and expertise in the fields of railways, renewable energy and food and beverages. Also, we are currently in touch with Japanese and South Korean companies, who want us as their construction partner. We are also negotiating with an Italian company for gas-related services.</p><h4>Are you looking to further diversify your portfolio of activities?</h4><p>We are already present in many sectors. Within the oil and gas industry, our activities include pipelines, refineries, and gas compressor stations. On top of that, we construct roads, rails, metros, and buildings. Recently we have been looking to enter the clean energy industry, in partnership with the Italian company SITA. We are particularly interested in solar and wind energy. Also, we would like to expand to water projects, as herein lies one of the biggest challenges for the future of Iran.</p><h4>What would you share as the most interesting opportunities that you see right now in Iran?</h4><p>There exists an image that doing business is Iran involves a high risk, but this image is false. When investors come to Iran and get to know the people and the business, they will realize the risk is lower than in many countries that are recognized as investment destinations. Even more, the profit margin of doing business in Iran is high compared to our neighboring countries. We can help our international partners to manage and reduce risks. In many GCC countries, the government is highly involved in business with foreign companies. In Iran, businesses are mainly controlled by the people and resources like money and manpower are in the hands of the private sector. There are vast opportunities for investors who are willing to come to Iran. By partnering with a local company, you can then approach other clients in the country. There are many fields in which the private sector can come up with ideas, such as traffic management in Tehran. If you have a good knowledge base that has already been exercised outside of Iran, we can bring this together with our expertise and experience and present it to the government.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the years to come?</h4><p>Our focus for 2017 is on energy and railways systems. In these domains we see the highest demand from the government. We are focused to enter the Iraq market in the future because there will be high demand after the war. We are looking to partner with some Italian companies in this regard. This is our main aim moving forward. We are also looking for expansion to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, but Iraq is our priority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Panama received the PGBC, and how are you instilling awareness regarding the importance of minimizing the environmental impact in the construction sector?</h4><p>PGBC is one of the five-largest green building organizations in Latin America. As we grow, so does our influence and ability to spread awareness. We are part of the World Green Building Council (WGBC), an umbrella organization for all green building councils. In 2009, we contacted the WGBC and informed it of our intention to register the council. Ever since then, we have been escalating our level of involvement and the size of our operations. There are three different levels of association one can attain with the World Green Building Council: prospective, emerging, and established status. Countries such as Australia, Canada, the US, and Italy are all established members. In 2015, less than 30 countries had attained established status. After years of making strong gains, Panama officially received its established status.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on some of the new green building standards the PGBC is promoting?</h4><p>In 2016, the construction industry grew, accounting for 14.8% of GDP in Panama. Simultaneously, sustainable construction projects grew. We currently have 30 projects officially certified with the LEED green building standard, which is still the most widely used standard in the world. We also have 80-85 projects in the certification pipeline, which puts us in second place in terms of green building certifications in all of Central America. Only Costa Rica has more.</p><h4>How are other Panamanian organizations supporting green building activities?</h4><p>We work with many outside organizations whose missions are similar to ours. We know, for example, which groups or firms have experience with LEED and can therefore consult on projects. The biggest project we have at the moment is putting together a comprehensive eco-protocol for the municipality of Panama. The sustainable construction guide put together by the National Secretary of Energy and the IFC focuses mainly on energy efficiency, but the Eco Protocol will include six or seven distinct efficiency and sustainability categories, including water efficiency, interior air quality, energy efficiency, and green procurement, to name a few.</p><h4>How do you plan on reducing the environmental impact of the industrial sector in Panama?</h4><p>The industrial sector is relatively small in Panama; however, there has already been some movement toward more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. Energy and water efficiency have been the sector's most important focuses, because they represent fairly large outlay categories. They want their operations to run as efficiently as possible, and many of their efforts have been having great results. Recently, the National Secretary of Energy announced the recipients of its energy efficiency awards, and industrial firms continue to perform well. As social responsibility becomes more and more important in Panama's business culture, the sector has made great strides to bring its operations in line with contemporary standards and expectations.</p><h4>What kinds of companies decide to become members of the council? </h4><p>Some 37% of our members are engineering and architectural firms, most of which are local. While 29% are product distributors that represent a mix of large multinational and local firms. Interestingly, the companies that seem most interested in being members of the council are lighting providers and paint providers. Solar panel firms are also becoming more and more popular, and we currently have three member companies that are solar panel providers. Construction and project promoters also make up a fairly large proportion of our membership, and they include local and international firms. New companies are also usually interested in joining the council because they see it as a way of making a competitive differentiation in the market. </p><h4>What are your main targets, goals, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The most important goal is completing the eco-protocol, which will serve as the guiding light and technical foundation for creating a new green Panama. The clear elucidation of expectations and incentives is so important, and this document promises to deliver on both fronts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry has recently finished its trade mission to Latin America. How would you assess this trip? </h4><p>This trade mission to Latin America achieved its objectives of strengthening trade relations with promising markets within the region, while providing a platform that has enabled businesses on both sides to take a pro-active approach to boosting trade and investment. The opening of our first representative office in Latin America, in Sío Paulo, was a major step in enhancing economic cooperation with the region. Establishing our presence in the region will help us effectively promote Dubai as an attractive trade and investment hub, and attract Latin American companies that plan to expand to Dubai and access markets in the GCC and Africa. During the trade mission, Paraguay's President, HE Horacio Cartes, announced plans to open the country's first commercial representative office in the UAE later this year, and said that all the necessary resources and facilities would be provided to support the expansion of UAE businesses and investors into Paraguay. We were very encouraged by the strong commitment on the part of the Paraguayan officials and business leaders who are actively looking to strengthen trade relations with the UAE and increase bilateral trade and investment.</p><h4>Which economic sectors hold the largest potential for growth between Panama and Dubai in the medium term?</h4><p>Panama is Dubai's fourth-largest trading partner in Latin America with bilateral trade in 2016 valued at USD21 million. Agricultural commodities and food products account for the largest share of this volume. Yet, when you look at the untapped potential that exists in this dynamic market, it becomes clear that there is still plenty of room to expand trade to other high-potential sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and tourism. As a trade and logistics hub, Panama can serve as a major gateway for UAE businesses to access the Latin America region, and the chamber is looking into opening a representative office in Panama in the near future. The recent expansion of the Panama Canal has made trade with Latin America a lot more efficient, while it has opened up new prospects for global trade, which stand to benefit businesses in the UAE.</p><h4>In what way can Panama and the UAE collaborate to create a more enabling business environment for businesses keen to open up avenues of trade?</h4><p>The UAE's plans to open an embassy in Panama this year and Panama's move to upgrade its consulate in the UAE to an embassy are signs which indicate that the two countries are committed to strengthening ties and enhancing economic cooperation. Going forward, the launch of direct flights between Panama and the UAE would be a major step in expanding bilateral trade, while it also stands to boost tourism markets in both countries. In addition, the adoption of more investment treaties, free trade agreements, and double taxation agreements between the UAE and Latin American countries would eliminate trade and investment barriers and help build bridges between business communities on both sides.</p><h4>How have FDI flows between the UAE and Latin America regions developed over the last few years, and what sectors have attracted the most investment?</h4><p>UAE investments within Latin America's industrial sector have been growing over the last decade, while ports and logistics has been another key area that has seen a great deal of interest. DP World, the largest Gulf investor in Latin America, is estimated to have invested USD4 billion across the region to date, according to a recent whitepaper from the Economist Intelligence Unit and Dubai Chamber. The Dubai-based container port operator has expanded to Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador, while the company is exploring opportunities that have been created by the Panama Canal expansion. Enhancing cooperation between UAE businesses and their Latin American counterparts supports the objectives of the 2030 Dubai Industrial Strategy, which aims to stimulate the industrial sector, and attract foreign investment to key sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the chamber supporting the business climate here in Panama? </h4><p>We are supporting it more and more. Each year we mature and develop as a chamber, though we are still young. We consolidated our membership in 2016 and have approximately 150 members now. This year we are looking at having international members, which has just been approved at the board level. This is for people who are not in Panama but are interested in building relationships. We have the option now for people overseas to become members of the British Chamber. We have also worked closely in trying to find out exactly what kind of support our members want. We had the opportunity of working with UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) on a project supplying business intelligence to a company looking to enter Panama. That kind of service is something we want to expand on to give people more contacts and knowledge about what the market is like and what opportunities exist.</p><h4>What are the main factors that make the chamber a reliable platform for its members?</h4><p>The fact that the British Chamber of Commerce works closely with the British Embassy here is a reliable factor. The ambassador has an honorary position on our board, and we work closely with UKTI. The government's long-term idea is for UK chambers around the world to start working even closer with the UKTI and the trade industry branch and take on some of these responsibilities. Things like trade missions and business intelligence are what we are slowly moving into. That the chamber is linked to the embassy forces the chamber to be transparent, open, and rigid in its practices</p><h4>What are the main obstacles investors face in Panama?</h4><p>There is a lot to be done regarding employment laws. It is a hub and open for international business, but at the same time there are still protected professions and restrictions on the amount of foreign employees a company can have. Sometimes it is difficult with the gap in skills we have spoken about. We cannot get the qualified people here that we need. I do not know whether there could be a change in the law that would oblige foreigners to train locals before phasing out the foreigners. That could enable a plan reducing those percentages over a period of time and would be fantastic. But if we have those limits right from the beginning, and the know-how is not there, it can be quite difficult to establish a business.</p><h4>Panamanian imports from the UK were valued at USD265 million in 2015 between vehicles, beverages, spirits, and pharmaceuticals. Is there room for growth?</h4><p>Absolutely, and that is one of the fantastic things about Panama. There are still lots of gaps between supply and demand in terms of goods and services. Panama is a country of opportunity, but there are still a lot of gaps in what it can offer. Panama itself does not produce many things, so there are definitely also manufacturing opportunities here. In logistics there are big plans for Colón. Panama Pací­fico is a member of the Chamber, and the developers there have great opportunities for growth. There is also room for retail, especially supermarkets.</p><h4>What is the position of Panamanian women in the country's business world?</h4><p>It is higher in this government than the previous one. There are some very impressive businesswomen here, and comparably little sexism. Latin cultures can appear quite machista from the outside, but when you dig deeper it is the women who drive the country. It is a matriarchal society, and I am amazed at the capacity of work that Panamanian women have. They are also major drivers at the other end of the economy: business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your biggest achievements in 2016?</h4><p>For Panama, 2016 was an excellent year in terms of the country's continued regional leadership as the principal investment destination in the region, resulting in an increase of 15-18% FDI and once again receiving close to half of all FDI in Central America. We managed seven effective missions abroad, resulting in over 800 new potential business contacts and more than 100 real investment prospects, which was well above our target.</p><h4>What actions should Panama take to improve its transparency among the international community of investors?</h4><p>At PROINVEX, we facilitate investments coming into Panama and help integrate new business operations that are productive, have a positive impact on our future development goals, and further enhance the competitive advantages the country offers. Panama has been successful as a competitive destination for FDI and transparency in our laws that align with international standards and the evolution of the global economy. Panama has advantageous special economic regimes, and it is in our country's best interest and in the best interest of the foreign investor that laws be clear, that there be confidence in the rule of law, and that investments have a sound environment, not just to land, but to grow and diversify. Transparency, in fiscal and other matters, is of paramount importance to guarantee an attractive and sustainable business climate, which is one of the main factors that companies consider when investing abroad.</p><h4>What sectors of the national economy are considered particularly appealing to international investors?</h4><p>Our national strategic plan highlights four main growth sectors—logistics, regional services, tourism, and energy, as well as opportunities in other pillars of the economy, like infrastructure development, maritime services, agroindustry, and real estate. We have seen exponential growth in headquarters and shared-service delivery centers. The Multinational Headquarters Regime now has 130 multinationals that has generated close to 9,000 jobs. We hope is to see growth both in new investments in that particular sub-sector of the economy as well as re-investments and growth from existing operations</p><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of the existing free trade area and economic zones as platforms for attracting foreign investment? </h4><p>Panama has a unique advantage in that the investment regimes it offers are designed, developed, and tailored as solutions to particular economic activities. In the Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area, we hope to see further investments in advanced manufacturing and third-party logistics operations, as well as value-added multi-modal logistics activities. Investments in headquarters, shared service activities, and high value-added services are a growth area in Panama Pacifico that are bringing the most sophisticated business processes to our country, and a multicultural community that fosters creativity, growth, and value. The Colon Free Trade Zone, the second-largest free trade zone in the world and a pillar of our national economy, is a competitive distribution center for serving Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean pact region with well over 3,000 companies.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The main ambition is to continue the rhythm of growth in investment attraction. There was nearly 17% growth between 2015 and 2016, a milestone that was replicated from last year to this. We are also integrating our promotion and attraction efforts with other key government agencies, academia, and private sector stakeholders to foster the growth our country needs to meet our strategic development plans. If Panama sustains this rhythm of year-on-year FDI growth until 2025, we will experience a transcendental transformation, as our economy shifts from one based on services to one that is based on innovation. I firmly believe this is one of many paths that will contribute to securing a bright future for all Panamanians. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index, Panama ranked 42 out of 138 economies worldwide. What is the country's strategy for continuing to improve its competitiveness?</h4><p>Panama improved its position in the World Economic Forum's ranking by an impressive eight positions. We are only nine positions away from Chile (33); overall, this has been a massive success for us. The main objective of the secretariat is for Panama to be the most competitive economy in Latin America by 2019, a position currently topped by Chile. However, it is worth mentioning that in the World Bank's Doing Business Report, Panama lost three positions—we currently rank 70th and are the sixth Latin American economy. By 2019, we want to be in the top three in the region in terms of doing business, which is currently topped by Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile. These are our objectives and my goals as National Secretary. Achieving all this will enable us to complete the Strategic Development Plan for the country that our president implemented: to grow our economy from USD40 billion to USD 68 billion by 2019. In this content, we have a competitiveness plan at the national level that we follow. Currently, our fiscal deficit is around 0.5%, and the country's debt is just below 35%. Thus far, we have increased the per capita income of Panamanians and GDP by almost 40% since we have been in office. We have identified three main challenges to improving how business is done in Panama: a governmental bureaucracy that stifles entrepreneurs and businesses, the lack of a highly specialized workforce, and a dearth of institutionalization at several levels. The secretariat works to improve the conditions for doing business in Panama. One such project is the Panama Digital project: We want to make Panama the Silicon Valley of Latin America. We have put together joint efforts with other entities and organizations at the national level to boost the arrival and presence of tech-based companies to develop new projects and technologies here. We coordinate and facilitate this project alongside SENACYT Panama and the Panamanian Chamber of Technology. One of our main advantages is that we are part of the presidency of Panama. There are four secretariats under the presidency of the country: the Secretary of Objectives, which takes cares of the achievement of the government's goals; the Secretary of Legal Affairs; the Secretary of Social Affairs; and the Secretary of Competitiveness. Our role is to coordinate efforts from the presidency with all involved parties in each particular project. For example, with the joint efforts in terms of the lack of highly qualified workforce, we coordinate activities with the Ministry of Labor and other such institutions. We plan during our term in office to create over 120,000 new positions and train more than 232,000 people. Additionally, we have established the country's first technical and professional schools in the country.</p><h4>What is the importance of new technical schools in the country's efforts to increase the availability of highly qualified human resources?</h4><p>Companies arriving here face a lack of technically qualified human resources in some areas. At the same time, certain companies have also raised concerns over the lack of soft skills in people. We can see the consequences of this: In most customer-facing jobs such as in the hospitality industry, we have people from other nationalities. The development of these technical schools is in response to the needs and concerns of companies operating in Panama and a means of increasing the number of expats allowed in companies and encourage foreign companies to stay in the country. There is also the Panama Bilingual project, which will allow us to have a completely bilingual primary education system by 2019. The budget for this project is about USD130 million.</p><h4>What are other of the top priorities for the Competitiveness &amp; Logistics Secretariat?</h4><p>The governmental bureaucracy is far too tedious and extensive for both Panamanians and companies operating here. Therefore, one of our top priorities is the facilitation of bureaucratic processes, including the issuing of national documents and the payment of taxes. We prioritized either the revocation of certain processes or their digitalization. Our efforts in the logistics sphere have gained momentum in the most recent government, for the secretariat had another name and was more focused on the overall economy. However, we have appointed several positions within the secretariat that work solely with the logistics industry: boosting technology, increasing synergies between ministries and institutions working in the logistics industry, and so on.</p><h4>How have the Panama Papers impacted the country's image at the international level?</h4><p>The Panama Papers had an impact on the way people see Panama worldwide; however, it did not affect our performance as a country in economic terms. Our government unwaveringly faced this, and we understood that only by being transparent could we reverse any negative impacts. Panama signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters with the OECD. We have boosted efforts against drug trafficking and money laundering. The signature of the above-mentioned convention with the OECD is a clear example of this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

This year, we expect to buy MYR10.5 billion and issue MYR11 billion, which is a large increase from last year. We have continued to issue in foreign currencies since the inception of our EMTN program in 2014—having issued a total of MYR7.8 billion equivalent in foreign currencies, including CNH, USD, SGD, and HKD. Thus far, sukuk issuances in foreign currency have only been done in SGD. The Company has performed well, and we made profits of around MYR332 million in 2016.</p><h4>How do you market your products and where does interest for these issuance come from? </h4><p>Even before we established the EMTN program, we visited a number of financial centers to meet with investors and determine their needs. We continuously interact and engage with our existing investors and potential investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, the Middle East, Taiwan, and Japan, among other countries. We keep in close contact with them, and that allows us to close an issuance quickly. As a result, we recently concluded a public issuance of USD350 million in less than a week. We are active in branding our services abroad, and people have become more familiar with Cagamas. We have also won a number of awards in various forms, including 2016's Global Islamic Finance Advocacy Award for an Institution.</p><h4>What should Malaysia do to unlock the full potential of Islamic finance? </h4><p>Islamic finance is still growing in terms of the capital market. When we first started meeting with investors in Hong Kong and London, some of them did not want sukuk unless we gave them a higher yield in comparison with conventional bonds. Over the years, we have found that the acceptance of sukuk has changed, especially after the governments of the UK and Hong Kong started issuing sukuk themselves. The acceptability, awareness, and understanding of sukuk have significantly grown around the world. Unlocking the full potential of Islamic finance is about creating awareness and understanding. In Korea, Taiwan and Japan, there is a great deal of room for growth of sukuk. Within ASEAN, we can focus on Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam to build more awareness. In Malaysia, about 23-25% of all banking assets are already in Islamic finance, with a strong prominence in the housing sector, for example. With our established Islamic finance and sukuk investor niche—consisting of Islamic pension funds, Islamic banks, Islamic fund managers and takaful operators—we are able to offer sukuk more competitively than conventional bonds in the local market. This is possible since conventional investors can also buy sukuk while Islamic institutions cannot buy conventional bonds. In Malaysia, the market demand for sukuk is in fact greater. Previously, investors expected sukuk to pay a higher yield; however, in Malaysia that scenario is the reverse and we are either paying lower or equal to what we pay for conventional papers. In terms of government securities, we have Malaysian government securities (MGS) and Malaysian government investment issue (MGII). Previously in 2013-2014, foreign participation in the MGII was small, at about 1-3% in comparison to the MGS, which was about 40%. The yield for MGII was also 20-30 points higher than MGS. After the rebranding from GII to MGII and investors realized it was related to the Malaysian government, foreign participation increased significantly. It is still lower than MGS; however, it has grown significantly from to a high of 13%. This shows that the demand and awareness for sukuk has grown in terms of buying sukuk in the form of the MGII. Since the US Presidential Election, we have seen volatility in the market and foreign holdings of Malaysian government papers have also gone down overall; MGII and MGS combined are about 30%.</p><h4>Cagamas is celebrating 30 years of operations in 2017. How successful have you been in terms of your social economic role in society in promoting house ownership?</h4><p>As far as promoting home ownership is concerned, Cagamas has contributed by purchasing housing loans from financial institutions and hence, providing the much needed liquidity to the banking system to further finance house purchases. Cagamas has refinanced about two million homes since its inception. Currently we look at areas that promote economic activities such as infrastructure and the SME sector. Another area that we focus on is affordable housing. We work to see how Cagamas can play a role in promoting affordable housing. Cagamas has participated in two government schemes in terms of mortgage guarantee, such as My First Home scheme (SRP) and the Youth Housing scheme (YHS). A sister company, Cagamas SRP, provides the mortgage guarantee on such loans to the first time homebuyers. This allows borrowers to borrow up to 100% of the house value. This helps some young individuals below the age of 40 who individually earn less than MYR5,000 a month or MYR10,000 in a joint household income. This scheme helps these individuals to own their first home. For the SRP scheme, there are 23 participating banks whereas the YHS is offered by Bank Simpanan Nasional. These are efforts that the government has put in place to help young individuals own houses and Cagamas plays a role in terms of providing the mortgage guarantee. We also look at the role we can play in terms of affordable housing and are working on certain ideas there.</p><h4>What makes Cagamas outstanding in the international market?</h4><p>Cagamas continued to be accorded the international rating of A3 by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and the domestic ratings of AAA by both Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad and RAM Rating Services Berhad. This is a testament to Cagamas' consistent track record of strong governance, robust assets quality, stable profitability and prudent risk management. In the past 30 years, there were two spikes during periods of crisis. During crises, banks usually would face a liquidity crunch and thus, would sell more loans while we also continue issuing bonds/sukuk to fund the purchases. There were adequate buyers of our papers even during crisis periods. When investors look to buy a bond/sukuk, they look at the rating, the yield, and liquidity of the papers. When investors buy a bond/sukuk, majority of them would want to keep it. That may not attract certain investors, particularly foreign investors to come in. For investors to buy a Cagamas MYR paper, they want to be sure they can exit at any point in time to sell the paper. What we have achieved is that some of our issuances are now included in some of the influential benchmark indices that investors look at, including dollar issuances and MYR issuances. Certain investors base their investment decision on the basket in the benchmark. To be within the benchmark is important in terms of creating secondary liquidity. The next thing we did was to create a dedicated pricing page in both Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. These pages show our outstanding bonds/sukuk to investors and also served as platforms for investors to obtain indicative pricing of Cagamas bonds/sukuk in the secondary market. Cagamas is the only corporation in the world that has a dedicated pricing page in Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. In 2016, we achieved MYR17.1 billion in volume in terms of secondary trading, which was more than double the MYR5.3 billion in 2015. As a result of these initiatives, foreign holdings of Cagamas papers including both bonds and sukuk increased from 0.5% in 2015 to about 8% in October 2016. However, after the US Presidential Election, there was an outflow, particularly by some banks and the foreign holdings of Cagamas bonds/sukuk is about 5-6% which is still credible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the heritage of the Summit De Las Americas that took place in Panama in 2015?</h4><p>From a diplomatic standpoint, this government under the leadership of President Varela and Vice President and Foreign Minister Isabel Saint Malo has been able to achieve a balanced foreign policy contrary to what happened in the last part of the Martinelli government. Nowadays, we have excellent relations with every country in the Americas, including those in the Bolivarian Pact. We also have observer status in the Pacific Alliance and are considering whether to participate as a member. In this scenario, Panama has been able to act in Latin America's different multilateral entities as a facilitator and bridge for dialog among different parties. President Varela has had exceptional relations with almost all of the presidents in the region, especially the US, which will continue under the Trump administration.</p><h4>2015 marks the beginning of the government's 2015-2019 strategic plan. What has been achieved so far and what are the government's main short-term priorities?</h4><p>On December 31, we reached the halfway point of our government. We will still have 30 months to go and there are three areas of focus. One is the institutional area, and in that sense the Varela government has been able to restore some institutional balance in the country. Unfortunately, in the last three years of the Martinelli administration there was a form of government that did not take into account the institutional balance that is needed, and both the judiciary and legislature have become an appendix of the executive branch. The other issue is economic; in our first full year of government in 2015 we achieved 5.9% economic growth. In 2016, we are targeting between 5.3% and 5.5% growth. The growth forecast for 2017 is between 5.8% and 6%.</p><h4>What should Panama do to increase its image as a transparent and reliable country to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>This effort began immediately when we took on new business and enacted important pieces of legislation. We were also able to set up different mechanisms for reporting suspicious activities, which includes obliging lawyers to report suspicious activities to the financial analysis unit. We have also signed a multilateral assistance tax relief bill, which has been signed by approximately 100 countries. In the beginning of 2018, we will take part in an automotive exchange of information between countries to ensure everyone has adequate safeguards to prevent information from being used by third parties. Hence, we are taking steps that are being recognized by the OECD. We have good bilateral relations with major players such as the US and Germany. There is one notable exception, France, which without any justification has targeted Panama and is about to include us on a gray list beginning in January, even though it was aware that our commercial code did not require companies that are not operating in Panama to require accounting information in Panama</p><h4>What are your main targets and goals for 2017?</h4><p>As far as infrastructure is concerned, we have been able to conduct public bidding on all our major planned infrastructure programs. Only two are pending: the public bid for the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal and the third line of the metro system. These are projects that will be inaugurated by the new government in 2019. We will also complete the expansion of the highway between the bridge and Arraiján on the western side of the Panama Canal. We are also going to expand the Inter-American Highway from Chorrera in the western part of Panama to San Carlos in the touristic area. We will continue all the other infrastructure projects, some of which we will be able to inaugurate in 2017, some in 2018, and line two of the metro in early 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background into COINLA and its activities in Panama?</h4><p>COINLA is a consortium created specifically to develop the Panapark Free Zone, a 520,000sqm project of land with roughly 300,000sqm of construction development. In turn, this will create 3,000 direct jobs. Our vision for Panapark Free Zone is for it to become the largest private FTZ in Panama. COINLA is formed by three groups of entrepreneurs: Roca Group, Repro Group, and Shahani Group. Roca Group, to which I belong, has built more than 6,000 houses, five industrial parks, and shopping centers and office buildings. In conjunction with the Shahani Group, it has finished over 15,000 housing units and 510,000sqm of industrial facilities. We are familiar with Panama because we had already developed a pilot project here, Las Americas Free Zone, which began after the Panamanian government passed Law 32 to promote the creation of industries and new jobs. At that time we saw an opportunity because companies could from then on own the land to build warehouses and industries, which gives them the opportunity to ask for financial loans from the banks. Before, they were unable to do so, which is why Panama did not have many free zones for small and medium businesses. Panama was falling behind neighboring countries and had the least number of FTZs in Central America. Costa Rica, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic have many more, but this law will open new opportunities for companies willing to build new industrial parks and FTZs here. Now, Panama has better conditions for FTZs with the expanded canal and a solid, dollarized economy, both important features for activating a new FTZ. The government is pushing to build new projects in the eastern part of the city, where it is expanding the subway and airport.</p><h4>In a market characterized by increasing competition, what competitive aspects must a good free zone offer?</h4><p>Excellence and quality in terms of design, infrastructure, and technology. This must be a national project that is a reference point and highlights the many qualities and advantages of Panama for the development of free zone companies and industries.</p><h4>What other incentives are there for investors willing to buy or rent your warehouses and how do you promote the new park?</h4><p>Investors have to be based inside the Panapark Free Trade Zone. There are also some requirements that they have to add some value to their products, not to mention create jobs and give something back to the sector. Almost all of the companies that export can be in the FTZ; the great thing is that they do not have to pay taxes on profits or property values. The government also promotes immigration benefits; a company that invests USD250,000 can have a special visa for its staff who work in the FTZ. The park will be an appealing platform for doing business and has attracted the attention of both regional and international investors. We conducted a study that allowed us to understand the countries we have to focus on; there is an important market in Asia, especially in China and Korea. There are also the Pacific South American countries like Ecuador and Peru that want to establish activities and companies here in Panama.</p><h4>What is your main target for 2017?</h4><p>The main target for 2017 is to deliver the first 60,000sqm of a high-quality park in October. Due to the time spent on construction and the technology used, some parks do not have the quality that they should. A free zone that does not meet all the necessary standards will not attract foreign companies to rent or buy. This year we also started the first stage of tailor-made warehouse solutions as well as the selling of big lots for transnationals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Health, infrastructure, education, and security received more than 50% of public investments in 2016. How much is the current government investing in social issues?</h4><p>Official data shows that our budget is about USD280 million. Of that, social spending received about USD215 million, a figure that covers all types of programs that reach our country's most vulnerable. For example, men over 65 with no pension and living in extreme poverty get a government subsidy of around USD120/month. Today, this program has around 133,000 beneficiaries. We have another program called Opportunity Network, which targets families headed by women and has 65,500 beneficiaries who receive USD50/month. There is another program for those with severely disabled dependents who receive USD80/month, which has 17,000 beneficiaries. In the last two years, we have expanded this program by 90%. Finally, there is the program for people suffering from malnutrition, mainly amongst indigenous people. Today, there are 10,000 beneficiaries who receive food support of eight million balboas per year. Our administration has also built several children's counseling centers across the country that meet the necessary quality standards. In this context, this program is supported by the Inter-American Development Bank and reaches soup kitchens across the country, especially in the capital cities and remote areas. We additionally donate about USD4 million to about 100 non-governmental organizations that support elderly people in remote and indigenous communities. These are the main points of our social policy. On top of that is our literacy program. Some 4.5% of Panamanians are still illiterate, and our objective is to eradicate this. One of our greatest achievements has been the implementation of the Social Investment System, through which we eradicate poverty by providing people with the necessary tools. These cooperatives support local farmers, handicrafts, and small industries through a PPP that spurs them to become entrepreneurs. Some universities also take part in this program by providing training. Finally, we have created the so-called Social Protection and Inclusion Program; we have aligned the structural matrix of the program/system to reach our beneficiaries with transparency and efficiency.</p><h4>Why is welfare not more equally distributed?</h4><p>We are a country of around 70,000sqkm and enjoy great social cohesion. Our people are our greatest asset. We are proud of having become the epicenter for many cultures and ethnicities; culturally, we are Caribbean, geographically we are Central American, and historically we are South Americans. Yet, we are alongside Brazil and Haiti as one of the countries with the highest levels of inequality. This is because, historically, the political system was mainly dominated by particularistic party and government policies rather than long-term state objectives. President Varela and his administration have recognized the critical nature of the situation, and we have identified three countries within Panama: that of the rich; that of the middle-class, which supports the social and economic development of the country; and everyone else. In this context, our government has prioritized projects to address the situation. We fight poverty with basic healthcare, eliminating ranch schools and providing educational opportunities to all, decent housing, and other similar programs. We have also decentralized investment, which has been complex and difficult for mostly cultural reasons. We have slightly less than 500,000 indigenous people, and 23% of regional land belongs to them. Large investment projects in these areas always face the radical opposition of local communities. For example, the electric connection between Panama and Colombia was suspended due to the opposition of indigenous communities. The main challenge here is the differences within those communities. It is fair to say there is no consensus within them regarding their development. In this context, we have established an Indigenous Coordinator to channel the development of the regions, for we are committed to their development and will continue to invest in these regions.</p><h4>What are the main actions and investments toward the inclusion of women in the country?</h4><p>It has been hard for women in Panama to break the glass ceiling. At the ministry, however, we are 80% female and 20% male, meaning we are trying to lead by example. In this context, 70% of our mid-level management across the country are women, too. At the MIDES level, we have the National Women Institute, of which I am president. There is also a national Women's Council, in addition to many other organizations and institutions that have been fighting for equal gender rights. One of our main focuses in 2016 has been the fight against femicide, of which at least 25 were registered in 2015. We have already seen that figures have dropped thanks to our efforts. Our priority is to provide women with the tools to achieve economic autonomy while still taking into account their importance in the development of their families, households, and so on and so forth. Another of our main struggles has been struggling against early pregnancies, and we are drafting a law to strengthen education and consciousness in society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Uneven split in Mexico telecoms market]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Telefonica's current position in the market and what are the biggest challenges and opportunities that you see?</h4><p>Typically in most countries Telefonica has been the incumbent, the former monopoly that competes against new challengers. In Mexico, we are different in the sense that we are the challenger. The company has solid foundations and its staff is extremely committed to the company. We also have a solid network and are in 93,000 cities and towns in Mexico, covering more than 90% of the population. Telefonica has been innovative in providing different services in the last few years. We were the first to not charge customers by the minute, but by the second. We place our clients first, and got rid of international roaming fees and provided unlimited voice minutes. Later, the competition imitated our offers, which subsequently benefited their own clients.</p><h4>With over 20% of the market share and 15 years in the market, is Telefonica still the challenger in Mexico or is it now a large, established player?</h4><p>We are still in an offensive mindset in various ways. There is a huge market in Mexico and this presents a great opportunity for Telefonica Mexico. There are 120 million people in this country and only three operators. Furthermore, Mexico has a large number of young people. They love social networks and connectivity and this presents a great opportunity. In Mexico, we are behind other Latin American countries in terms of penetration of mobile services; there is still a great deal of ways to go in terms of extending the penetration of mobile services here. Finally, Mexico is economically stable. Despite the issues with the US, we will still grow by 1.5%. Furthermore, in addition to the opportunities in mobile services, we will see a new wave of growth in the market, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). That is still nascent in the Mexican market and the world in general. It will bring us millions more connections in the future. Mexico is a great country for a telecoms company and we need the appetite and hunger to capture that opportunity. Even though we have 24% of the market and 15% of market revenues, our ambitions are greater. There is a player here with 65% of market share, which is a large figure.</p><h4>What does a company need to do to be able to respond quickly?</h4><p>One of the most important moments in our market is the Christmas campaign. In the 2015 Christmas campaign, we had our entire campaign ready in the final days of November and suddenly AT&amp;T launched an aggressive campaign in prices. Two years ago, it would take us about one or two months to change our campaign; now we have shortened that to 10 days. Another example has to do with execution and being agile; it is typical for a large company to make a decision at the board meeting and two months later little has been done. We now work in a system in which we select our key priorities and the main initiatives that support those main priorities. We appoint leaders for each initiative for a team and follow up on the progress of each project every week.</p><h4>Where do you envision Telefonica being positioned in Mexico?</h4><p>It is hard to have an exact definition of a number that defines where we want to be. We are currently living in a digital revolution. Telefonica firmly believes this revolution will bring great things to the world and will help people live better lives. This is our place in the world because we provide connectivity. All these great things happen because connectivity exists and we are the ones that create networks that users can purchase and interact with. We want Telefonica Mexico to continue to improve the lives of the Mexicans. We have three priorities for this company in the next few years. We want to continue to grow at a solid pace in the market. We are proud of our 27 million clients and want to increase that number, even with the entrance of AT&amp;T. We continue to win market share and have certain businesses where we are growing by double digits, such as post-pay. Our digital services business is mainly in B2B. Many believe we only have products for consumers; however, we also have many products for SMEs and for large corporations and the government. This B2B sector is growing by double digits, and includes cloud services, security services, and IoT. This is a priority for us: accelerated growth in businesses with more value. Our second priority is to continue transforming the company as a digital company, with more digital processes. We are proud today that over 90% of all customer calls are attended to automatically. The third priority is having an offensive mentality. We are digitalizing our company and transforming it into a more efficient one. Another example that contributes to our agility is that every year we reduce our headcount. We are proud to manage 27 million customers with 2,000 colleagues.</p><h4>What sets Telefonica apart from the other telco providers in the market?</h4><p>There are different aspects that companies and governments should consider when working with us. Our network and services are robust and are only getting better. We do everything it takes to serve our clients better. We signed an agreement with Telcel under which it will provide us network services in places where we do not have a network. In terms of products and prices, Movistar has one of the best competitive prices in the market. However, customers pick us as their provider because we have the best customer service in the market; in Mexico Telefonica has the best customer satisfaction in the market. We also have the lowest number of consumer complaints in the market. We have to provide the best of the world in terms of network, a competitive suite of products, and the best customer service is what has to take customers and these people to work with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-history]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the legacy of the 2015 Summit of the Americas?</h4><p>The Summit of the Americas, which we have hosted, has been the most important continental event in the last six decades. As a Panamanian and as part of the organization, this is a source of pride. This important space allowed us to ratify the principles that have always guided our foreign policy and the historical vocation of the isthmus of Panama as a country of dialog and a point of convergence. Panama bridged the gap and managed to establish an open and sensible dialog, which created the conditions for, for example, the first meeting of the presidents of Cuba and the US after six decades. It was the first time since the beginning of the summit mechanism that all countries of the continent participated; the agreement methodology was much more participatory and focused on inclusive development, rather than political matter; we introduced the first Forum of Rectors of the Americas to ensure that public policies advance hand in hand with the academic sector on the continent; we had the honor of receiving a high representative of the Vatican, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, for the first time in the seven summits held, among many others.</p><h4>According to the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index, Panama ranked 42 out of 138 economies worldwide. What is the government's strategy to continue improving the country's competitiveness?</h4><p>Internal reports as well as the IMF, The World Bank, and other international entities show that Panama's economy continues to lead the region's economic growth and attracts more foreign investment, with low levels of inflation and unemployment, confirming the country's great performance and its excellent prospects, which have been strengthened after the expansion of the inter-oceanic route. The Panamanian government implements numerous initiatives that seek to further strengthen the economy, a diversified economy that has allowed us to confront and resist the different economic cycles at the international level. It is worth highlighting what we are doing to consolidate Panama as the logistics center of the Americas and continue to be a bridge between continents. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, the strategic role of our country for both regions will continue to increase. Currently, work is underway on the elaboration of a master plan for infrastructure, transport, and logistics of cargo for the Interoceanic Zone of the Panama Canal. The objective of the study is, among others, to promote the development of value added logistics services, and to order investments in transportation infrastructure in the areas surrounding the Panama Canal to maintain and increase its competitive advantages.</p><h4>What should Panama do to increase its image as a transparent and reliable country to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>Panama has adopted and ratified all the necessary tools and commitments to be in accordance with international standards on transparency and fiscal cooperation. Now, Panama focuses on the development and strengthening of its international financial and services platform, developing new products, services, and competitive advantages in this area. From the ministries of foreign affairs, trade and industries, and economy and finance, we promote the international investment opportunities in the country, revealing the competitive advantages of Panama, which include the great connection of the Americas, fiscal transparency, legal security, and incentives such as the multinational headquarters law. There is a special emphasis on the logistics and port sector, enhancing the advantages offered by the expanded Panama Canal, which has opened the doors to the supply of new goods, such as liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico to Korea and Japan, as well as Colombian coal and Brazilian iron ore to China. Among other investment opportunities are the value chains that can be generated with the Neopanamax ship traffic, both to supply these ships and to take advantage of the inputs they carry to add value and generate new products and services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Jamaica and Panama cooperate to boost opportunities for growth?</h4><p>Jamaica and Panama have a long history of cooperation. Many Jamaicans left here to build the Panama Canal and have formed a strong Jamaican community in Panama, so there is a historical basis for us to continue cooperating. The flight from Panama to Jamaica on Copa Airlines is significant as well; it is probably the main connection to the South American continent from the Caribbean. That needs to be explored because Central and South America offer a great tourism market. Many people in South and Central America who take vacations end up in North America; however, the Caribbean is right here. It is closer, involves less hassle, and there are many interesting things to see and do. There is a great potential to develop a product between Jamaica and the South American region. More flights are critical because much of South America could come through Panama to get to the Caribbean region.</p><h4>What can Jamaica learn from Panama's experience in regards to Jamaica's attempts to boost operation efficiency in the Port of Kingston?</h4><p>Determination gets it done. The Panamanian government made it a priority to expand the Panama Canal and it became an entire government and bipartisan approach. Jamaica is taking the same approach with logistics and the divestment of our port. We have diversity in our port and that crossed several administrations. Our port is now developed and there are plans for expansion. That will enable and facilitate more shipping between our port and the Panama Canal. However, I believe logistics around the port could give Jamaica a boost and the lesson is that it requires determination across government administrations to get it done; that is the approach I am taking. We are engaging both the government and the private sector and driving the entire government to develop logistics in Jamaica.</p><h4>How would the region benefit from a regional strategy of renewables?</h4><p>Jamaica is probably the most advanced company in CARICOM in terms of the diversification of its energy mix. The other countries in the Caribbean region are doing well in terms of the efficiency of their refinery and the integration and expansion of renewables in their energy mix. We have benefited from the energy initiative launched under the previous US administration, which facilitated the development of an LNG terminal. In addition, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from the US has also invested in renewables as well in Jamaica. We are doing very well in diversifying our energy mix here in Jamaica. Our intention is to become the hub since we have had the jumpstart.</p><h4>Apart from logistics and tourism, what other sectors have a great deal of growth potential?</h4><p>Business process outsourcing is indeed a major growth area for Jamaica. An entire government effort is being made to facilitate the development of that industry. It is an industry that can reap quick results in terms of employment; however, we have to plan for this industry in the long term because it changes rapidly in line with technology. On the horizon is technology that could make redundant some of the functions that are not being performed in call centers and other such operations. It means we have to rapidly upscale our workforce. While we try to get in that industry in a large way, we also plan how to upscale rapidly so that as the industry changes we are still leaders in the industry in the region.</p><h4>Where do you want to see Jamaica in the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term, we want to get Jamaica up to full employment as quickly as possible. We want to be at 5% growth sustained in the middle term. We want to have a diversified economy in terms of energy, tourism, agriculture, business processing, and logistics. We also want to have a country that is at peace with itself, where crime is under control and our natural creativity can be expressed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[of-progress-and-port-calls]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2016 saw an historic expansion of the canal. How is it impacting the national economy and what sectors are benefiting the most?</h4><p>The expanded canal has increased transit capacity. We had the biggest RoRo ship passing through the Panama Canal in early 2017. Mexico has become one of the biggest exporters of cars and now uses the canal to reach the east coast of the US. Asian cars also pass through the canal, RoRos are interesting. Panama is considering building a specific port just for cars from Asia where we offload them in Panama and add value—such as specification stickers in Spanish—before reloading and sending them onward, specifically to South America. Another important impact has been on the natural gas industry. We just had the biggest natural gas ships go through the Panama Canal, and the government is looking at the possibility of building a port on the Pacific side to supply natural gas. We definitely made the right decision to expand the canal; the numbers are there but the world market and shipping industry are having a tough time. Revenues have held even because we raised the fares a little to meet the lowered tonnage. But there are still great opportunities out there.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles and challenges that international companies face when doing business in Panama? </h4><p>The president of Panama visited the Chamber of Commerce in June, and we made him a presentation of the things we thought the government should do to help the economy. Our first issue was bureaucracy and trying to expedite processes and make government transactions more efficient. In that regard, we have been working with AIG and the FTA of Panama, which provide certification. They are working on a process to improve the time it takes for approval of medicines, cosmetics, and other personal-use products. The approval for construction blueprints has been a challenge, and they appointed a new municipal engineer. We cannot automatically fix a bad process; we have to redesign and reengineer the process and then automate it. Therefore, we are working with the government to redesign processes, working with medical issues, construction, and customs. We want to become the port for Central America and are trying to expand because we are the only country that has one port with two oceans. To do this, we need to fix customs, especially the process of going through Paso Canoas in Costa Rica. The Panama Canal shows that Panama can have a publicly owned company that really works. We are proposing a law to grab some of these public companies and make them more like the Panama Canal.</p><h4>The WBG foresees 6.4% growth for Panama in 2017. What segments will drive this?</h4><p>There are three sectors. The first is logistics and the second is tourism. We are a country with two oceans, history, ruins from colonial forts, native tribes, jungles, and mountains. The Pearl Islands are an archipelago on the Pacific coast that look like Aruba or San Martin—the sand is so white and there is a lot more fish, more food, and a lot of calm. On the Pacific side, we have Coiba, the largest island on the Pacific side of the Americas. We have mountains, nice cool weather, and both oceans; where else can you find that? </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Around 500 years ago, the conqueror Hernan Cortés found the meeting point between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This is how Panama initiated a new world through the construction of a railroad and a water canal, and is the reason why it is today uniting the civil society and the investigative community to fight against corruption in the world. I welcome you to meet the true Panama.</p><p>I have been given the opportunity to participate in the 17th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC), organized by Transparency International and the National Authority of Transparency and Access to Information (ANTAI), the Minister of External Affairs of Panama, IACC Council, and Transparency International with headquarters in Berlin. This international transparency and anti-corruption conference is the largest and most important of its kind in the world. Here, we find the most devoted organizations to the fight against corruption and their most relevant personalities. This conference will serve as a backdrop to analyze in detail the proposed themes of this edition, such as justice, equity, security, and trust. The conclusions drawn from this conference will enable us to face the challenges posed by global corruption.<br>I would like to congratulate Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado, Vice President of Panama, and Angélica Maytí­n, Director General of ANTAI, for putting forth this initiative. Allowing open dialog with representatives of the participating organizations will strengthen international cooperation between the government, civil society, the private sector, and citizens. Panama believes in transparency and has zero tolerance toward corruption. For this reason, we are delighted to host the 17th edition of this conference, and we hope that the conclusions drawn from the debates will contribute to the promotion of a more just and fair world, a world in which people are not only at the core of public policymaking but are also the subject of its results. </p><p>By hosting the IACC, Panama places itself as a global leader in the anti-corruption movement, creating a conducive working environment for international experts and leaders that will enrich and strengthen us all. Panamanians have a historic vocation to foster meetings, debates, congresses, and conferences. It is in our nature to choose dialog and negotiation instead of wandering around the uncertain paths of confrontation, aggression, and epithets. Therefore, on November 25, 2015 the government of Panama, represented by ANTAI, signed a MoU to set out the main responsibilities of the organization of this event with IACC Council, Transparency International, and the Transparency International National Chapter in Panama.</p><p>Panama is a country with a history of success that has not depended on irregular cash flows in our financial system. Our success is based on the hard work of Panamanians, their generosity, and their love for peace. Despite the small size of Panama, both in dimension and population, it has found an important place in the concert of the nations. We are aware that by having a world-class international services platform we are committed to be responsible world citizens. Panama, as a responsible and serious country, assumes its obligation to act in accordance with international law. We are committed to cooperating as a regional partner or strategic ally both in trade and security matters in the same way in which we committed ourselves to completing the Panama Canal expansion and protecting our platform of logistics services against organized crime. Panama has decided to defend its financial system and to move forward with the exchange of information in matters of taxation.</p><p>We will continue our collaboration with the international community in order to avoid the exploitation of our financial system. I encourage everyone to develop proposals that would bring genuine solutions, and, thus, create new ways to better coexist. We have now built a country with a solid and long-lasting base that will ensure more justice, equity, and security to all our citizens. I want to thank all those who have followed up on the tasks that were required to build this solid base; they will be the living proof of our country's efforts. I believe that security is the precondition for any financial system to be trusted around the world. We will continue to be engaged with this cause, investing resources and the necessary time and effort to offer reliable services in our financial system. We will not stop fighting for the security of our people, and it is our duty to defend it. On our part, we know we have the necessary motivation to perform our duties both in this country and the world around us. </p><p>I would like to take this moment to share some topics that are of utmost importance in the global fight against corruption. First, I want to defend public prosecutors, all those men and women who are at the forefront of this fight. The salary that a public prosecutor earns in five years is the same amount earned in an hour by a lawyer defending a corrupt person. That figure alone is unacceptable. It is important to defend and support public ministries so that they can continue their fight against corruption. Panama is on the right path against corruption. We have taken precautionary measures that have saved USD120 million in liquid resources and assets only in the past 28 months, and we have also prosecuted people that held senior positions in Panama's political and economic institutions. </p><p>However, I feel that we are not always supported by society. The anti-corruption fight has to be a popular cause supported by the people. If we lose support from them, the cause will not be attainable. It is important to end the corruption of a country's political and private systems but, in order to do so, it has to be a popular cause backed by the people. If we affect innocent people, if we destroy political systems and economies, we will not get the support we need.</p><p>During our campaign, our winning statement was our promise to deliver 25,000 free houses to the people of Panama. However, that number has now been raised to 100,000 houses. This has been made possible thanks to our anti-corruption measures. After bringing down the corrupt system at Tocumen Airport, we are now generating USD70 million more per year in revenues—USD400 million more during our five years of administration. Likewise, we now save USD30 million yearly by buying rice from state to state, accounting for USD150 million under one administration. Thanks to the transparency policies installed by our government we currently have 60,000 houses in production. Therefore, as a result of the group of men and women that are at the forefront of this fight, there will now be a legacy that will benefit 75,000 more Panamanian families than I initially promised. This way, people can see the benefits of the anti-corruption movement and will thus strongly support our cause.</p><p>We must continue fighting the corruption in our political and economic system. We must do it carefully so that no innocent people are affected and make sure there are tangible results to demonstrate to the population what has been done. Panama's transparency case will be a turning point in history. In a few years' time, we will be able to show the Panamanian population and the whole world how this government has continuously committed to the fight against corruption and to the creation of wealth in the most transparent way available. In this country, there are a group of men and women that are committed to transparency, efficiency, and social responsibility for the benefit of the entire population. This government will not only be an example to future generations but also to nations around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the recent approval by the Makkah Region Development Authority to expand the construction area of the fifth, sixth, and seventh phases of the Jabal Omar Project?</h4><p>The total construction area will increase to 1.66 million sqm, compared to its previous size of 1.17 million sqm. Jabal Omar will take advantage of this increase to introduce new development concepts across those phases in order to add architectural and financial values and achieve the company's growth strategy YoY. JODC is the largest real estate developer in Saudi Arabia. Founded in 2006 with SAR9.2 billion in capital and a current market cap of SAR60 billion, Jabal Omar is the sixth-largest company on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). Currently our flagship project is in Makkah, located at the edge of the Al Haram. Our mixed-use project consists of 40 towers with a build-up area of 2.1 million sqm, including 15 five-star hotels, over 100,000sqm in malls, and approximately 3,000 residential units. Our vision is to make Jabal Omar the main destination for pilgrims and visitors to Makkah by creating innovative concepts and introducing new spaces and uses that will positively impact the pilgrimage experience.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the government's Vision 2030, and with the Hajj and Umrah industries expected to thrive under the ongoing reforms, what opportunities will the vision bring to JODC in the long term?</h4><p>JODC is a strong supporter and partner of Vision 2030 and Makkah in general, especially when it comes to the Hajj and Umrah. JODC coordinates its efforts closely with the Makkah Region Development Authority. Vision 2030 includes a strategic plan to develop the sector to allow the largest number of Muslims possible to perform Hajj and Umrah. The largest expansion of the Grand Mosque is underway in Islamic history. The plan as per the vision includes increasing the capacity to 30 million pilgrims and Umrah visitors in the coming years. Our projects seek to serve these pilgrims by not only accommodating them in our hotels or apartments but also introducing them to the Saudi and Islamic heritage through our different cultural elements. Moreover, Jabal Omar is a great contributor to the economy of Makkah and, more specifically, in creating jobs for local citizens.</p><h4>How does JODC deal with demand for commercially viable real estate projects that are open to foreign investment in Makkah, given the sensitive nature of the city?</h4><p>Foreign investment is a cornerstone of driving the Saudi economy to the next level. Direct international investments, considering compliance, will drive demand in the real estate markets and enhance liquidity and contribute to the overall growth of non-oil sectors such as residential, hospitality, and retail. In addition, such foreign investment can also contribute to an array of real estate assets and portfolios across Saudi Arabia. Our shareholders include government entities, charity foundations, large institutional investors, as well as high-net-worth individuals, a base that gives JODC a distinct advantage to attract international and regional operators. This in turn allows us to consider our strategic position and prepare for the future. Nonetheless, the JODC Board of Directors and management take into consideration the sensitivity of the location and consider sharia compliance in all situations. In addition, we strive to maintain the touch of our local culture in the architecture of Jabal Omar project. We recently conducted a limited architectural design competition between four of the world's top architectural firms for our upcoming seven-star Four Seasons Hotel adjacent to the Holy Mosque. Foster + Partners won the competition with a superbly contextual design that fully respected the sanctity of Islam's most holy site. Moreover, we worked closely with the architects to achieve a design solution founded on providing guests with “luxury with humility."</p><h4>What does the future hold for JODC?</h4><p>We completed Phase I of the project in 2Q2017 with the opening of Jabal Omar Hilton Convention. Offering more 2,700 five-star rooms, shopping malls located on Ibrahim Al khalil Street, and the largest convention center in Makkah. We always aim high; our strategy is to be the national, world-class urban developer. Our strategy has proven successful this year, and we registered the highest profit in our history and in record time. With expansion in mind for our business, we have our eyes on other potential areas in Makkah, Medina, and surrounding areas. In addition, Jabal Omar is working on several investment packages that will attract the most astute buyer. We will soon announce the launch of Al Bawaba-Jabal Omar, which is a hotel operated by a five-star operator, allowing buyers to invest in what is arguably the best investment on earth, based on real estate fundamentals. We currently have two showrooms, Jeddah and Riyadh, with interactive models that allow interested parties to look at and experience the project and select and reserve their property with confidence and ease. Our chief of sales and marketing officer Mr David Nezar Awayda welcomes early registration in this project; this will allow buyers to select their preference no matter if it is for investment or personal use.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones have you been able to achieve in the past year?</h4><p>A tough year, 2016 saw sluggish demand, and Dubai is always a competitive market. Yet we still achieved more than 4% of our occupancy target and closed revenue per available room at an impressive 90% for our 299-room hotel. Our location, Al Barsha, is one of the biggest hubs for hotels making it even more competitive. When we opened in 2010 there were five hotels here and now there are 65. We believe that the intense competition helps us to thrive, to challenge ourselves, and hold every aspect of our hotel to a higher standard. 2016 was a success for Ramada Chelsea with a strong percentage of occupancy and ending the year with high revenues.</p><h4>How would you assess growth in the Dubai tourism market?</h4><p>For each of our 12 years being here in Dubai, we have achieved growth in line with the city's growth. New markets continue to open, old markets are flourishing, and the Emirate is doing well as we approach 2020, where we expect a further boom. The buildup to Expo 2020 will include building infrastructure, roads, and retail facilities, which will directly impact the hospitality industry as well. The government itself supports the industry through cooperation with the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) and Dubai Tourism on promotion through roadshows and inviting hotels onto different platforms of promotion in foreign countries. The best feather in the cap is creating visas on arrival for Chinese passport holders and permitting any Indian passport holder with a valid US visa, a visa on arrival. This illustrates the commitment of the Dubai government to be involved in supporting the industry and developing a stronger hospitality sector.</p><h4>Do you host many guests from the Far East?</h4><p>We receive a lot of guests from the East, mostly China. The majority of our guests come from Germany, occupying nearly 60 to 70 rooms every day. We receive guests from all over the EU, France, Austria, and Italy. Our other largest customer group is the GCC, particularly Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What opportunities have been made available by your central location?</h4><p>Internet City is quite competitive because there are a lot of hotels located in the telecoms area in general. In terms of attracting customers, Internet City helps, and Jebel Ali Free Zone helps as well, but the greatest unique selling point is being walking distance from the Mall of Emirates. This is why within a radius of one kilometer you will find over 65 hotels. We heavily promote that we are in walking distance to the Mall of Emirates as our primary USP as Dubai is major shopping hub for the entire region.</p><h4>How have user-review websites affected your business?</h4><p>User-review websites can often offer a deciding factor in terms of choosing a hotel, as guests go to the portal, check ratings, and measure what they are looking for against extensive reviews. Reviews play a major role in instructing and directing our internal development so that we can operate at peak levels in accordance to our guest's preferences. Therefore, next time, we can provide a better overall experience for them and all future guests. Other services like AirBnB have been in place for a long time and do not affect the hospitality sector. We offer a something more extensive than a room or an apartment with full service rooms, bar and restaurant options, and other services. Competition is important for us to do better and is instrumental in informing our strategy to better to achieve our operational goals. Because of both the nature and magnitude of the market, if someone can survive in Dubai, they can survive anywhere in the world.</p><h4>How does Ramada Chelsea differentiate itself from the competition?</h4><p>While every hotel has similar rooms, here we pride ourselves on our F&amp;B options and uniqueness it brings to our property. We have five dining options: an authentic Indian restaurant with live classical music each night. We have a sports bar with a British band playing five nights a week. Then we have the Arabic restaurant, which offers guests Shisha and Arabic cuisine. We also have a Chinese restaurant, as well as a 24-hour dining restaurant. The sports bar is the official sports bar for Glasgow Rangers fans and is one of the most popular in Al Barsha and is packed each night. Five days a week we have a band playing from 9:30pm to 2am, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings we have Premier League  football. Giving guests five distinctly different cuisines to choose from offers not only accommodation for any taste, but also an inclusive experience at our hotel.</p><h4>What kinds of opportunities and challenges are presented by offering such a mixed cultural cocktail?</h4><p>Our Arabic restaurant Mezz is one of the top choices for the GCC guests. We have channels so that guests can be segregated if they choose to be. Sometimes guests prefer to retain their privacy within the confines of their own tradition and culture. Other times they choose to mix together, for which we provide several options. The main challenges we are facing are with new hotels opening. In the next four to six months we are expecting another five or six hotels to open in Al Barsha alone. And as we were the fifth hotel to open here, our success has led others to replicate what we have done. While this competition may take away a small amount of business it ultimately forces us to continue to improve, offer new products, and chase innovation. In other words, it makes us pull our socks up and continue to be the best.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2016 Bank Audi's consolidated net profits rose by 17%, amounting to USD470 million compared to USD403 million in 2015. How would you evaluate 2016 and what factors led to this increase?</h4><p>There are no miracles or mysteries; the bank's figures highlight the strong performance achieved in the three main markets of the group: Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt. One ought yet to be careful when reading these figures because consolidated figures are normally expressed in US dollars, while the activity in our material subsidiaries abroad, mainly in Turkey and Egypt, is denominated in local currencies. Those two currencies witnessed severe depreciations in 2016 relative to the US dollar and that have affected the translation of the real performances at the consolidated level. When the Egyptian pound and the Turkish lira depreciate, the contribution to the consolidated assets and earnings translate into fewer dollars. It does not mean that the entities have not performed well; it is just a currency translation impact. Had the exchange rates of those currencies been the same as at end-December 2016 as they were as at end-December 2015,  the fundamental business in both countries would increase between 10-22%, outperforming in each countries the growth achieved by peer banks. That supports and justifies the important results achieved. It is actually a combination of good performances achieved in Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon, despite the volatility witnessed in Turkey and Egypt and despite the tough environment that prevailed in Lebanon over the year before the normalization of the political process throughout the election of the President and the formation of a national unity government. The past year was a good year for Bank Audi when taking all those factors into account.</p><h4>Where do you stand in terms of diversification?</h4><p>Today, Egypt represents 7% and Turkey represents 25% of consolidated assets. In four years of average activity, we have succeeded to build USD11 billion of assets in Turkey, generating USD26 million of net profits after tax and provisions in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to USD69 million in full year 2016, underscoring an exponential growth in net profits. The latter were generated on the backdrop of a cost to income ratio of 47% and a gross doubtful to gross loans ratio of 3.0%, clearly witnessing to a good financial position. Together they represent almost one-third of total assets and earnings of the group, which falls in line with the diversification strategy followed by the group. With the regional expansion launched in 2006 aiming at achieving a balanced breakdown between Lebanon and abroad, in terms of assets and earnings we are already there. The aggregation of our foreign activity now represents 42% of the total when adding Paris, Switzerland, Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. All these are markets where the group has a presence and has business there. Bank Audi is among the most geographically diversified banks in terms of the balance between domestic and foreign entities.</p><h4>Last year you mentioned also the bank's intentions to have a physical presence in regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. How is this progressing?</h4><p>We are already covering Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America but without a physical presence there. We have Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin American desks in Beirut, Switzerland, and Paris. We have relationship managers that only cover those two regions and have succeeded in building a business portfolio of close to USD3 billion today from the two geographies. Those are mainly deposits or assets under management in Switzerland or some trade finance or corporate loans that are mainly granted from Paris and Lebanon. When we succeed in building such an important franchise in geographies where we do not have any physical presence in, it does infer about our capacity to build material assets once we are on the ground. It could be the way forward towards a presence which form could range from representative offices to an acquisition of a small entity offering fully-fledged services. We do look at the possibility of such a move but this will materialize in due course. Today, it is still too early.</p><h4>What is your vision for economic development in the country this year?</h4><p>This economy requires a lot of restructuring and adjustments because it has been stagnant for the last five years. Since the outbreak of the Arab Spring and the Syrian war, real GDP growth rates have gone down from 8-9% per annum to 1-2%, per annum which represents a yearly forgone income of no less than 6-7% of GDP. That is a huge opportunity loss. The prospects have slightly improved post domestic political settlement in Lebanon that lead to the election of a new president and the formation of a new cabinet of national unity. In parallel, there are talks of possible plausible hypothetical settlements in Syria as per the recent statement of international and regional decision makers shaping events in the region. In case of a regional settlement scenario, the favorable spillover effects on Lebanon will be significant. Meanwhile, we believe that domestic economic prospects will improve but not to the extent of coming back quickly to the potential growth rates of Lebanon that are within the 6-8% range. We believe there is room to stimulate domestic consumption and investment and more external demand from the low base of the past few years. After seeing 1-2% per year for the last five years, we can assume that we are going into the next phase of growth, heading to potentially 3-4% this year and next year. The observed growth in real sector and financial indicators in the first quarter of this year are in line with such a perspective.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the group in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p>In Lebanon, Bank Audi is in the leadership position in the banking sector. Being the leader, we have a fiduciary responsibility, exerting a lot of pressure on us to set the tone and give an example in terms of governance, compliance, and risk management. We are keen to maintain our leadership at all those levels. There is no change in our priorities. Domestically, it still revolves around consolidating and strengthening our leadership in Lebanon with all it entails in terms of products and service offering and in terms of technology and communication investments and in terms of governance, compliance and risk abidance by the best practices. At the level of foreign businesses, we have set clear market share targets for our two most material markets: Turkey and Egypt. We will be further enhancing all means deployed in terms of financial resources, human resources or technological resources in the two markets in order to help them achieve the overall targets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What recent projects has ZICTA launched in Zambia?</h4><p>ZICTA has been government's implementing partner for a few years now. Following the revision of the ICT Act in 2009, our mandate expanded and we were able to help the government more actively implement some of its developmental projects in the ICT sector. From 2011, we started our drive to facilitate universal access, rolling out connectivity to underserved areas. Between 2012 and 2014, we installed geo-sim sites in rural areas. Over the total period, we installed 204 towers that initially provided communication for 400,000 people, and has since generated over 1 million web subscribers. Another recent project is the national addressing project. In Zambia, we have witnessed massive population growth in the last 20 years. Many smaller municipalities began expanding rapidly, with urban areas mushrooming across the country. However, this was accompanied by a lack of corresponding organization and town planning. The Ministry of Lands had one record while the city council had another; there was no communication or overlap between the two systems. We realized this was not a desirable situation, and therefore went to UPU and were given guidelines on how to implement a national addressing program. Through universal access we reviewed the existing numbering system, coming up with a new, logical way of numbering houses and naming streets. We carried out this initiative in high-density as well as low-density areas, and have broken records as the first country to provide such a system in villages in Africa. The project was designed to encourage e-commerce and also guarantee accessibility to emergency services.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Zambia National Data Centre (ZNDC) and what services will it provide for shareholders?</h4><p>The country did not have a national data center, and we realized this could provide vital services for the public and private sectors. We hope it will attract institutions to store their main databases at the ZNDC and offer backup to ensure business continuity. The center is being built and developed to tier-three standard, and therefore can provide globally competitive services for both the public and private sectors. To attract these business, we need to assure people that the system is highly secure. We were also acutely aware that the project would have to be commercially viable from the beginning. There are three sites located across the country, and for us to sustain global standards and best practice in all of these sites, we cannot afford to house information for free. We are working closely with Huawei, because it has the business expertise in this area. We have engaged other partners that can help us grow commercially as this is something new for us and capacity will not appear overnight. Our people are being trained and have been trained; however, implementing such a world-class initiative, and a first for Zambia, means we require time to develop and mature.</p><h4>How does ZICTA work alongside the government and its partners to review ICT legislation in the country?</h4><p>We have been hard at work reviewing all the acts, since our laws are mostly built on policies brought about in the 1990s. In the 1990s, the ICT matrix was in a different state than today. Then, we were a telecom center; now we need to move with the trends of a rapidly digitalizing world. We want to instill a legal framework that is flexible and does not require constant revision. With this in mind, we are redrafting the ICT Act, the ETC Act, and the Postal Services Act. We propose drawing up new laws; items in current laws that were previously listed as paragraphs or sub-clauses now need to stand out prominently as laws of their own. These include e-commerce and cyber security. ZICTA works closely with the World Bank to ensure these new regulations are relevant, incisive, and up-to-date.</p><h4>To what do you attribute Zambia's relatively low internet penetration rates?</h4><p>Penetration for voice communication in Zambia has rapidly improved: between 2011 and 2013 we climbed five places in the global ranking. However, data penetration, before the arrival of cheap smartphones, was embarrassingly low by ITU standards, at 3%. When we saw an increase in smartphone sales, we saw more people consuming data on their devices, pushing penetration up to just under 30%. This is a remarkable increase, though still not good enough. There are two critical issues here: literacy and price. We cannot talk about internet penetration if people cannot see the value in it. Considering many people cannot read or do not understand English, this immediately excludes a large number of potential users. If we can increase local content and have a local voice to encourage people to connect, we will see an increased appetite for digital platforms. The other aspect is that internet services in Zambia are expensive: we still rank amongst the most highly priced for connectivity in the region. This is because we are landlocked: everything that comes into the country incurs high transit costs. Then, because penetration is low, whatever data comes into the country has to be shared among this small number, bumping up costs. If we can obtain a higher penetration rate, the market will automatically depress and bring down these costs. If we can also look at a cheaper way of bringing in internet, this could also have an impact. We are working on a project to install virtual landing stations, for instance. Finally, it is important to remember that we also face high taxes. We have received feedback on this from a number of investors, all of whom demand a better pricing mechanism.</p><h4>What future initiatives does ZICTA have planned for 2017?</h4><p>We have been working tirelessly to ensure ICT literacy levels are boosted across the nation. We want to ensure our development is aligned with the goals set by World Information Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA). WITSA tasked its directors with connecting all villages and schools to the web by 2015. In the last decade or so, the UN has highlighted that ICT access is a human right. We began a project to provide communities with access through schools, setting up ICT labs and ensuring that all tertiary education facilities had connection. Since then, we have managed to set up connectivity at three public institutions, 69 colleges and universities, and about 200 schools, both primary and secondary. We are also constructing a computer assembly plant before the year ends. We hope these developments will inspire children who are coding software in class to see that there is a viable market and a future in the sector. Secondly we are working on setting up a standards lab in order to validate the standards of our equipment. Currently we do not have a physical assessment process to check the standards of equipment that is imported or produced locally. In fact, there are only one or two of these in Africa, and therefore we are working with ITU to consider Zambia as a regional center for standards that would serve Malawi, Zimbabwe, and other nearby countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NCCAL has been around since 1973, mandated to coordinate educational, literary, artistic, and cultural development in Kuwait. Could you tell us more about what your activities here include?</h4><p>The decree of establishing the National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters sets out various tasks that have contributed to raising the cultural landscape in the State of Kuwait. It preserves, documents, and publishes popular heritage, as well as encourages reading and writing. It supports intellectual and cultural creativity locally, within the Arab region, and worldwide. The Council sponsors 10 annual festivals that deal with theater, cinema, literary writing, children, youth, archeology, book fairs, and fine art. It also organizes many internal and external cultural weeks in application of over seventy bilateral cultural agreements between many countries around the world.</p><h4>The recently announced “New Kuwait“ initiative aims to raise the bar of the nation's international standards across the board, setting the nation's long-term objectives in five strategic directions. How do you envision this new strategic plan to part of the policy for the cultural sector?</h4><p>Cultural activity and action is a fundamental part of the development plan. The Council plays an important role in this regard, especially in preserving national identity, supporting heritage, caring for children, and cultivating their cultural and artistic talents. We will also have a role in sponsoring about 48 public libraries throughout all the regions in Kuwait, which requires a double effort to activate them. There is also significant activity in tourism support through cultural festivals, museums, and historical buildings, as well as the remarkable activity of archeological excavations that revealed ancient civilizations in the country's lands and islands.</p><h4>The Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Center was opened last year as a world-class theater quarter and a new symbol of Kuwaiti architecture. Together with the Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre, it forms the new national cultural district. How do these and other initiatives shape the Kuwaiti cultural identity?</h4><p>Without a doubt, a new edifice created to serve the cultural movement will add a material and moral balance to Kuwait's developmental structure. The leading buildings mentioned in the question, as well as the other buildings under the council's leadership, ultimately achieve a nominal goal, which is serving the public, meeting their cognitive and cultural needs, and improving their artistic taste. Furthermore, if Kuwait develops cultural centers similar to the Jaber Al- Ahmad and Abdullah Al- Salem Cultural Center, it will prepare a qualitative leap for cultural work.</p><h4>Kuwait became UNESCO's Islamic Cultural Capital, aimed at boosting cultural knowledge amongst the youth. Could you tell us more about the interaction with UNESCO and the recognized Islamic cultural heritage? How does NCCAL interact with other Arabic cultural centers?</h4><p>The Capital of Islamic Culture is a title awarded by ISESCO to Kuwait in 2016, and it is a tribute to a history of more than 60 years of cultural interest in Kuwait before and after its independence. This title is an opportunity to highlight the interrelationships between people in the Islamic regions, and not only Arab regions, for through this celebration elements embedded in Islamic civilization can be highlighted, including in science, culture, civilization, urbanization, and cooperation and interaction with different communities. In 2016, the Council was able to provide 826 service activities for this event and succeeded in highlighting the beautiful values enjoyed by the Islamic civilization.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will continue to work on what has been built in the past five years in many cultural fields. We will give priority to the subject of reading for children, paying attention to public libraries, strengthening cooperation with civil society institutions and building partnerships with the private sector. We also plan to strengthen tourist activity through giving attention to historic and heritage centers that fall under the council's supervision. We also aim to train our staff to keep up with developments in the field of culture, and to increase interest in youth production throughout many areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you participating in renewable energy generation and the water sector?</h4><p>Diversification of power generation in Saudi Arabia is now changing and will further accelerate, as the government has announced in Saudi Vision 2030 that renewables are to be an important part of the energy mix in the future. The Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO), part of the Ministry of Energy, Industry &amp; Mineral Resources, is drafting the right regulations and working to create a conducive environment for private companies to contribute to the renewables sector. General Electric is a global leader in the wind sector, and last year we agreed to install two wind turbines in the Kingdom with our long-term Saudi partners, one in the northern part of the country at Turaif and the second close to Riyadh at Huraymlah. Both wind turbines were installed in January 2017 at the same time, and were intended to demonstrate that wind turbine technology in Saudi Arabia is possible and worth pursuing. Today, both wind turbines are generating power. The government announced a target of 9.5GW of renewable energy by 2023 with the first 750MW now on the market. GE is proud to contribute to this and to be a part of clean energy projects in the Kingdom. From a water standpoint, GE is leading in water treatment plants, and we are generating 180 million cubic liters of clean water for remote areas.</p><h4>What investments have you made in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In each decade GE has been in the Kingdom, we have done something different from an investment point of view. From tapping oil resources, to helping different regions have access to electricity, to supporting aviation and the air force, to improving the healthcare system and latterly establishing an advanced manufacturing and innovation ecosystem. In 2012, GE launched what we referred to as Project Kingdom, which was a commitment to invest US$ 1 bn to support the economy by successfully undertaking localization projects in human capability development, manufacturing and innovation. When Saudi Vision 2030 was announced, we had been working on various investment initiatives for a few months at that time so  GE was the first company to support the Vision by making a number of big announcement about a month later; .At this time we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Dussur (SAIIC) Saudi Arabian Industrial Investment Company)to co-invest around USD3 billion in strategic sectors that will support the localization of industrial value chains in Saudi Arabia to serve the domestic market and beyond. . We also signed a US$ 400 m agreement with Saudi Aramco and Cividale of Italy to set up a first-of-its-kind Forging &amp; Casting manufacturing facility to serve the region's maritime and energy industries. At that time in May 2016 we also announced another eight programs including working with with MODON on smart factories, an aviation program with Middle East Propulsion Company (MEPC), and an agreement with AlSharqia Chamber to train 1,000 women in the Eastern Province on Digital and 3D design and printing. At GE, we work with stakeholders to make sure that all the Vision's areas are supported. Our collaboration with Dussur is to strengthen local content in Saudi Arabia, localize and support local hiring, and make sure that we support local Saudi suppliers and strengthen the “Made in Saudi" brand.</p><h4>How do you currently participate in the aviation sector?</h4><p>We are already working on the first investment we announced in May 2016 with MEPCon military aviation. We will bring support for the airplane engines such as the F110 and T700. We are currently building those localized capabilities and, later, with other investors, we are going to introduce overhaul and repair facilities.</p><h4>Recent global spending cuts have affected research and innovation. How have you managed this?</h4><p>We are working at high speed to demonstrate our R&amp;D abilities in Saudi Arabia. We started a few years ago and of course there are high expectations from our local customers. As part of our investment initiatives, we have set up a research facility in Saudi and will be opening a new Hot &amp; Harsh R&amp;D facility at GEMTEC (GE Manufacturing &amp; Technology Center), in Dammam that'll further focus on the energy sector. In Saudi Arabia we are working at the same speed and commitment and are working within the current environment to make sure that our commitments to our customers are not be affected.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>GE is here to stay and what we have built already is evidence of our long-term commitments. Our 2,000 strong GE team and our facilities are each part of a larger ecosystem. To see-through and to execute the results of it means that we need to continue to work hard in 2017, 2018, 2019 and beyond. The GE team is very excited and we have a lot of new blood in the company. In Saudi Arabia, GE planted seeds for the future and based on that we think that 2017 will be excellent year and 2018 will be even better for GE and its employees. We are going to continue what we have built, see the results, and take things to the very best level that we can.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Besides our four-star offering and very high service standard, our guests can overlook the Arabian Gulf from our premises. We offer different types of rooms and suites; standard, deluxe, and four different kinds of luxurious suites, all with competitive rates. For business travelers, we provide all required facilities and support for their requirements. For families, we have special packages that give the chance to each member of the family to enjoy his stay to the maximum level. Our restaurant offerings include Japanese cuisine, seafood, an international buffet, and place for our famous shisha. Our spa has unique offerings for our female guests; it offers them many professional treatments as per their requirements.</p><h4>What should be done to unlock the full potential of Kuwait's business and leisure tourism, and where does Kuwait stand in comparison with other regional destinations?</h4><p>Kuwait is improving the touristic facilities in all aspects; some of them are being enlarged, constructed, and some are on the drawing table to be implemented in the near future. The new Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Center is a great example of such attractive facilities. It attracts visitors from all GCC countries especially for its wide range of concerts and other events. There are still obstacles that present challenges for tourists, like our visa requirements, albeit the government has now implemented an online visa program, an important step. More attractions are required in order to compete within the region; tourism has become a main source of income for many countries. In Kuwait, we can be much better by increasing the attractions, especially for families.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are optimistic and always look for opportunities that can enhance our business in the future. Developing our properties is a continuous process and new ideas are always in the pipeline. Kuwait is developing gradually and we are part of it. We do have here very good attractions for people to see and try. Kuwait has become a destination for GCC nationals whenever they have public holidays. They come as groups and families to enjoy the friendly atmosphere, especially in winter. As a Kuwaiti company we are planning to expand in Kuwait as well as abroad. Our new hotel in Spain will be opened in the summer of 2017 and it is the first Kuwaiti hotel in Europe owned and managed by a Kuwaiti company. Other projects are also being developed and will be ready in the near future. We move forward with steady steps and we make sure that the base is strong enough to bare our ambition, and we are looking forward to growing our business and to being on all continents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

How have you performed since the IPO?</h4><p>Mezzan Holding listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange on June 11, 2015 after its transformation from a family-owned business. Mezzan's stock is still up 30% from the private placement price prior to listing. From day one there has been a great deal of traction because, first of all, it is a defensive sector, secondly a Kuwaiti story, and thirdly a credible name and a food and beverage company. Our stockholders include Al-Wazzan family members at 63% and Oberoi family members, while approximately 30% of our stock is free floated and owned by Kuwaiti retail, GCC quasi-sovereign, and corporate institutional investors, as well as international, regional, and local asset managers. The primary objective of listing was succession planning beyond the second generation. Today, around 75% of Mezzan's operations are in the food business, while 75% of our revenue is generated from discretionary and non-discretionary fast-moving consumer goods. Mezzan's operations span seven countries, where Kuwait—our home market—accounts for 65% of revenue in addition to operations in UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Afghanistan. In 2016, we recorded sales of KWD207.4 million, with profits of KWD17.2 million. Of course, because of our soft parallel portfolio, we are exposed to certain risks; however, our investors are pleased as our risk profile is diversified, both geographically and in terms of product portfolio and range.</p><h4>In August, Mezzan Holding acquired a 70% stake in Saudi Arabia-based Al Safi Foods. What are your expansion plans there?</h4><p>The Saudi market is the largest consumer market in the GCC. We went to look for the right asset and the right partner to execute our venture into Saudi Arabia and to grow our holding there. We found Al Safi Foods, whose owners decided it preferred to be an investor rather than an operator. This partnership had potential, and we injected KWD7.3 million into the company for a 70% stake and our partners Al Faisaliah Group own the remainder. Mezzan Foods will be the vehicle through which we expand our operations in food manufacturing and distribution in the Kingdom. We now consider different options to increase our product portfolio there and local production. In two years' time, we expect Mezzan Foods to make up around 5-10% of our business.</p><h4>How do you envision diversification within your portfolio?</h4><p>We look at vertical integration, including production and integrating more parts of the process to lock margins. If we find great brands in non-foods, we will certainly consider them; however, our focus outside of Kuwait is primarily on food. Having a core strength gives us bargaining power through our distribution platform. It is becoming more in our DNA to look not only at organic growth but also inorganic growth.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the evolution of food trends in the MENA region?</h4><p>There is a shift toward healthier products and greater awareness, and we are on track to adopting healthier eating habits. Water is becoming more prevalent vis-í -vis sparkling drinks and it is becoming a health fad growing in Kuwait and the region. Following consumer trends we adjust our products as well, as we now have kettle-cooked chips that use around 40% less oil. A short-term trend is spending awareness, and people are spending less at restaurants and instead buying in grocery stores.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the company in the year ahead?</h4><p>We have committed ourselves to the Saudi market, and my ambition is to win a 5-10% share in the market there. In Kuwait, we are expanding in the right sectors and are putting together a new line of water beverages. At an operational level, we seek to enhance our efficiency and invest in technology and infrastructure. For example, we will improve centralization in our warehousing and distribution for the different product lines in our food business in Kuwait and the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The recently announced New Kuwait initiative aims at raising the bar of the nation's international standards across the board. How do you envision the New Kuwait initiative to govern the policy at your ministry?</h4><p>The Ministry of State for Youth Affairs (MYA) derives its direction and strategy from both national and international developments, especially as it pertains to youth and their shared vision and mission. As a result, one of the ministry's priorities is the drafting of the country's first National Youth Policy in Kuwait, which addresses a spectrum of aspects covering different youth segments, and focuses on both holistic and multi-sectoral interventions in the field of overall youth development. The key is to build a new generation of pioneers and game-changers that will, in turn, create new industries with the potential to rival the country's current dependency on oil.</p><h4>Do you envision more e-platforms and blended learning programs?</h4><p>Private universities in Kuwait are the first in the region to utilize e-learning solutions, as the implementation and integration of ICT systems took place more than a decade ago. As for the public sector, around 83% of public learning institutions have adopted Student Information Systems and 62% are using Learning Management Systems. Kuwait University, our public university, has launched a series of different e-platforms serving different purposes along different fields of study. These will continue to improve in the coming years as we put policies in place in order to improve the adoption of such platforms as we move toward globalization. MYA has played a crucial role by supporting informal education and online training courses. We have also started funding non-profit tech projects that serve the youth through our Initiatives Program. MYA has been a leader in e-services within the government as it currently operates wirelessly across all departments via a custom-designed document management and correspondence system (DMS). In turn, it also provides fully integrated online solutions, which serve our youth community via our website and application.</p><h4>MYA recently concluded an MoU with tech giant Huawei to develop ICT skills amongst the youth. May we expect more public-private collaborations here?</h4><p>The government of Kuwait has been working to increase public-private partnerships as it is one of the major focus areas in the Kuwait Vision 2035. When it comes to ICT, Kuwait is amongst the top five in the region in the ICT Development Index and we plan to thrive in that area. That is one of the reasons MYA has been studying the dynamics of corporate social responsibility in Kuwait and taking steps toward creating a CSR ecosystem catering to youth development. MYA has collaborations with ICT leaders such as Ooredoo, Huawei, and many others. And we foresee many more collaborations in the near future.</p><h4>How do you envision preparing the youth to become the leaders of tomorrow?</h4><p>MYA has been working toward youth development and empowerment while promoting a sense of citizenship and mutual belonging. Through our vast array of programs, we are leading by example in ensuring the provision of equal opportunities with a high level of transparency and efficiency. We believe firmly that, in order to succeed, full ownership of the youth agenda needs to belong to the youth themselves. As a result, to engage and empower our youth, the ministry has been built for the youth by the youth. Today, the average age of an employee at the ministry is 25 years. This not only allows us to invest in our future leaders, but it also exposes them to needs of their community and allows them to engage fully in the decision-making process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you strive for synergies with the other entities under the KPC umbrella?</h4><p>In general we are all under the same strategy and the same targets, which are set by KPC. Our task is to transport all the crude and processed products to the customers that KPC deals with. KOTC is the operator in the transportation area, and our activities are directly linked to KPC's customer demand. We align ourselves with the strategy, and since KPC has committed to 3 million bpd by 2020, we have been investing in fleet capacity. In the end, all KPC subsidiaries perform as a team to deliver the targets that are set. For example, if KNPC invests further in an LPG plant with a LNG delivery point, we will invest accordingly in our fleet and purchase LNG carriers. Thus far, gas is only for domestic use, primarily to fuel operations in the power plants and refineries. As industrial demand is growing, and consumer demand also increases, we might expand our gas facilities or import more. There is a dream that one day we will have LPG connected to our residential areas, but that involves carrying LPG across the oceans for us.</p><h4>What is the status of the fourth phase of your fleet expansion?</h4><p>For the fourth phase we are talking about a fleet renewal and expansion scheme to construct one very large crude carrier (VLCC), three LPG carriers, and four medium range (MR) carriers. For these investments, we have taken into account two main factors; the age of our current ships and the manufacturing time of new ones, as well as the anticipated demand of KPC. Phase III has been executed well and came in ahead of time. With the increased capacity we have been quite comfortably meeting the demand growth thus far, and with Phase IV we should be getting ahead of that. Korean companies have historically been our primary contractors here, and we find them proficient, professional, and prompt in delivery. They were chosen through a bidding process and have shown reasonable pricing and great capabilities.</p><h4>How do you expect commitments made during the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to influence the government's policy and your operations within KOTC?</h4><p>We are certainly committed and even before that agreement we strived for safety with all of our ships, taking into account every environmental measure that we can. Of course, our activities are subject to international rules and regulations, and we also enforce our own. Incidents may happen, and whenever something happens anywhere in the world, we recheck our own operations to secure our safety on the ocean. We closely collaborate with the International Maritime Organization, and with insurers and brokers to understand what the latest safety measures are. KOTC has been distinguished as one of the global leaders in safety.</p><h4>What are your ambitions as the chairman in the long term for KOTC?</h4><p>KOTC should be autonomous. Today we are tied up with KPC, and we should focus more on business development within KOTC. It is in our line of business to see if there are any opportunities that KOTC can enter into in order to increase our profitability. I would like to see KOTC be more dynamic and flexible and become a truly international company. To do this, we are considering putting a business development unit in place to study those opportunities in the market. These markets could be anywhere, as Kuwait is limited and the world is an open ground for everybody to take their horses and run. Interestingly, KOTC started as a private company in 1957, as a pioneer in the sea transportation of crude oil. In 1976 the government decided it was imperative to join and started with a 49% stake in the entity. Three years later KOTC was fully owned by the government. Because we started as a private company, we still have the entrepreneurial DNA and should leverage that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the cornerstones of your operational strategy in 2016?</h4><p>At the end of 2015, we received budget approval from the Council of Ministers to redevelop the entire infrastructure of the KPA. This includes transforming the current storage areas into the Kuwait Logistics City Project and a complete transformation of three ports into smart port systems with fully integrated control systems. We are also implementing a new tracking system, allowing companies to track their containers via our partners the General Department For Customs. KPA works hand in hand with customs to expand the size of its customs plots to allow it to inspect more incoming containers and general cargo because of the increase in incoming goods. Furthermore, RFID, container tracking, vehicle tracking, and smart gate systems will be included in the smart port system. We have strategized with the National Technology Enterprises Company to control the whole infrastructure and terms of reference to prequalify international companies to implement such a project. Integration is the most important element in this type of project. No other port has integrated facilities under one single roof. For our 2016-17 strategy, we are looking at the expansion of Shuaiba Port and have invited 11 international consultancy companies to present their offers via the Consultancy Firms Committee under the General Secretariat of Planning &amp; Development.</p><h4>How will these efficiencies impact revenues for KPA?</h4><p>A year before I joined KPA, the authority made profits of KWD14 million in the 2014-2015 fiscal year. The following year it was KWD31 million, and for 2016-2017 we are approaching KWD40 million. After implementing all our projects in our approved strategy, we expect to more than quadruple our profits, which would put us amongst the top ports in the world in terms of profits. Reaching this goal requires a number of other changes as well, such as completely developing the current aging facilities and port infrastructure and increasing our Kuwaiti operational staff capabilities by training them at different port agencies and maritime academies all over the world. We also have vast storage facilities and want to introduce an integrated, end-to-end logistics system to become a service provider rather than a landlord. In fact, the concept of rental per square meter has completely changed into a fee per service per cubic meter. The revenue stream of that multiplies by 5-10, which would be a great income-generating stream. This can be implemented by transforming the current storage areas into Kuwait Logistics City.</p><h4>Kuwait has ambitions to boost its status as a regional logistics hub. What is your vision on the interconnectivity of ports in the region?</h4><p>As a country, we import a great deal of what we consume and therefore require roads, bridges, railways, airports, and ports to satisfy the day-to-day influx of these goods. We seek an integration of the sea, roads, railways, and airports. There are so many countries that have excelled and gone through the phase of trial and error, and we should learn from that experience in terms of how those ports are run and the integration of systems. As the ports authority, we would be happy to share our experiences and best practices. This will allow us to become a role model of how ports should be run in the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will finalize all our engineering works and should be starting the prequalification process of international contractors for the expansion of Shuwaikh and Shuaiba. At the port authority, we have three indexes: the port efficiency index, the port infrastructure index, and the logistics index—the latter as part of the World Bank. In all three, we were listed as being in last place among the GCC countries. Once we build the Kuwait Logistics City, expand our ports, and introduce the integrated smart port system, we will definitely be one of the top in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[much-to-follow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the scope of METCO's operations? What are the recent trends in the market in Kuwait?</h4><p>METCO mainly concentrates on two arms of the telecommunications business: we provide transmission services for the operators, and we do enterprise activities, such as call centers. Of course, the technology in telecommunications changes so rapidly and the market is becoming over saturated. There are big players that concentrate on penetrating the market as much as they can with new technology. While competition is a healthy thing to have, there is certainly a high level of saturation. There is a lot of refurbished second-hand hardware coming into the gray market here and this equipment is being sold as new. Unfortunately, there are still no controls over these gray-market products.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for METCO in e-government solutions and what are the challenges for your industry?</h4><p>The government has said repeatedly it wants to create an e-government system here, but it is taking a long time. Other countries have overtaken Kuwait's efforts. I hope that the government implements an e-government scheme soon because it will create transparency, better access to information, and improve official processes. For example, it takes a long time to register a company in Kuwait—the bureaucratic process is long. The new Minister of Trade and Commerce has announced that he is going to change the regulations and introduce e-registration for companies. Some of these changes have already been introduced, but we hope the rest will follow soon.</p><h4>How do you envisage Kuwait transforming into a knowledge-based economy and developing non-oil revenue streams?</h4><p>The fact is that Kuwait does not have any resources other than oil, so whatever we do has to be around the oil sector and its further development. The other area that was identified by His Highness the Amir many years ago was the transformation of Kuwait into a business and financial center. However, doing that will require a lot of concentrated effort and expertise to handle the development of that sector. The vision is right, but unfortunately the implementation of that vision has been slow. We need to put a complete team in place to drive this, and this has been done.</p><h4>Where does Kuwait rank as an early adopter of technology compared to the other countries METCO operates in?</h4><p>Kuwait is in the middle; it could be much more advanced in the adoption of new technologies given the availability of wealth and our educated people, such as our knowledgeable graduates coming out of university. Certainly the country could have done much better and we need a chance to do this. METCO is trying to drive the industry by sending our people to advanced courses outside Kuwait in places such as Europe. It is difficult to get the right people from the universities and train them up in the ICT field because most people want an easy job.</p><h4>In what ways is METCO striving for innovation and what partnerships do you look for to support this process?</h4><p>The area of innovation I see the whole telecommunications sector moving to at the moment is the development of applications. Applications are becoming the primary innovations of the industry. I think the old age of boxes has finished; now the aim is to have applications and those applications are really becoming the area of most interest to many people. We are actively looking for new partnerships in this field.</p><h4>What characteristics does METCO look for in its prospective partners?</h4><p>We look for individuals who can complement our ideas with their ideas, and we plug them together. We are in the stage of developing an application that should be very interesting, and we are collaborating with some US-based companies. This will hopefully be our contribution to innovation here.</p><h4>How have you advanced with your regional expansion?</h4><p>METCO operates in several countries in the region. Our headquarters are in Kuwait, and we have operations in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Sudan. We used to work in Nigeria and some other African countries, but those are on hold for the time being. We certainly hope to work in different areas, such as North Africa, but that decision will be made once political stability improves in those areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the overall concept behind Saveco when it was first established?</h4><p>Saveco is a destination store that is focused on an overall customer experience. We want customers to enjoy grocery shopping at Saveco. The ambiance is great and there are activities for every individual in the family. The average grocery shopping time in Kuwait is between 20-40 minutes, but in Saveco the average time a customer spends shopping is two to three hours. That is a huge jump in hours spent in the store and it is because of the different things we offer.</p><h4>Tracking the development of Saveco, what are two notable milestones for the company since your inception?</h4><p>The first milestone would be the opening itself. The bureaucracy involved with getting the electricity to our stores and obtaining our licenses took two years, and we had to pay our employees and rent on a monthly basis and incurred a huge loss. The second milestone would be acquiring the trust of suppliers.</p><h4>How would you describe your customers' shopping preferences?</h4><p>We have two different types of customers. Our regular customer base is 80% Kuwaiti and 20% mid- to high-earning expats. On Mondays and weekends we have promotions that cover the mid to low range and have a totally different customer base. Our customers usually prefer healthier products, lactose free, gluten free, and dairy free products. We offer the biggest variety of free-from items in Kuwait.</p><h4>What additional business lines are you looking to add?</h4><p>We are looking to package our own goods. Many of the products we receive are imports or local suppliers, but we want to be producing these items instead of purchasing them. We are also testing hydroponic, aeroponic, and aquaponic types of farming to use in our farms and provide the highest quality of fresh produce to our customers.</p><h4>How aggressive is your business model, and what challenges does this pose?</h4><p>When we first opened our second store, we thought it would be easy to control the same level of service and merchandising, but we found that it is not as easy as we thought. The quality for the first few months was totally different from our first store. Maintaining high standards is difficult. One of our main goals now is achieving ISO and HACCEP certifications. Combining both would be very difficult to achieve, but there are just a few things that we need to implement. These certifications are very specific, evaluating the nitty-gritty details including lights, shelving, and our storage organization. It would have been easier to implement these standards in the beginning because now we have to change procedures and retrain employees. We built an actual classroom in the store just for our employees to be educated in ISO certification, HACCEP, and customer service.</p><h4>What markets are you looking to target when it comes to international expansion?</h4><p>Initially the GCC: Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and then Saudi Arabia. To enter the Saudi market, we need to have huge purchasing power. Some of the big players over there have 50 stores or more, and we would not able to compete with that just yet. We would need to open in other locations first in Qatar, UAE, and other regions before we would be able to open in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are some of the peculiarities of the Kuwaiti retail market?</h4><p>It is very different from the Gulf. Kuwait seeks to be the next food hub and no other location in the Gulf has comparable restaurant concepts to Kuwait. Most of the concepts in Dubai are franchises, but in Kuwait they are Kuwaiti concepts by Kuwaiti chefs. In addition, our purchasing power per capita is much higher than many other countries. Many things in Kuwait sell because of the trending effect. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[love-freight-relationship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends have you noticed in the regional market in recent years?</h4><p>With our primary focus on the GCC countries, we are active in warehousing, freight forwarding, project cargo, stevedoring, and imports, and some services to the UN and the US government. Something important we have seen as a result of the decrease of the oil price is privatization of activities that have been within the public domain. This is similar to 1997, when the oil price was low as well and privatization started. Back then, we were part of a privatization project, a BOT in Jeddah, in a container terminal that has proven successful. In the current era, Saudi is also taking the lead in this privatization process. It has a clear vision of what it wants to do, and in Kuwait we are still developing this vision. In some aspects we are better off, but we seem to be unable to decide what direction to go. The Kuwait Port Authority, for example, should decide whether it wants to privatize or take the operations. Most logistics companies would agree with this, and the closure of the free trade zone is another counterproductive action. Without a clear vision, it will be hard for Kuwait to regain its position as a major trading hub in this region. We need flourishing and successful port operations to facilitate trade. There are talks about privatization but so far we have not seen real action. Other countries are progressing; Dubai is the most prominent, and Saudi and Oman are following suit.</p><h4>How has the nature of your shipped goods changed over time, and what industries do you primarily serve?</h4><p>In recent years, the government has stepped up with infrastructure projects, as well as large-scale development projects within KOC and KNPC. We are logistics partners for these, and furthermore we anticipate other project cargo activities to increase. For example, we are subcontractors to Petrofac, which was recently awarded a large contract. On the consumer side, the food market, for example, has changed little and we are the transporter for many of the industry players here.</p><h4>What are your expectations and recommendations for the development of physical infrastructure in Kuwait?</h4><p>Boubyan is a project that is now developing, although the government has not announced its vision yet. There is a law for the island, and there is going to be a permanent board for this operation. If we were going to advise the government it would be for it to be privatized, we have capable companies in Kuwait and in other regions in the world that can operate this port, either as a single operator or with multiple operators. If the objective is to serve Iraq, there is a competing port in Al Faw, which could also be privatized. Kuwait has three commercial ports; Doha, Shuwaikh, and Shuaiba, and they have enough capacity to service base needs from an equipment capacity perspective. They do require some upgrades, but essentially they are serving Kuwait's needs. If the vision is to develop Kuwait as a hub, then we have to think about the combination of these four ports. The small port of Doha is for containers, the port of Shuwaikh is for the general cargo, and Shuaiba primarily for petrochemicals and containers. Boubyan should be included within this synergy.</p><h4>Who should step up here to force a breakthrough in the port situation?</h4><p>It has to come from the top in the government. Initially KPA was run as a government operation and it was losing money until 1995; that is when it decided to privatize. Only a portion of the operation, the stevedoring, was privatized, and this turned KPA into a profitable institution. There were three operators in Shuwaikh port and three operators in Shuaiba port and there was competition on multiple levels. There was a competitive environment among the two ports, and consumers were benefiting because they could put different operators against each other; the government was also benefiting because the KPA was profitable. Now with this entire new terminal the KPA is introducing, it is unclear which direction Kuwait is going. We have given clear advice to the government that what is happening in KPA today is undermining everything the government is trying to do. It scares investors and cargo shippers and does not seem to serve anyone. The market wants clarity on whether further privatization is on the agenda. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your philosophy on real estate, as well as on architecture and design, contributed to the growth of ALARGAN?</h4><p>It is very basic; we are in the business of adding value. We are not a primary industry; real estate is a secondary industry. Accordingly, when we go and develop or build, we have to build to the specifications of the end user. We focus on the largest segment in society: the middle class. When we go to a new territory, in that territory we make sure we understand quite well what would raise the bar. Right now we are entering Morocco, and we found that there are certain things that are not being served for the middle class. We go the extra mile to provide them with that service. As far as style goes, once something we have built is occupied it is not only a box to come and work in, but a place the client can be comfortable in. We provide our customers with that feeling and basic amenities, whether it has to do with proper parking, services like a gym, an auditorium, or a place to eat. That is why we hope to couple retail with residential with design spaces so that they can be accessed without a car, and in the future we will create entire communities that are developed with that ethos in mind. These are services that complete the basic amenities that our clients are looking for. That is what we do.</p><h4>Initially your focus was on building middle-income housing, but you have other projects. Where are you looking now and how are you driving growth at ALARGAN?</h4><p>We announced our 2020 strategy last year. By the year 2020, we will make sure that we secure a 40% return on our capital with 20% every year, so it is 40/20 at 2020. This has brought in another parallel to our focus where we have to produce income-generating properties for which insurance and cash flow is steady and will offset the locality of developments. We are doing a project in Salmiya that has to do with retail; we have another one coming up in Sabah Al Salem, which is mostly a social club, with services, education, and health facilities all together for middle-income families. The health side will be something of a subsidiary of ours. It is focused on something that is really missing in the market from the private sector side: physiotherapy treatment. That has not been up to par with countries around us in the region, and though the demand in the market is there, the supply is really lacking, and that is something we will hopefully have running by 2017. All of these things are happening in order to meet that target of reaching the 40% return on capital by 2020.</p><h4>Oman and Saudi Arabia are major markets for ALARGAN. What are your immediate plans in those areas today?</h4><p>We do not plan from here; each country has its own decision-making policies and its own board. However, in terms of markets, Saudi Arabia is going to be running a very tough market very soon and is already in it now because of oil prices. It is good that change is happening; prices have been soaring at least 10-15% per year and are inflated. The way the legislation is being implemented now will eventually trickle it down and that is healthy for everyone. Taxation is an issue, and everybody is talking about it; we will see how people adapt to it. This is something we are already seeing in Saudi Arabia and in Oman also; the economy is slowing down dramatically. There is a lot of desire in the public sector to pass on infrastructure costs to the private sector.</p><h4>Real estate prices have fallen in Kuwait recently. What effect will this have on ALARGAN?</h4><p>It will affect us in a good way. It is always good to have a correction. We will also see a drop in retail prices, which is something we already forecasted in our studies about three or four years ago. Our studies are always built on smaller numbers than now. It is going to be much healthier to have this drop now and to make a correction and move in a steady way, which will allow businesses to be able to function in a more healthy way than these inflated prices that we are seeing today. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision future housing developments in the country and could you tell us more about current projects?</h4><p>In the short term, PAHW has set an ambitious target of allocating 60,000 units over a five-year period, from 2015-2020, as per the second development plan. Furthermore, PAHW has succeeded in maintaining close coordination with other government entities to implement the government program and its ongoing strategic plan. In doing so, PAHW has exceeded previous targets and managed to distribute 45,746 units during the period from 2014 until 2016, compared to 96,938 units for the period from 1956 until 2013, representing 46% of the units of the past 58 years in just three years. In the long term, since PAHW is fully convinced that continuing the current approach in the provision of residential care is too expensive and unsustainable and will not solve the housing challenge and we will instead concentrate our efforts on the development of a sustainability strategy. For this, we work with the Kuwait Credit Bank (KCB) and other relevant parties. This requires a fundamental shift in the philosophy of providing residential care from securing the housing units through PAHW to the activation of public-private partnerships and developing sustainable communities with a social environment that complies with best industry standards. The practical application of this vision would result in the creation of investment opportunities, lift the burden from the state budget, and set the plan for long-term financial sustainability by converting non-residential lands into income-producing assets to transform to a self-financing entity.</p><h4>How would you describe Kuwait's progress in achieving its 2020 objectives, and what is the role of the Ministry of Housing affairs here?</h4><p>In 2015, PAHW signed a program strategic consulting (PSC) agreement to provide technical and strategic support for the former housing programs and manage PAHW's megaprojects. These projects include the new Cities of Al-Khairan with 35,000 housing units, South Saad Al-Abdullah with 25,000 units, and North Al-Mutlaa with 52,000 units, amongst others. These will be executed by creating urban communities according to best international standards and funded by public-private partnerships. Through these partnerships, we strive for an efficient utilization of resources and alleviation of the burden of financing projects away from the state and to leverage the expertise of the private sectors and transfer the skills, knowledge, and abilities from the private sector to the public sector. In addition, we seek to adopt a smart cities agenda where we also aim to rationalize energy usage. We are investing in attracting highly skilled calibers for all level of positions to enhance the efficiency and the delivery of these projects.</p><h4>How do you envision more private-sector involvement in the construction and housing sector?</h4><p>To drive private-sector participation in the development of housing projects, we plan to adopt a PPP framework that relies on an existing legislative setup, adoption of best practices in PPP project structuring, as well as close interaction with the private sector throughout development and tendering life cycle. The new legal setup provides the necessary tools for attracting investors and lenders such as allowing for foreign ownership of project companies, providing lenders security over the project contracts, and dictating a clear and transparent procurement process. Applied in several ongoing PPP procurements in Kuwait, PAHW does not envisage any major challenges in implementing the PPP law for its real estate and housing projects. In terms of PPP project structuring, PAHW will adopt the appropriate risk allocation between the public and private sector, which aims to allocate the risks to the party best able to manage them. Finally, PAHW is engaging the private sector throughout the development and procurement of PPP projects, and will be organizing roadshows for prospective bidders to outline up-and-coming opportunities and how these will be tendered. Since May 2016, PAHW has the authority to tender PPPs without involving the Kuwait Authority for Partnerships Projects (KAPP) and we will be fully responsible for the tender process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What are the next steps?</h4><p>We have a total of four projects for Az-Zour North and delivered the first one at the end of 2016. Phase II will be identical to Phase I and will deliver 1,500MW and 107 million imperial gallons of water per day. We will sign the contract with the chosen developers soon, and after that it will take around 18 months to complete the project. Phase III will be 1,000MW, without water, and Phase IV is 800MW. Another project is starting in Al-Hirahn, which is not far from Az-Zour North but on a different site. Al-Hirahn will be developed in three phases; a phase with 1,500MW and a capacity of 125 million imperial gallons of water; Phase II is 1,800MW; and we are currently designing Phase III. Looking at the history of our capacity development within MEW, these developments fit in a trend. Over the past 10 years, we have added more than 30% capacity, both for water and electricity. When Az-Zour North 1 became operational, with 1,500MW, we added 10% of our total power generation to our national capacity. The 107 million imperial gallons of water reflect around 20% of our total capacity.</p><h4>The Az-Zour North projects were the first to be executed in a public-private partnership (PPP) model. Does the involvement of the private sector here represent more opportunities for the private sector to assist Kuwait in meeting its future energy needs?</h4><p>In 2013 we started the first project with the private sector, which we evaluate as successful. The contractors delivered the project even earlier than the contractual deeds, which is a good sign that we can rely on the private sector. Having private-sector involvement makes the development process smoother, and we were able to do it a lower cost. We are streamlining our tendering processes now so we can rely more on the private sector for our future projects. </p><h4>This year, the first meeting of the Tariff Committee took place, mandated to implement new tariffs for the use of water and electricity. What is your forecast of the price regimes Kuwait will be seeing in the years to come?</h4><p>We cannot deliver figures because parliament recently issued a new law. After 50 years of having the same price regimes, almost free, we need to adjust to a new reality. According to the new law, the tariff will be changed except for residential houses, so it will be applicable for commercial, industrial, and other sectors. Altogether, we anticipate growth of our industries and our population, but the major increase in demand will come from the growing residential areas. We are now implementing smart meters in residential areas, and in the future we hope to upgrade our grid to also utilize innovative tracking technology.</p><h4>How are you moving forward on your agenda to include renewables in Kuwait's energy mix?</h4><p>We have committed ourselves to 15% renewables in total generation by 2030. There are small projects that have already been delivered; the big one is Shagaya, which is controlled by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR). Recently, we celebrated by creating 20MW: 10MW from wind turbines and 10MW from solar panels, which is already on the grid. We are also waiting for another 50MW from the Clean Fuels Project (CFP), which will come in 2018. Other than that, we have more than 100 projects running, including housing projects where solar PVs are installed on more than 1,500 rooftops. Furthermore, we work to design a greenhouse with the possibility of using its entire roof for solar PVs. By using these rooftops and adopting additional sustainability measures, we can reduce residential energy requirements by 20-30%, and we are modeling a prototype of this project with the public authority of housing. Solar PVs can be installed anywhere, and we have them on our own ministry as well as our neighboring Ministry of Public Works, delivering 500KW and 1,000KW, respectively. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the Ministry of Public Works' operational strategy for 2017?</h4><p>We have more than 30 projects in the design stage and almost the same figure in the construction stage. In healthcare, we have almost four hospitals commissioned, such as Sheikh Jaber Hospital, a maternity hospital, a children's hospital, and the Police Hospital. In addition, we have a correctional hospital for the Ministry of the Interior. In the education sector, we have three large buildings for special needs care in Jahra, Hawalli, and Egaila. In the music and theater sector, we have a music and theater college. We have many projects for the Justice Ministry and around 11 projects for the Ministry of the Interior on different scales. Our budget is almost more than KWD1 billion, excluding terminal two of Kuwait Airport. That is currently the biggest project we have. It is in the construction phase and the figure is almost KWD1.4 billion.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the capabilities of Kuwaiti companies with these projects?</h4><p>The capabilities of local companies are limited and once they reach these limits, we have international contractors to fulfill and cover the projects. We have megaprojects worth KWD300-400 million as well as KWD1.4 billion, which local companies are not capable of doing. If we were to add the technology that other countries are using, then we would be able to cover these projects. The oil price has almost a negligible impact on our operations, which shows the excellent policy of the government. We are stable and have enough funds to start and complete our projects.</p><h4>What are the main features of the healthcare projects?</h4><p>Sheik Jaber Hospital is almost done. The contractor handed it over to us, after which we will deliver it to the Ministry of Health. Last year, we handed over the dental clinic and nursing accommodation. Now we will hand over the entire project to the Ministry of Health and it will do its part to bring in the health equipment and medical instruments so that it will be ready to operate and receive patients. The facility has 1,200 beds and is capable of handling 600,000 people. It is the biggest hospital in the Middle East and the sixth-largest in the world. The budget was more than KWD300 million. There are 36 surgery rooms, eight MRI rooms, seven X-rays for dental, and four rooms for cardiology. It has three helipads on the roof, more than eight floors, plus five floors for services, and a three-level basement garage that can accomodate 5,000 cars. We also have a children's hospital in the design development stage. For the maternity project, we have signed a contract and will commence on the project soon. It is a design-and-build contract with an Italian company. The hospital for the police is in the bidding stage and will have more than 16 floors.</p><h4>What role do international companies play in the realization of these projects?</h4><p>The biggest role is to come and start construction. We have international consultants doing the design and sharing with local consultants. The need for labor, equipment, and tools can only be understood when they enter the Kuwaiti market. Now with the new law, they can enter the Kuwaiti market directly without a joint venture.</p><h4>Could you give us an overview of the other projects that are in the works?</h4><p>Other projects that are currently under construction being expanded include the court complex in Hawalli, the National Assembly building, a labor complex, and an expertise building as well. Courts and judges need an expert department to help them so we are building a huge building for them. We are constructing medical specialist buildings and the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, Awqaf, and Islamic Affairs, as well as numerous neighborhood centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Q8 is the marketing and dispensing outlet for 30% of total production. What responsibilities does that bring to Q8 for the wider KPC group?</h4><p>KPI is the international downstream arm of KPC, and we operate outside Kuwait in the refining and marketing business. Europe has been our key market, and it is our plan to strengthen our position there by improving the efficiency of our operations and increase our presence in Asia. We all know that demand for oil products and energy is moving east. We sold our refinery in the Netherlands, but maintain our JV refinery in Italy and are growing our retail business in Northwest Europe. Our 2015-2016 growth in Europe was 15%, which is a very high percentage if we consider the declining demand in Europe. In 2015, European demand for petroleum products declined 11%, and 16% in 2016. Yet we have been able to increase our market share because we concentrate mainly on countries where we operate: Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. In these countries, we are also enhancing our international tools and service to meet the fueling needs of international road transport companies. Today, International Diesel Service (IDS) is one of Europe's leading fuel card companies with a network of about 537 automated service stations in 23 countries across Europe. The IDS card provides outstanding control and security. An online authorization system gives protection against fraud and card use can be restricted to selected sites, countries or fuel purchase limits, putting our customers in control. We also completed our acquisition process of all Shell stations in Italy in 2016, which was started in 2015 for four product storage locations and about 830 stations, most in northern Italy. With this acquisition we became the second-largest player in Italy after state-owned Eni. In Asia, we are progressing well with the construction of a USD9 billion complex, integrated refinery, and petrochemicals grassroots project (Nghi Son Refinery &amp; Petrochemicals, NSRP) in Vietnam. We are nearing the completion of the EPC contract, and we are expanding in other regions of Asia so we can achieve KPC's objective of reaching an international refining capacity of 800,000 barrels per day.</p><h4>Kuwait is all set to be the region's next downstream hub with almost USD30 billion worth of megaprojects. What are your thoughts on these developments, and how do you position Q8 within this trend?</h4><p>The refining industry has changed; simple small refineries can no longer compete with the large-scale petrochemical complexes. We have seen a slowdown in downstream investment, just as upstream investment has been reduced. Oil prices are low and the refining margin is not healthy enough to support any investment in downstream activities. Building a new refinery has become very expensive because you need to build a big, integrated, very complex refinery with petrochemicals production capabilities and expensive units to crack fuel oil. With these requirements it will cost no less than USD7-9 billion per project. However, in Kuwait and other GCC countries, we are proceeding with these projects because the oil business is cyclical. After three to five years in a downward cycle, there will be no projects around while demand has grown. We will face that period with very good projects on hand. The demand will catch up, especially in the Middle East and Asia.</p><h4>Q8 is known for its emphasis on R&amp;D with, among other locations, a major technology center in Rotterdam. What describes your latest research agenda?</h4><p>Research is a very important part of our business, and that is why, when we sold the refinery in Rotterdam, we kept the research center. Our center, Q8Research, is essential because it secures product development, product specification, and quality control, especially in the fields of lubricants, jet fuel, and transportation fuel. Q8Research also specializes in developing customized formulations for high-performance applications for lubricating oils. Our latest agenda is how to enhance Q8Research's training and development capabilities to other oil industry professionals from Kuwait and globally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In September, PAI announced its plans to boost Kuwait's industrial output by 12% in the coming years. As the sector currently contributes around 9-10% to national GDP, how do you envision growing this stake and what are the strategies and the specific sectors?</h4><p>Our real national GDP is 4%, and when we add the oil sector it can reach 9%, which should not be added because it is not the sector we want to see growth from. The growth the country is looking for should come from the industry sector. We aim to achieve 12% growth through our strategic plan and policies by targeting specific sectors, such as petrochemicals, food, renewable energy, and fourth-generation manufacturing, such as 3D printing and robots, as well as by planning industries and creating industrial cities in order to give us a clearer picture of what we own.</p><h4>How can Kuwait use its vast resources to drive surrounding industries?</h4><p>We should look to our industrial economic entities, for example EQ8, which is a good example of downstream production. Because of the importance of the raw materials we have in Kuwait, namely oil, we can make the industrial sector more sustainable. To this end, we have certain criteria for the sector, namely adding value to the sector, investing capital, front and back integration, important replacement, national employment, and competitiveness. With these focuses, we hope to diversify domestic industry and attract capital.</p><h4>What sectors are attractive to foreign investors, and what synergies do you strive for between multinationals industrial players, national giants, and SMEs?</h4><p>The Kuwait Direct Investment Promotional authority (KDIPA) has the responsibility of attracting foreign companies to establish factories in Kuwait, and through bilateral cooperation we inform major global industries how to be successful in the country. We are mainly targeting unique manufactures in the region, including high-tech and worldwide names. We plan to create industrial organization plans that specify zoning for foreign industries, among other preparations. In addition, we are trying to learn the language of a new economy and understand the trends in the industrial sector around the world through cooperation with countries that have been successful regionally, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and globally, such as China.</p><h4>How do you envision the New Kuwait initiative governing policy at your organization?</h4><p>Human capital is the main element to make the initiative a success. We need to create a new initiative that manages the outputs of the education sector and classifies them in different field. For example, high school students can be trained to do skills relevant for work in factories, like what is being done with STRATA in Abu Dhabi. At the same time, we plan to cooperate with the Ministry of Education to select the 100 best students to receive special training in global factories for the purpose of teaching administration in the industrial sectors and developing a kind of trade protectionism.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>I believe we have the ambition and an adequate infrastructure to rebuild our industrial sector. We want the sector to be a success story, one of competitiveness and one that involves the entire country. Industry should be a legitimate alternative to oil and one that secures the economy for the future, adds value, and provides opportunity. We hope to create a clear ecosystem that will support the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were recently appointed the new General Manager of KAPP. How would you describe your operational strategy for 2017?</h4><p>KAPP plays a major role in allowing the private sector's participation in the Kuwaiti economy. The government has, in fact, initiated the PPP program to promote and establish collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure well-developed projects for Kuwaiti citizens with effective services. It is our priority to warrant and assure all projects are operating as planned according to the PPP Law 116/2014 and its executive regulations, while KAPP receives competitive bids for its current projects that are pivotal to the country's infrastructure. For example, while some projects such as the Kuwait National Rail Road Project or South Al-Jahra Labor City are in the pre-tender phase, others such as the Az-Zour North Power Generation, the Water Desalination Project Phase II, the Umm Al Hayman Wastewater Project, and the Municipal Solid Waste Project are currently under tender. However, we are obliged to thoroughly evaluate all proposed bids, as we are at a significant phase where we have to be aware of the significance of the projects and their importance to the economy. On the other hand, we work hard to ensure that KAPP projects are advancing as planned as well as deliver top-quality infrastructure services through these partnership projects.</p><h4>The KAPP recently received proposals from a number of companies looking to become involved in Phase II of the Az-Zour North power generation and water desalination project. Who are the primary investors behind these infrastructural megaprojects and what projects will the KAPP particularly be focusing on in 2016?</h4><p>KAPP has recently announced that it received the bids for Az-Zour North IWPP Phase II. It is recognized through regional and global developers' interest, interactions, and visits with vast experience and a successful project portfolio. In addition to developers, global financial institutions and credit export agencies are the key players behind the project. It is also well noted that there is increasing interest from local financial institutions and equity holders to take part in it as well. However, KAPP is working on already established projects that are well underway. No specific project is to be referred to as all current tendered projects are of priority. We strive to ensure that all projects proceed according to the planned timeline. However, the concept of PPPs is relatively new. It is a challenge to introduce PPP laws to Kuwait's business culture and guide it to adapt and adjust. KAPP's Az-Zour Phase I project is proof of the huge success of PPPs and its benefit to the economy. We have to raise awareness of such projects and their requirements, as institutions need time to adapt and deal with this new culture successfully. Moreover, there are numerous governmental entities that KAPP cooperates with. The Department of Legal Advice and Legislation has especially been fully supportive by ensuring steady legal compliance of projects with the current local regulations of the State of Kuwait. KAPP always takes the initiative to cooperate with and have great ties with related institutions.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>KAPP looks forward to ensuring that all tendered projects are proceeding according to plan. Law No. 116 of 2014 has established our authority, and we work hard to ensure the timely implementation of projects that are of significance to Kuwait's infrastructural development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[concrete-ideas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you strive for synergies within the diversified portfolio of ACICO?</h4><p>As COO for the industrial division I was more operational, more into factories, sales, and meeting customers' demands. In my current position, the nature of my work has changed entirely and I focus on managing five COOs for the different divisions we have, and monitoring the numbers, the growth, their budgets, and ensuring harmony. As our operations span from manufacturing, construction, infrastructure development, and hospitality to logistics, it is a challenge to align all corporate cultures and to strive for synergies. One of the major processes that I currently lead is to reinforce HR, to make it a strategic partner and to eliminate the cultural gaps in our organization. We jointly engage on strategy brainstorm sessions to work on our long-term objectives and the execution plan for those. ACICO started as an autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) manufacturer with just one plant in Kuwait, so our DNA is in the industrial sector. All other divisions still learn from our expertise and experience here, and the concept of AAC is a key driver of our groups' performance. After this factory, we moved into building materials, cement, ready mixes, interlock, and precast concretes, which are all used in our other divisions. So the AAC technology is one that we take pride in, having been the pioneers in it in our region. But we did not stop there as we supplemented this advanced technology with additional building-material products and services, from design to finishing, to come up with what we refer to now as ACICO System—an integrated building solution rather than separate products and services. The ACICO System is the child of the synergies we achieved throughout our various sectors. In non-materialistic terms, the management and operational practices of the industrial division are exemplary for the other segments of our business. We have translated this know-how into manufacturing, real estate development, our contracting business, and the hotel industry. It was my father's vision to never shy away from opportunities and to hire experts to bring in knowledge and learn in the process.</p><h4>How do you envision further expansion of the group in the region?</h4><p>In any new market we penetrate, we ensure we are fully integrated in that market, and then we look for other markets. Our key driver here is the integration of our existing offerings as sometimes we find it necessary to be in one market or another, so we are able to cater to an existing demand for what we offer. Now we are doing well in the region, and although the demand is high, there is also a lot of competition. In Kuwait, the government subsidizes electricity and land, which gives us a great competitive advantage to be manufacturing from here. We are grateful for the government here, and if we need more land we stand strong as we have a strong track record of exporting to neighboring countries. ACICO has businesses throughout the region but our best profits are made in Kuwait. We are even relocating our best operational managers to come back here and further develop our business. Kuwait is our primary focus for now, and especially with the upcoming public projects. Although large-scale projects are not our specialization, we acquired a pre-cast concrete factory two years ago to deliver larger structured items. It is not our mission to be a major contractor as that market segment is already quite saturated and we would rather focus on delivering on our expertise without getting distracted. At a later stage, we could be looking into these mixed-development projects and eventually we will be able to compete because we produce concrete and ready-mix, so our whole solution is competitive. In summary, when we experience success in one area, we do not feel content and sit back—any new success drives us to attain more success and reach for even higher limits; hence, I often remind our staff that the sky is the limit when it comes to creativity and innovation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[highest-priorities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KGOC is responsible for the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ), where you operate, amongst other fields, the Al-Khafji JV with Saudi Aramco. What are your growth plans and the collaboration here?</h4><p>The Khafji field was a concession that was given to the government of Japan, and when that concession expired, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signed a joint operations agreement, with the contract representatives from KGOC and the Aramco Gulf Oil Company sharing the resources. The resources are vast, and production can be significant but the seizure of operations, by a joint governmental decision, has put extraction on hold for now. The Al-Khafji Joint Operations entity is still active, and currently working to keep all the facilities up to the HSE standards and ready to resume as the safety of our staff and the environment are our highest priorities. The decision to restart will come from the ultimate owners, which are the two governments. Everything underground is 50-50 and above ground also the agreement says 50-50 in terms of numbers of persons, 50% from Kuwait and 50% from Saudi Arabia. There is a rotation mechanism within the joint operations, and the development plan is build under the guidance of both companies, also under a 50-50 agreement.</p><h4>With privatization on the agenda for some of KPC's subsidiaries, what are best practices from the private-public sharing model?</h4><p>The private presence comes in the form of Saudi Arabian Chevron (SAC), which is not on our side. The Kuwaiti assets are not privatized, and our joint venture partner to us is one entity, representing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are encouraging private participation in the areas of oil field services, development of technology and engineering construction, so that the desired skills and capabilities are available in the local market.</p><h4>What is your vision for Kuwait being the region's next downstream hub, what does this mean for KGOC, and what synergies do you strive for within KPC?</h4><p>What is happening on the downstream side and in the petrochemicals industry is excellent, both for the industry and for the country. The fourth refinery is a strategic decision by the government and will spur diversification. Our crude oil products from both onshore extraction in Wafra and the offshore in Khafji go directly to the KPC network of refineries and exports. Part of our production is gas, although not in large quantities, and this goes directly into the KPC's gas network, which primarily fuels production and petrochemical industries.</p><h4>Are you looking into new innovations to extract heavy oil in more efficient ways?</h4><p>KGOC has a history in terms of heavy oil extraction, as we have a lot of reserves, and both our JV partner and we are keen on developing these resources. We have started some pilot projects in terms of steam injection and steam recycling, but this was put on hold once activities were frozen. Once we restart, we are more than ready to increase our production capacity, to diversify our product specifications, and to generate a learning curve for our staff on heavy oil development. We have already been passing this technology to our sister company KOC. It is looking into offshore lately, and we have expertise there as well. All companies eventually serve the KPC group and follow a joint strategy, which makes it easy to find synergies.</p><h4>How could industry demands be better aligned with graduate employability?</h4><p>The petroleum sector has demanded that many times, and we do believe that our education strategy could be improved to serve the industry better. Many ministers of education have strived for this, but it takes time to change direction. There has been a shift in recent times, and the sector itself has been supportive too. We have good talent development programs for our employees. As our operations were frozen for two years, we have used the time to build HR capacity, but talent development is much faster when there is actual drilling going on. In the current context, the most important thing is to bring our staff, both in the joint operations and the head office, to the highest standards, in terms of technical development, HSE, business processes, and general guidance for best practices. We want to bring them all to the level where the language spoken by everybody here is on par with when they meet with Chevron or Aramco. So we are not sitting idle; we are investing in people. It is a major investment for us and we will not be hesitant to spend resources to develop the people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Spreading The Risk]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[spreading-the-risk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is driving your geographic advancement throughout MENA, Central and Eastern Europe, and Asia Pacific?</h4><p>Reinsurance, by nature, is more diversified than any other financial industry, which is why it is important to spread the risks. The portfolio of Kuwait Re is currently split between 27% in MENA, 24% in Asia, and around 49% Europe and rest of the world. We have an office in Malaysia, which leads the Islamic financial sector, and we are planning to open an office in Africa in the near future. For the MENA region, we have the competitive advantage of locality, and because we are close to our clients here, knowing the market well means we can provide flexible rates. However, the reinsurance market is open and competitive, because direct insurance operators can seek assistance from any international reinsurance company.</p><h4>The global takaful market is estimated at USD20 billion and expected to reach as high as USD34 billion by 2019. Are you looking to expand in the re-takaful segment?</h4><p>We do it from Kuwait, but the center of our re-takaful operations is in Malaysia. The takaful market is growing, and as a consequence, there is growing demand for re-takaful. Nevertheless, it is by no means as large as the traditional reinsurance sector. The capacity is limited in that sector, and we are capitalizing on any opportunities that arise.</p><h4>Does the insurance market of Kuwait require a regulator?</h4><p>Kuwait lacks a regulatory framework for the insurance industry, while other GCC countries have taken advanced steps in this direction. Similar to the banking sector, also in the insurance industry, the assets of clients should be safeguarded. Unfortunately, this has been overlooked by the government, and the last regulation was passed in 1961. As a result, the market is self-regulated; companies regulate themselves in terms of conditions and price. With regulation comes healthy competition, so I welcome that. The Ministry of Commerce officially functions as the regulator. The industry has advanced in the past five decades, and insurance is now a protection for properties, other assets, trades, and businesses. There is no proper checking of the solvency and capital adequacy of insurance companies in Kuwait, whereas, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Bahrain, and to a certain good level Qatar now have a highly regulated insurance industry. In the reinsurance sector, they encourage the retention of premiums inside the country, which we do not have in Kuwait. Any international contractor can come here and bring in a reinsurance company and all the money goes out of the country. We, as a local company, ensure that the money stays in Kuwait. We do not have to invent new regulations; we can use the example from other CGG countries, which have similar economic models, and adapt the regulations to fit the specific needs of Kuwait. In countries that implemented regulations, in Saudi Arabia in Dubai, insurance companies' profits have increased substantially, solvency ratios have been improved, jobs have been created, and assets of clients are more well safeguarded. These companies are in a better position to grow internationally and become a new driver of the economy</p><h4>What are your expectations for the insurance and reinsurance market?</h4><p>Oil prices have been putting pressure on economic growth in GCC countries and there is an excess of capital that is pouring into the industry to find better investment returns. This decreases the prices of insurance services and ultimately leads to lower margins on the operating side. Consequently, the insurance industry has to look for different and better opportunities. Companies have to be creative and keep their eyes open for any emerging opportunity. We envision being a leading reinsurance provider in the GCC, and we have the ambition to capitalize on emerging opportunities elsewhere, for example in Africa and Asia. We continue focusing on our core business: facultative and traditional proportional and non-proportional treaties for direct insurance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-records]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements and developments at KOC since your appointment as CEO in January 2016?</h4><p>The company performed well in 2016. We reached a record production of 3,078 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD) and gas production of about 1,900 million standard cubic feet of gas (MMSCFD). In addition, several projects, which are critical to delivering KOC's strategic production capacity target of 3,650MBOPD by 2020, have progressed well. These projects include four production units—three of them for Jurassic oil production and one for heavy oil production, which together will deliver around 135MBOPD, three gathering centers in North Kuwait with total capacity of 300MBOPD, and a major heavy oil production facility to produce 60MBOPD. In August 2016, KOC reduced the gas-flaring rate of its operations to a record 0.8% of its produced gas, thereby maximizing the revenue from gas production and improving the quality of the environment. Also on the environmental front, last April we inaugurated the Ahmadi Oasis, a new addition to the several oases KOC has constructed in its operation areas to restore and improve the environment. In response to HH the Amir Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah's direction to develop alternative energy sources, we have established our first solar power plant in West Kuwait to cover some of the power requirements in the operations and oil production fields.</p><h4>The KOC's mandate primarily encompasses the exploration, drilling, and production of oil and gas in Kuwait. What are the major projects that your company is currently involved in?</h4><p>Several major projects are ongoing toward realizing our strategic goals in all the fields. In the exploration field, KOC currently handles five projects, which are in the execution stage, with an approximate cost of KWD259.8 million. These are the 2D/3D seismic surveys in Kuwait Bay, North Kuwait, and Southeast Kuwait and two other projects related to 3D seismic surveys for Boubyan Island and West Kuwait. When it comes to drilling, KOC handles around 100 drilling projects with different drilling types, including the construction of flowlines and artificial lift, with an approximate cost of KWD5.5 billion. Work on an effluent water treatment and injection plant and a new booster station in West Kuwait are also in progress.</p><h4>What is your strategy for future innovation within KOC?</h4><p>Our strategy outlines an ambitious growth agenda with technology as a critical enabler. Considering the challenges that we face in Kuwait, we look at several key technologies with high potential for our operations. We are considering the options of using nano-chemicals for enhanced oil recovery, which could lead to increased production with a limited amount of material. The options to use nano-materials for corrosion control and drilling fluids are also being explored. Water conformance technologies that enable the potential use of smart fluids to prevent or reduce water production from our reservoirs are also being looked into. The use of non-thermal processes for heavy oil productions, new effective inhibitors to prevent asphalting, and also a new class of superior chemicals as surfactants are also being explored.</p><h4>With global volatility in the oil price in recent years, what do you consider to be the main challenges in attaining KPC's volume objective of 4 million barrels of oil per day (MMBOPD) in 2020?</h4><p>KPC has set a challenging strategic direction for Kuwait's domestic upstream, which is a production capacity of 4MMBOPD by 2020, of which KOC's share is 3.65MMBOPD. To achieve this target, KOC has been implementing a comprehensive roadmap, where we outline how to overcome the challenges ahead. First, we will master secondary recovery techniques and conduct an aggressive exploration program to add additional new oil and gas production capacities. We will also enhance the current production capacity by applying production optimization techniques and by piloting and implementing newer technologies to meet our strategic target. In addition to the sub-surface optimization initiatives, we are conducting several de-bottlenecking projects in several production facilities to increase its crude handling capacities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Implementing Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[implementing-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What defines the strategy you intend to bring to the ministries?</h4><p>Certainly, I envision bringing my private-sector experience in, and the priority for me now is governance. In the oil sector, I feel confident, as there has been strong leadership in our industries. Over the past 35 years the oil sector has developed to an acceptable level of governance, performance, achievements, and leadership, so I intend to emulate this success into the electricity and water industry. Prior to my arrival, there was already a law to be presented to the parliament to establish the Electricity and Water Corporation as a vehicle to commercialize the power operations that are currently under the ministry. These activities should be under a commercialized entity rather than a public service. This process of implementation should take around two to three years, and we will leverage on the GCC's experience in incorporating these activities.</p><h4>An important step in this direction is the new power plant, Al-Zour North, which was constructed in a public-private partnership (PPP) model. Does the involvement of the private sector in this project represent more opportunities for the private sector to assist Kuwait in meeting its future energy needs?</h4><p>Part of the Kuwaiti vision for the future is to encourage the private sector to become the primary creator of jobs, and we need this social security for our people. By having an active and engaged public sector, we can absorb the excess manpower that the government has, which is hindering us from achieving the best services for the people. Creating more jobs in the private sector and encouraging people to work in this sector will ultimately build a more sustainable society for future generations. Our first and foremost priority for these PPP projects is to create social security. Secondly, we will be enhancing the diversification of income of our country and moving away from a near-total reliance on oil revenues. The private sector should be a larger contributor to our GDP. We have already pinpointed future projects, including the second, third, and fourth phases of the Al Zour project. The PPP model can be emulated in other governmental sectors like health and aviation. In the Ministry of Oil, however, we are bound by the constitution. We do not have any other privatization initiatives except for gas stations. We are taking another look at the program that has been established for the privatization of the petrol stations, and we have another model that we will be adopting in the future for the remaining petrol stations.</p><h4>What effects will the forthcoming implementation of new tariffs have on water and electricity? What price regimes may consumers and industries expect?</h4><p>Halfway through January, we had the first inaugural meeting of the Tariff Committee, after the parliament approved the law for increasing the tariff of electricity and water. The current tariffs do not even represent 1/20th of the actual cost of electricity and water. Our objective is not simply to increase our revenues, but rather to encourage people to conserve energy. Unless they have some sense of the reflection of their usage on their disposable income, there will be very limited motives to reduce consumption. A conventional light bulb in Kuwait costs 60 fulus, an LED or saving bulb around KWD1, which is around 20 times the price. A conventional light bulb uses seven times the amount of energy as a LED bulb, but there need to be incentives to purchase the latter to make it attractive. We want to increase awareness of conserving energy. The Tariff Committee consists of representatives from the Ministry of Electricity and Water, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Legal Bureau of Kuwait. We are combining all these entities because we want to have a balance between increasing income with the effect of the rise in the inflation and increasing the prices of goods in the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Diversifying the Portfolio]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[diversifying-the-portfolio]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What developments have characterized the last year for KAMCO?</h4><p>A key issue for KAMCO was to maintain operational growth and profitability in a difficult operating environment. It has been a tough year for us, but we are proud to have been able to grow our core activities and maintain our profitability during a tough time. Our asset management activities in terms of portfolios and funds are beating benchmarks and growing in size. Despite losses in the markets and falling values, we have been able to raise new money and expand our products regionally, which has added more diversification to our return portfolio. We have also been cautious on the equity markets and that has helped us weather the volatility. On the investment banking side, we have been quite successful in winning announced mandates, especially on the debt side, which has helped us position KAMCO among the top regional lead managers and book runners in GCC and MENA bonds.</p><h4>Do you see an increasing role in debt markets and issuances in Kuwait, and how do you see the spread in your advisory activities?</h4><p>When we look at debt markets, we see that financial institutions are looking at strengthening their capital base. Accordingly, our investment banking team continues to lead in this space on every transaction announced in Kuwait. The time comes with a wealth of expertise and track record, managing to successfully execute over 87 transactions since inception as of March 31, 2016, valued at over USD12.5 billion. We have been active and closed the first investment grade-rated Tier-2 private bond in the last quarter of 2015 for NBK and, during the first quarter of 2016, we acted as one of the joint lead managers (JLMs) for Burgan Bank's KWD100 million, subordinated Tier-2, Basel III compliant bonds. KAMCO was also one of the lead managers in Kuveyt Türk's Tier 2 capital-boosting sukuk worth USD350 million, and we were one of the few JLMs on it.</p><h4>How do you approach business around the region and how do you plan to diversify out of Kuwait?</h4><p>In the last decade, we were focused on Kuwait, and since the past post-financial crisis years we have extended our product line and services further within the region, investing more into regional areas, real estate, fixed income, and equities. In addition, we obtained our license to open and operate an office in the DIFC area in Dubai, UAE. We believe that the DIFC's solid growth and stable platform make it the ideal hub for KAMCO to access emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA). We are also looking at other areas in the region, currently focusing on the MENA region in particular. However, we will also venture into international markets and real estate, looking actively at real estate opportunities internationally. In addition to that, we are also about to launch an international sharia-compliant product.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>It will be a better year than 2016. We had a tough 2015 and a tougher 2016 than expected. Yet, we expect 2017 to be a better year as companies become more efficient and focused on their activities. As the oil sector stabilizes, investor sentiment is likely to bounce back. Moreover, when a country initiates privatization, it allows the private sector to have a larger role in performing business activities in a more efficient and modern way. Privatization in Kuwait will need to have a consensus in regulatory framework on the governmental side. Thus, the parliament and Kuwaiti government will have to build a consensus evolving the plan for privatization and set key objectives while creating a win-win situation for society and business in general. The gridlock between the government and parliament is being addressed successfully, allowing for more efficient privatizations moving forward. The entities to be privatized have to be properly regulated and organized under fair parameters to achieve a win-win situation for all, with companies achieving profits in the long run while improving efficiency and user satisfaction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Novomet is a global frontrunner in innovative solutions for making upstream activities more efficient. What are the latest technologies you are excited about?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Mick Stephen</strong> Novomet is primarily an electrical submersible pump manufacturer and service supplier. In these fields, we are very much a leader. We are expanding these technologies, and have a number of innovative solutions for enhanced oil recovery. Our CEO referred to our technology as a part of the smartphone revolution. A smartphone does not only make calls now, but does banking, interactions on social media, and orders food all in one package. That really is how Novomet has addressed its technological direction. We supply not just the pump for bringing oil to the surface, but have the advanced expertise to deploy it, save energy, and make the process more efficient. Kuwait is very power-limited, and although the country is investing in new power plants, anything that can save power in the industry is of great benefit. Our Permanent Magnet Motor (PMM) technology, together with pumps that are optimized to run at far higher rotational speeds, can reduce power consumption dramatically, up to 35%. That is a massive leap forward, and as of today Novomet is the world leader in PMM technology.</p><p><span></span><strong>Mikhail Peregudov </strong>Novomet is a relatively small company, which is our strength in the innovative process, as we can move quickly and have fewer levels in the approval procedure. We have a calculated risk appetite and have founders who want growth with their investment, which is visible in our technology strategy. That is why the company has matched throughout, and within five years we expanded our international business more than five times. Our first project was in South Sudan because it was harder for a foreign company without a strong international reputation to enter developed markets. Later we moved into Romania, Colombia, and now into 10 other countries. Novomet spends a large percentage of its revenue on R&amp;D, allowing us to move quickly with our technology into new countries to meet specific demands.</p><h4>KOC has been hungry for technological advances. How has this translated into more demand for your services?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MS </strong>We are planning to do a number of trials this year and are already applying the PMM technology with further expansion into the field. Furthermore, we are working towards integration of our power saving capabilities with solar power generation, taking a two-sided approach. The generated solar power runs the field. Once it is coupled with our pumps  it enhances the overall power savings. We are also deploying rig-less systems and two differing alternatives of surface-pumping solutions. Our design is unique and can handle much higher free gas. We are also introducing our slim-line technology, which is a smaller version of the big product. It is useful because we can get around higher deviations or through smaller well bores, which is an advantage as no oil well is straight. Novomet produces the slimmest ESP pumps and motors in the world today. Kuwait has pretty mature oil fields where the pressure has declined, so the wells are producing much smaller amounts. Having a much smaller pump with lower rates, we are still able to get the fluid out without the pump going out of range. Kuwait has heavy oil discoveries, and we are developing products to support those applications.</p><h4>How does Kuwait fit into your global portfolio of services, and what further expansion in the region are you eyeing?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MP</strong> Kuwait is currently less than 5% of our global revenue. A significant part of revenues is still earned in Russia, and because of devaluation of the Russian ruble since 2014, Russian exporters have increased their capabilities on global markets, especially in those where market prices in USD prevail. We are already very well established in the region, with existing contracts in Iraq and our kick off in Abu Dhabi with ADCO. Furthermore, we are going to move into other GCC countries. Even Qatar, which is primarily gas, has opportunities for us. Novomet is a Russian company, and Russia is the number one in terms of numbers of ESPs in the world. Most of these ESPs work in very severe conditions, and historically Russian oil companies preferred to repair rather than order new pumps, so we leverage on 50 years of experience of repairing equipment. We have well-structured procedures on how to perform not only the assembly of the pump but how to determine how the spare parts of this pump can be used afterward, how to construct a new one from spare parts from the factory, how to manage your inventory properly, and ultimately optimize your working capital. Such experience is a competitive advantage in our service facilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-new-horizon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What events have characterized the past year for Boursa Kuwait?</h4><p>The key event was our takeover of the management of the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) in April 2016. This was a huge milestone and a great leap forward in the privatization process. It was a very smooth handover, which did not hamper the operations of the exchange or trading activities. We have successfully completed Phase I, which primarily involved the setting up of Boursa Kuwait. Phase II entails the formulation and implementation of our initiatives and strategy roadmap, and is almost complete. Finally, Phase III includes the assumption of full operations of the KSE and preparations for a company IPO in due course. However, we first need to ensure that the improvements continue to be on the right track, because none of our existing or potential stakeholders will be interested in entering the market if we are not conducting and maintaining the business to internationally recognized standards. We are not seeking to reinvent the wheel; we are adopting international benchmarks and best practice and are mainly targeting international institutional investors.</p><h4>To what extent would you say your privatization process aligns with the goals of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Our process was stated and made clear long before the new Saudi plan, but our cycle of implementation is taking a little bit longer because of the current law and the need to approve new laws by parliament. This is one of our weaknesses and as a result our actions cannot yet be translated as fast as we would like. Although our main priority is to finalize the KSE's infrastructure, we currently have 203 companies listed and the day-to-day business must continue. We are the only established stock exchange in the market, so the privatization process is not just about convincing people to list on the market, or assisting the government privatization process by helping it list its own entities on the market. The stock exchange itself is leading the process on this issue. The KSE is at the forefront of the government's privatization initiatives. Once governmental entities are transferred to the private sector, they will be listed on the stock exchange. Our aim is to have government companies, mainly in the oil sector, list on the KSE. The concept of the privatization process is not just about opening government entities to the public; it is also to convince family-owned companies to consider an IPO. However, we need to give them confidence and persuade them that the stock exchange is one of the most effective methods for companies to raise capital. We need to showcase the benefits of going public, and that an IPO will only benefit the company, not the opposite.</p><h4>How would you describe your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We anticipate being a fully licensed independent stock exchange with the full support and endorsement of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). On the ground, we are making good progress in enhancing our services and systems and this date will not affect the upgrades we have underway. If all continues to plan 2017 is going to be our breakthrough year. If the CMA accepts all of our plans, we will have a new kind of stock exchange with new markets and systems that embrace best international practice. We are going to have a market maker introduced by the end of this year, and will introduce securities, lending, and borrowing (SLBs) and short selling. We are going to enhance over-the-counter performance, which is a market nobody focuses on in the region, and later we are going to focus on SMEs, which are a key part of the economy, especially in relation to diversification. Kuwait is the most innovative country in the region and while other countries are focusing on conglomerates and big businesses, in Kuwait we concentrate far more on entrepreneurship and encouraging business growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the position of KFH as a primary service provider for Islamic finance and as a driver for the industry?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the leading sustainable Islamic bank in the world. One of our core principles is to educate the world about Islamic finance and promote it as an alternative to conventional banking. We believe Islamic finance involves ethical banking solutions that would interest and attract many customers from around the world today, be they Muslim or non-Muslim. Most of our customers are attracted to sharia-compliant banking because it is line with their beliefs, but many others see the value of the ethical dimension and safety that these products imply. There is no interest rate, just a profit rate, and at maturity the amount remains the same without accruing any additional charges. It is also asset-based, which makes the recovery much easier, and there is a limit on over-leveraging of the same asset. Once it is moneyed, there is no way it could be leveraged again. That provides assurance and prevents things like credit derivatives that we saw in the conventional finance sector, and which were instrumental in bringing about the 2008 economic crisis. So Islamic finance is an attractive field for investors looking for an ethical and secure source of financing.</p><h4>In 2016, the volume of sukuk traded via the KFH exceeded USD11.4 billion, nearly doubling the amount of the year before. Why has the sukuk market gained so much momentum in recent years? </h4><p>What has helped is the change in oil prices. Most GCC governments are hydrocarbon based and have been affected by oil prices, thus having to fill gaps in their fiscal budgets. They have tapped the international bond markets for a long time but have not been able to attract Islamic funds due to the form of the financing. We are now seeing more diversity in the financing pools and more appetite toward Islamic financing. In essence, it is a complementary liquidity product that suits Islamic banks because it has liquidity features and tradability, and because it also suits the investor in the sense that it comes at the right price in relative terms, and accesses a larger audience of participants rather than limiting yourself to purely conventional banks. Relative to conventional issuances, it is still small, and the question is how we can grow in terms of diversifying the funding sources between Islamic and conventional.</p><h4>Large-scale infrastructure projects and other megaprojects have been the bedrock of the Kuwait government's five-year plan for 2015-2020. Have you seen a concomitant growth in Islamic financing to fund these projects?</h4><p>Definitely. To give an example, last year the KNPC deal included an Islamic tranche for the first time, opening the door for potential future deals in Islamic finance, be it in local or foreign currency. For example, EQUATE was looking to raise KWD500 million and the book closed at 3.7 billion, so it was significantly over subscribed, with a price that was actually lower than conventional bonds. I see this trend continuing, and the valid proposition of sukuks and the demand we are seeing for those issuances significantly outweighs any conventional bank issue.</p><h4>How important are common international Islamic finance standards, and is there a need for a body to bring about standardization?</h4><p>What needs to be standardized are transparency, accounting standards, agreement, and contract regulations. In terms of products, it helps create flexibility and innovation to have different sharia boards, enriching the Islamic finance world and the products on offer. To centralize would be to kill innovation. However, standardization of processes and procedures is beneficial and important, and is being done by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2017 marks the 50th anniversary of KISR. What are some policy milestones that have helped shape the Kuwaiti economy?</h4><p>R&amp;D is the root of technological advancement and a driver for global growth across the board. Our research is very specific and tailored to the needs of our country; our industries, public health, food, and our economic strength. In our mandate, we have outlined the way we function within our strategic program, and in which sectors. Currently, we focus on food, energy, agriculture, and the environment. Ultimately, our clients should benefit from our expertise and the solutions we find, which are often related to industry-specific problems. Sometimes, however, there is no demand from the market and our scientists work on their own long-term visions to increase the potential of our nation, for example to improve productivity in our commodity-output. For aquaculture, we were the founders of research and development. This knowledge building has been an important driver for our fishery sector, focusing on the aquaculture of the most economically viable fish. Parallel to that, we have been working on the preservation of our desert resources and production of our native plants and seeds. For the latter, we can see growing demand and the industry is maturing for export. We have also been active in the energy sector, looking to improve our ways of producing our output. In all of our research projects, we think about the business side and how we can improve the life of the community at large. For example, in our fresh water project, we implement KISR technology and know-how to produce on a semi-commercial scale. This plant does not compete with the market; it complements it with another source of local water.</p><h4>The successful completion of projects often relies on collaboration, and KISR has established several international partnerships. What characterizes these partnerships?</h4><p>Our focus is primarily on the petroleum sector, and we closely collaborate with the relevant ministries there; the Ministry of Electricity and Water, Oil, Commerce, and also the Environmental Public Authority. We aim to collaborate as much with these local governmental organizations as we do with the private sector. Similarly, we have international partnerships and these expand our horizons from national to international interests. We have committed ourselves to focusing more on the global humanitarian benefits of our research. Although we have ideas in our institute, we still need the skills and capabilities of other academic and research organizations to execute them.</p><h4>What are some of your current projects?</h4><p>In the petroleum sector, we are looking at solutions for corrosion in the production process. This has been one of our ongoing research projects, but we are now using nanotechnology to reduce corrosion of pipelines, and this has great potential value for the industry—not just for petroleum, as these can be used for water as well. We are developing special products that will reach pilot stage soon. We have submitted these for patents, and we are also publishing in academic journals. With the help nanotechnology, we are able to reduce the temperature in the production process, and thus prolong the lifespan of the equipment. This is considered a breakthrough and has potential to fuel developments for alternative energy sources. For example, with improved technology, houses can become better at conserving energy and water. This requires a mentality change amongst the housing authority to start thinking about environmental issues, and we are working on a model to adopt this. Furthermore, we are looking at a new location for our fishery research station. An area has been allocated to establish commercial production of water fisheries and renewable energy, both commercial and semi-commercial. This project will keep us occupied for the next 10 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-progress]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have been made in balancing development with environmental priorities?</h4><p>The EPA believes all the cooperating institutions, together with the Kuwaiti oil companies, have a distinctive job in protecting the environment, saving its natural resources, and reached many milestones set earlier in the development of health and safety protocol on the environment. For example, Kuwait has made significant progress in the reduction of gas flaring in the company's operations, reducing leakages within the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) facilities, and establishing a crisis management center at the headquarters of KNPC. We are committed to implementing the most stringent international rules and regulations in the field of health and safety and the environment in crude oil transfer operations. For our logistics operations, we now have 15 new tankers that have the highest HSE standards. The Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC) has established three additional stations to monitor the ambient air quality at Khafji Joint Operations with the development of air quality monitoring by installing dust and fine particles and hydrogen sulfide analysis capability. Also, KGOC's Wafra Joint Operations have removed 90% of the liquid, sludge, and waste pits within the project and achieved the total elimination of waste discharges. The international petroleum division is working to cut carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the operation of gasoline stations by providing alternative energy plants through the application of design and installation of a photoelectric system project.</p><h4>A law was passed to implement tariffs for the use of water and electricity. Will these measures raise awareness about rationalizing consumption of water and electricity?</h4><p>All these campaigns and measures are implemented to contribute to increasing environmental awareness about the importance of the environment and its natural resources. The issue of rationalization of electricity and water is no longer an individual responsibility, but turned into a collective responsibility because of our responsibility in Kuwait about the high consumption of natural resources and energy, and of course the issue of rationalization is not only limited to how much they are used but will extend the concept to include the protection of the environment and reduce pollution in a world facing global warming. Promoting environmental awareness amongst the broader community is a key priority for the EPA. It is the only guarantee to save citizens and residents from the dangers of environmental pollution. The EPA is seeking to improve environmental awareness, instilling a sense of belonging and stimulating awareness of the depth of the positive relationship between humans and the environment.</p><h4>How do you expect commitments made at the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April 2016 to influence policies at the current administration?</h4><p>Kuwait's vision on sustainability includes a lot of projects, and legislation has been already approved by the midterm development plan. Kuwait was granted the right to proceed with the development and establishment of projects that would enhance the national economy and achieve security of energy supply and provide housing and jobs for citizens without being against Kuwait's obligations toward the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is achieved through the establishment of projects that meet the criteria for sustainable development of the state by taking into account environmental, economic, and social aspects. The Zour Refinery and alternative energy plants at the Alshqaya complex are good examples of these, and are subject to global environmental specifications. The projects are targeted to protect the natural resources in the state while retaining the right to request financial and technological support to reduce gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Act No. 24 of 2014 instructs the government and private agencies to improve their production processes, reduce gas emissions, and conserve the natural resources of the state. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the past year for your operations?</h4><p>We did reach the end of the investment plan, acquiring and booking investments, and now the shareholders, including our largest shareholder Kuwait Finance House (KFH), and other investors are expecting payback so we are exiting the investments. Turkapital is structured originally as a fund, which means that, just like any other fund, there is always going to be an exit plan. As we are currently in the eighth year of the fund, we are discussing and trying to resolve the road to the exit and this is where we are. Turkapital functioned as the investment arm of the KFH group within Turkey, so the team at Turkapital originated many deals and opportunities in the market. Turkapital's team identified and closed deals in Turkey. Turkapital's portfolio of investments includes real estate (residential, industrial, and commercial), non-life insurance, and auto fleet leasing businesses. Operationally, they are all profitable while the challenge remains the Turkish lira's volatility.</p><h4>What markets will be crucial for Turkapital in the upcoming year?</h4><p>As a group, KFH remains interested in the Turkey/Eurasia region. For Turkapital, a vehicle that was created to invest in the same region and reached the end of the investment line, we are in the process to finalize the roadmap to exit. However, as a group, we remain interested in Turkey and the region, and we will continue to look at opportunities in private equity and real estate as well. Also, Turkey offers many attractive opportunities in different sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, and energy. We will also look at Eastern Europe and Western/Central Asia, including Russia.</p><h4>What are some challenges in reconciling complex financial technologies with the principles of Islamic finance?</h4><p>There is definitely a steep learning curve. Some of the complex financial models are still not even mastered by conventional economists and the finance world. So when coming to sharia-compliant economists and financial mathematicians, they have to reshape and tailor the models to fit. It is not impossible but it constitutes a challenge, and the risk is not to fall for the quick and cheap game. The players in the market should stick to a genuine ethical business and try to come up with models that are genuine as well, realistic, and more efficient than the previous ones. Although at Turkapital we are a small and young sharia-compliant fund/firm, we have consistently tried to maintain an ethical touch in our business.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook for the upcoming year for Turkapital?</h4><p>We will try to finalize the exit plan for shareholders and the investments as well.  In addition, 2017 is going to be yet another worthwhile year for Turkey as the government had set a number of challenging objectives for Turkey as an economy and as a player in the region; socially, financially, and politically. We shall see how this evolves, and Turkapital will be in a good position to benefit and to take advantage of such developments hopefully.</p><h4>What do you consider to be the most important change your company will implement in the medium term?</h4><p>Our current focus is executing the exit plan and to meet shareholders' expectations hopefully while maintaining the group's presence in Turkey through a well-established business platform to originate, package, and launch investment opportunities form the region. We shall continue to formulate an asset exit strategy based on predetermined key financial and market indicators, as well as ensure regular monitoring of the performance of the assets alongside periodical reporting (quarterly and annual) of the asset performance and asset valuation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were recently named the Best Islamic Bank in the GCC, the latest in a string of accolades for leadership in the Arab Islamic banking sector. What distinguishes KIB within the region's Islamic finance space?</h4><p>I am delighted to say that 2016 proved to be a highly successful year for KIB on all fronts, and the numerous awards we have received only served to highlight that. Much of our continued success can be attributed to our forward-thinking strategy and visionary outlook, which have been extremely successful in enhancing our position within the Islamic banking sector. This has been a key driving force pushing us to continuously develop our offerings, in order to provide customers with innovative, contemporary, and market-leading Islamic banking solutions. Our continued stability has also been one of our biggest defining attributes. KIB has proven to be one of the most stable financial institutions in the region time and again, and we have continued to perform strongly in every aspect of our business. Our employees and management team have also played a key role, as I for one truly believe that the success of any organization is dependent on the efforts and dedication of its employees. KIB houses a team of highly qualified and experienced banking professionals across all levels of our organization, and they work cohesively and collaboratively to help the bank attain its strategic objectives and long-term goals. Additionally, one of our biggest areas of focus as an organization has been social responsibility, and I am proud to say KIB continues to have one of the most comprehensive and successful social responsibility programs in the market. Social responsibility has been a fundamental cornerstone of our vision since inception, and we have always sought to be true corporate citizens and have worked diligently to fulfill our duty towards Kuwait, its people, and its society—beyond just our economic role and functions.</p><h4>What new products and services from KIB would you like to highlight?</h4><p>We continue to make major strides in our mission to enhance our full suite of products and services, introducing innovative and state-of-the art banking solutions crafted to meet the ever-changing needs of both customers and the market. Our Arzaq Deposit continues to offer one of the most attractive profit rates in the market, and our savings account enjoys one of the highest return rates, in addition to providing the benefits of savings and investment simultaneously in a single account. In 2016, we also launched one of our most successful promotional campaigns to date. The “Get Half Your Salary Cash" campaign gave new salary customers the opportunity to win half their salary cash instantly upon transfer, and without any draws. There is also a major push on the corporate banking side of our business, as we are developing tailored solutions and innovative products for our corporate clients.</p><h4>In what ways is KIB investing in human capital development?</h4><p>We have always actively sought to support, nurture, and develop talents within the local banking sector. Our goal is to continuously attract aspiring young Kuwaiti professionals of both genders, providing a wealth of career opportunities and professional training programs for newly graduated Kuwaiti nationals. In a testament to our outstanding employment strategies and ongoing efforts to support local human capital, KIB was honored at the 15th ceremony recognizing excellence in workforce nationalization policies in the private sector in the GCC, which took place under the auspice of the Council of Ministers of Labour and Council of Ministers of Social Affairs of GCC States. We are also committed to investing in our employees and promoting their professional growth and development, and we continue to provide professional training and development opportunities across all divisions and levels. We maintain a comprehensive program of training initiatives year-round, designed to enhance the skillsets and abilities of all of our employees. We are also in the midst of implementing a new performance management process, which will balance performance assessments with career aspirations and professional development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision to empower young Kuwaitis?</h4><p>Over the last two years the ecosystem has changed dramatically and in a positive way. We have catalyzed a lot of the players and stakeholders in the market, and we do not see a need for a government entity to be in that space anymore. If this trend continues, in three to five years many of the gaps in the market we saw two years ago will be filled completely. Governments should regulate and monitor and should also catalyze what the private sector is not ready for or is not willing to enter yet because of the risks. That has been one of the biggest achievements we have had in the last two years. SMEs are starting to become an engine of the economy like in developed countries where SMEs make up about 60-70% of GDP. That took a long time of course, and it will take us a while too, but probably faster than the typical developed country. An important target for Kuwait is to create Kuwaiti jobs. There is no problem in creating jobs; we have a problem creating Kuwaiti jobs. It will take a culture change to get people to own and build small businesses, with all the work and risks it entails. Business owners will also have to be willing to hire Kuwaitis, despite not necessarily having high salaries, especially compared to the public sector, which pays high salaries and is a safe channel of employment for Kuwaitis. We have to make the right incentives to bring about this SME evolution and make it a viable alternative for Kuwaitis compared to pursuing public service positions. There is an increasing number of youths who are opting for starting or working in SMEs. This is not just a Kuwaiti or GCC or even an Arab thing, rather it is a global trend. We are getting invited to global conferences on entrepreneurship development, collaborative entrepreneurship debt, startups, and so on. It is a global movement and everyone is worrying about the same thing: job creation and developing certain components of economies. The unique challenge in the Gulf is how to create jobs for our own citizens, but the appetite for startups and SMEs is certainly there.</p><h4>IT is a booming sector for entrepreneurs. How can you continue to bring benefits to the sector?</h4><p>IT or IT-enabled businesses and ideas are booming globally, addressing two things: globalization, and linkages of countries. The world is shrinking, and that means we need to worry about being sustainable and competitive at both the local and global level. What we produce or can produce here will come from elsewhere, maybe even in our own language. So we need to figure out how to become competitive in that field and people in that space already think globally anyway. While trying to be more efficient, you need to direct your operations better and that is where the fund could come in as a catalyst. If we talk about Kuwait being a financial center, anyone who wants to make an IT incubator/accelerator will probably think of e-commerce as the biggest money maker, but nobody will think of fintech products. We may need it to provide, produce, and develop services and products that would serve that sector. That is where we would catalyze that, doing it where nobody else might want to do it. So we would direct the country where it should be going and get the entities to serve that. Today not all entities have a view of that and follow it, because it takes time.</p><h4>How do you see the interplay between banks and fintech businesses developing in Kuwait? Will they work together more closely?</h4><p>I do not think the private sector will go into creating fintech companies in Kuwait, which is where we would come into the picture. We could partner with banks ourselves to see what their needs are for a year or two, and try to do this in our own hubs and do it in-house in our own IT and ICT hubs. Eventually, once we catalyze that and do it, the market will figure it out, other brains will come and see how they can feed it, and then we can exit and let it roll on its own. Central banks by definition are conservative, so when there are regulations to be issued, the big issue for them is always security. The cabinet just approved the creation of a cyber security center and they mandated CITRA to do it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones characterized the past year for you?</h4><p>A key milestone was organizing the Kuwait Investment Forum (KIF), the first investment promotion conference, under the patronage of HH the Amir of Kuwait and with the personal inauguration of the Prime Minister in March 2016. KIF attracted more than 600 high-ranking officials, dignitaries, and private-sector participants from 24 countries. The KIF showcased Kuwait's unique attributes, highlighted the evolving legal and regulatory favorable developments, and presented a host of lucrative investment opportunities that portrayed a new culture of achievement in the dynamic Kuwaiti market. Such achievements, reinforced by a host of new economic laws passed, provide a profound basis to further consolidate KDIPA's efforts to ensure that direct investments are conducive to national sustainable growth and prosperity</p><h4>The authority further collaborates with the Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP) to strengthen public-private partnerships. What PPPs does KDIPA hope to facilitate in the coming years?</h4><p>Under the current second medium-term development plan, around USD103 billion has been allocated toward megaprojects covering north zone development, electricity and water, oil and gas, urban development, education, health, transport and communications, tourism, media, and environment. The Kuwaiti government is aware of the urgent need to expedite the diversification process of its revenues by getting the private sector to increase its share in GDP. Moreover, the government is actively seeking to attract powerhouse industries into new areas that focus on advanced technology and technical know-how to support economic diversification and to establish the needed ecosystem to build the pillars of Kuwait's knowledge economy</p><h4>How would you describe the business and investment climate in Kuwait at the moment?</h4><p>Kuwait's business and investment climate is witnessing continued improvement. Incentives such as 100% ownership and being able to receive a license within 30 days are integral components of KDIPA's offer to attract foreign investors. Other incentives include performance-based tax credit, customs duties exemptions, and guarantees against expropriation, allowing free transfer of capital and profits, and sharing benefits under bilateral agreements. In doing so, KDIPA acts as a specialized agency promoting Kuwait as a lucrative investment destination, receiving applications for investment licensing and granting incentives, servicing investors, facilitating procedures, providing aftercare, as well as playing an active advocacy role for streamlining business environment and enhancing Kuwait's competitiveness in close coordination with all other government entities and various stakeholders. Under this advocacy role, KDIPA is assigned to head the Permanent Committee for Streamlining Business Environment in Kuwait (PCK), established by the Council of Ministers decision to coordinate national efforts, document achievements, and communicate improvements. Current membership of PCK includes nine concerned government entities entailing the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Ministry of Justice, and the Kuwait Municipality. Additionally, KDIPA launched a series of public-private open dialog to identify reform priorities that will contribute to improving the business climate in Kuwait. Furthermore, KDIPA, in accordance with its mandated tasks, keeps communication channels open with the investors receiving their issues, addressing their concerns, and resolving identified barriers to doing business in Kuwait, in close cooperation and full coordination with other relevant government entities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>KDIPA plans to become more pro-active in the coming year. We hope to adopt a well-planned and assertive approach when implementing our multifaceted promotional campaigns, generating investment leads, conducting investor-targeting initiatives, and developing investor services operations. The dedicated efforts of our team of young professionals, accompanied by well-articulated strategic directions, are fundamental to achieving our intended goals to make Kuwait an investment location of choice. We shall be building on the success attained this year and will work to further strengthen our service delivery model, and geographic outreach. In this regard, we take it upon ourselves to continue providing the needed facilitation to attract value added investments that will advance our country's economic growth and steer its development path toward an innovation-based economy focusing on ensuring sustainability in face of rising global commitments and challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Case of Supply and Demand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-case-of-supply-and-demand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the structural investment agenda impacted the economy in recent years and how does the office of Al-Amiri envision this moving forward?</h4><p>Building up infrastructure is the role of the government and we have been a bit behind on this, but using the oil surplus for infrastructure is the best path we should take for the economy because it will be permanent, whereas savings or cash surpluses fade away. World-class infrastructure has a highly positive impact on the economy, society, and the quality of life, but this is not enough. A country does not build infrastructure to increase conceptual behavior, rather it should be a tool to increase productive behavior. New highways should not be built to encourage more driving, instead they should be used by trucks to deliver goods outside Kuwait or to make the import of goods cheaper, they should be a tool to enhance the economy. Secondly, there is the issue of maintenance, and it would be great if the private sector would take on that role, like we have seen with the development of the airport.</p><h4>What are HH Al-Amiri's thoughts on having the curriculums of these universities aligned with industry demands?</h4><p>In the last three years, most people have been speaking of the danger of the decline of oil prices on our budget deficit, but we should be more concerned about youth employment; that is the biggest problem facing Kuwait. The major challenge is to provide value-adding jobs for young Kuwaitis. The solution is not to employ them in the public sector, so we should encourage them to start their own companies or join private companies. Both public and private higher education have to adapt to this reality and meet the needs of society. It has to matter whether one has an arts or an engineering degree, and currently the public sector employs all regardless of their background. In the last five years we succeeded in changing the landscape, although there are still some issues; we do not necessarily need new economic activities that do not fit our country, but ultimately the market decides what will survive. We try to encourage IT, services, and export-oriented activities that will employ Kuwaitis. There is a difference between opening a restaurant and bringing in a dozen unskilled foreign laborers to do the work, and creating a company for two highly skilled Kuwaitis. We need a distinction that encourages value-adding economic activities, whilst leaving other industries to flourish by themselves.</p><h4>What are the ambitions of HH Al-Almiri for the coming years?</h4><p>His Highness Al-Amiri's vision is to see Kuwait as a regional hub for finance, commerce, and trade. The key to success here is that it is a stable region and HH Al-Amiri is working hard to bring every member of this region together to discuss how to bring about stability. Kuwait currently plays a major role in Iraq, bringing humanitarian aid to those in need and facilitating a dialog with Iran on behalf of the GCC. A stable region means a stable Kuwait, because we are just a small country. Secondly, HH Al-Amiri is pushing hard on our soft infrastructure, educating the management of our infrastructure projects, like the new seaport in the north and the Silk City. Kuwait has great potential for many reasons, and not just because our oil reserves or our financial strength. Our strengths are our people, our constitution and democracy, and our institutional setup. Kuwait has been through ups and downs, but has managed to sail through these dangers in a stable way. Comparing the exchange rate of the Kuwaiti dinar in 1962 to a basket of regional currencies with the rate in December 2016 shows how much it has preserved its value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-man-with-a-plan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of the GSSCPD?</h4><p>In the early years, we had a master plan for urban development in the country when no other countries in the region had such a plan. Our planning transformed from urban development to more strategic national planning. In 2004, His Highness the Amir issued a decree to form the GSSCPD in Kuwait, and it was inaugurated in 2007, initially as the Ministry of Planning. The primary objective was to develop a long-term strategic plan for the future of Kuwait, a five-year plan, as well as short-term annual plans. With all of these planning activities our ultimate vision has been the transformation of Kuwait into a commercial and financial hub for the region. The idea is to create an environment that encourages and empowers internal and external investment and has greater ease of doing business, which is driven and led by the private sector.</p><h4>How do you envision measuring progress on the seventh pillar, the international positioning of the country?</h4><p>It is a chief objective to change the government from being an operator to a regulator by 2035, and this involves privatization. For the master plan, we have outlined seven pillars and six of them ultimately converge in the seventh pillar, which is putting Kuwait on the map through “International Positioning of the Country." In each pillar, we look at the global competitiveness indices, which are compiled and published by international organizations like the UN, the IMF, and the World Bank, and we have listed 20 global indices and outlined KPIs for each of them. We would like to be at least in the top 35 for all indicators in the world by the year 2035.</p><h4>As you strive to become a commercial hub, how do you plan to leverage Kuwait's geographical location?</h4><p>As a hub, we need to be open to all, and as we are geographically well positioned, we can link the East to the West. We are moving closer to being part of what we call the economic corridor. With this strategic position, we are definitely looking at a higher rate of trade exchange volumes once we create the proper infrastructure to link the East with the West. With the investments that are made in infrastructure, we can host that linkage and be part of that global economic corridor. We are looking forward to building a solid commercial and financial infrastructure, and this cements us as a financial and commercial hub.</p><h4>What characterizes Vision 2035 for you?</h4><p>In line with His Highness the Amir's vision, by 2035 we should be able to transform the labor market so that 20% of our citizens work for the public sector and 80% work in the private sector. Furthermore, in line with our “Sustainable Living Environment" pillar, we have a very ambitious renewable energy project whereby 15% of our energy mix will be sourced from renewables. The potential for solar power is huge in Kuwait, and we should strive for solid PPPs to make progress here. Also, by 2035, the smart cities that we envision building should be up and running, and boost our society on the sustainability index. Our education system will be about delivering more creative and innovative graduates and human capital should become our biggest asset.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will be seeing a lot of megaprojects approaching submission, and by 2018 and 2019 most of them should be in operation. All entities are working together to get things done this time, and we are all locked into this vision together. Our judicial system is strong, which is a key parameter for international business to set foot into a country, so we should promote that. We still need to improve the ease of doing business in Kuwait, and we are working on that. With the conclusion of the Kuwait Business Center project, a company can be registered in just 30 days. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does NATO envision with the opening of the ICI-NATO Regional Centre in Kuwait?</h4><p>The opening of the ICI-NATO Regional Centre marked two important milestones: a milestone in the strong bond that unites NATO and Kuwait and a milestone in the blossoming partnership between NATO and the entire Gulf region. We owe a debt of gratitude to the State of Kuwait, and in particular Sheikh Thamer Ali Al-Sabah for his leadership and steadfast support. Furthermore, we are grateful to Kuwait for hosting this center, for being such a strong and valued NATO partner, and for its long-standing leadership in promoting regional security. NATO's Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) was designed to contribute to long-term regional security and stability. This center is a historic achievement, and NATO's first such presence in the Gulf region. We envision it to be a vital hub for cooperation between the alliance and Kuwait, as well as our other Gulf partners, including in our important fight against terrorism. We will work together in a range of different areas, including strategic analysis, civil emergency planning, military-to-military cooperation, and public diplomacy.</p><h4>How will this center strengthen the relationships between the ICI members and NATO?</h4><p>The security of the Gulf countries is directly linked to the security of all NATO allies. We face common security threats and we share the same aspirations for peace and stability. Working more closely together than ever before is essential, and for that we have now developed individual cooperation programs with all our ICI partners, tailored to their specific security interests and needs. The NATO-ICI Regional Centre in Kuwait aims to foster cooperation between NATO and ICI countries in the fields of the strategic and policy analysis, military-to-military cooperation, civil emergency planning, public diplomacy, and cultural awareness. The center will also facilitate the implementation of our individual cooperation programs and will allow us to reinforce our level of interoperability, which will be key in responding together to future crises. Modern security institutions and well-trained local forces represent our best weapons in the fight against violent extremism. NATO has a long history of working with partners to project stability beyond our borders, including through enhancing the defense capacities of its partners. In addressing the most pressing security challenges of our time, we are much stronger together than we are alone, and that is what this NATO-ICI Centre is all about—deepening trust, building cooperation, and working together to make our nations safer.</p><h4>What are the reasons for the establishment of this regional center, particularly in Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait has been a strong and dedicated NATO partner for many years and has been a driving force in building greater security and stability in the Gulf region. In 2015, we signed the NATO-Kuwait Transit Agreement to facilitate the transit of personnel and supplies to our NATO Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, and to make any future NATO activities in the region more effective. In 2004, Kuwait was the first country to join NATO's ICI and also the first ICI country to establish the Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme with NATO. Today all four ICI countries—Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE—have these cooperation programs with NATO. Our relationship with Kuwait and the other ICI partners reached a new level last year, when all four countries opened diplomatic missions to NATO. On the sidelines of the opening of the regional center, we held a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Kuwait, where we discussed regional security challenges and how we can work together to address them. As the regional center is the alliance's first such presence in the Gulf, it will be a vital hub for our practical cooperation. This is essential, because our security is directly linked. We have learned over the years that we are much stronger with allies and partners than we are alone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The two countries have around USD250 million in total trade, with petroleum derivatives exported to Sri Lanka, and tea, precious stones, fruit, and jewelry heading to Kuwait. Could you tell us more about economic relations, and what are the important areas of focus to bolster trade and investment?</h4><p>Kuwait is a preferred trading partner for Sri Lanka. Yet, the current amount of trade between our countries does not reflect the huge potential for bilateral trade. For the most part, it has been based on traditional items from both sides, such as tea and petroleum. While they form an important share of to our trade relations, there is scope for diversification through fostering more people-to-people and business-to-business trade relations. Currently, value addition in food industry has seen some positive developments. Furthermore, the fisheries industry has been in focus and many opportunities are available given the resource-rich large extent of sea area of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has identified green energy as a top priority. This offers ample investment and business opportunities in Sri Lanka for socially responsible businesses and entrepreneurs. It is a good time to do business in Sri Lanka. The country's economy is growing at a healthy rate over 5% and our middle class in expanding fast. Sri Lanka's workforce is one of the best skilled in the region. What makes Sri Lanka most attractive to investors is the access they will enjoy from Sri Lanka as we have a solid FTA with India, which we are improving further. At the same time, Sri Lanka is negotiating two more FTAs with China and Singapore. Once complete, these trade agreements will make Sri Lanka a launching pad to a market of three billion people.</p><h4>Sri Lanka serves as one of the primary Asian destinations for Kuwait, both for tourist destination and as hub for further travel by Kuwait Airways of Sri Lankan Airlines. Kuwait, in return, is home to more than 120,000 Sri Lankans who work in a variety of sectors. How do you envision mobility in both directions to develop?</h4><p>Throughout history, Sri Lanka has been referred to as a place of idyllic scenery and exotic beauty. In the ancient Arab world, Sri Lanka was once known as Serendip. Today, Sri Lanka is one of the top emerging tourist destinations in the world. Tourist arrivals from Kuwait to Sri Lanka have risen formidably in the recent past. While Sri Lanka's rich geographical and natural diversity is a treat to most visitors, Sri Lanka's central location between the Middle East and Eastern Asia offers a convenient meeting place for business travellers. Sri Lanka is agreeably located in the middle of Asia's many growing economies to serve as a central travel destination. Sri Lankans employed in Kuwait also contribute heavily to the frequency of travel between the two destinations. Both Sri Lankan Airlines and Kuwait Airways operate frequently and the airlines are ready to increase the number of flights further. Expansion of the Katunayake airport is also taking place to cater to the growing demand of the travellers. Sri Lanka is emerging as a travel hub in the region, thanks to the many travellers who wants to stop over in Sri Lanka during their Asian tour. Tourism is one of our fastest-growing industries and the expanding Asian middle class has helped Sri Lanka become a preferred travel destination. </p><h4>Sri Lanka and Kuwait have had cordial relations for more than five decades. What are your hopes and expectations for Sri Lankan-Kuwaiti relations in the near future?</h4><p>Kuwait is more than an economic partner for Sri Lanka. We are a few years away from celebrating five decades of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Kuwait has been a “home away from home" for many Sri Lankans who work there. Sri Lanka and Kuwait have stood in solidarity in many international fora, and acted with mutual understanding and respect. In terms of bilateral relations, as Sri Lanka prioritizes science and technology sector as declared in the Asia Co-operation Dialogue, where Kuwait is a member, I welcome the priority Kuwait has given to sustainable development. We are also keen to diversify and upgrade the skilled labor migration to Kuwait from Sri Lanka. As such, we will see more skilled employees seeking employment opportunities in Kuwait. Both countries have agreed to promote more and more business-to-business linkages as a key strategy in strengthening trade between the countries. We also look forward to increased people-to-people linkages for achieving sustainable business and cultural ties. After all, we are one big Asian family and it is those ties that bring real benefits for people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Kuwait's progress in diversifying its economy, and how is the ministry equipped to drive diversification of the economy?</h4><p>The 2015-2020 plan could be named “the rebirth." Kuwait was the first country in the region to build a comprehensive infrastructure between 1950 and 1960s. This infrastructure has reached its maturity and it is time to rebuild the country. But, infrastructure does not build countries, economies do; therefore, we have concentrated on different initiatives to achieve the target of becoming a more open economy and focused on diversifying its sources of income. This has been the cornerstone of the development plan. MoCI is committed to utilizing the ministry and its affiliated bodies to enhance and improve the ecosystem of Kuwait. We aim to achieve that by simplifying and automating the procedures and processes of establishing and maintaining business licenses and registration, while taking into consideration the best practices and latest technologies, enhancing regulatory requirements for trade and commerce supervision, and improving the skills of employees attending to those tasks.</p><h4>How can Kuwait use its vast resources to drive surrounding industries?</h4><p>Kuwait is one of the main oil providers in the world and has some of the highest reserves. The country has been successful in its partnership with global leaders in petrochemicals and we are witnessing more companies entering this market in Kuwait. At MoCI and our affiliates, we are taking into consideration the needs of businesses in those industries and are working closely with stakeholders to improve the underlying platform and enhance the process and procedures related to them. We also encourage international companies to enter the Kuwaiti market, and the Kuwait Direct Promotion Authority (KDIPA) has been successful in executing and inviting international firms to start their direct business in Kuwait without a local agent, such as Huawei and IBM, along with many others that already have operations. On the other hand, we will soon have the Authority for the Protection of Competition (APC) working at its full capacity to enhance and improve the competition in the Kuwaiti market as well as ensure fair trade for all stakeholders in the economy. The National Fund for SMEs has been working vigorously to consolidate and enhance and promote entrepreneurial initiatives among the youth in Kuwait in order to enhance the local business communities. The fund has been engaged in different financing programs and training and development program and we aim for the National Fund to be a major driver in the near future and would be a factor in increasing the employment of Kuwaitis in the private sector. The National Fund also focuses on enhancing the engagement of small and medium enterprises in that field, in which we believe it would be an added value to the overall economy and assist as well in the knowledge transfer by linking international players with the know-how with local business to collaborate in the field, similar to what is happening between multinational companies and the government.</p><h4>Kuwait has a strongly developing food market, with national giants like Mezzan and Americana increasingly becoming regional leaders. What potential can be further unlocked for the F&amp;B and FMCG market in the country?</h4><p>Kuwait is an active and versatile market for the F&amp;B and FMCG industries with major players, not just locally, but regionally. This has been the norm for a long time. Americana and Mezzan are indeed recognizable publicly traded companies; yet there are other players in those sectors, varying from SMEs to multinationals. We have witnessed many new brands in both industries originating in Kuwait and expanding into regional countries, which have been a great added value to our economy and we aim to encourage those businesses to expand into other countries and continents as well as encouraging similar businesses to take the footsteps of the predecessors and increase the Kuwaiti footprint in other economies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you envision the Islamic world driving the global economy in the years to come?</h4><p>According to recent reports, the world's Islamic economy grew at almost double the global rate in 2014 and 2015, and Islamic consumption is set to reach USD2.6 trillion in 2020. Taking ASEAN as a whole, GDP growth was robust at 4.5% in 2015. In fact, despite the prevailing global uncertainty, it is even expected to grow marginally higher in 2016. The European scenario is rather different than that of ASEAN and the global Islamic economy and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, the pace of recovery in Europe since 2008 has been sluggish and eurozone GDP is still below its pre-crisis rate. In contrast, ASEAN's economic growth has been rapid and stable since 2000, recording a combined GDP of USD2.6 trillion in 2016, making it collectively the seventh-largest economy in the world. The region has become a major global hub for manufacturing and trade, and it is also one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world. Also, more Muslims are becoming increasingly active as investors, manufacturers, bankers, traders, competitors, and suppliers. Islamic consumer spending is also rising as demand increases for ethical finance, investment, insurance services, halal food, modest fashion, and halal tourism. Even non-Muslims are attracted to the Islamic economy's underlying socially conscious ethos. There is an opening here for dialog with the West, which has longed in some sectors for a just and compassionate economy of its own.</p><h4>What are the challenges that the Muslim world faces, and could these be addressed in a collaborative way?</h4><p>The Muslim world has some serious issues to address. Education, poverty, and female participation in the workforce remain challenges and only 2% of GDP is spent on R&amp;D. All of this is despite the fact that collectively the Muslim world holds 70% of the world's energy resources and 40% of global natural resources. We also face the scourge of ISIS, the terrorists who blaspheme our religion by falsely claiming the mantle of an Islamic state. There is nothing Islamic about a group that practices such barbarities, and it is crucial that Muslim majority countries take the lead in condemning them. Malaysia stands firmly against ISIS and its accomplices both at home and abroad. While we acknowledge the issues we must address, we believe it is good to focus on vital topics relating to sukuk infrastructure development, halal industries, female empowerment, and disruptive technology. We must encourage more merit-based economic opportunities in the Muslim world. We seek a world that includes all our citizens and shares the proceeds of growth with all. One that educates all our children; one that supports all our entrepreneurs and SMEs; one that prizes knowledge and innovation, and one that appreciates that our diversity is also our joy and our strength.</p><h4>Together with the Middle East, Malaysia has become a vital growth center for Islamic finance. Why has this gained so much momentum in recent years?</h4><p>Increasing numbers of people are recognizing that Islamic finance can be a model of a socially responsible and sustainable investment, and a more secure way of supporting the world's financial system. Malaysia's USD418 billion Islamic capital market has more than tripled in size over the last 10 years, and it is strengthening its status as a premier destination for sharia-compliant businesses and transactions. Malaysia continues to be the global leader of the sukuk market, combining 54.3% of the global sukuk outstanding at the end of 2015, while total assets under management of our Islamic fund management industry remains the world's second largest. Moving forward, we have identified Islamic wealth management as a new growth area, and we look forward to opportunities to collaborate with other jurisdictions, as well as industry and academia, to expand international connectivity, strengthen talent capabilities, and grow the international Islamic capital markets for the benefit of all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Regarding expansion, could you tell us about the agreement that you signed with the Faculty of Engineering at AUB recently?</h4><p>We will end 2017 with 20,000sqm of built-up area, adding an additional 2,500sqm to where we currently are. With Phase B, we are introducing new commercial blocks that will double our size which will become 35,000sqm by 2020. The agreement with the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at AUB is another important element critical for our growth and achieving our vision. We must recruit the best talent. The main thing, and one of the main challenges that most of the start-ups are facing in Lebanon, is recruitment and access to talent. From that perspective we decided to venture with different universities, starting with AUB, specifically the faculty of engineering and architecture. We started there to spread later into many different faculties and then continue to spread on to other universities. We connect third-year students with companies that we host at BDD or to companies within the networks of our partners. The idea is to try to connect the needs of the companies with interns. For the companies this provides access to talent and potentially the ability to recruit talented people if they perform well during internships. From the side of the interns, which is the most important side, they get access to see what is happening in the ecosystem. Through having their internship at a start-up company, they will be asked to produce much more and have the opportunity to learn much more about the needs and innovations currently happening in the ICT sector in a two-month period.</p><h4>As of today, Lebanon is home to over 200 startups, only second behind the United Arab Emirates. What is your outlook for the next five years?</h4><p>It is all about the internet and bandwidth. We have the three other components. From my point-of-view, in its current state Lebanon can complement the UAE. It should not compete with the UAE because the UAE has invested a lot in infrastructure during the last 20 years. Our infrastructure does not compete with theirs. The UAE is also now positioned as an international hub for most international companies, especially with the political instability that Lebanon is exposed to. Although we have a certain level of stability when compared to the region over the last five to six years, there is still exposure to political instability. However, at the bottom line what you need is super high-speed internet at affordable rates. Everyone is looking for more speed so as to increase their productivity. We got fiber optics connected and we started rolling this out to many companies that we host at BDD. However, it was not at a subsidized rate, so it was at a similar rate to elsewhere in Lebanon. It is fair enough as a start, because currently the whole government is looking at internet prices and increasing bandwidth. This is much needed. Increasing the bandwidth while decreasing the cost is the one thing that must be done for Lebanon and that is discussed each year by the government. This will make companies more competitive.</p><h4>What are the main priorities and goals for BDD over the next 12 months?</h4><p>For our development we focus on five things, which are our pillars. They are community, business cluster, innovative architecture, sustainability, and work-life balance. For 2017, we see our two main focuses being our community and the business cluster, which is automating and increasing the productivity and benefits that our current community enjoys by launching a new app that automates all of its needs and services. This is happening this year and I believe it will  create a seamless experience for anyone to enjoy all of the benefits that BDD can offer through their handheld phone. We are in beta-phase now, so we are testing internally. The app will allow door access, a digital secretary for visitors, payments, room booking, and so on. It was subcontracted through a Lebanese start-up company. The first version will be launched in July-August. There are two stages with different features, so all of the features will be finalized before the end of the year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does BNP Paribas see in Colombia? What is the strategic importance of this market for its strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>In terms of opportunities, there are many in construction and infrastructure. The 4G infrastructure projects are humongous and comparable to Mexico's energy projects, which suffered from the decline in oil prices. In the region, this is still the main group of projects where we see lots of opportunities because firstly, BNP Paribas is a bank that likes infrastructure. Being a European bank, BNP Paribas knows and likes product financing. What is more, the knowledge of international banks that we bring to the different products is important. We need to have international standards in developing our different toll roads for 4G. The same applies to the Bogotá metro, a project I hope moves forward. There you need international banks with experience developing metros in other parts of the world; since BNP Paribas has done metros throughout Latin America, we have the expertise and knowledge. The other opportunity is related to capital markets and global markets. There are many opportunities in the development of Colombia's capital markets. We think there are several initiatives in order to have asset managers be more sophisticated. That goes along with the product offering that a bank like BNP Paribas can provide those clients. These clients are mainly institutional investors, such as pension funds, banks, and insurance companies.</p><h4>What role should international banks play in financing the 4G projects?</h4><p>The international financial community is definitely playing an important and necessary one. The overall USD20 billion budget needs funding from every available kind of pool in the world. We are also demonstrating the extent to which domestic banks can support projects with international standards. As international banks, we are also helping develop the financial industry in Colombia. I can tell you that before 4G, the Bogotá Airport was the only project under a project finance structure. Before that, the runways independent of the airport had a different project finance structure. Other than those examples, project-financing structures of this size did not exist. Therefore, there is still a lot of learning involved, but best practices are being transmitted to the local financial community.</p><h4>What do you see as the main challenges for the international finance sector to get involved in these projects?</h4><p>The corruption and scandals that arose at the beginning of 2017 were definitely challenging. We began 2017 with a lot of optimism, which has unfortunately now receded. By March 2017, things began to slow down. One of the main challenges is to get past the corruption scandals we have seen. The other is to get financial closing for each project: the competitiveness of Colombia depends on it. Therefore, securing USD20 billion in funding is no walk in the park.</p><h4>How have outside perceptions of Colombia changed over the last several years?</h4><p>BNP Paribas is a kind of house where international investors come to see and learn about the country. We hear from three to four companies each quarter looking at Colombia and seeing what they can do. The perception of Colombia has undergone a major change. Sometimes it is sad because Colombians probably have an image of their country that is not so good in comparison to the one that foreigners now have. I do think that investment will continue to grow in Colombia. There are lots of opportunities in the country, and people from abroad are looking at them seriously. We track our reputation digitally, and one of the analytics tools we use has shown that this year we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of people and investors taking an interest in us from abroad.</p><h4>What do you expect in the future M&amp;A market, especially involving foreign players?</h4><p>There is a lot of interest in the financial sector, and we will see interesting developments in the health sector. Again, we have to talk about infrastructure. This is something, at least in the 4G projects, where Colombians have a very important role, as sponsors, especially partnering with international institutions, be these constructors or pension funds. As for the other business segments of the bank, it is still a work in progress. We also see opportunities in developing consumer finance in the country. That is something in which we are seeing a lot of interest. BNP Paribas is an institution that tends to have agreements and joint ventures with other institutions. The Colombian market is excellent for developing consumer finance and bringing best practices to that aspect of banking.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the rest of the year?</h4><p>The end of 2017 will be better than the beginning of the year, but we are not expecting that much growth, probably around two percent. I do expect the low levels of confidence to rise by the year's end. Economically speaking, this is absolutely necessary for us to have growth. The Central Bank has got the message and said they are concerned with growth. That is why they have been cutting down interest rates. The message is there, and everybody is concerned with the way it should end. I do expect a ramp up in the second half of 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As this is the first year of operations for the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, what are the lines that are going to draw your strategy in both areas?</h4><p>Municipal and environmental affairs are closely related. The Ministry of Municipality and Environment wants to beautify our cities, provide services to the population, and oversee land use and urban and infrastructure planning. At the same time, we have to reflect environmental and agricultural considerations in our activities. This means making sure land is used correctly without damaging Qatar's natural resources. We are a tropical desert country, but we have vegetation; Qatar has around 4,000 groves where five different types of trees grow. We need to protect those areas from human activities. Moreover, the environment and green practices are important for keeping the city clean, for example through recycling, building, and industrial waste. Environmental controls for emissions standards and diseases are also under our jurisdiction. We have a laboratory for monitoring emissions from factories, as Qatar is a strong producer of petrochemicals. Therefore, the municipal affairs, along with the environmental, agricultural, and urban development sectors are linked to our duties at the Ministry of Municipality and Environment.</p><h4>One of the focuses in the development of new urban areas is the implementation of smart solutions. What are the Ministry's plans for developing the concept of smart cities across Qatar?</h4><p>Parks should be vibrant places for their surrounding community areas. With this in mind, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment is working on the development of 60 smart public parks. We are installing electronic services, such as free internet access and special smart colored lighting, as well as some of them will even have cinemas. The parks will host festivities, celebrations and social events where families and friends can gather. People will also be able to do sports, as there will be tracks for bicycle, running, and walking. There will also be game areas for children as well as an F&amp;B and shopping offering. Additionally, we have chosen some of the parks to host traditional Qatari houses to preserve our heritage. All in all, the parks will be designed in such a way that they serve the population. In terms of wider smart cities initiatives, we are working on more advanced navigation systems that give information while driving, and there will be more direct information sent by public bodies to individuals about issues affecting daily life.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with private developers on the urban planning of new areas built to cater the demand of the growing population?</h4><p>Besides the residential and commercial areas, there are going to be 20 civic centers within the city of Doha. These quarters will be equipped with gardens, markets, and other public services. They will include residential developments for Qataris and expatriates built around the Metro exits. In addition there are the Msheireb and Al Dafna downtown areas as well as Lusail City. These urban developments will also develop their surrounding areas, but these expansions should keep up with the architectural and landscaping style of the original project to have harmonious quarters. Our inspectors and engineers ensure developers respect the urban plan and the environment, as well as install the facilities that every neighborhood needs. Furthermore, we have the intentions to develop three new cities outside Doha with their own administrative services, industrial areas, schools, hospitals, and other public services. These cities are Al Khor, Al-Shahaniya, and Al Wakrah. We need to take the pressure of Doha's residential and commercial areas; therefore, each new city will have its own downtown area with a different focus. Al Wakrah will be more industrial because it is near the port and the airport. Al Khor will have some sea and land developments and will feature more agricultural projects. Finally, Al-Shahaniya will be connected with livestock activities.</p><h4>What role is the Ministry playing in promoting sustainable and green developments as the country rapidly rolls out new construction and infrastructure projects?</h4><p>The Ministry of Municipality and Environment is responsible for waste management and we intend to create energy from waste. Our target is to have approximately 400MW coming out of waste treatment and recycling. Our other responsibility, together with Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA) and Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), is to allocate land for solar plants to produce 200MW of solar energy. Qatar already has fertilizer-generated energy and we are creating new farms for energy created underground by tree roots. All in all, we are focusing on how Qatar can deal with its waste products through 100% recycling and 100% energy reuse while minimizing its emissions. We are asking companies that come here to operate with zero waste and zero emissions. We are also working on improving our waste collection methods to be underground in the new development quarters. We will be implementing a special collection program that includes advanced sorting of various types of waste products so that it is easier to recycle these materials.</p><h4>How is the Ministry ensuring that Qatar complies with the COP21 Paris agreement?</h4><p>Qatar signed the Paris agreement in 2015, and it was then ratified by the government last year. In Paris we submitted our Climate Action Plan to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have a national program to complement the international agreement, and that will be executed in phases. It is up to the signatory countries to select how they execute the program, with some parts requiring compliance and others that are non-mandatory. Overall, Qatar has chosen to participate intensively in the COP21 program.</p><h4>How is the Ministry contributing to the achievement of food security in Qatar?</h4><p>We have a target for self-sufficiency in food stocks. Qatar has agriculture and currently vegetables account for 40% of our production. The target under our food security program is to see local agricultural production accounting for an 80% by 2022. We also have to increase our livestock from 1.5 million animals to 3 million animals by the same year so that we reduce our reliance on imports by at least half. By 2030 we hope to be almost self-sufficient in food production in Qatar. We would only be reliant on the importation of fruit from and some specialized meats, such as beef and chicken.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>For 2017 we need to clear some waste management areas and turn them into gardens. We also need to empower farmers to produce more organic products and be price competitive. Today local products cost around 60% of the total price of imported products. We have awarded the top three farms in terms of quality, quantity, and diversity of production at the Qatar's International Agricultural Exhibition last March. At the same time, we need to create an awareness program to educate the population and count with their participation for protecting Qatar's natural resources. We have programs to plant trees in order to regenerate our deserts and groves. We are also working to protect our plants and deserts from damage caused by grazing animals, such as cattle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dangote Industries fared in the Zambian market?</h4><p>We began our Zambian operations in July 2015, with Aliko Dangote and the President of Zambia His Excellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu officially opening the company in August 4, 2015. It has been an interesting journey for the company since then, considering the recession that followed not long after we broke ground for the construction of our industrial complex in late 2011. With the currency depreciating, the copper price dipping, and the market shrinking, it was not the easiest time to launch operations. We also learnt that there is a great deal of seasonality in the cement market in Zambia. In the rainy season, for example, cement sales drop dramatically. However, in spite of these setbacks, the Dangote brand was well accepted in the country. Our arrival was hotly anticipated, owing to increased demand in the cement business and certain supply deficits. The product deficit led to upticks in prices and forced people to curb construction on roads and houses. With Dangote's entrance, prices have come down and stabilized. Stability was vital, as it afforded people to opportunity to plan longer-term projects more accurately.</p><h4>Did load shedding impact Dangote's activities in Zambia?</h4><p>While the country experienced severe power shortages, and all the complications that this brought with it, Dangote was extremely fortunate in that we are self-reliant on power. Our industrial complex includes a quarry, where we mine our own limestone, and our own power plant, where we produce 30MW of power, which is actually more than we need resulting in Dangote being in negotiations with power companies to sell some of the excess power into the national grid. Our complex also includes a state-of-the-art cement plant, which has by far the best technology in the country, the transport division and an administration section. Our fleet consists of almost 400 vehicles, which allows us to provide customized logistics solutions for the consumer, another way in which we differentiate ourselves from other offerings on the market. We generally take this holistic approach to setting up business in the country. Dangote superior quality plants result in the best quality cement for the consumer.</p><h4>What opportunities does Zambia present for Dangote, and how have you tailored your products to meet these?</h4><p>When we entered the market, we did so with two types of products: Dangote 3X the 42.5R, our standard product that can be found everywhere we operate, and a 32.5 R product. In 2017, we then added a 32.5 N product, looking to serve the growing demand in the road and home construction segments. Zambia also presents us with another key opportunity, which is the potential for export, with its eight bordering countries, many of which are not yet not self-sufficient in terms of in-house cement production. Secondly, cement prices in these neighboring countries are higher, which means that, even with transport costs, our prices are competitive. The problems we face include instability in terms of legislation, for example, in countries like the DRC, as well as competition from well-established brands.</p><h4>What is the current capacity of the plant?</h4><p>The capacity of our plant is 1.5 million tons. We are currently operating below that, due to dampened supply following the recession and the rainy season. At peak months, however, we reach 80-90% of our capacity. Looking at the market we see that the overall cement production capacity in the country stands at 3.4 million tons, and we estimate that market demand in the country is about 1.5 million tons. Further capacity expansion will be driven by increased demand from the local market.</p><h4>What advances have you made in transport?</h4><p>We are working hard to ensure the utmost safety precautions are being taken in our transport division. We have put tracking systems in place, hired more trainers, and have seen a significant improvement in our drivers' behavior. At the same time, the road infrastructure of Zambia is difficult to negotiate, to say the least. There is a great deal of development needed. The building of new roads connecting parts of the country will surely increase commerce. The government is considering introducing a statutory instrument for heavy goods forcing companies to move 35% of certain heavy cargo onto rail. This is an extremely sensible initiative in terms of protecting road infrastructure from continuous damage; however, at the time Zambia lacks the rail infrastructure for the 35% target to be achievable. At the moment, there are rail tracks linking Ndola in the north to Livingstone in the south, and a little of the east up to Nakonde, but that is all. The intention is great; however, the implementation requires refinement. The government should start at 5% and then slowly increase this, eventually reaching the 35% target as the rail infrastructure and rail efficiency improves.</p><h4>What are Dangote's ambitions in Zambia for the medium term?</h4><p>We want to make our debut in the bulk market here, where currently we have a low profile, and are securing investments in order to effectively participate in this segment by May 2017. We already have the product—our cement services high-end construction such as dams, airports and so on—although at the moment we only supply in limited quantities. In the medium-term, though our focus will be on market penetration. We are only 20 months in the Zambian market, and we still need to raise awareness about our presence, and familiarize customers with our products. There is some user education required, which will be another of our key areas of concentration which also extends into learning and development and skills transfer of Dangote employees and partners. Finally, we want to use Zambia as a starting point to explore other areas in the region, such as Malawi and the DRC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Constructive Criticism]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[roberto-forte-taylor-director-panama-green-building-council]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Panama received the PGBC, and how are you instilling awareness regarding the importance of minimizing environmental impact in the construction sector?</h4><p>PGBC is one of the top five largest green building organizations in Latin America. As we grow, so does our influence and ability to spread awareness. We are part of the World Green Building Council (WGBC), an umbrella organization for all green building councils. In 2009, we contacted the WGBC and informed them of our intention to register the council. Ever since then, we have been escalating our level of involvement and the size of our operations. There are three[RF1]  different levels of association one can attain with the World Green Building Council: prospective[RF2] , emerging, and established status. Countries such as Australia, Canada, the US, and Italy are all established members. In 2015, less than 30 countries had attained established status. After[RF3]  years of making strong gains, Panama officially received its established status. Our growth over the last five years has been substantial, and the larger we get and the more global recognition we receive, the more influence we can have with builders here. As an organization we have physically grown as well, going from a 14sqm to a 105sqm office. We also have an extensive showroom highlighting different sustainable construction methods inside our office. We have over 135 members, most of which are architectural firms, construction contractors, and supply distributors. Some 30-35 of our members are individuals or institutions.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on some of the new green building standards the PGBC is promoting?</h4><p>The construction industry is trying to establish[RF4]  itself as the second largest contributor to Panama's GDP; hence, any standards we can get universally adopted would have a major impact. In 2016, the construction industry grew, accounting for 14.8% of GDP in Panama. Simultaneously, sustainable construction projects grew. We currently have 30 projects officially certified with the LEED green building standard, which is still the most widely used standard in the world. We also have 80-85 projects in the certification pipeline, which puts us in second place in terms of green building certifications in all of Central America. Only Costa Rica has more. In 2012, the PGBC executive managers were in San Francisco for the Greenbuild Conference, the largest sustainable construction conference in the world. While there, we met with the IFC, and they were promoting a green code and certification to be applied to the energy sector, which is exactly what we need in Panama. Though they were looking at larger global markets, we really pushed to have the standards introduced here. Now, four years later, we have the first Green Building Code. In July we partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council  to organize the LEED Technical Meeting for the Latin American Region. Being Panama at that moment the 4th country in the world after Singapore, Mexico and Germany that carried out this activity. We had the participation of 52 LEED professionals from the entire region, 11 countries represented and 26 companies. For these results we received an honorable mention during the "LEED International Roundtable" held in October in Los Angeles. We are also partnering with IFC to promote de EDGE Certification. Everyone is really working together to get the word out about green building, its benefits and its codes and standards.</p><h4>How are other Panamanian organizations supporting green building activities?</h4><p>We work with many outside organizations whose missions are similar to ours. We know, for example, which groups or firms have experience with LEED and can therefore consult on projects. The biggest project we have at the moment is putting together a comprehensive eco-protocol for the municipality of panama. The sustainable construction guide put together by the National Secretary of Energy and the IFC focuses mainly focus on energy efficiency, but the Eco Protocol will include six or seven distinct efficiency and sustainability categories, including water efficiency, interior air quality, energy efficiency, and green procurement, to name a few. We want to use this protocol to establish the most holistic local certification we can, and we are currently working to implement them on a municipal level. We are working with the mayor and vice-mayor of Panama City right now, and once the Eco protocol is established there, we hope to implement it in other major urban areas. Additionally, once we have clearly established the technical requirements of the eco-protocol, we plan on proposing to the Ministry of Environment that they use our protocol as a best practices guide for the entire nation. There has also been some discussion of streamlining the permitting process for projects using green techniques and following our eco-protocol. This will further incentivize companies to choose green projects and use sustainable techniques. This is the most tangible intra-organizational synergy we are working on right now.</p><h4>How do you plan on reducing the environmental impact of the industrial sector in Panama?</h4><p>The industrial sector is relatively small in Panama; however, there has already been some movement toward more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. Energy and water efficiency have been the sector's most important focuses, because they represent fairly large outlay categories. They want their operations to run as efficiently as possible, and many of their efforts have been seeing great results. Recently, the National Secretary of Energy announced the recipients of its energy efficiency awards, and industrial firms continue to perform well. As social responsibility has become more and more important in Panama's business culture, the sector has made great strides to bring its operations in line with contemporary standards and expectations.</p><h4>What kinds of companies decide to become members of the council?</h4><p>Some 37% of our members are engineering and architectural firms, most of which are local. While 29% are product distributors that represent a mix of large multinational and local firms. Interestingly, the companies that seem most interested in being members of the council are lighting providers and paint providers. Solar panel firms are also becoming more and more popular, and we currently have three member companies that are solar panel providers. Construction and project promoters also make up a fairly large proportion of our membership, and they include local and international firms. New companies are also usually interested in joining the council because they see it as a way of making a competitive differentiation in the market.</p><h4>What are your main targets, goals, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The most important goal is completing the eco-protocol, which will serve as the guiding light and technical foundation for creating a new green Panama. The clear elucidation of expectations and incentives is so important, and this document promises to deliver on both fronts. We can begin making transformative changes to the economy and the environment of Panama using this as our guide. We also want to see substantial improvement in the efficiency of residential construction, because this area is a key part of ensuring the greening of Panama. We want to reverse the trend of growing urban sprawl, and replace it with more sustainable city design as well as more efficient housing. Another key project is establishing baseline consumption statistics so builders, consumers, and governmental officials have a clear idea of where the Panamanian market is in terms of efficiency and consumption. This will allow companies to more effectively design and market their products and will allow consumers to make informed product decisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives have been undertaken by the Ministry of Education to encourage PPPs and promote other investments in the education sector?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education aims to achieve eight strategic goals within its plan in the National Transformation Program 2020 through the implementation of 36 qualitative initiatives worth more than SAR28 billion. As a result, public and private education will jump towards the forefront in the next three years. The strategic objectives of the Ministry of Education are to provide educational opportunities for all segments of the society, to expand kindergarten and nursery programs, adult education, and special education because of its importance in completing the education system for all segments of the society. Following this, the ministry moves towards the teachers by improving the opportunities to attract them and develop their skills and abilities. In addition, a learning environment that stimulates creativity and innovation will be created, including the support of universities by providing opportunities for students and faculty members to present their thoughts and innovations, patenting their inventions, and nurturing the gifted and the talented amongst them.</p><h4>How can the ministry contribute to achieving the goals of Vision 2030?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education contributes greatly to providing an environment capable of enhancing students' personal skills and their abilities to adapt to the labor market and its requirements. A basic group of skills and competencies will be created and included in school activities and curricula, and at the same time we will improve teaching methods and evaluation of students and thus achieve the compatibility between education programs and labor market needs. We see to restructure the education sector, formulating a modern system of regulations, instructions, and executive rules governing the development of curricula and the enrollment of teachers in educational institutions, organizing the process of educational supervision, increasing the effectiveness of development and vocational training on an ongoing basis, raising the efficiency of the operational performance, reducing the cost of waste, and making maximum use of human potential, resources, equipment, and buildings.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Education support the use of technology and digitization of education in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have signed an agreement with a specialized company in the field of technology worth of SAR1.6 billion to produce special devices for Saudi schools at competitive prices and specifications that correspond to the nature of the Saudi education system until 2020. The new educational system will be launched in 150 Saudi schools in mid of 2018 and the number of e-learning schools will be increasing to 1,500 at the end of that year. In 1996, Saudi Arabia launched the Comprehensive Curriculum Development Project to develop the educational process in all its dimensions and elements, reviewing and evaluating the curriculum and the extent of its relevance to the educational development in the world. We have been able to achieve three dimensions of the main shift to the digital world by creating an electronic platform containing the digital integrated content of all curricula, as well as reducing the use of paper books, providing computers for students as an educational tool, and training and qualifying teachers to use modern technical methods.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future of the education sector in Saudi Arabia in 2017?</h4><p>We are working to achieve an ambitious national strategy and plan whose features are evident with the formation of the task teams in all governmental institutions to activate the initiatives of each authority according to a specific time plan. The future of education is directed to achieve the most important aspects of the educational side stipulated in Vision 2030, including involving 80% of families in school activities by the year 2020, providing training programs for teachers and qualifying them to achieve effective communication with parents, and raise awareness of the importance of their participation, and cooperating with the private sector and the non-profit sector in providing more innovative programs and events to enhance and promote the educational partnership, among other goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important highlights of the past five years for Mexichem?</h4><p>The company has grown tremendously; 13 years ago our revenue was USD200 million and now it is USD5.4 billion; we were in two countries and now we are in 37. We have been creating a global company, process-, talent-, and cultural-wise, while also creating a single company from a group of companies that we acquired. A second highlight is the transformation of our product line; we have focused on growing what we call the downstream. People know Mexichem as a chemical company; over 50% of our revenues are products that are sold downstream in hardware stores and construction companies. Five years ago, this was a much smaller portion of our revenue and we have been growing in this area. Finally, as a chemical producer, we want to be the most cost efficient and have been building a plant in Texas, the largest investment in our history. After four years of construction it recently began operations, making Mexichem one of the most cost efficient PVC producers in the world.</p><h4>What has the transition from being a Mexican company to a global company been?</h4><p>That is a difficult process. Today, 85% of our employees speak English, but when I joined the company the majority could not. We have had to do a significant upgrade on the management team, and we now have a great and global team. It was not an easy transition because people have a way of anchoring themselves to their own culture and not being open enough to understand other cultures. 50% of Mexichem is owned by a family and the DNA of that family is disciplined growth; we all believe disciplined growth has to be a part of the equation for a successful company. A company that only looks at Mexico as its key market is limiting its growth. Our products are made predominantly for developing countries, for places where the infrastructure and water management is not there, where housing is missing, and those places are normally far away and are not Mexico.</p><h4>What response has Mexichem received abroad as a Mexican company?</h4><p>The response has been mixed. The first large company we bought in Europe was a public company in the Netherlands in 2012. There was a cultural encounter which forced us to be better than other companies. We have worked a great deal on the way we do business; we publish our code of ethics on our website, we have moved a great deal on the government side of the company, we publish our results in dollars, we report to the Mexican Stock Exchange in dollars, and we manage the company like any other multinational company. We base our results on three pillars: financial, environmental, and social. We have a significant sustainability program, we are in the Mexican Stock Exchange Sustainability Index, and we were just listed on the London Emerging Market Sustainability Index. This is a way of changing the perception of Mexican companies doing business abroad.</p><h4>Are you concerned with relations between Mexico and the US?</h4><p>Mexico has operated with the one assumption over the last 30 years that the integration in North America would only get stronger and that we have complementary economies. Now, with the current situation, that single assumption might not be right or will change depending on who runs the respective countries. However, at the end of the day, common sense will prevail; we will come out of it and things will improve in NAFTA. We are more interested in tax reforms because we have a large presence in the US, larger than in Mexico.</p><h4>What are the most interesting growth areas in terms of your actual product portfolio and how do those fit geographically?</h4><p>The US is an important country in which we want to continue to grow; even though we are large, we are still underrepresented in certain product lines. Asia and India are also interesting locations. Latin America will always be key for us and we have to expand our product line there. Mexichem has platforms for growth: I see the 37 countries as platforms and am excited to grow in those countries where we already have a presence and infrastructure and they use that infrastructure to leverage the rest of the product lines.</p><h4>What are the values of Mexichem?</h4><p>We want to do what we do the right way. In the past years we have strengthen our Corporate Governance. The orientation toward results is another one that is in the DNA of the company. We are by far one of the most aggressive companies in terms of results and performance orientated to compensation. Our investors demand and require a management team that is focused on results. In addition, our commitment to our employees and communities are important values for us.</p><h4>How important are environmental issues in your operations?</h4><p>The environment is part of the code of ethics. We have to take care of the environment and we working every day to measure and reduce our carbon footprint. We have to do a standardized measure and are now implementing a system globally to measure it. There is zero flexibility for that. Chemical plants have bad reputations on these matters; however, the reality is that chemical plants have become environmental friendly. We are one the largest recyclers of pipes in Europe and one of the largest users of recycled PVC in Europe; in Latin America and the US it is not as popular yet but we are moving in that direction. We have a team of people focused on the environment and sustainability globally.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>We expect our cash flow to increase this year and our results to be positive this year. We told the market we would grow in terms of reported EBITDA between 10% and 20% in USD in 2017. Our big goals are to grow our profitability and increase our returns. Finally, I want to continue this integration of the company, finish out the creation of a single culture, and also grow through acquisitions.</p><h4>Why is Mexichem a good company to invest in?</h4><p>We have a first-class family that controls the company and the company is managed by professional people who are accountable for results and responsible for operations. Our global footprint allows us to have a strong network around the world and our strong company values.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Health is a crucial piece of the national transformation plan. It also has specific goals stated within the NTP. Have those goals changed the strategy of the group or influenced it in any way?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a giant that has been sleeping. In the past, it was kind and generous to everyone, but not particularly productive. Now the country will start to produce. The reforms imply that people will have to give, and not just take. This shift in policy has provoked a shockwave to the system. Imagine a budget of USD250 billion a year that was spent as if it was the duty of the government to spend it. Now, it is being invested in infrastructure and change through the private sector. For example, the Ministry of Health budget of around USD28 billion is going to be spent through the private sector by creating partnerships, outsourcing services, and selling assets or interest in them. Why the private sector? The government cannot make decisions at the speed the private sector can, nor can it run operations as efficiently. Government policy is also working to shift more of the responsibility for the country's growth to the private sector. This means it will use the private sector to efficiently spend on services and economic stimulation. This is the whole idea of privatization. When it comes to health, there have been a series of significant announcements about the structure of the healthcare sector recently. For one, from now on everyone will have a digital health profile that can be accessed by all care providers, and that system will be accompanied by a billing system that will prioritize quality of care in the way that providers are paid. Saudis will still be treated free of charge because it is the government's duty to treat them free of charge, but it will be done through the private sector and in a way that is highly structured. By spending through the private sector, the government's budget will go much further, and the economy will grow and employ more people.</p><h4>Would Middle East Healthcare be interested in participating in the privatizations and partnerships in the health sector that are being discussed today?</h4><p>It depends on the tender. When tenders come out it will definitely be an opportunity because the government will guarantee some off take by the provider. So, if your operations are in order it should be a solid proposition. For example, the tenders may propose that a private firm take a hospital, operate it, and guarantee a number of patients every year at a high level of service. It will allot some of the 20 million Saudis to these hospitals and pay for them through a national insurance scheme that relies on the infrastructure I mentioned; that means the hospitals will treat Saudis, but the government will pay for it. We are much more efficient than the government, and could deliver a high level of service as well as control costs considerably from what government care centers spend today. From what I have seen, we are already lower cost even though we are considered one of the best places to go for care in the region.</p><h4>What made you decide to risk the market and go for an IPO in 2016, even though the market had seen a downturn? The decision now looks to have been on good footing judging by your share price.</h4><p>That was one of the most difficult decisions I have taken in my life. If it had failed, it would have been a disaster. I hired a team of financial advisors, and they said go for it. In the end it was as simple as that. The beauty of that was that they said go, and then the stock exchange dropped 7 points the next day. Because of the fluctuation they said wait, so we backed out and waited for one month. Then we went back in, and it was a success. It was not my genius—it was being part of a team. In this part of the world a family business that does not go to IPO will be dissolved within 25-50 years, mostly due to conflicts within the family. I believe the only way to secure safe and fair exit is through IPO. The capital markets are the future, as is public ownership. This has been a landmark for us, and it gives the business a sustainable future. We are increasing our investments; our name is better known, we are expanding, and the opportunities available to us have increased. We are investing the capital raised from the IPO in new projects, primarily building more hospitals in Saudi Arabia and increasing our market share.</p><h4>You also have medical colleges now. What is the future of that line of business?</h4><p>We have the largest private-sector medical school in the country. We are building four more. We are also developing what we call medical cities, which are large complexes that have a medical college, a large hospital, and hospital for the poor. Recently, I came up with the idea of leveraging private-sector knowledge to this cause. This is essentially a charity—a hospital for the poor—that leverages the private sector to close the gap between the rich and poor's access to healthcare by leveraging private-sector knowledge to reduce cost. This means, for example, our group has knowledge and a brand name; people know us, which makes them want to help and work with us for a good cause, like helping people in need. I have arranged with landowners, medical suppliers, and doctors to donate their time, energy, products, or money toward a hospital dedicated to treating the poor in Mecca. Soon, this project will be operational.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>It will be a challenging year. The government is introducing a lot of new rules, and society is starting to feel the strain. The Saudi population needs to learn how to walk; it has become too used to being carried by the government. This is a natural and necessary step forward. However, despite the so-called crisis, the Saudi economy is strong and resilient. In addition, healthcare and education are resilient industries and we take part in both; we are in a people-oriented industry. To finish with an idea that started this conversation, Saudi Arabia is a great and flourishing country, a giant of the region, and I want to be able to help the development of my country and my people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What dimension can Es'hailSat give to the economic diversification of Qatar?</h4><p>Es'hailSat was created in 2010 purely for strategic objectives. At that time, the government of Qatar thought of creating an independent satellite operator to serve Al Jazeera Media Network's needs, which was using the capacity of other regional players. Having our own operator means that our satellite operations would not be influenced by foreign political decisions and we could cater to the demands of the country's broadcasters. I quickly realized the huge commercial impact this decision would have. We bought an orbit slot and created a new satellite to compete for the MENA region with other players like Arabsat. We found a good partner in Eutelsat, the European satellite company, which helped us with the first satellite to enter into commercial service in 2013, Es'hail-1. During this time, we have built a satellite industry in Qatar and we now have the vision to become a global satellite operator and services provider.</p><h4>How is Es'hail-2 going to help you expand your reach?</h4><p>Es'hail-2 will still cover the MENA region, as it will be located in the same orbital slot as Es'hail-1. However, Es'hail-2 comes with advanced technology to make sure that nothing can disrupt the service that is provided through the satellite. The strategy behind launching a second satellite is that we will use Es'hail-1 for broadcast and military purposes and Es'hail-2 will add new communication services. Broadcasters are nowadays looking for high density with zero disruption, which is what Es'hail-2 will be providing. Their capacity will be utilized by any broadcaster interested in transmitting in the MENA region. We will expand our services in two ways. On one side, we will adapt our expansion plans to the needs of the Qatari telecommunications companies. For example, in 2016 beIN Sports acquired Digiturk and is interested in expanding into the Turkish market. Following this line, last February we signed an agreement with Total TR Medya to exclusively represent Es'hailSat and market our services in Turkey. On the other side, satellites have a limited lifespan. Therefore, we will look at the markets where satellites are at the end of their life and we will raise funds to launch a new satellite to cater to the needs of the operators. In this regard we are looking at the Asian market in countries such as Indonesia, where Ooredoo has substantial business. As we cannot build satellites all over the world, we will also enter into partnerships with existing satellite operators to cover other regions. We have a good relationship with Eutelsat and SAS, the world's largest satellite operators, and we can provide services to companies like Qatar Airways to provide entertainment on all their planes.</p><h4>How could the potential of the IT sector in Qatar be unleashed?</h4><p>I believe that economic diversification is only viable through technology. As we diversify our economy we need to expand our market scope, and technology allows us to reach the whole MENA region. When I worked in the ICT sector I realized the importance of creating small local companies instead of hiring the best system integrators in the world. Those sophisticated systems are expensive to maintain, so in 2008 we invested USD8 million in creating Malomatia, which started with around 10 employees. Now Malomatia has around 650 employees and it is going through an IPO with a high value. Rather than buying another company, its growth was organic, and all its 650 employees are talented and skillful Qataris. This has impacted many economic sectors, such as health or education. It has tied in with leading international players to develop new products, such as with a Singaporean company for customs services. Although it started as a small company, it is now targeting the region. This is where I see diversification happening. The government should only interfere in the market when there is a shortage, but with cases like Malomatia it can leave the control to the private sector. The base for growth will come from having a competitive environment favored by the right regulation. I have been working with a lot of startups all my life and this gives me energy for the future. They do not only need the funding but also the right support strategically and technically. I am currently focusing on health and how technology can help to provide better healthcare.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We agreed on specific targets. Although the manufacturer was delayed in handing over Es'hail-2, we have started working on specific projects to expand our services internationally. While we wait to cover the MENA region with Es'hail-2, the company is building its footprint internationally. Furthermore, in 2016 we started the construction of our teleport, which will be operational in the second half of 2017. This facility will support the control and capacity management for Es'hailSat satellites and will benefit MENA broadcasters. In three years from now we will be operating in Asia with Indosat and present in Turkey. These are the main areas of focus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent split from GACA affected your organization and its operations?</h4><p>The country is moving further toward corporatization and privatization, and it is seeks to do so with as many entities as possible. The government wants to see a dramatic increase in performance and service quality in all areas. The idea is to develop financially independent, sustainable companies that provide high-quality services to stakeholders across Saudi Arabia. Our main customers are the airlines flying over Saudi airspace or transiting through the country. The split from GACA has empowered us to become a leaner and more efficient company. We now collect our air navigation charges from airlines sooner, ensure we provide a better service, and have catalyzed a company-wide improvement in all areas of our operations with safety as our top priority. A consultancy firm assisted us with this process and helped us develop and implement new policies and procedures for all the different departments. Now, we focus more on our human capital and changing the culture and mindset of our people. We used to operate as a government-owned entity and now need to make sure all our employees work with a new private-industry mindset. We have put in place a new performance management framework to ensure everyone in the company hierarchy has key performance indicators and targets. We want them to know exactly what their responsibilities are so they can achieve their specific objectives, thereby achieving the vision and the mission of the company.</p><h4>What will be the specific operational changes facing Saudi Air Navigation Services Company moving forward?</h4><p>SANS will continue its duties to offer users of Saudi airspace with all the required services at the highest quality standards to navigate safely during their flight operations. As traffic grows quickly in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia takes a great portion of the regional traffic. Therefore, SANS is planning to redesign the airspace structure to increase the capacity and improve the efficiency.  This effort will include heavy investment in the empty quarter area serving thousands of future flights crossing Saudi Arabia. We will also coordinate with the neighboring ANSPs to ensure strong relationship specially in with GCC countries. We will be working together to ensure strong quality of services across the region. One of the promising project that is still under discussion is developing a unified upper FIR between GCC countries. This kind of collaboration will help smooth the regional and international flow of the traffic. Furthermore, SANS will support the development plan of the Saudi airports. We will raise our presence in local airports adding more tower and approach services. We will increase working hours in the growing airport such as Hail, Yanbu, and Al-Ahssa to meet traffic demand.</p><h4>How do you plan to fund some of these new initiatives, and how quickly do you plan to become fiscally independent from the government?</h4><p>Moving forward, we have to fund every project ourselves. We have even funded a number of smaller projects we began a few months ago. We have a number of strategies to raise capital. Air Navigation's global strategy is based on cost recovery. This means we are allowed to cover our cost plus a small margin of around 10%, and to be used for developments and upgrades. We have made certain agreements with local banks in the event we need extra funds for special projects. The other option in case of major capital investment would be through increasing tariffs. Moreover, there are several initiatives aiming at cost optimization and also increasing non-aeronautical revenues.</p><h4>What impact will the expansion of airport infrastructure have on the industry in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have a close relationship with all the airports in the country. Every month we generate traffic volume projections because we need to ensure we have enough controllers, engineers, and technicians to cope with the traffic. In order to cope with traffic growth, we seek to optimize airspace restructuring to ensure that traffic moves as efficiently as possible. We expect it will take some time to scale up once the new airport plans are completed. We have to provide all the new systems for any new airport plan, and sometimes even newer systems are required to optimize the airports operations. We coordinate closely with airports all across the country to ensure that our strategies are aligned. We want to implement new systems and operate on a timely basis so we can serve these airports better.</p><h4>How did Air Navigation achieve its rate of Saudization, and what lessons can be learned from your experience by the rest of the economy?</h4><p>The company is more than 90% Saudis while the air traffic controllers are 100% Saudis. This was achieved by developing and implementing a solid recruiting plan. In the past we recruited directly from high schools; however, in the last one or two years we have established a fast-track program. In this program we take students with good English that meet a certain level and enroll them straight in the ATC program. By ensuring that we have strict selection criteria for controllers, which is a job that requires a special mindset and aptitude, we have had a higher success rate. In engineering and maintenance, we still have some expats to help, but the majority of the workers are Saudis. We maintain this by enrolling them in a high-quality training program. By having a strong career training program in place, we have managed to make great strides in Saudizing this sector. We are considering recruiting female staff as well, and this could happen soon. Part of the 2030 vision calls for involving women in the economy to a much larger degree and we seek to play a part in this.</p><h4>What does the year ahead look like for Air Navigation?</h4><p>We are very optimistic about 2017 and have ambitious programs in the pipeline. We have to ensure that the culture of the company is more private-sector oriented. The entire corporate mindset needs to be changed. We need to ensure that our employees recognize that the company will operate differently as a private entity, and we want this recognition to change their behavior. We have set up a new unit called customer relations management, and this unit will take care of all the complaints and suggestions from our customer and stakeholders. We will also hold periodic (twice or three times annually) meetings with the airlines to know what their expectations and needs are, and on top of that we will work to improve safety to the highest levels. This is a unique year for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you improving the quality of life in Panama?</h4><p>One of our main objectives here in Panama is to help Panamanians participate in sustainable growth. We are doing this by partnering with countries with leading public policy agendas. Working with them, we try to lay the foundation for inclusiveness and sustainable growth. With the Varela administration, we are trying to help them design a better education system and improve access to social services. Health and education ministries do not have services in remote areas where demand for social services is low because of the circle of poverty. They would rather put their children to work or stay at home than keep them in school. The policy of social protection is important because what you are trying to do is develop instruments that allow poor people to have the incentives and access to social services to develop their human capital. This is why we have the cash transfers program.  </p><h4>Why is it so hard in such a small country to divide the wealth more equitably?</h4><p>The problem is not about using the rent from the Panama Canal or redistributing taxes; rather, it is that, institutionally, Panama is weak in many sectors, especially the social ones. If you do not develop human capital in these areas, people will not be productive or participate in economic growth. This is a major challenge because usually the institutions are bureaucratic and centralized and social expenditure is captured by the bureaucracy, whether is the health or education department. The main challenge—and this happens all across Latin America—is how to develop efficient institutions that provide services and give enough incentives.</p><h4>What is the IADB's vision for boosting a balanced growth in the Panamanian logistics sector?</h4><p>We are trying to help the government develop a logistics strategy with all the various actors because logistics as a means of development is not an end in itself. With the expansion of the canal and its strategic geographic location, the country is well positioned to play a larger role in the global logistics game. What it needs right now is to make the political decision to make the needed investments in ports and the airport. You first need to say what kind of economic activities you are going to develop in order to use that logistics capacity you have developed. We are working with the government under the leadership of Minister Aleman to launch the logistics development strategy.</p><h4>What other segments have the potential to contribute to the growth of the economy?</h4><p>Growth here still has to do with public investment, which continues to play an important role. Investment in the metro and the construction of new bridges will both be big boons. The challenge that Panama is facing is that our advantage in the financial sector is being threatened by all the transparency problems. If they follow up on and implement some of the recommendations of the commission, they will be able to convert this challenge into an opportunity.</p><h4>Is the government making adequate efforts to distribute wealth across the entire country?</h4><p>There is an important effort to decentralize more investment. This is clear in the social sector, particularly education and health, and some of the investments in infrastructure. The problem is that they are doing that part with a growth strategy. One of the other areas that Panama has a lot of potential to grow, but lacks a good strategy, is tourism. It is about how to connect the dots. We should be investing in Boca and doing the waste management, roads, and electricity; it is not a huge amount of money.</p><h4>What should be done to boost the inclusion of women in Panamanian society?</h4><p>One of the main issues that Panama must address is early pregnancy, particularly in adolescents. This is a major problem not only in Panama, but in the Dominican Republic and the rest of Central America. The opportunities for young women with children are low. This gets politicized and enters the ideologies and the church, but it is still a pending issue. We have been working with some of the main actors in society to try and generate a culture in which the women take a more active leadership role.</p><h4>What are your main ambitions, goals, and targets for 2017?</h4><p>We want to innovate Panama's growth agenda of Panama while still being more efficient and effective. One of the forgotten areas for growth potential is the orange economy; this is why we want to boost investments to establish Panama as a cultural center with a rich past. We are trying to develop a program with INAC in which we hope to reopen the theatre in the city center, the History Museum, and launch a film festival.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[margaret-mwanakatwe-minister-commerce-trade-industry-zambia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the meetings in Egypt recently regarding the Tripartite FTA?</h4><p>The launch of the TFTA and the signing of the TFTA Agreement signify an important political milestone towards the establishment and operation of a fully-fledged Free Trade Area. It represents free movement of goods and services from Cape to Cairo, bringing together a market of over 625 million people, living in one of the fastest growth areas of the world with a booming middle class in 26 countries and a combined GDP of USD1.3 trillion, about 60% of the African Continent's GDP. For Zambia, the TFTA represents a significant market for Zambian goods and services once effectively exploited. Total merchandise exports by TFTA members was USD145 billion and merchandise imports of USD211 billion as of 2014. This is a massive market for our finished and semi-processed goods and gives us the market access to our producers, who are struggling to secure a share in developed markets due to Non-Tariff Barriers. The establishment of the Tripartite Free Trade Area will undoubtedly boost trade among the participating countries as a result of market expansion and contribute to the African Union Agenda of boosting intra-Africa Trade.</p><h4>What is the status of the 11 bills presented to parliament to consolidate private sector participation?</h4><p>The eleven bills represent my ministry's aggressive agenda to reform the business environment. The bills relate to strengthening intellectual property rights, trade facilitation, re-engineering of the national quality infrastructure; aligning company law to international best practices and expanding access to finance for micro, small, and medium enterprises. The bills are at different stages in the legislative process. Most of these bills have been approved by cabinet and are now undergoing legislative drafting.</p><h4>How do you expect the international trade to evolve in Zambia in the next five years?</h4><p>The evolution of Zambia's trade in next five years will be dictated by regional integration. The phase II negotiations under the Tripartite FTA framework and the Continental Free Trade Area negotiations will change the trade arena in Africa. Zambia needs to position herself to capitalize on this expanded market. If we don't position our industry to become a key regional player, we will be faced with high levels of imports into our country, which can lead to the death of local industry. We are confident that our experiences with COMESA and SADC FTAs have made us stronger. At the international level, the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union and the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement present new challenges we must be prepared for even as we consolidate ourselves as a middle-income country.</p><h4>What incentives should be provided to move small entrepreneurs into the formal market?</h4><p>One of the key drivers of business informality is the high cost of doing business. When the procedures for starting a business and the licenses are expensive with tedious procedures, entrepreneurs avoid that cost by operating informally. This is why the Private Sector Development Reform Program is an important national priority. The measures to reduce the cost of doing business are bearing fruit as registration of SMEs at the Patents and Companies Registration Agency has grown substantially. Local authorities are now implementing single licensing systems to make it cheaper and more effective to formalize small businesses. We have now put in place a Business Regulatory Act and institutional framework that will mainstream tools such as Regulatory Impact Assessment into our policy-making systems. We will also be expanding the use of Regulatory Services Centers or One Stop Shops for business registration in all provinces and e-Platforms for business licensing across all regulatory agencies. As we make it easier and cheaper to operate in the formal sector, more small businesses will formalize.</p><h4>What are the comparative advantages of Zambia over neighboring countries and why should an investor choose Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia's comparative advantages lie primarily in its abundant resources. It has vast land, 752,614 sqkm, with a population of approximately 15 million people, with over 70% of the population below the age of 40. We have vast natural resources in terms of minerals, tourist sites, water, and land for agriculture. The country has had a stable economy with growth averaging 6% over the last decade, stable inflation averaging 7% over the last five years as well as a stable political and social environment since the country gained independence in 1964. In terms of doing business, we are ranked 5th in Sub Saharan Africa and 3rd among the SADC Countries, 4th in COMESA and 8th in the whole of Africa, pointing to the attractiveness of our business environment over most of our neighbors. We share borders with eight Countries making us landlocked. The country's central location in the region gives it a competitive market. Zambia has no controls on prices, interest rates, foreign exchange transactions, free repatriation of earnings and repayments as well as security and guarantees of full and fair compensation for investors. The country has banking, financial, legal and insurance services meeting international standard as well as a Stock Exchange. Investors can join other major corporations such as Barclays, Standard Chartered, Lafarge, Vedanta, and Barrick Gold who now call Zambia home.</p><h4>What industries hold the biggest potential for investment in Zambia?</h4><p>We have investment opportunities in the agricultural, energy, mining, manufacturing, and tourism sectors. These sectors have been prioritized by the government for wealth and job creation. In the agriculture sector, our potential lies in the cultivation of bananas, pineapples, tea, beans, rice, maize, wheat, oilseeds, coffee, cotton, tobacco, sugar, bio fuels, and livestock. Other key areas are the aquaculture subsector and the export of vegetables and flowers. Zambia has about 40% of the total water resources of the Southern African Region with the potential for 5,000MW of hydro-electricity generation. We also have proven coal reserves exceeding 30 million tons.  In tourism, investment opportunities include natural sites and wild life. We have abundant minerals such as copper and gemstones. The vast agricultural and mining potential provides raw materials for value addition.</p><h4>How do you describe the evolution of Multi-Facility Zones (MFEZs) and their role in achieving the three objectives of the Triangle of Hope?</h4><p>The main objective of the Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZ) program in Zambia is to catalyze industrial and economic development through increased activity in the manufacturing sector with value addition to the numerous natural and agricultural raw materials present. The zones are designed to provide a superior industrial and business platform. To date three MFEZs have been established and operationalized. These are the Chambishi MFEZ on the Copperbelt, the Lusaka East and Lusaka South MFEZ's in Lusaka. The Chambishi and Lusaka East MFEZs are privately developed, while the Lusaka MFEZ is publicly owned. Over USD1.5 billion has been invested in MFEZs by developers and enterprises operating in the MFEZs and in excess of 9,000 jobs have been created. More MFEZs are to be established. These include an MFEZ in Maamba in Southern Province, Kalumbila, and Lumwana in North-Western Province and Chembe in Luapula Province.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudi power generation market has seen rapid change this year, and looks set for a serious shift in terms of renewable energy, billing, distribution, and pretty much everything else. Where do you stand as arguably the Kingdom's best-established power developer?</h4><p>Half of our investments are in Saudi Arabia and the other half are abroad; the revenues also match this 50-50 split. Over the last four to five years, the level of private-sector participation in the Kingdom in power generation and desalinated water production sectors did not grow as compared to previous years. We thus ended up pursuing more opportunities outside the Kingdom and have built up our external capacity. But yes of course a big change is now expected in the Kingdom. In 2016, we saw a clear vision being set out in the form of Vision 2030 and this then quickly followed through by a 2020 transition plan, and what is exciting is that this is a well thought through detailed plan with a lot definition of key deliverables. Here in the Kingdom we have at least identified the problems, the issues we need to address, set out clear and measurable targets, which then allows the government to monitor progress, keep reviewing the plan itself and refine and reset the path as required. In 2016 not only all that hard work was done, but also the government then went on to reorganize itself, realign the ministries, departments and agencies and brought in many new people all focused at creating the supportive enabling environment and culture to efficiently deliver that vision.</p><h4>What is the Sukuk coming this month, and will it help power these opportunities in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>From the day we were founded we have been working to a plan on how we should steadily grow and how we optimally finance that growth. At this stage of our evolution, we are investing typically USD600-700 million of new capital every year. Given that we lead all projects we pursue and thus take a meaningful level of the equity share, typically at a 40% share in each project and thus with co-investors we bring along an additional USD1.2 billion and with these projects financed on a 25% equity and 75% debt, we are developing USD8 billion of new projects. What all this means is that we need to ensure that our capital structure and funding capacity is in a position to fund USD800 million of new equity every year. We were founded by a group of very strong shareholders. Thereafter we have then carefully grown our shareholder platform with very capable new shareholders joining us increasing our capital base. With this increasing level of capitalization and having had the supportive shareholders to retain earnings that we have been generating from our investments, many of which are now reliably delivering electricity and desalinated water,  we have been able generate more equity funding by leveraging our balance sheet with five to seven year revolvers and the next logical step is for us to be looking at some bonds or Sukuks from of financing. So, what we expect to do in this quarter in terms of the Sukuk offering is part and parcel of that program. Our expectation is to go out during the second quarter of this year for a bond and Sukuk offering with a target of raising USD 1 Billion. Given the level of activity we foresee in in the Kingdom in 2017, 2018, and 2019 we would expect to deploy all of this and more in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>When you look at the future tenders for solar, will the prices continue to be as low as you have been providing in other countries?</h4><p>Comparing the published tariff of tenders is frankly meaningless. The press goes crazy but it of course does not have the details. Yes it is X US Cents/kWh but on what contract terms? This is before even considering that the tariff will be dependent on the level of renewable energy resource, the cost of construction at two different locations, the taxation cost burden, the credit quality of the different parties involved, making the list of what impacts each tariff endless. For example the famously low tariff in Abu Dhabi id simply not comparable with the tariff of Dubai contract as the Abu Dhabi contract commits to make a higher payment than the contracted tariff during summer months. So that meant the published kWh tariff appears low, but was in fact not as low as in other places if you equalize the multiple variables. What I can say is that Saudi Arabia has fantastic solar resources, land is going to be given at a notional cost, the credit worthiness of the Kingdom is superior to many other countries, and there is a lot of funding capacity here and so the cost of financing for Saudi will most likely be lower than for Abu Dhabi. It is going to be a big program that will attract a lot of competitiveness. Putting all this together you will end up with a tariff that for sure is going to be lower than that which you have seen anywhere else, of course may not be the published number, as it will need to be evaluated on a like-for-like basis.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Our principal goal remains unchanged;  focus on reliably delivering desalinated water and electricity at the lowest possible price and continue to serve the markets where we operate. Specific targets for us are to complete the many plants under construction and bring them on line on time such as the two CSP plants at Morocco on which when construction is completed these two together with the one phase that is already dispatching green electrons day and night will then become the largest CSP complex in the world; fantastic. Another exciting finish will be the DEWA 200MW photovoltaic plant IPP coming online in early second quarter of this year well on track. Here in the Kingdom we have a 2,000MW gas-fired power plant that will come online this year. In terms of new tenders we expect to see the first few tenders in a major programme of new big renewables here in the Kingdom. Here in the Kingdom, we can also expect a big gas-fired IPP, a few large privately financed Desalination plants and the start of the SEC Genco privatization, at least with the commencement of the prequalification process. There is a lot going on and it is an exciting period, especially in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Qatar a pillar of Vodafone's operations across the Middle East and how do you assess your contribution to the development of the IT sector during these years?</h4><p>As a business, we are deeply committed to the country and enormously proud of our successful history operating as the holder of Qatar's second public mobile and fixed telecommunications networks and services license. Fully in line with Qatar's 2030 National Vision, Vodafone Qatar is committed to providing innovative services and solutions designed to further develop the telecommunications sector as the country progresses toward its vision of becoming a knowledge-based economy. We have introduced a number of market firsts in Qatar such as the London Edition, the first telecoms product of its kind in the world, which is an invitation-only plan to customers with both Qatar and UK numbers that is easily managed through a single Qatar account; in addition, Vodafone Red, our signature postpaid suite, provides some of the best international and local rates in the region; and our Connect plans bring maximum flexibility to our customers with no restrictions. We have developed initiatives such as our data welcome bonus, another market first for postpaid customers. This gives customers two months of unlimited internet with a new postpaid plan. We have a whole-hearted commitment to customer care and ensuring maximum flexibility and transparency in customers' dealings with us. Innovations such as the My Vodafone App, which gives users full control over their mobile usage, or Bill Manager, an innovative product that ensures all our post-paid customers never receive a shocking bill again, help build customer trust and brand affinity.</p><h4>Vodafone has emerged as one of the pioneers in smart solutions through the Internet of Things (IoT). How are you supporting Qatar in its smart developments?</h4><p>Our extensive experience and expertise in fixed, mobility, IoT, cloud solutions, big data, and analytics mean we are ideally placed to address many of the urban challenges that are evident in a rapidly developing economy and market like Qatar and to support the vital delivery of public services efficiently, securely, and cost effectively. The launch of our Global Platform as the connectivity solution that enables a wider concept of IoT is a good example of how we are continually looking for ways to bring the power of our international network to Qatar. This combines with an interactive portal for end users, global SIM cards powered by the world's largest network, highly secure solutions, more than 1,300 IoT experts, a broad portfolio of IoT terminals, and an application and service enablement development and testing and deployment—all from a single supplier, with a single contract. We recently announced the launch of a partnership with Qatar Mobility Innovations Center (QMIC) to provide a fleet management service, a telematics service designed to track and perform logistics management for companies aiming to enhance productivity and tackle road safety issues.</p><h4>In light of the agreement signed with Qatar Rail, what are the areas of collaboration you can explore with developers to provide world-class telecommunications infrastructure?</h4><p>The MoU with Qatar Rail covers commuters using the Doha Metro Green and Gold Lines and will ensure the availability of high-quality telecommunications services to the general public from the commencement of railway services. Once the lines are open in 2020, Vodafone will ensure citizens, residents, and visitors enjoy a superior network quality experience. In addition, we will further invest in fixed-line activities targeting opportunities in public and private investments in major new real estate developments such as Msheireb Downtown, Lusail City, and The Pearl-Qatar, and infrastructure projects such as the new seaport and Hamad International Airport. We believe these offer real scope for our enterprise business and fixed-line services.</p><h4>You stated last April 2016 that Vodafone Qatar would be one of the fastest adopters of 5G services. What is the status of this initiative and how will it represent a revolution in the market?</h4><p>As the sole representatives from Qatar on global telecoms industry steering groups for 5G standards, we are already thinking about how we can bring that technology to bear in Qatar. 5G will be the next generation of mobile technology, which the International Telecoms Union expects to be formally defined by 2020. Vodafone is at the forefront of making 5G a commercial reality with 5G technologies research underway to prepare its networks for a transition toward the new mobile standard.</p><h4>How is Vodafone expanding its business plans portfolio to attract small, medium, and large companies?</h4><p>We are actively supporting large numbers of small- to medium-sized businesses in Qatar, enabling them to succeed and grow. We have designed products such as Ready Business, a unique platform for the Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) segment. This offers two choices of postpaid plans packed with value including international free minutes for every hour of received calls, and other innovative benefits such as a business ring-back tone. At Vodafone, we do not just offer Wi-Fi but managed Wi-Fi, which consists of a carefree package that we serve end-to-end so that a business owner need never worry about their connectivity. Our presence in all major worldwide destinations also means that we are uniquely placed to offer our business customers unparalleled benefits. Companies can benefit from a truly cost-effective voice and data roaming service that enables all their employees to stay connected to the company's office and to their friends and family while travelling. We also recently launched Business Corners in our flagship stores Villagio, City Center Doha, and Landmark Mall.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our strategic focus is to continue the positive momentum we achieved in 2016 and to build on our improving financial performance and success. That momentum is based on delivering significant and sustained improvements in network quality, customer service, and expanding our range of innovative products and services. We will continue our investments in network and technology upgrades, building on our progress to date in delivering a reliable network and wide range of quality services. This will enable us to consolidate the success and recognition we have received such as our network being named Best in Test by P3 communications. We will continue to invest in bringing a range of innovative solutions and applications to the market. Fixed line will represent an important future growth opportunity for Vodafone Qatar as we expand our product portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your main focus since becoming General Manager of Ogero at the beginning of this year?</h4><p>Looking back at the previous years, my main focus would definitely be to satisfy our customers. The people of Lebanon have been through much frustration when it comes to this sector, I believe it is time to put a plan in place to meet their needs and boost the technological capabilities of our nation.</p><h4>According to the minister, 500,000 new landlines will be available soon, which will enable Ogero to speed up the DSL connection all over Lebanon. How is this progressing?</h4><p>To be honest, 500,000 new subscribers is an understatement. What we are working on is much more transformational in nature. We called this the IMS Project because we are dismantling and decommissioning all the old technical switches that were put in place back in 1994 with limited capacity and capabilities in comparison to what we have today. This introduces the digital era of IP telephony. What we are doing is not only adding 500,000 landlines; we are completely transforming the infrastructure of the fixed network into a groundbreaking platform that will allow us to welcome as many new subscribers as the market requires. Our short-term objective is to add an additional 500,000 subscribers to the 1 million that we already have, but this is only the first piece of the puzzle. Having an advanced digital environment starts with fixed-network assets, which is the IMS. Other pieces will also fall into place in order to establish the final, or at least the modern, infrastructure that we intend to have in Lebanon. The second phase is the fiber-to-cabinet solution, which will allow us to provide triple play and quad play to the end-user in their homes.</p><h4>The installation of fiber optics is part of the 2020 strategy launched in July 2015. According to that plan, fiber-optic networks will be gradually installed over a period of five years. How is this progressing?</h4><p>The first phase of the fiber optics plan was deployed before I joined Ogero, it was dedicated to linking all of our 300 switches together through fiber optics. So far we have deployed around 6,000km of fiber in the country. The second phase is to get closer to the subscriber by installing active cabinets. Those active cabinets will get the end user closer to the switch, thus reducing the distance and giving access to high-speed internet. We are about to tender this project; the technical teams are putting together the documents as we speak, as well as planning the deployment of several thousand cabinets across the nation.</p><h4>How has Ogero contributed to the development of the country over the years?</h4><p>In total honesty and with all humility, Ogero is the major infrastructure provider for Lebanon. My team and myself are constantly striving to improve the capabilities of our network so that the private sector can take part in the infrastructure improvement, providing capacity, high-speed internet, and a resilient, stable, secure, fit-for-purpose network. We truly believe that we are a vital transforming force in the Lebanese economy. Many entrepreneurs are moving out of the country due to the lack of proper infrastructure. Connectivity has become essential for every start-up and every business that seeks growth. Our objective is to ensure that such services are available for all stakeholders, to be able to grow within their homeland and benefit the economy.</p><h4>What are Ogero's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a plan in place that will allow us to catch up with the leading economies in the region in terms of technology and telecommunications. Our main objective is to provide nationwide high-speed Internet. Our fiber-to-cabinet project (FTC) was established to offer a connection with a minimum speed of 50mbps. The next milestone consists of providing heavy internet users (universities, hospitals, specialized schools, public entities, and big enterprises) with fiber connectivity characterized by high capacity and bandwidth. We are also looking into expanding our data center and cloud computing capabilities to create a national cloud for Lebanon. Our proof of concept will take us to a new level of service specifically for the ministries and the public sector. Once this proof of concept is solid and well set, we will move to a private cloud while trying to get the framework to establish a regional cloud. This five-year plan will elevate Lebanon to become a major player in the regional ICT industry. With this plan in mind, we aim to establish a long-lasting strategy that can be sustained through different administrations. We have received the buy-in of all concerned entities, including previous ministers and the current government, to turn this sector into a success story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What sectors are driving the growth of corporate relations between Qatar and Romania? <br>Doubling the number of daily flights of Qatar Airways between Doha and Bucharest is a clear sign of the increasing cooperation relations between Romania and Qatar. In Qatar, there are more than 2,500 Romanians working in different sectors of activity such as oil and gas, construction, medical, and aviation. Moreover, the operation by Qatar Airways of two direct flights daily between Doha and Bucharest is favoring the exchange of tourism. The driving sectors of Romanian exports to Qatar include cars, furniture, wood, machineries, electrical appliances, rubber, articles made of cast, iron and steel, textiles, garments and accessories, and optical, photographic, and cinematographic instruments. Romania is importing organic chemicals and plastic materials from Qatar. <br>What opportunities do you foresee for Romanian companies in Qatar? <br>The context of Qatar's path to diversification offers the private sector in both countries many opportunities, such as in the food industry, focusing on the concept of food security, a priority in the development strategy of the Gulf countries. I would also include tourism, through the exchange of tourism and health treatment packages between main tour operators in Romania and Qatar. Construction also offers opportunities, taking into account the quality of Romanian manpower at convenient prices, in addition to the use of modern technologies at the EU level. Other sectors include IT and cyber security, where our software specialists perform at elevated levels; rolling stock, taking into account our capacity to produce passenger and freight coaches, metro trains, and modern trams; waste recycling and recovery, where Romania has cutting-edge technological solutions; and energy, natural gas, and electricity, by the transfer of technology and expertise.</p><h4>Qatar has earmarked Europe as one of the main destinations for its investments overseas. What makes Romania a good opportunity for Qatari investors? </h4><p>Romania has a market economy, meaning the state protects freedom of trade, fair competition, and private property rights. Among the factors that make Romania attractive to foreign investment are political and economic stability and security, its status as an EU and NATO member, its position as a gateway to the European Community's 500 million consumers, its size as the eighth EU country in territory and the sixth in population, its location at the crossing of three large markets (the EU, the CIS, and the Middle East), and its strategic access to the Black Sea and the Danube River, which cross Europe from south-east to north-west. Other competitive advantages include extensive agricultural land (more than 9.4 million ha), energy and mineral resources, human resources with high qualification and technological expertise at competitive costs, developed transport and tourism infrastructure, high-speed internet, lower taxation (16% flat tax, VAT 20%, and 9% in food and tourism), and the existence of 72 industrial parks. Investment opportunities are offered by our country specifically in areas such as agriculture, real estate, tourism, IT, defense industry, mining, aviation, and mineral waters. In agriculture, we should focus on the capitalization of Romania's agricultural and livestock potential through partnership projects and joint ventures between Qatari companies and businessmen and Romanian agro producers, the foreign capital attraction being meant to extend the production capacities in Romania, in the mutual interest. In tourism, Romania has a wealth of natural beauty: the Carpathian Mountains, Black Sea coast, the Danube Delta, and numerous locations for hunting. Besides increasing the number of Qatari tourists to Romania we are particularly interested in attracting Qatari investments in the tourism field, both in the hospitality industry and taking into account the vast network of therapeutic resorts (over 125), spas and natural salt mines, with healing properties, in the field of physical recovery and of various health services. There are energy investment opportunities in the capital market, considering the outstanding financial results obtained by national companies Transgaz and Transelectrica, following their privatization. In the mining sector, we are open for Qatari investment for the reopening of iron mines in Caras-Severin and Suceava counties.</p>]]></richbody0content>

To support the country's efforts, QNB has focused its financing on four key areas: utilities, transport, real estate, and the FIFA World Cup infrastructure. In utilities, we have continued our active involvement in financing key projects such as water and sewage networks. In transport, we were involved in vessel and aircraft financing for prime shipping and transport companies. These deals will further propel Qatar as a transport hub for the trade corridor between Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. In real estate, our involvement in the iconic Lusail City development has been a particular success as a benchmark project in both infrastructure and real estate development financing. We have seen continued demand for residential projects and hospitality, helping Qatar reach the 60,000 hotel rooms targeted for 2022. Gearing up for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we have participated in many projects, including roads, stadiums, and infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the Southeast Asian market?</h4><p>Building on our continued success, our vision is to become a leading bank in the Middle East and Africa and Southeast Asia (MEASEA). MEASEA markets will continue to be the focal point of global growth for the coming years. These regions require further trade and investment flows to support the building of the foundations for socio-economic developments, such as infrastructure, including transport, real estate, power, telecoms, healthcare, education, and tourism. This will, in turn, drive population growth, consumer demand, and consumption, resulting in higher economic growth across the region. By strategically positioning our business toward and across these markets, we are securing our vision of becoming a leading bank in MEASEA by 2020. Through our own network, as well as through our partners and alliances, we have the necessary local knowledge, expertise, and understanding of the risks and opportunities to successfully create and capture significant value in those markets. This positively contributes to QNB's growth and adds additional strength to the group by diversifying our sources of revenue and profit. India is the world's seventh largest economy with the second largest population and an investment grade rating. India became the fastest-growing “major economy" in 2014 and is set on a positive trajectory due to raft of structural and fiscal reforms. Real GDP growth annually is expected to be around 7.5% annually until 2020. We hence see several opportunities in India. We are glad to announce that we obtained regulatory approval for a branch license in 2016. Right now, we are working on the establishment of our branch in India.</p><h4>How do you assess the results of QNB's acquisition of Turkey's fifth-largest private lender, Finansbank, and how could this decision further increase trade between Turkey and Qatar?</h4><p>This transaction is a significant milestone in QNB Group's strategy of international expansion. With the addition of Turkey as a new market and one of the leading Turkish banks to its network, QNB Group further extends its international presence and will be able to increasingly benefit from the rapid development of trade and the strengthening of economic ties between Turkey and the Middle East in general, as well as between Qatar and Turkey in particular, taking into consideration the historic relations both countries enjoy. This also reflects QNB Group's confidence in the long-term prospects of the financial sector and economy of Turkey.</p><h4>As there is mismatch between the growth of lending and deposits in Qatar, do you have intentions to tap the debt and equity markets in 2017, particularly in Asia?</h4><p>It is the slowdown in asset growth that means we have greater ability to be more opportunistic when it comes to issuing further debt. We have a large and stable liquidity buffer, with our wholesale funding made up from a diverse mix of deposits, structured deposits, CDs, and EMTN issuance. In the debt market, we will remain opportunistic, with no fixed-issuance targets. The maintenance of strong liquidity allows us to only access the market when it is beneficial to do so. Looking at new niche markets such as Pro-Bond, Kangaroo, Panda — EUR, and CHF, if they make economic sense. At the same time, we are agnostic to currency of issue as long and it swaps back to our USD target levels. As for the equity market, this really depends on the capital requirements or further plans for acquisition, as of now we are adequate on the capital requirements.</p><h4>How do you assess the overall health of the banking sector in Qatar and what are the factors driving bank mergers?</h4><p>The Qatari banking system is healthy. It has grown strongly in size in recent years, without compromising its profitability. We expect this trend to continue going forward. We foresee robust growth in the size of the banking system, partly driven by Qatar's strong investment spending program. And we expect this growth to be healthy, with profits also projected to grow to new highs. Underpinning this healthy growth is the strong capital position, high-asset quality, and efficient cost structure of Qatari banks.</p><h4>What are your business expectations for the next 12 months and your economic outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Regarding credit growth, we expect a fiscal deficit around 2% of GDP in 2017, leading to continued demand for loans from the government. When it comes to liquidity, the higher oil prices should slow the withdrawal of government deposits, which declined by 11.1% year on year in December 2016. At the same time, I expect the private-sector deposits to grow on high population growth (6.3% in January 2017). This growth was 0.9% in December 2016 compared to 9.1% a year earlier.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the expanded canal reshaped the logistics sector in Panama and the region?</h4><p>On the container business, the impact is not as large as the LNG business, where there was a major impact. By expanding the canal, we maintained Panama's position as an important trade route in the world. The first impact was that we retained the business and services that left us and are returning from Suez. In addition, this coincides with the consolidation of shipping lines that are now using the expanded canal for some of their products, of course, using larger vessels. What happened is that we are not only returning to previous levels but are able to grow bigger and better. We will see the impact more going through 2018, when alliances are consolidated. We did not expect a major impact on the container business initially, though LNG saw a major impact as a new route was opened.</p><h4>How do you apply your company's values of efficiency, productivity, and readiness for the future in Panama?</h4><p>The greatest challenge in this business is trying to create capacity when volumes are down and being prepared to take care of the capacity when volumes go up. The trick here is to create capacity in a way that can match demand without spending a large amount of money. What we have done in many cases in our terminal is to use the same footprint that we have and add more technology. In the end it helps to really move more cargo to the same terminal. This is what we are doing now because we seek to do a little bit through more advanced technology equipment to lower costs. The biggest problem that we have is that Panama's population is only 4 million so we cannot compete with larger markets, with way more people and more developed agricultural/industrial sectors[JCC1] . The challenge is to predict what is next and sometimes we hit the target and sometimes we get close and then adjust. We cannot, however, just invest a large sum of money and wait for the market; we have to create capacity and normally it takes 18-24 months to create capacity and a new dock.</p><h4>How is the company positioned to boost the development of Colón?</h4><p>When we started in 1995, we had no idea what corporate social responsibility was. All we knew was that people lived there and we wanted them to work with us, so we decided to have a two-phase program that focused on giving people the best place to work and a great place for them to live. We first did the internal part, and then considered how we could do the external part. We focused on our people and then looked outward and built hospitals and schools and invested in baseball and soccer teams, as well as in education. Our biggest challenge is that we want generations of families to continue working in our port. We have the first generation working here for over 20 years and are starting to hire the children of the employees who first started working with us; we want people to be prepared. We need to keep the people of Colón in Colón, because if they all migrate elsewhere, we will not see the benefits. We are involved in many activities and are the biggest in Colón in this respect, which started from having no idea about CSR and simply using common sense, which has worked. Subsequently, there was a name for such projects and we realized we were doing it without knowing that we were; we simply wanted the best for our people working here. The most important thing is that our people now run operations in Haiti, Colombia, and Vietnam because in the end the idea was to offer a career and not just a job. This has worked and is one of the things that we are truly proud of; all the other parts such as equipment, cranes, and technology can easily be found in any part of the world. The challenge was that when the Canal expansion stopped, everyone lost their jobs and struggled. The part we are concerned with now is that the type of labor we need requires another level of education that we are not getting. This is the biggest challenge; how we do the job on the existing education level. We need more than what the schools give us; we need what the market demands. Our biggest challenge following the expansion of the canal is now the expansion of education.</p><h4>What are your targets, priorities, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>We need to consolidate our logistics hub but change the concept a little as we have to go more into developmental high-tech products as the real cost of labor in Panama makes the prices of products uncompetitive. If we do not understand that then we are fooling ourselves; we need to look into products where we add labor costs. This is where we are talking about high tech. We also have to look at electronic services such as Amazon and Alibaba because all companies need to run such a business is a place from which they can dispatch orders. In Latin America, having a Miami zip code is a bonus; customers send everything to the Miami zip code and everything gets forwarded to their country. Why can't we do this in Panama and become a major center of distribution of e-commerce as well? The free zone concept is there but it will not grow much more as having a free zone does not make a large difference. We need to have free zones, added value, e-commerce, and airline hub of the Americas as well as cargo as we do not handle enough. The dream is to consolidate this and not just have each sector grow individually; when we put it together the package and value proposition that we can put into commerce, this is the ideal scenario. This is great for business because that generates cargo. Panama has been in the newspapers too much and not for the right reasons. The problem with this is that the media outside and inside dampens the optimism within Panama. People talk about everything that is wrong but currently compared to many places in the rest of the world things here are extremely positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Morocco rejoining the African Union?</h4><p>Returning to the African Union after more than 30 years away is like a return to our institutional family. Morocco has always been involved in Africa. After South Africa, Morocco is the second-largest African investor on the continent. In 2020, we have ambitions to become the first not only in terms of economic development, but also in terms of human development and culture. Morocco also fully supports the process of spreading peace across the continent. Many parts of Africa face challenges of fighting extremism and to do so it is crucial to boost cooperation among nations. His Majesty Mohammed VI has a vision for Africa. Africa is a continent with great potential, a continent of the future, but one grappling with many obstacles. Thus, the continent has two alternatives: become a problematic continent for the rest of the world in terms of democracy and political stability, or become a driving force—as one of the landmasses with a rapidly growing population—behind ensuring global peace and security. We must invest in this in order to make sure that African countries have their own means and can, with their own efforts, work together to protect the continent's future. Morocco entered the African Union with this vision in mind. We want to share with our neighbors all that we have acquired in terms of experience, know-how, and capacity, to add value to the continent. There is a new generation of Africans, with potential, ideas, and innovation. The problem is organization, cooperation, and learning to work together. The visit to Zambia is part of Morocco's commitment to strengthen our ties with all African countries. We are applying a new type of cooperation, with an emphasis on development, capacity building, and human investment. This visit marks a new chapter for us in our bilateral dealings with other African nations.</p><h4>During the state visit to Zambia in question, 19 agreements were signed between the two countries. What were these agreements regarding?</h4><p>There were six or seven agreements consolidating the legal relationship between the two countries, as well as agreements from private-to-private sectors and public-to-private. These were in a number of fields. For example, we know that the potential for agricultural development in Africa is tremendous. Morocco has a rich and successful history in agricultural development, and our neighbors acknowledge this and ask us to bring this experience to the table. We want to help structure the development of agriculture, contribute to the know-how, investment, and investment planning in agro-business. Regarding the issue of minerals, the African continent, and in particular Zambia, boasts significant resources. When we consider that currently 70% of the Zambian economy depends on the export of these, it is obvious that structuring the industry effectively can be key to creating wealth and employment. However, at the moment, there is extraction and export but no transformation, and if there is no transformation, no value-addition to raw products, then there is a minimum cap on the amount of wealth and in-country employment that can be created. This was the motivation behind the signing of the a memorandum of understanding between the Zambian Ministry of Mines and Morocco's office for hydrocarbons and mining (ONHYM). In the logistics area, we know that today competition is global and being a global playing field, there are demands that a country's logistics are of premium standard. We want to assist Zambia in realizing its potential as a logistics hub in the southern African region, contributing to capacity development in industry and transport. Training is also fundamental for Zambia's growing youth population to be effective in their jobs, and, therefore, we signed agreements to boost education. We also contribute to Zambia's drive to improve its tourism sector. Morocco has had great success in building itself as a tourist hub, tripling the number of tourists who flock to our shores from 4 million to 12 million in 10 years. Finally, agreements have been laid out between the two countries to continue working together to identify fields of possible development and investment. We will organize an economic forum, one in Zambia and one in Morocco, to cement this relationship and ensure we continuously seek out new opportunities for this fruitful relationship to flourish.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The newly formed Mubadala Investment Company, which was formally established on May 1, 2017, brings together an asset portfolio worth USD125 billion. What was the rationale behind this merger?</h4><p>The rationale for merging two of the Emirate's key government-owned investment entities, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Mubadala Development Company, was to create enhanced economic value for the government of Abu Dhabi. As a combined entity, Mubadala Investment Company will realize synergies and growth in multiple sectors, including energy, utilities, technology, aerospace, industry, healthcare, real estate, and financial investments. Mubadala Investment Company has a stronger, more dynamic balance sheet and world-class expertise in a pool of industries vital to Abu Dhabi's growth. As a result, it can contribute more significantly to the diversification of the economy, in line with the Abu Dhabi Plan and the country's long-term vision.</p><h4>What do the two organizations bring to Mubadala Investment Company in terms of heritage and legacy?</h4><p>IPIC and Mubadala Development Company have played leading roles in Abu Dhabi's economic growth and diversification. IPIC was established in 1984 by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, with the aim of directing Abu Dhabi's energy expertise and petroleum heritage toward the creation of a modern, diversified economy. IPIC's first major acquisition was Cepsa and, since then, it has become a global powerhouse in the hydrocarbon value chain with investments in 18 leading companies worldwide. Mubadala Development Company was established in 2002 to advance the Emirate's economic diversification. The company's first project was Dolphin Energy, a groundbreaking joint venture with Occidental Petroleum and Total that directly connects gas from Qatar's North Field with customers in the UAE and Oman, and today meets approximately 30% of the UAE's energy requirements. By 2017, Mubadala Development Company had become an active investor across multiple sectors in more than 20 countries. As a combined force, the two companies form an investment powerhouse that includes partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries and has a group-wide employee base of more than 68,000 people.</p><h4>Given the significant scale of the new company, how has the business been structured?</h4><p>Committees made up of representatives from both Mubadala Development Company and IPIC worked together over a six-month period to develop a structure that would best serve the mandate given to us by the government of Abu Dhabi. The business has been organized across four investment platforms of significant scale: petroleum and petrochemicals; technology, manufacturing, and mining; aerospace, renewables, and information and communications technology; and alternative investments and infrastructure. These platforms will help accelerate the diversification of the Abu Dhabi economy through strategic investments across critical sectors within the UAE and abroad.</p><h4>Just under one-third of the new Mubadala Investment Company's portfolio is comprised of businesses in the petroleum and petrochemicals sectors. What will your strategic focus be in this area and how does this contribute to Abu Dhabi's diversification ambition?</h4><p>Mubadala Investment Company's petroleum and petrochemicals platform makes up 31.1% of the asset portfolio and includes significant investments in companies such as Cepsa, Nova Chemicals, Borealis, and Mubadala Petroleum. While the development of non-oil sectors such as aerospace, renewables, and metals were key pillars of Mubadala Development Company's strategic focus, oil and gas have always been a key component of its portfolio. Today, Mubadala Petroleum pursues oil and gas exploration and production in eight countries across the eastern hemisphere, building on the UAE's hydrocarbon expertise. What is exciting about the merger with IPIC is that we now have 18 leading companies that operate across the hydrocarbon value chain. So, in addition to increased exploration and production activity, Mubadala Investment Company also now has significant midstream and downstream capability in areas such as shipping and pipelines, retail and marketing, petrochemicals, and power and utilities. We see significant opportunities to build on the Emirate's legacy of hydrocarbons expertise, particularly in the petrochemicals sector, and look forward to developing as one united business.</p><h4>Industrialization is a central component of Abu Dhabi's economic development. How will Mubadala Investment Company continue to create a sustainable manufacturing industry in the Emirate and the wider UAE?</h4><p>It will continue its efforts to support the transformation of Abu Dhabi's economy through the growth of industrial champions in sectors that capitalize on Abu Dhabi's natural advantages. These anchor investments in the UAE are key to growing non-oil GDP and creating new jobs in diverse fields. Abu Dhabi is leading the way in a number of manufacturing industries, exporting high-quality products to top-tier companies around the world and providing high-skilled jobs to local talent. Mubadala Investment Company has created tens of thousands of jobs in the UAE since the inception of its parent companies, as well as many more in other markets. For example, Emirates Global Aluminium is today one of the world's five-largest primary aluminium producers, manufacturing high-performance aluminium for use in a range of applications. It has a formidable track record of innovation, performance, and profitability, with more than 300 global customers in more than 60 countries. In aerospace, Strata is producing high-quality component aircraft products for original equipment manufacturers and has partnerships with leading aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. It is both an innovator and key employer of Emirati talent. 2016 saw Strata's percentage of Emirati technicians cross the 50% mark, in part driven by a highly successful technician-training program in collaboration with the UAE University, which graduated another 105 UAE nationals last year. Through these global champions and other critical UAE investments, Mubadala Investment Company will continue to support the growth of a strong, diversified national manufacturing industry.</p><h4>What will be the investment strategy for Mubadala Investment Company outside of Abu Dhabi and how is the company allocating a more varied range of sectors within its portfolio?</h4><p>Mubadala Development Company and IPIC were both highly active globally, and as a combined entity with partnerships and subsidiaries in more than 30 countries, this will continue. Our focus remains helping to fulfill Abu Dhabi's long-term vision for a globally integrated and diverse economy, and operating as a trusted global business that partners with the world's best companies and institutions. Our semiconductor business GLOBALFOUNDRIES' international presence embodies our approach to investing in globally integrated sectors. Through nine fabrication facilities spanning three continents, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has established Abu Dhabi's footprint in the advanced technology sector—a core pillar of the Emirate's diversification strategy. IPIC has brought the new company a significant international portfolio of assets, including stakes in Cepsa and Borealis, one of the largest polyolefin producers in the world. In addition to these established assets, we are also continuing to explore new markets through capital investments and a range of Sovereign Investment Partnerships. For example, we have established relationships with sovereign-backed entities in Russia, China, and France that are creating significant opportunities in a variety of sectors with like-minded partners. In addition, our dedicated financial arm, Mubadala Capital, began in 2017 to manage third-party capital for the first time, following a transaction with Ardian, the independent private investment company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the greatest achievements of Digital Ware over its 23-year history?</h4><p>Today Digital Ware has over 23 years in the market and over 250 direct employees, as well as some indirect employees. We have offices in Medellí­n and Quito as well. We have alliances with companies including PWC, Stefanini, Everis, and Inda. We have won various prizes in the country, including the recognition for being the 'Most Innovative Company in Colombia,' from Portafolio. That prize was awarded due to the range of our services, for security, government institutions, health, and in each one we have offered innovative solutions unlike any other IT company. In pension and payroll systems, for example, many of the largest companies in Colombia use the Kactus payroll system, which is one of our products. We are very visible in all of these segments. Our focus is medium to large companies, rather than SMEs, companies such as Compensar, Aviatur, Chevron, Mazda, Ecopetrol, and Oxy are all our clients, so we have an impressive portfolio of both domestic and international companies. Our focus back in 1992 was definitely on payroll systems. Since then, we have worked in developing other REPS systems. Large multinational companies from Mexico to Argentina have used our Kactus platform, which is a very robust system for managing complex payrolls with an increasing number of employees coming and going and working part-time. There are 30,000 employees in our Chamber of Law. All our products have been engineered with great care. We have a concept called Quebristica, where we apply to various tax regimes within companies. We also have a program called Ophelia that integrates the characteristics of the Seven and Kactus programs, which allows clients to conserve their investments and grow their client base. Our systems manage a mass of big data and work in a robust manner, requiring a high level of engineering. These systems have gradually evolved and become more perfect over the years, as we've worked with a greater range of clients.</p><h4>Which of your solutions have seen the greatest commercial success since their introduction into the various industrial segments in which you work?</h4><p>Over the past year, KACTUS-HCM has experienced a wealth of commercial success. I also mentioned earlier the success of HOSVITAL-HIS, which we developed thanks to our strategic alliance with PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the world's largest consulting group.</p><h4>Why do you think your software has been considered so innovative that it is used by a mass of public institutions, such as the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN)?</h4><p>After the DIAN's selection process, in which several software companies with extensive experience both nationally and internationally were invited, the Digital Ware KACTUS-HCM solution was chosen. Thus, a team from the DIAN and Digitalware worked together to mount KACTUS-HCM, which is the information system for human resources and payroll most widely implemented in the Colombian government. DIAN has made KACTUS-HCM one of its most effective processing tools, allowing it to optimize its processes and add value to the most important asset of this entity: its human capital. So far we have issued more than 10,000 certificates and 36,000 settlements in the period between July and October at the national level, this is possible thanks to the modules and applications of KACTUS-HCM: payroll, self-service, recruiting, selection, performance evaluation, and welfare related products.</p><h4>You have offices in Quito today. Do you have other regional expansion plans?</h4><p>For the past five years or so, Digital Ware has been developing strategies to expand its presence throughout America. Therefore, it has defined a model of partnerships to help expand its presence, leveraging our positioning in the local market by working closely with each of our partners with which we have signed agreements. As a result of this strategy, Digital Ware has signed an alliance with PwC at a regional level, to integrate into the practice of PwC Health Solutions and other Digital Ware products and services to other institutions to which PwC provides services. This alliance in its first phase will allow us to consolidate our presence in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. Digital Ware will therefore advance its strategy of expanding hand-in-hand with one of the largest health practice consultancy firms that exists worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This is the 90th Anniversary of GE in Colombia. What does this milestone mean for the company?</h4><p>GE is present in almost every country on earth. The commitment we have with each country is to support their development. Even though it has had turmoil throughout its history, Colombia is now a country with proven high quality institutions, reliable financial policy, and a good draw for foreign investment. In general, it has had the best performance in these areas within Latin America. Through our technologies and services, we support the countries meet the most difficult challenges in infrastructure, while generating the conditions for competitiveness, not only in the industries in which we work, but in the industries, that benefit from the things we do. We have been in Colombia for 90 years, providing cutting-the-edge technologies for the development of a sustainable infrastructure for health, energy, water, ground transportation and aviation. Now, transportation and energy are two sectors that the country needs to improve to become a more competitive economy.</p><h4>Major investments in offshore exploration have been announced for 2017. What opportunities are there for GE in the hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>For both Colombia and GE, the oil and gas industry is one of the pillars for development. We believe in the strategy that the industry in Colombia is performing at this point to go offshore. This is the opportunity that the sector might have to make a good turnaround of our reserves, not only in gas but also in oil. A decade from now, we could be able to multiply the country's production by two with a good combination of gas and oil. If the country doesn't do that, we might not be called an oil-producing country anymore. If we don't play this bet, we may not be in the playing field. We totally support the strategy and we have the technology to support its execution. Through acquisitions, we will be improving our portfolio to serve it better.</p><h4>In terms of the legislative framework in Colombia, what needs to be changed to make non-conventional renewables a more viable investment?</h4><p>The only way in which there is going to be a proper diversification of the power generation matrix is with the right incentives to implement all the available technology. It is not only renewables but also thermal, such as coal and gas. The matrix needs to be complemented with all the technologies available and each one should bring a benefit in terms of cost and reliability. Specifically, for non-conventional renewables, the country's regulations need to show signs for remuneration of intermittent non-conventional renewables. The Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission (CREG) has already shown four mechanisms that allow not only reliable remuneration for this technology, but also long-term remuneration. Today, the country is not signing long-term contracts for energy. The regulations need to incentivize the intermittency of the energy and long-term contracts so these projects are bankable. The wind potential that the country has in La Guajira is not only good, but maybe one of the best wind resources in the region. The only way to get the energy out from La Guajira is through a new transmission line that needs to be built to connect to the national grid. Hence, there are not only regulatory obstacles, but also physical obstacles that need to be met, specifically in that region for wind farms. Then, for solar, perhaps one of the things that the country should think about, in terms of regulation would be a two-way meter for energy so that during the day you can be a producer, and at night, get charged up. Getting into that sort of regulation would help expand the solar capabilities of the country, which also have good potential, especially in the north of the country.</p><h4>How does the transformation toward a digital economy factor into GE's Colombia strategy?</h4><p>We are going through a digital transformation and aim to lead the transformation of the industry this century. We strongly believe digitalization is the most creative alternative to improve efficiency and optimize manufacturing, as improve your specific processes. What we are telling the world is that the changes are coming quickly—the world is changing faster every day. The amount of information we are receiving from the equipment that is already or will be installed in the near future is not necessarily being analyzed. What we offer the world is Predix, our digital platform, where we are building new apps to collect and analyze data, as well as predict not only the maintenance of equipment, but also the optimization of the processes, mostly operational and manufacturing. Between 1995 and 2010, productivity increased by 3.5%-4% because of new technology and better processes. But from 2010-2015, that went down to 0.5% because there has not being disruptions, especially in the manufacturing sector.  We are telling the world that new opportunities for productivity are through digital. In wind farms, for example, we have already proven we can improve efficiency by 20%. Imagine doing that for any industrial process. Our main focus for 2017 is helping our industry partners optimize their operations, be more productive, be more efficient, and create more value through digital transformation based on the Predix platform, where they will be able to build the apps required for managing their assets, processes, and business models.</p><h4>How has the concept of digital transformation been received so far in the local market?</h4><p>The reception has been positive around the globe. In Latin America, 2016 was the year to introduce the idea. In 2017, we will start seeing the product of that. The companies that need to be more competitive every day, in the global and not merely local market, need to find ways to be more productive at a lower cost. We should be seeing an important switch in almost every industry in which we participate. We are already seeing the willingness of our customers to take on the digital transformation, which is not only about equipment—it is also about the culture of the companies. You won't have the same people doing everything. Perhaps 20% of the jobs that we have today will be transformed, creating new jobs for people writing apps, analyzing, teaching the software to review the information and then use it to make critical business decisions. The way we do things is changing. The challenge for this is not just to bring in software—it's more about the management of change. Those are the challenges our customers will need to address, with our help of course. The digital transformation is an important topic—perhaps the most life-changing opportunity for the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What potential is in the Saudi market, and what were the initial reasons for entering the market?</h4><p>Market size was extremely important. The Saudi Arabian market has a larger population than any country in the region, and, truly, it is the most important market in the region. Additionally, the geographical size of the country requires a much larger investment of time and capital, and companies willing to make these investments will be able to capitalize on the country's rich wealth of opportunity. We were the first Spanish private company to be awarded with a non-revenue water contract. This means we try to optimize the network to avoid leaks. We were awarded this contract because we are one of the top-10 firms in the world in the field of water management. Our core business is managing sewage and water networks for cities, and we have extensive experience and world-class expertise. In Spain, for example, we manage the sewage and water systems of more than 1,000 cities. In countries where there are major water scarcities, it is important to reduce water consumption and properly manage water resources. Really, our extensive experience and long history of success was why we were awarded contracts in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What techniques are you applying to reduce non-revenue water?</h4><p>Normally we do this by sectorizing a network. This simply means we design a network in a series of small cells that are independent of other cells. We can then control the water inside these smaller cells to a much greater degree than we could if we were trying to control the entire network at once. This has to be done in a way that does not affect the larger network. After the sectorization of the network, we apply certain state-of-the-art technologies that rely on wireless connectivity. We remotely monitor our network without relying on connections with any other utilities. We can understand exactly how much water is moving through the system and how much water we are billing, giving us a much better idea of waste and leakage, which we can then address. Non-revenue water can be as much as 40% of the water moving through a system in some areas, so it is extremely important that we pinpoint and address leakages. We think that the government is headed in the right direction, and that there are huge opportunities in the market for the private sector. We at Aqualia are particularly well positioned because we know how to reduce costs and increase efficiency and we have a long history of industry experience. We are ready and willing to transfer our knowledge and expertise to the Saudi market.</p><h4>What potential do you see for Aqualia to participate in the privatization of the Saudi water market?</h4><p>We are ready to work in many different ways. For us, an important model is the concession model for Water Management. We work within this structure in many places, including Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic. This model is the future. There are other modalities too, like developers for desalination and sewage treatment plants. We finance, we build, and we operate plants, and we are considering a similar model for Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Are pure concessions for existing assets under consideration?</h4><p>There is potential for this, but it will not be considered on an asset-by-asset basis, rather it will be considered regionally. It will be done this way because some assets are old while others are quite new. Companies can be more properly compensated this way. We plan on bidding on projects like this.</p><h4>What changes need to happen in terms of reform to make it economically viable and attractive for Aqualia to bid on these projects?</h4><p>BOT projects need a minimum legal structure and a minimum financial structure. All companies come to the market with financing, but most of this financing is coming from banks and investment funds. These institutions will need a clear picture for how their investment will be recovered. Additionally, it is clear that sovereign guarantees will be required. Those two changes need be achieved in the country. Legal changes allowing firms to generate profits will also have to be implemented or addressed, and the country will have to rely on private companies to generate the contracts. The BOT framework does not fully exist at the moment, and we need to finish developing it. I'm convinced that the Saudi authorities are doing a good job and will deliver a strong framework in the coming months.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>For us, 2017 will be a transition year. Many governmental agents are announcing their intentions to begin new projects this year, but we know that these types of initiatives take time to develop and implement. These are huge changes that need massive adjustments on the legal and financial side. This will be a major issue both this year and next year, and it will take time to address this challenge. I think we will see major changes by the middle of 2018, but not before. Aqualia has a number of projects with all of the water works institutions. It is great that 2017 is fully loaded in terms of projects. While 2016 was a poor year for tenders, right now we are in a good position. We hope that in the coming weeks we will have even more projects confirmed, especially in water management.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the results of the large-scale urbanization in the country and how is the Ministry of Housing positioned in this development?</h4><p>The Ministry of Housing plays an important role, not only in the administration of President Varela but also in all administrations. It brings together, in this case, several institutions that have to do with real estate development, the public sector, and the private sector in Panama. The related institutions include the Ministry of Public Works, the Institute of National Aqueducts and Sewers, the Transit Authority, the National Environment Authority, and the Ministry of Health, which all have something to do with the development of infrastructure within Panama City and throughout the country. Within the Ministry of Housing lies the Vice Ministry of Territorial Ordering, where approvals for preliminary projects—be they state projects or private initiatives—are given. From that perspective, the Ministry of Housing plays a key role because this initial process depends a great deal on private developers, who in this case are one of the most important economic engines of the country in employment, investment, and economic activity. If that body is not alert and responsive, developers lose a great deal of time, which translate into a loss of opportunity and money. Therefore, the administration of President Varela has placed great importance in this single body so that procedures are as efficient as possible. In addition, there is the issue of territorial ordering, which also involves, within the Ministry of Housing, the territorial ordering of cities so that developers have clear regulations on what they can or cannot do in a particular area of the country; this was not the case with previous administrations. This is an area created in the 2009-2014 administration, and started to have greater relevance in the development of the country because we are bringing order to cities. Our administration has placed great emphasis and interest on the real estate development of the country, which is supported in this case by the management of the Ministry of Housing. The ministry has also been a project manager in general to help both private companies and the government reduce the housing deficit; it also plays a key role here. We have created what is called the Solidarity Housing Fund with funding from the Panamanian state budget that provides assistance to families buying their first home. When we arrived at the administration in 2014, the aid given to such the families was USD5,000. In December 2014, we modified the terms of the benefits and raised it to USD10,000. In addition, up until 2014, the sale value or mortgage of a house was USD40,000 and we subsequently raised it to USD50,000, which represents greater benefits. We also expanded the range of development projects.</p><h4>Which are the most representative projects that are being developed in the sector?</h4><p>When the government took office, there were approximately 147,000 families that did not have a house, were living in rentals, living with their parents, and so on. This is why the government of President Varela has promoted important housing projects. For example, the conditions of the Solidarity Fund for Housing have been improved, from 74 promoters to over 525. In addition, we have increased our initial goal to build 25,000 housing solutions within five years up to 100,000 houses. This is extremely important because it will not only give a boost to the economy but will encourage both public investment by the government and private investment to reduce the country's housing gap.</p><h4>What are your goals and targets for 2017?</h4><p>At the end of 2016, the Ministry of Housing had managed more than 55,108 housing solutions throughout the country. The goal for 2017 is to add 26,000 more housing solutions to that figure so that by the end of this year we have managed over 80,000. To manage means that we have complied with all the administrative procedures and that the housing solutions are in different stages. We also seek to increase the project investment from the government from USD1.6 billion to more than USD2.1 billion at the end of the year. This would be a historic investment because in five years the average investment in housing was between USD300 million and 400 million, and we have multiplied that investment by five. In 2017, we hope to leave up 81,000 homes managed throughout the country to reach the goal of 100,000 homes by 2018. Finally, we expect to deliver 40,000 completed homes to the beneficiary families by the end of this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drew you to law and how did AlSoaib Law Firm come about?</h4><p>I had two reasons to switch from a commercial business inherited from my family to law. The first reason was my position regarding law and legal practice. Since a young age, I have believed that practicing law was meant for me. The second reason was that law could be used to protect the family business, especially in the sense that law can protect and preserve the business in order to keep it going. I started with a small office of 150sqm. At that time, when I told people I was a lawyer, no one was interested. People did not have any idea what lawyers do or how they can protect people. This was in 1995. By 1998 foreign investment began to flow into the country and law became much more important. They came before the investment authority was created in 2000. We began growing together with the investment authority, and we now have a good relationship with that entity. We were growing together with foreign companies. They often look for lawyers and auditors. Most of the local companies now are also looking for lawyers. In 2005 we opened our AlSoaib Law Firm branch in Jeddah, which has been successful. Then we began to grow all over again after 2008. We hope to compete. We have a good relationship with other firms. We even transfer know-how. We also learn a lot from international firms. Most of the clients are foreign companies, up to 90%, while 10% are local.</p><h4>What major legal changes have happened in Saudi Arabia with regards to investment?</h4><p>A lot of changes have happened in the last five years specifically, mostly in corporate business and in terms of the labor law. These changes have made it easier. The most important thing for foreign companies is justice. To tell the truth, the courts here are fair. Previously, foreigners often misunderstood our laws. They were afraid of courts and Sharia law, but now they have started to understand that the law is clear. We have good experience and references documented with many of the cases we have taken on from foreign companies.</p><h4>What does it mean for your legal practice that the government is seeking to attract more investors with Vision 2030?</h4><p>The legal framework in the Kingdom is already prepared to develop our investment system and extend the success of that to all stakeholders. The reforms will certainly bring business. We prepare ourselves and develop ourselves for that and to achieve our goals. In 2017 it is difficult, but we hope it will be easier in 2018.</p><h4>How does the upcoming creation of a new bankruptcy law affect your practice?</h4><p>The Kingdom has taken note of the rise of the problem and the Ministry of Commerce and Investment is working on a new law. The bankruptcy law is important, to be articulated in 320 articles. The new law shall cover all of the possibilities and shall be enforced as early as possible. It will be a balanced law; offering protection to both creditors and debtors. It is an important law, for both foreigners and local companies.</p><h4>Do you see the law making it easier for foreign investors to invest in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Not just for foreign investors and international companies, but also for locals. We requested this law a long time ago. We are happy with the law now. We wish to see a lot of new laws from the government. The stock market also needs more laws. There is a new law on the way for the stock market that will increase protections for foreign investors. This will also bring business to my practice.</p><h4>What are your goals and ambitions for the law firm in 2017?</h4><p>The government has already done excellent work and will protect Saudi Arabia from an economic downturn. We will always be strong. We feel this in the stock market now. Real estate remains strong, the stock market remains strong, and still we have a strong economy. We are involved in many companies and investors in the real estate sector today, especially from Kuwait and Qatar. Al Futtaim will build the largest mall in the Gulf and it has already started in Saudi Arabia on the foundations—it started six or seven months ago. Al Shaya is also investing. Many US companies invest here in real estate. Al Shaya is our client, and we have them in Jeddah and Riyadh. In the coming years we will hire more staff and more lawyers, and we have recently hired two additional lawyers. We are preparing for 2018 and investing for the future. Most large companies do the same. If we do not prepare ourselves for bad economic times, it is our fault. We should always have something for the down cycle. It is not going up in one direction; it must go down and up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main objectives and achievements of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment? </h4><p>In response to the current economic challenges, Saudi Arabia has taken several steps to enhance the power of the Saudi economy and increase its effectiveness. Therefore, a restructure within the Ministry of Commerce has been made to include the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) under MCI. Thus, the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises was established to effectively contribute to the realization of the Kingdom's Vision 2030, taking into consideration a number of strategic objectives that include: ensuring fair trade between consumer and seller, creating consumer's confidence with products sold in the market, raising the culture of entrepreneurship, increasing the contribution of SMEs to GDP, increasing job opportunities provided by SMEs, promoting and increasing consumer's awareness, and increasing the level of competitiveness of local products and services. In a joint effort with the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment has pledged to introduce a number of mechanisms to empower and support the role played by SMEs in the local economy. </p><h4>Which initiatives relating to the SME sector have you launched, and how will they impact the economic reforms of Vision 2030? </h4><p>Taking into consideration the importance of SME sector as a major factor of the local economy, the General Authority of SMEs has been established, which aims to increase the contribution of small and medium enterprises to GDP, as well as to create job opportunities, also to promote and support the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Accordingly, a number of initiatives have been launched to achieve the objectives of the Authority, such as introducing business accelerators and incubators and entrepreneurs centers, where these facilities are concerned with providing support and services to entrepreneurs and the emerging SMEs. Second, we are launching applications and services for SMEs sector, thus supporting the small and medium enterprises with various electronic programs designed specifically for SMEs, including offering and presenting opportunities, cloud e-services, training and consulting services, and a job platform. Third, we are encouraging an initiative that seeks to enhance the status of the commercial franchise in the country, by introducing the franchise system, as well as helping the Saudi Franchise Association to be successful, besides spreading the culture and awareness of the franchise among the local investors. Fourth, we are enhancing the contribution of small and medium enterprises by facilitating the necessary procedures, so that they would be able to compete in the public and private sectors. Fifth, we are launching a SMEs Data Center initiative, which is a statistical database, representing the historical and current data and the future forecasts for the SMEs sector. We are also revamping financing services and the relevant solutions to support the SMEs sector by creating direct or indirect new financing sources. </p><h4>How does the Ministry of Commerce and Investment expect the Saudi investment environment to change based on Vision 2030? </h4><p>In line with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment's mission to enhance the capabilities of the trade and investment sectors and to protect the interests of the beneficiaries through the development and formulation of effective policies and implementing mechanisms that contribute to sustainable economic development, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment has set out 18 strategic objectives, which are: creating investment opportunities, enhancing competitiveness and the business environment, promoting foreign trade, guaranteeing fair trade, enhancing the productivity of the commercial sector, providing strategic goods and input, developing small and medium enterprises, supporting major large companies, developing the investment companies section, enhancing the national quality infrastructure, developing and empowering chambers of commerce and industry, updating and promoting rules and regulations, promoting distinguished professional services, developing the capacity of manpower and human cadres within MCI, developing governance systems and improving the operation model relevant to MCI, updating and digitizing information technology and data analysis, supporting decision making, and strategizing internal and external communication.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At the outset of this talk, can you give us an idea about the Colleges of Excellence?</h4><p>The Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) established Colleges of Excellence (CoE) a limited liability company in 2013, for the purpose of expanding and improving the quality of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CoE operates through three distinct models: the International Technical Colleges (ITCs), the Strategic Partnerships (SPs), and the Capability Building Contract model (CBC). A fourth model has been introduced recently which is for customized training for employment. ITCs are operated by international training providers to ensure high quality technical and vocational training and to prepare Saudi youth for the labor market. CoE currently oversees the operation of 31 ITCs, 14 male colleges, and 17 female colleges. One more college is also overseen by CoE that offers bachelor degree in Applied Engineering. SPs are highly specialized training institutes established in partnership with both the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF), and the private sector. All SP trainees are enrolled in training programs by signing an employment contract with a specific employer. Thus, trainees are employed from day one of their training and are guaranteed employment upon successful graduation. HRDF supports employers by funding a portion of the cost. However, the employer is responsible for the remainder of the cost. Currently, there are 24 institutes in different sectors and locations across the Kingdom. The CBC program aims to transform current traditional TVTC training units by contracting international training providers to work alongside the existing units and enhance their performance. This program aims to enable traditional TVTC training units to reach the highest international standards and to improve outcomes. Last but not least, “customized training for employment“ also known as short training courses, is very similar to the SP model. However, there are two key differentiating factors. First, the duration of the training program is a lot longer in SP institutes. Second, the Human Resource Development Fund generally covers the full cost of training unlike the SP model. This model is the most flexible of all, and has been utilized in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, to rehabilitate recipients of health degrees with low-level competencies, and to be a bridge for natural science graduates to enter the health sector.</p><h4>How does the CoE differentiate itself in the TVET system in the Kingdom?</h4><p>When TVTC embarked on planning and establishing the CoE, it was blessed with the support of His Majesty the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The Kingdom's leadership firmly believes in the mission of CoE, which is to provide Saudi youth with relevant skill sets  in preparation to enter the labor market. Likewise, the support of the kingdoms leadership has been firmly rooted in the National Transformation Program (NTP) of 2020, and the Kingdom's vision of 2030, where TVET plays a vital role. What differentiates our programs is the way we conduct our business. First and foremost, comes our attention to high quality standards throughout all stages of the training process. This includes training methods and curricula, administration policies, and third party quality assurance, such as Saudi Skills Standards (SSS), in addition to other internationally renowned quality assurance and accreditation bodies. It should be noted that CoE depends solely on international expertise; this alludes to the fact that English is a mandatory competence for all trainees. Moreover, internally CoE has a highly qualified education team who is specialized in TVET quality assurance. The team conducts routine field visits and raises periodic reports about various colleges and institutes. Another criterion that differentiates CoE from others is its updated five-year strategy (2016-2020). This strategy has been pioneered by renowned international consultant agencies. The five-year strategy ensures alignment with the vision of 2030 and the NTP of 2020. Furthermore, a new branding identity has also been launched simultaneously with the new strategy. The third point I will mention in this regard is our flexibility in catering to the demand of the national labor market. CoE offers numerous specializations through ITCs, SPs, and customizable training for employment. Durations of training programs can be long or short depending on an employer's labor demand. Furthermore, training units are very well distributed over the kingdom. In conclusion, international standards and benchmarks, flexibility in specializations and durations, quality assurance, logistics, and strategic alignment with national interests and objectives, are the primary components of CoE's uniqueness and value proposition.</p><h4>Where did the idea to set up the aviation college come from and who are your partners in this college?</h4><p>A decade or more ago TVTC started planning to provide the aviation sector in Saudi Arabia with highly skilled technicians. Over the last decade, TVTC has worked closely and diligently with Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus, and Saudi Airlines to determine what different types of skills the sector is looking for, and to determine the number of technicians needed. In 2013 with relentless efforts and strong determination CoE with the support of its primary stakeholder TVTC, established a state-of-the-art technical college in the area of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh to provide the Kingdom's aviation sector with highly skilled national technicians. The development of the curriculum and the entire setup was done in collaboration with several parties. Subsequently, through a robust tendering process, CoE attracted the best international training providers in the field. As a result, Australian Aviation College was awarded the contract to operate and maintain the “International Aviation Technical College at Riyadh.“ Many employers have developed partnerships with the college by sponsoring trainees, to secure qualified national technicians. The Saudi Royal Air force is the college's largest sponsor. Also other branches of the Ministry of Defense have shown interest in sponsoring trainees.</p><h4>What do you look for in partners and sectors when you are selecting them to work with?</h4><p>We have a rigorous selection process for the international training providers. Before we select a training provider, we have pre-qualifications process and other criteria that must be met. CoE's aspirations and anticipations are nothing less than excellence, and with that spirit all procurement and tendering is carried out. The sectors that we are currently looking into are characterized with job growth and suitable occupations for Saudi nationals. It is key to understand that CoE's strategy for choosing sectors depends significantly on the national strategy.</p><h4>What other sectors are you examining now?</h4><p>As previously mentioned, we are looking for sectors characterized with job growth and suitable occupations for Saudi nationals. Moreover, in our efforts to be aligned with the national strategy, CoE is currently looking to expand in areas of renewable energy, mining, and maritime.</p><h4>How do students benefit from close partnerships with the private sector?</h4><p>As previously mentioned, all SP trainees sign an agreement with a partnering employer as soon as they are enrolled. Upon signing, they are immediately considered to be employed. Such programs are known as “employment starting with training“. The employer bares the cost of training and the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) assists the employer by reimbursing a portion of the training cost. The Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) and CoE only provide the building and some other basic equipment. However, the training provider in collaboration with the Employer, provide the main lab equipment and any other remaining equipment. CoE oversees the operation of a state-of-the-art institute for plastic manufacturing in Riyadh's Industrial region, and the operation of an institute for mining in the northern region of the Kingdom. The mining institute was established in partnership with Ma'aden in 2012. Currently there are about 24 SP institutes, the objective by 2020 is to have 35 SP institutes and to have trained more than 1 million nationals. We are proud of the institutes we have established, which are all state-of-the-art facilities and cover a number of different sectors. CoE contracts different training providers from the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Spain. Each of our partners brings a different variety of resources, rich and diversified. CoE is keen on selecting only the best from abroad to build, develop, and enhance the national workforce of the kingdom. The first pillar of Vision 2030 is to develop human resources. We need strong vocational education and specialized training; and we are committed to that. CoE has a solid conviction that its collaboration with International training providers (ITPs) is governed by strategic importance. Thus, CoE is looking into genuine partnerships, where both parties are committed to a long-term prosperous relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones have you been able to achieve in the past year?</h4><p>A tough year, 2016 saw sluggish demand, and Dubai is always a competitive market. Yet we still achieved more than 4% of our occupancy target and closed revenue per available room at an impressive 90% for our 299-room hotel. Our location, Al Barsha, is one of the biggest hubs for hotels making it even more competitive. When we opened in 2010 there were five hotels here and now there are 65. We believe that the intense competition helps us to thrive, to challenge ourselves, and hold every aspect of our hotel to a higher standard. 2016 was a success for Ramada Chelsea with a strong percentage of occupancy and ending the year with high revenues.</p><h4>How would you assess growth in the Dubai tourism market?</h4><p>For each of our 12 years being here in Dubai, we have achieved growth in line with the city's growth. New markets continue to open, old markets are flourishing, and the Emirate is doing well as we approach 2020, where we expect a further boom. The buildup to Expo 2020 will include building infrastructure, roads, and retail facilities, which will directly impact the hospitality industry as well. The government itself supports the industry through cooperation with the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) and Dubai Tourism on promotion through roadshows and inviting hotels onto different platforms of promotion in foreign countries. The best feather in the cap is creating visas on arrival for Chinese passport holders and permitting any Indian passport holder with a valid US visa, a visa on arrival. This illustrates the commitment of the Dubai government to be involved in supporting the industry and developing a stronger hospitality sector.</p><h4>Do you host many guests from the Far East?</h4><p>We receive a lot of guests from the East, mostly China. The majority of our guests come from Germany, occupying nearly 60 to 70 rooms every day. We receive guests from all over the EU, France, Austria, and Italy. Our other largest customer group is the GCC, particularly Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What opportunities have been made available by your central location?</h4><p>Internet City is quite competitive because there are a lot of hotels located in the telecoms area in general. In terms of attracting customers, Internet City helps, and Jebel Ali Free Zone helps as well, but the greatest unique selling point is being walking distance from the Mall of Emirates. This is why within a radius of one kilometer you will find over 65 hotels. We heavily promote that we are in walking distance to the Mall of Emirates as our primary USP as Dubai is major shopping hub for the entire region.</p><h4>How have user-review websites affected your business?</h4><p>User-review websites can often offer a deciding factor in terms of choosing a hotel, as guests go to the portal, check ratings, and measure what they are looking for against extensive reviews. Reviews play a major role in instructing and directing our internal development so that we can operate at peak levels in accordance to our guest's preferences. Therefore, next time, we can provide a better overall experience for them and all future guests. Other services like AirBnB have been in place for a long time and do not affect the hospitality sector. We offer a something more extensive than a room or an apartment with full service rooms, bar and restaurant options, and other services. Competition is important for us to do better and is instrumental in informing our strategy to better to achieve our operational goals. Because of both the nature and magnitude of the market, if someone can survive in Dubai, they can survive anywhere in the world.</p><h4>How does Ramada Chelsea differentiate itself from the competition?</h4><p>While every hotel has similar rooms, here we pride ourselves on our F&amp;B options and uniqueness it brings to our property. We have five dining options: an authentic Indian restaurant with live classical music each night. We have a sports bar with a British band playing five nights a week. Then we have the Arabic restaurant, which offers guests Shisha and Arabic cuisine. We also have a Chinese restaurant, as well as a 24-hour dining restaurant. The sports bar is the official sports bar for Glasgow Rangers fans and is one of the most popular in Al Barsha and is packed each night. Five days a week we have a band playing from 9:30pm to 2am, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings we have Premier League football. Giving guests five distinctly different cuisines to choose from offers not only accommodation for any taste, but also an inclusive experience at our hotel.</p><h4>What kinds of opportunities and challenges are presented by offering such a mixed cultural cocktail?</h4><p>Our Arabic restaurant Mezz is one of the top choices for the GCC guests. We have channels so that guests can be segregated if they choose to be. Sometimes guests prefer to retain their privacy within the confines of their own tradition and culture. Other times they choose to mix together, for which we provide several options. The main challenges we are facing are with new hotels opening. In the next four to six months we are expecting another five or six hotels to open in Al Barsha alone. And as we were the fifth hotel to open here, our success has led others to replicate what we have done. While this competition may take away a small amount of business it ultimately forces us to continue to improve, offer new products, and chase innovation. In other words, it makes us pull our socks up and continue to be the best.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the recent achievements at Flynas in terms of your fleet, routes, and operations?</h4><p>Flynas was proud to announce a record order for the region of 120 Airbus 320NEO family aircraft. This deal was concluded at the end of 2016 and will see the new aircraft being delivered to Flynas as of 3Q2018. This is a very exciting time for aviation in KSA with the arrival of the latest technology in both airframes and engines. The expectation is that these aircraft will immediately save 15% on fuel due to the updated designs. This will give Flynas the opportunity over the coming 10 years to have one of the youngest fleets in the region. We have a wonderful partnership with Etihad Airways, where we codeshare flights into Abu Dhabi from both Riyadh and Jeddah. There is only a certain volume of passengers who would typically want to fly between Riyadh or Jeddah and Abu Dhabi as a point-to-point trip, so the balance of passengers on board those flights will be flying onward on the Etihad network. We can reach further and offer long-haul services, but we do not actually have to do the long-haul flights ourselves. Flynas opened up a new base in Dammam in November 2015 and we have three aircraft there now. It is a very strong addition to our[PB1]  network. In addition we also codeshare with Pegasus in Turkey giving us a reach into five major Turkish destinations, and we intend to expand this over time. Recently we started flying A319 aircraft from our newest base in Abha where we are working with the government to service five smaller airports in the South.</p><h4>Is your plan to continue to give passengers more options with your flights?</h4><p>We see our expertise in the three-and-a-half to four-hour flight duration. We still see ourselves as a regional carrier, though up to 70% of our flights are within Saudi Arabia. With a number of airports being upgraded and improved in the Kingdom, we see the domestic market becoming very vibrant in the years to come. Internationally we fly to Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Sudan, Turkey, and the UAE. We see our domestic responsibility as a Saudi national carrier as important, as this is the biggest single market in the Middle East. There are two major things that Saudi Arabia's General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has done to improve connectivity around the Kingdom. These are both public service obligation (PSO) rights that have been awarded to the Abha base. This will open up the smaller cities in that region through one hub from where passengers can connect to other parts of the country or to international destinations.</p><h4>How do you expect Vision 2030 to affect the aviation industry in Saudi Arabia? How is Flynas positioning itself for the expected increase in Hajj and Umrah visitors?</h4><p>The main way of getting people into Saudi Arabia is by air. The Muslim world is expanding, and people coming here for Umrah or the Hajj have little choice but to fly. The aviation industry should benefit greatly from this. We have a separate division that was set up to serve the Hajj market and by extension Umrah as well. For the Hajj we have served around 17 different countries, many of them in West Africa and some in the former Soviet Union. These are charter flights that we arrange with the governments of these countries, and we are the serving carrier. In order to do this, we need wide-bodied airplanes which we procure on a short-term basis as we do not operate them on a daily basis internally. We do have plans to expand our regular Umrah traffic on a long-haul basis, probably starting with Indonesia and Malaysia. Under the Vision 2030, the idea is that Umrah and the Hajj are effectively operating 11 months of the year now. This makes it more sensible for us to have a longer-term partnership with other airlines and lease their aircraft for longer periods. The extension of the capacity at the two Holy sites and the government's decision to expand the number of visas has greatly improved prospects for this traffic.</p><h4>What are Flynas' expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Everyone was optimistic at the end of 2015, because there were a lot of aircraft being added to the fleets and the price of oil was dropping. However, most airlines will make losses in 2016. Thankfully, Flynas has remained profitable, but it has been a tough year for us. Typically with a drop in oil prices, planes that were sitting idle are more viable, so we have a lot more capacity coming into the market. As a result, we have seen a lot more competition. With too much capacity usually the price drops. We are hoping that sense will prevail, especially from the state carriers that have a lot of large aircraft to keep busy. We would expect 2017 to be a year of consolidation. We are not immune to the economic conditions, as 70% of our guests are Saudis and there is less disposable income in the country at the moment. We are well positioned as a low-cost carrier and therefore we will be the choice for customers who want to save some money while getting excellent service. We will keep pushing both our on-time performance and our price. We have fantastic operations teams, efficiency, and friendly staff, which help us to maintain the profitability we have so far.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What value does JRE add to the market and what is your strategy to be the real estate industry leader in Qatar?</h4><p>JRE is a real estate investment company that offers an extensive range of real estate solutions, from sales and leasing to marketing communications, property management, facilities management, and development management. Our business plan differs from the conventional way the local market has been working. Our offer is more engineered, more institutional, and more selective with the products under our portfolio. These services set us apart from the competition as we provide the sale and leasing of some of the finest real estate in Qatar and beyond. Our new sales center is a one-stop-shop for real estate solutions and demonstrates our commitment to offering our clients a 360-degree service. During the first successful year of operations, which drove us forward in Qatar and beyond, we have tapped into the international market with projects in the US, UK, and Turkey. As we continue to grow, we will remain true to our core values of honesty and integrity and will continue building a deep level of trust and a strong bond with our clients. We have built a large database of individuals and companies to whom we can provide real estate services. We are not into mass production; we have a unique property offer that creates value for our client as a return on investment as well as a comfortable living and location.</p><h4>Last year, JRE unveiled its flagship development, THE e18hteen. What makes this project unique in Qatar and how do you assess its attractiveness to become a business hub in Lusail?</h4><p>THE e18hteen is a modern design masterpiece. Inspired by the historic Qatar dhow, the building was purposely created for its Lusail Marina location, with the exterior façade of the podium level designed to look like rippling water. The building's designers considered every detail, down to the sheltered principle entrance that corresponds to the direction of the mainly north-westerly winds experienced in the area. THE e18hteen is attractive to corporate tenants because of the 360-degree business and leisure services available. Today's business tenants demand fully integrated services and in order to meet those needs, and THE e18hteen is equipped with premium quality amenities, including the latest in high-tech office solutions and spacious luxury meeting rooms, high-end restaurants, cafés, exclusive business lounge and retail outlets, with the additional benefit of stunning views over the Arabian Gulf. It has access to banking facilities and a state-of-the-art gym further highlight how the complex caters to the daily needs of office staff, helping to reduce stress and potentially boost productivity. Overall, we are offering something that is not on the market. That uniqueness extends further in that THE e18hteen offers buying options for local and expatriate investors, which is rare in the Qatari market.</p><h4>Qatar enjoys a wide offer of hospitality and entertainment, including retail, F&amp;B, and hotels. How do you combine these features in your portfolio?</h4><p>All of JRE's projects are located in premier locations and are intricately designed to cater for every need in order to deliver a complete luxury experience. For example, THE e18hteen is more than just a commercial tower. The inclusion of a gym, high-end dining options, and an exclusive business lounge, as well as retail outlets demonstrates our dedication to offering unrivalled amenities. Similarly, The View Residence is a destination of modern living incorporating a fitness center, resort-style swimming pool and stunning views and quality dining outlets in one location. Jenan, located in Lusail's Marina district, stands out due to its focus on tenant wellbeing. With its blend of luxury apartments and retail space it represents a fantastic investment opportunity. Additional features such as a minimart, dining options, a swimming pool, and a fitness center make it attractive to a wide range of tenants. Meanwhile, La Verna Villas and Residences is ideal for family living with appropriate amenities and stylish villas designed with the Qatari culture in mind. By highlighting just a few of the properties in our portfolio you can see the desire we have to go beyond the ordinary in terms of delivering quality real estate solutions.</p><h4>With operations already in the UK, Turkey, and the US, what are your plans to expand your presence internationally?</h4><p>Our primary focus is on the local market, which accounts for the 85% of our operations. However, our plans to grow will see JRE explore new options and avenues for our clients in the international markets, which will in turn help us to further diversify and vary our portfolio and enhance our reputation as an international real estate leader. We have already made great strides elsewhere in the world and now offer sales and leasing opportunities in three major properties in the UK. Riverwalk, Chiltern Place, and The Heron are high-end, ultra-modern residential buildings in the heart of London, offering unlimited opportunities for our clients. In the US, we see opportunities in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles, where I know a lot of good developers. Eighty Seven Park, located on Miami beach, is a unique holistic residential location that offers unmatched investment opportunities. Surrounded on one side by stunning parkland and pristine beach on the other, Eighty Seven Park is focused around community and family, yet is just 10 minutes from the world-famous cultural hub of South Beach and the lavish Bal Harbour Shops. We also offer unique investment opportunities in New York in the form of 75 Kenmare, a stunning, ultra-modern upscale development of 38 homes situated in the cosmopolitan hub of NoLita, at the crossroads of historic Manhattan neighborhoods NoHo, SoHo, Little Italy and Chinatown. JRE has also moved into the Turkish real estate market, where we manage the Quasar &amp; Fairmont Residence Istanbul, an all-inclusive property comprising a residential tower under Quasar branding, office space and the Fairmont Residence and Hotel Tower, which incorporates a street-level shopping arcade.</p><h4>What is your analysis of the current status of Qatar's real estate market and what are the future trends and development projects that are going to lead the way in the country?</h4><p>The Qatari real estate market is buoyant as the government of Qatar continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and mega projects, such as the new Doha Port and Qatar Rail's project, and the population continues to grow rapidly. Together, this will result in strong demand for both residential property and commercial opportunities. With construction continuing apace for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Qatar National Vision 2030 in full swing there will be a plethora of prospects for investors and tenants and we strongly believe Qatar will continue to be a benchmark for the regional real estate sector.</p><h4>What premium projects are you unveiling this year and what are your expectations for the 12 months ahead?</h4><p>In addition to our new real estate sales center that was launched in March 2017, we are currently working on more than seven projects in Qatar, a mix of residential and commercial, while continuing with our expansion beyond Qatar territories, with projects in the UK, the US and, Turkey. We now facilitate opportunities in three major projects in the UK: Riverwalk, an ultra-modern apartment development situated in Westminster, on the banks of London's River Thames; Chiltern Place, a high-end living complex in Marylebone Village, offering the latest in interior design and stunning views over the city of London; and The Heron, a 36-storey residential tower with special features including an eight-story atrium, stunning duplex penthouses, and an exclusive private residents' club. We will continue to facilitate and grow the opportunities in the aforementioned projects in the US and Turkey, while continuing to expand our expertise and footprint in those markets to explore further avenues for our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Two major five-year strategic plans have been completed and now LAU is gearing up to launch its third five-year strategic plan. What are the main highlights of this?</h4><p>Our new strategic plan is composed of three primary pillars. The first relates to the university's intellectual capital and we are working to take this to the next level in terms of research and faculty and staff. The second goal relates to our pedagogy. At LAU we no longer talk about teaching, but rather about learning and professors and students coming together to learn. To ensure that our students are part of an active learning process, our professors innovate and constantly revise their courses. In parallel, with all our classrooms being smart classrooms, we are striving to use technology to provide our students with the best learning opportunities. LAU without borders comes third. We are looking at how we can be present in the entire region, for example in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Dubai. There are two ways we can do this, either through technology by offering online courses, through a blended approach to education, or by having LAU present as an entity in other countries, which we are exceedingly serious about. I really believe that if people cannot come to our campus then we should take the campus to them. We are already negotiating with a number of countries to do this.</p><h4>How important is this internationalization for LAU and how are your student numbers growing?</h4><p>It is extremely important. We are responsible to provide our students with an education that ensures them that the world is their arena of operation. Technology has removed the barriers to the global exchange of ideas and business and through our curriculum we provide our students with the right framework for global thinking. We want them to look at the world and know they can succeed anywhere. Our Office of International Services partnered with 40 universities across the world to allow our students to be exposed to other cultures. Although globalization has brought down the walls of separation among the nations of the world, it has created many challenges for our young people to address. It has laid bare our differences, which we have not so far been able to deal with peacefully. And despite all its benefits, if you look at the distribution of wealth, it is being concentrated more and more in fewer and fewer countries and within these in fewer and fewer hands. Our students need to be aware of this, so they can address it, and contribute positively to society's improvement. Our student body is steadily growing. We currently have 8,500 students enrolled at LAU, with a healthy presence of international students, and our Byblos campus is continually expanding to accommodate their needs. We also have our Headquarters and Academic Center in New York (LAU NY), where we have been able to create a major bridge of ideas and actions between the US, Lebanon, and the region.</p><h4>How do you assess LAU's relationship with the private sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are an important part of Lebanon's society including the private sector, which is important for us. LAU has in place, and continues to negotiate, agreements with this sector, particularly through our schools and our Continuing Education Program (CEP). Today, for example, banks, industries, and pharmaceutical businesses invest money, experience, and expertise in the education of young people. Without such collaborative efforts between the private and education sectors to respond to the needs of the students there is no future for them. We have to provide young people with the opportunity to have a bright future or there will be no future for us. We are doing well on this front. The private sector has been instrumental in helping us complete our comprehensive campaign, Fulfilling the Promise, and to raise over USD13 million one year ahead of time. This is because apart from wanting to contribute to the education of young people, our benefactors and associates believe in our mission and what we are doing at LAU. They give money for endowments, scholarships, and annual spending for students. We give USD27.5 million in financial aid and scholarships to our students. Some 42% of our students are on some kind of financial aid and we are proud of that. We have made a commitment to ensure that anyone who is qualified has the opportunity to come to LAU. This goes to the heart of our mission, both socially and academically.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for LAU in 2017?</h4><p>LAU is an institution that is always on the move. We don't just have academic projects, but capital ones as well. We are completing two major buildings at our Byblos campus. One is the brand new Engineering Laboratories and Research Center, which has just been fully fitted out with state-of-the-art equipment and is currently being moved into. The other is the library which is scheduled to be completed in the next two years and has guaranteed funding. Our campus at Byblos has grown immeasurably, so we are revamping the infrastructure there. This is a major capital project that is going to cost around USD25 million and we are in the thick of it now. It includes installing nine megawatts of power capacity and ensuring that the campus has enough water. We want to make sure that we have sufficient power for all our needs, including air conditioning and hot water. The campus will have a reservoir and a distribution network going underneath it that will feed into every single building. We expect the project to be completed in a year or so. In Beirut, we purchased (with a part of the price donated by the owner) a major property, known as the Gezairi Building, just off campus, as we needed to expand and space on campus is tight. This building is going to be renovated and become the headquarters for our School of Architecture and Design. We have almost completed the planning phase. At the same time, planning for a new building to house our School of Arts and Sciences is well underway. Liberal arts is one of the main pillars of our philosophy in education and this is important because we believe in the education of the whole person.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some key changes to further involve the private sector in the nation's ports?</h4><p>The port sector was one of the first sectors that privatized its operations through concession agreements and BOT agreements. There were long-term incentives to the private sector to invest and reinvest in the terminal operations and the various ports. This started nearly 20 years ago and everything was based on a revenue sharing model where the incentives of the regulator and the Saudi Port Authority and the operator incentivized to increase volumes and thereby increase revenues for both sides of the concession. Looking forward we see a two-pronged approach to the next round of privatization. We have learned a lot through 20 years of experience about what works and what does not in these long-term concession agreements. We are keen on addressing those deficiencies that imbalance some of the concession concerns over the next 20-30 years. In the future, we see more focus on raising the efficiency of operations vs. ensuring a certain amount of investment. Thereby trying to manage the concession through efficiency gains rather than pure investment numbers. This is building on the great work of the 15-20 years that have gone, and we have three of the top four port operators operating in the Kingdom now. Many if not all of them are keen on investing in the next 20-30 years. We see that overall structure as good but needing improvement, and we are working on the next round of concession agreements and the restructuring of those agreements.</p><h4>Will you restructure any current agreements?</h4><p>Most agreements expire before 2020. For some of the remaining concession agreements we will have to figure out what we will do. We are going to look at a corporatization of the assets that remain within the Saudi Port Authority. That corporatization structure will allow the government through these companies to operate on a more efficient basis, will be better in terms of capital efficiency and operational efficiency, and will allow more commercial flexibility in dealing with the concessionaires. We see an initial stage of granting the Port Authority clearer authorities and will soon thereafter enter a corporatization structure; privatization is another step down the road but we do not see that happening immediately. At this point we have the assets we need for the next 10-20 years within the country. We have been working with customs and other government agencies to streamline this area. It does not matter how much capacity we put on the seaside if our efficiencies and processes and procedures are not supporting that capacity. We do not get the goods out of the ports quickly enough. We have made huge strides as the Port Authority as well as the customs are improving and digitizing. I am confident that within the next year or two that we are going to see significant ease of importing and exporting goods to and from the Kingdom. In fact, we are working on a 24-hour initiative where containers coming into our port in Jeddah and in King Abdullah Port will be processed within 24 hours and this will be rolled out to the rest of our ports before the end of 2017. The last element is hinterland access. Here we have been working with the Ministry of Transport to ensure that we have better rail connections as well as high speed roads or dedicated roads for containers and exiting of the ports.</p><h4>What are some of efforts you have taken in terms of human capacity and work culture?</h4><p>The key to the National Transformation Program and Vision 2030 is not just a new vision of how the economy is structured, but it is a new vision of how government operates. That vision is being cascaded through multiple efforts through KPI driven objectives about demanding efficiencies from government agencies and demanding responsiveness to requests either from the business sector or the citizen, all depending on what sector you are in. We are seeing more demand for being more business friendly and open for business. We are seeing overall opening of data and opening up of better statistics for the country. One of the things we are working on that will be integrated as part of the overall KPI structure of the government is a clearer KPI structures within this organization, SPA, and being developed that will allow them to have a real assessment of where the bottlenecks in our logistics chain within the ports is. As well as customs clearance and all that as well. You are seeing new blood coming into various government agencies all across the kingdom and that is changing the typical work patterns that have existed for decades. We are going to see a significant shift of accountability, which is important. It is not an easy journey but ultimately we will get there.</p><h4>What does that shift imply about the way the authority is run today?</h4><p>My job here is to sweat my assets and not to build something new. It is to make sure I get everything out of the assets that I currently have. The government has spent in excess of SAR40 billion over the past 30-40 years in ports, and we need to make sure that the investment has an adequate return. Not to mention the other SAR10 billion in private investment on top of that. There is an asset base that needs to be sweated and we need a better return on it now and increase volumes as much as you can. Anything that can be done by the private sector will be done by the private sector. There is no desire for the government to crowd out the private sector. My predecessors went down this path and they privatized the operations of the ports. We need to keep down that path and be more aggressive about privatizing as much of these operations as possible.</p><h4>For the rest of 2017 where do you hope to be? What are your goals and what do you hope to accomplish in the next 12 months?</h4><p>The NTP has targets in 2018, and we are expecting our dwell time to be down by seven days. The other thing that we will have accomplished by the end of 2017 is to have a better delineation within authorities between the Saudi Ports Authority. Ensuring the inner sections between the various government agencies is clarified. There are other minor steps along the way in terms of our corporatization process and internal assessments in terms of where we are and overall balance sheets of the operations Saudi port authority. Also by the end of 2017 we should have most of our concession structures done with and possibly some announced, if not sooner than that. The National Transformation Program envisages major changes for logistics by 2030. That includes mostly ports and clearance of goods and so forth and a significant shift in the short term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[walid-abukhaled-ceo-northrop-grumman]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the company sought to build a lasting footprint in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We are here for the long term. We enjoyed more than four decades in the Kingdom and plan to continue with our commitments. We are now focusing on developing the youth of Saudi Arabia to be the future business leaders dealing with the most sophisticated technology.  For example, we work with universities on cyber security and have annual competitions related to cyber security. Last year, the competition was presented by the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense and the winners were immediately recruited by various companies. This is of interest to us because this is exactly what we should do: highlight the importance of cyber security. The most challenging part is building a pipeline of capable Saudis who can be the future business leaders in the high-tech area. Interestingly, last year the winners on all three days were all female, and this sent us signals that is an area we should focus on and look at female empowerment in terms of enhancing their capabilities in ICT technology.</p><h4>To what extent does this fit into Vision 2030?</h4><p>This absolutely aligns with Saudi Vision 2030. We transfer knowledge and work with the youth. We also have other programs where we send Saudi students to the US to work with high-tech startup companies, because our experience is that if we place them with high-tech startups, they will understand what it takes to grow a company from inception to investment, to actually utilizing technologies. They start to get involved in everything, whether it is HR, design, or R&amp;D, so this is a great opportunity to place Saudis through this program. At the same time, we seek a great deal of initiatives where we can transfer our own technology to the Kingdom to not only serve Saudi Arabia, but also the region at large.</p><h4>How much of your business is divided with the MoD and how much goes into training and nurturing the new generation?</h4><p>We have a great history in the Kingdom; however, as a corporate office we started in January 2014. We did not have large B2B deals yet as we worked with universities and other institutions to transfer knowledge and technology. Our work with universities is not related to any obligations like offset. We do it because it is the right thing to do for the community. As we grow and win more business, that amount of work will be multiplied by a large factor. Now there are more opportunities and an important element of every opportunity is related to localization and industrialization. We do not only deal with the Ministry of Defense we also deal with the Ministry of National Guard and our products and capabilities go to the Ministry of Interior. We have two joint ventures in Saudi. Most of the work is done with the Ministry of National Guard by one of our joint venture called “Vinnell Arabia“ and the other is called Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Arabia. Most of the work with the latter is related to strategic site protection with Aramco. Cyber is included because we embed cyber in all our products.</p><h4>Is Saudi Arabia diversifying its defense mix more and more to deal with other countries?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has always held a position of diversifying its procurement. A large majority of that procurement was with the US, due to the fact that the US is undoubtedly the most advanced country in the world when it comes to defense technology. It has the most advanced working system, the most advanced defense system, and so on. When it comes to the amount of money it spends on R&amp;D, no one compares. That is why we are extremely positive that defense trade with the US will remain the highest. From Northrop Grumman's perspective, regardless of the rapid political changes happening both in the US and the Middle East, we are absolutely confident the strong alliance between Saudi Arabia and the US will remain strong, and that we will continue to support each other in security and defense matters for many years to come.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We all know 2016 was not a great year as there were many issues and the price of oil dropped by more than 50%. 2017 will be different and we are positive about it. We will not see the effect of Vision 2030 and the transformation before 3Q2017. In 4Q2017 people, the economy, and businesses will start to feel the positive impact. The Kingdom has looked at the government procurement systems and processes and has re-engineered them to make them more efficient and transparent. All of this will be great for the economy. There remains many good opportunities in the Kingdom. Northrop Grumman has designed and built one of the most advanced C4I systems and a world leader in Cyber security. We are standing by for a large sustainable program related to logistics and after-sales support for big platforms. With all these, we hope the coming years to be great for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the expanded Panama Canal reshaped the international maritime and logistics landscape?</h4><p>Panama has played a vital role in the logistics sector at the regional level and in this context the expansion of the Panama Canal was another boost to the many private investments in the maritime logistics and infrastructure industry in the country. It was truly a vital complement to the millions of dollars in investments from maritime operators as well as those companies operating within the sector. Subsequently, reports from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean have positioned Panama as the main logistics hub in the Americas. This was a result of the joint efforts from the many parties involved in that. We can proudly say Panama is the efficient merging of public investment and the belief of the private sector in the development of a common goal and idea: Panama becoming the main logistics hub in the entire region.</p><h4>How do you encourage cooperation between private and public sectors to empower the performance of this strategic segment of the national economy?</h4><p>The AMP facilitates maritime trade in the country. Our administration also works towards facilitating formalities for our users in other organizations; for example, the Maritime Chamber of Commerce closely works with the Migration Authority, the Customs Authority, the Ministry of Environment, and so on. We believe this close cooperation with other organizations in the country has been a key enabling point for the development for the development of the industry and for reaching common goals.</p><h4>Panama will be the host country of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) World Maritime Day, whose theme will be “Connecting Ships, Ports, and People.“ What can Panama impart to the international community about operating in the maritime industry?</h4><p>This achievement proves the relevance of Panama within the international maritime industry and of the efficient service the country provides to the industry. It was also a gesture of trust from our peers in the IMO. We must highlight that the subject chosen is a clear representation of the characteristic of the Panamanian maritime industry; we are a global logistics platform that integrates the industry and represents more than 300,000 marines. We are the country with the largest registry of international vessels. There was no better choice for a country to host such an important event. The date will also commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the international ship registry for Panama. We have been promoting global trade for 100 years and this is the message we want to send at the event. Our long-term contribution to global maritime trade has to do with enabling and supporting maritime operators in their efforts to enact the highest international safety standards for vessels; at the same time, we protect people working at sea through the application of global labor agreements.</p><h4>What is the commitment of the ministry in the development of human resources to serve the local maritime industry?</h4><p>We emphasize the importance of education and the need to promote studies in maritime and logistics sciences. For example, we traveled with President Juan Carlos Valera in his visit to Singapore to find out more on its activity with institutes of higher learning. We have begun to emulate that to address the need of human resources. We talk about international know-how transfer through partnerships. Our administration supports and promotes the development of human resources; it is important for young people in the country to see the many opportunities around these industries. The better qualified they are, the greater success they can achieve.</p><h4>Can you share some details of the recently approved collaboration between AMP and the Port of Hamburg?</h4><p>One of the top projects for President Varela this term is the development of a maritime port for cruises in the Pacific in the Amador area. In this context, we started joint work and efforts to lift a sheet with the support of the Presidency Project Unit. This will lead to an international tender process for the construction of that port. We have seen great interest from architects and dragging companies in this project. The tender will be decided in March 2017, and we foresee the finalization of this project within 18 months. A visit to the Port of Hamburg was envisaged within Panama's potential in the industry and the efficiency of the human resources of the public sector. The Port of Hamburg is one of the best examples in terms of port management and we signed a cooperation agreement with it to emulate its operations and facilitate the technical capabilities and regulations for the successful operation of this new maritime port in Amador. There will be no exclusivity whatsoever in terms of only a cruise operator monopolizing operations in this new facility. During another visit to Miami, cruise operators had advised that in order to avoid that monopoly, the state should manage operations in the port in an efficient way.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The most important activity for this year will be the celebration of the World Maritime Day in October 2017. At the same time, we need to emphasize the message that Panama has proven its technical capability and strength as international service platform, especially in sectors such as maritime and logistics. We will also leverage resources from the maritime industry to have a positive and valuable impact on local communities that require the support of the state. This administration has managed to establish within all tender contracts a percentage that needs to be allocated to the development of social maritime projects in the local communities. It is extremely important for us to integrate economic development with the social and sustainable development of our people. This is one of our top priorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the significance of President Solí­s' visit to the UAE and how would you assess the success of the trip?</h4><p>The visit set the tone for the initial chapter of relations between the UAE and Costa Rica. We have been building this relationship over the course of the last 18 months in an active and ambitious manner. To put this in perspective, during recent months I have met with my Emirati counterpart, HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on five occasions, I have visited the Emirates three times before now, and my counterpart visited Costa Rica in February 2016. With the visit of President Solí­s to the UAE and his participation as a key speaker in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week we have sealed a relationship that looks to be both promising and enduring. We are visiting the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah, and would have visited them all had time permitted. The UAE is a long way for any Latin American dignitary to come on a state visit, but our relationship with this country is so important that we embarked on a single visit to the UAE. During this visit we have opened our first embassy in the UAE, which represents a landmark for the bilateral relationship since we longed to have physical presence in this country to facilitate the plans we have for both nations.</p><h4>What objectives did you pursue during this visit and how will they propel business opportunities for both parties?</h4><p>We want the Emirates to look for opportunities in Costa Rica. We want to share a win-win relationship as we see a lot of trade opportunities for us both. Relations at the official level are as strong as they can be, and now we want to encourage the business communities of both sides to try their chances in the UAE or Costa Rica. There are a number of opportunities for Emiratis to invest in Costa Rica, and we intend to be the Emirates' strategic partner in Central America and the Caribbean. We have an extensive network of trade agreements that can benefit companies that want to enter markets in this region. We have solid, friendly relations with our Latin American peers to work as a platform for the expansion of business opportunities. Likewise, the UAE represents the door to the GCC markets for us. We have opened a trade agency in Dubai, which will cater for business opportunities at a regional level. We have solid relations with the UAE and Qatar, and we want to expand to the other markets in the region as well. We have confirmed our participation in Dubai Expo 2020, and we have signed an agreement to eliminate the visa for both of our citizens to travel freely between both destinations, and most importantly we foresee a great future for mutual ties.</p><h4>Costa Rica was one of the guests of honor during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. What is the significance of your country's participation in this event and how can both countries share experiences on the matter?</h4><p>The invitation to Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week was an honor for us because it is in recognition of the effort Costa Rica has put into renewable energies over the years. Energy efficiency and eco-friendly policies are the global trend now, but Costa Rica embarked on this process 60 years ago; it has become part of our national DNA. Today Costa Rica produces 99% of its energy and electricity using renewable resources and we are keen on maintaining that figure and sharing our experience with other nations. We acknowledge that spreading the word on environmental policies requires international solidarity and in the UAE we have found the ideal partner to promote these policies. This practices go beyond current events or temporary circumstances; they become long-standing practices that countries should embrace for the sake of their own future. The fact that Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, the most high profile event on this topic, has been taking place for nine years reflects the openness of the UAE's leadership to sharing its experiences all around the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is QF unlocking the human, social, and economic development of Qatar and contributing to its progress through its education, science, and research programs?</h4><p>We began with a vision to provide Qatar with quality education more than two decades ago, and this vision is now being realized. Education City is a unique concept; there is no place quite like it anywhere in the world. It houses a range of world-class multidisciplinary education and research facilities, from our QF schools to our international partner universities and our homegrown, Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU), all in the same proximity. Together, these institutions offer high-quality education opportunities that empower and support young people from their first day of school right through to postgraduate level. But education is just the beginning of what we do. Our emphasis on research and innovation allows us to address Qatar's national priorities and grand challenges. From energy and environment to computing and biomedical research, our students, faculty, and researchers make breakthroughs every day. Away from the labs and lecture halls, our community development projects help to foster tangible social engagement opportunities and promote our country's culture and heritage. We are fortunate to partner with leading local and international organizations on many of our community initiatives.</p><h4>What is going to define your strategy as the new CEO of QF?</h4><p>As advocates of lifelong learning, we will continue to foster a culture of creativity and innovation in education that provides our future generations with the skills and knowledge that will be relevant in tomorrow's world. Our young people are emerging as highly competent problem solvers, and we will ensure we build on our innovative R&amp;D ecosystem to inspire and empower them to become the entrepreneurs, researchers, and scientists of the future. We are also committed to further engaging with the wider community, including local and international stakeholders and partners, to foster social engagement and promote our country's culture and heritage.</p><h4>How would you summarize QF's main milestones in 2016?</h4><p>We celebrated many impactful projects in the last year. For example, in November 2016 we launched our educational 3D edutainment TV series “Siraj," targeting Arabic-speaking children aged two to eight, with engaging content to help them learn the Arabic alphabet in a fun way. We wanted to make Siraj available to children, parents, and teachers anytime everywhere, so we made it available on YouTube and created our Siraj app to further enhance the learning experience with engaging interactive games. Our World Innovation Summit on Health (WISH) 2016 proved the largest summit since the initiative began in 2013, with more than 1,400 delegates from over 100 countries, including ministry-level representatives attending. The summit proved hugely successful in allowing all these stakeholders to collaborate and find cross-border solutions to global healthcare issues. In mid-2016 we launched Renad Academy, which is a school dedicated to children diagnosed with mild to moderate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The facility aims to inspire acceptance, trust and success, and will help our students reach their full potential. Also in 2016, Qatar Foundation Research &amp; Development helped to stimulate and advance innovation across the MENA region through an MoU signed with 500 startups. The initiative actively helps start-ups achieve market traction and scale, using strategies mastered by tech companies in Silicon Valley.</p><h4>How is QF working toward the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage at sites like Education City?</h4><p>Preserving and sharing our local and regional culture is hugely important to us. Our “Restoration of Historic Structures Project" is now actively focused on the restoration of structures in the old Al Rayyan quarter, now within Education City. These structures, which date back to the early 20th century, serve as an important reminder of Qatar's architectural heritage. We are confident that the restoration of these structures will create a compelling attraction for visitors and give the public an understanding of the changing nature of their community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What significance does Alissa Group's recent professionalization of its management have in a region where many family groups are just starting to do the same?</h4><p>The group has developed strong foundations over the past seven decades in many sectors of our economy, allowing us to position ourselves at the forefront of several of them, particularly the leasing and automotive sectors where we have played pioneering roles. As we continue to build on the core values and principles of our late founder, which have made us one of the most significant economic groups in the country, we are also resolutely working on strengthening our corporate governance culture and expanding our opportunity-set by investing in the key drivers of business sustainability, namely our vision, our people, our culture, and our strategy. The degree of our future success will be commensurate to our level of commitment to these causes.</p><h4>How do these recent changes fit with the goals of the recent reforms in the Kingdom?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the goals of the 2020 National Transformation Program are both noble and ambitious, but I'm concerned that the accelerated implementation of the Program is loosening the very bedrock upon which the pillars of the new economy are set to be built, at least in the short-run. Indeed, the Kingdom has witnessed an unprecedented and unfortunately largely self-inflicted economic slowdown born from a misjudged oil policy that traces its roots back to H2 2014; the beginning of the two-pronged Saudi led oil market offensive on high-cost oil producers in the West and the resurgent economic and political thirst of Iran in the East. Having now fallen short of achieving its overarching objective of preserving market share, Saudi oil policy is clearly showing signs of fatigue (evidenced by the Vienna oil-cut compromise in December 2016), but only after many painful months of economic decline. Though I am hopeful that a great portion of the damage has already been done, Saudi companies are nevertheless having to cope with market and policy dynamics that are often at odds with each other. Indeed, the accelerated series of reforms being enacted by policymakers have coincided with a severe economic slowdown, rising interest rates, lower consumer confidence, diminishing disposable income, and higher geopolitical risks to synthesize the perfect economic storm. The government's increasing reliance on the private sector to pick up public sector slack also comes at a time when private sector entities, having borne much of the impact of the reforms (with more to come), are looking to significantly rationalize their workforces and reduce costs and expenses to a minimum. It is worth noting that although the more sophisticated of our people are aligned with the major themes of the transformation program, including the elimination of subsidies, the resizing of the public sector, and the development and employment of Saudis, policymakers will nevertheless continue to find it challenging to generate the required level of societal and private sector commitment to these programs without first transforming the cultural profile of our people from that of “entitled but devoted nationals" to that of “invested and active citizens." This is a delicate journey, but critical to our social evolution as members of the global community.</p><h4>Cultural change in government offices and family holdings has been a consistent topic of discussion for us this year. How are you shaping the culture at Alissa Group?</h4><p>Firstly, I don't see Alissa Group as a family business, but rather a business that has a fiduciary duty to protect and maximize the interests of its shareholders, no matter their constitution. However, as in many Saudi companies, our corporate culture is a subset of our nation's culture, which for many decades has been based on a sense of entitlement, rather than on performance or merit. I firmly believe that during times of reform and transformation, leaders must communicate an inspiring unifying vision which is authentic and compelling enough to win the hearts and minds of their most valuable enabling assets: their people. Leaders must instill a sense of purpose, ownership, and accountability in their people, wrapped in a progressive cultural value system that allows them to flourish in an environment where they feel engaged and empowered. If anything, this is the essence of the leadership role, and the very reason why an enabling people vision should always precede the introduction of a transformational economic vision.</p><h4>You formerly headed the Tadawul, an exchange that has long encouraged family groups to list. What parts of the group are the most likely candidates for a listing either in the main market or the newly established parallel market?</h4><p>Although we plan to list all of our subsidiaries over the coming years, it is too early to make that commitment today, especially in light of the downturn in economic activity and the unanswered question of whether the economy is headed towards a “hard landing". This uncertainty prompts us to be more inwardly focussed on business optimization. This apprehension is being felt by many companies. Indeed, it is not coincidental that 2015 only witnessed four IPOs, followed by three in 2016; the worst two consecutive years for IPOs since 2005 and 2004 respectively. Given the current ECM pipeline, it looks likely that 2017 will be an even more disappointing year for IPOs. As for the newly launched Nomu market (meaning “growth market"), and despite its promising start, I fear that the required market ecosystem and the rules around it have fundamentally strayed from the initial design. Having been the primary advocate and architect of the Nomu market blueprint before leaving the exchange in 2015, I was saddened to see it launched with two essential components critical to protecting investors and enhancing the maturity and sustainability of its constituents absent. I am nevertheless hopeful that these necessary components will be introduced over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. It was also disheartening to see a market that was initially designed to help SMEs expand and contribute to the national economy turn into a venue for founder exits. Indeed, six of the seven offerings in this market were shareholder cash-outs rather than capital raising exercises. This creates a credibility gap for the “growth" market, its constituents, and the regulator whose rules permit such cash-outs.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I fear that the year ahead will pose an existential test for many private sector establishments. Companies with skilled leadership, strong corporate governance, and a dynamic tactical and strategic outlook are likely to survive current and upcoming challenges only to emerge stronger and more resilient. Bold decisions will need to be made. Such decisions must unfortunately be mechanical and absent emotional considerations. For many companies, success in the past was primarily driven by favourable market conditions rather than from differentiating factors. Such conditions have distracted companies from enhancing efficiencies, strengthening controls, and fortifying the foundations required to ensure that their businesses are sustainable during troughs in the economic cycle. The current economic slowdown is now very clearly showing us the significant cracks in corporate foundations. To quote Warren Buffet, “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked." Companies operating under the illusion of “it's business-as-usual" will unfortunately be the first to succumb to the tidal wave of change. With that said, it is encouraging that policymakers are now progressively engaging with the private sector to co-design more balanced government policies that are conducive to improving the commercial, legal, and regulatory landscape. It is for this reason that we continue to be optimistic about the future while we navigate our way through the present.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE was one of the first places you visited after taking up the role of Secretary of State for International Trade. How would you assess the current state of UK-UAE bilateral relations?</h4><p>Relations between the UK and UAE are strong. They have been fortified over many years and date back over two centuries before its formation. We have rich people-to-people links and more than 100,000 British nationals are currently living in the UAE with a further 1.5 million visiting every year. Going the other way, there were nearly 300,000 visitors to the UK from the UAE in the first nine months of 2016, a record number. We collaborate in a broad range of areas because we have shared interests. When our Prime Minister, Theresa May, spoke at the GCC Summit in Manama in December, she stressed that the Gulf's security is the UK's security and that the Gulf's prosperity is the UK's prosperity. By assuring our shared security, we allow prosperity to flourish. More than 5,000 UK companies are operating in the UAE, supporting bilateral trade which is currently worth around GBP13 billion a year. The UK exports more to the GCC than to China and more than twice as much as to India, and we export more to the UAE than to any other market outside Europe except the US, Japan, and China.</p><h4>What pivotal areas do you look forward to deepening for the sake of strengthening this strategic partnership?</h4><p>Leaving the EU will give us the opportunity to reset the agenda and let our partners know that Britain is open for business. The UAE in particular has shown great faith in the strength of the UK economy. Since the vote to leave the EU the UAE's sovereign wealth funds have invested approximately GBP1 billion in gas distribution, offshore wind, and urban regeneration in the UK. The UAE is our 12th-largest export market. UK exports in 2015 were GBP8.55 billion (GBP6.20 billion in goods, GBP2.35 billion in services)—up 37% since 2009. Our market share (4.66%) is greater than those of France and Italy. In the last six months we have seen huge deals in the UAE for BP, which was awarded a 10% stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company's onshore oil concessions, and for Al Futtaim Carillion, which has just won the contract to build three thematic districts for the Dubai Expo 2020 site. My department has identified 217 high-value campaigns around the world where our government can help British business win significant deals over the next few years. Of those 217, 10 are in the UAE, in areas such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, creative industries, and energy.</p><h4>A handful of British companies are reshaping the healthcare and education sectors in the UAE. What is the significance of this legacy for the future of thousands of young people in the UAE?</h4><p>I am proud that UK excellence is in high demand around the world, particularly in these sectors. UK healthcare providers are making a valuable contribution to the thriving healthcare sector in the UAE. UK NHS providers Imperial College London, Moorfields Eye Hospital, King's College London, and the Maudsley Hospital are all operating facilities in the UAE. In addition to this, Alder Hey Children's Hospital are providing consultancy to Al Jalila Children's Hospital in Dubai, and Great Ormond Street Hospital is running a regional clinic coordinating swift referrals back to the UK for complex paediatric cases. The UK is a world leader in education. Four of the top-10 universities, and 18 of the top 100, are in the UK. They are proving to be attractive for the more than 3,000 students from the UAE who come to the UK to study at them every year. But UK education providers are also bringing their expertise to the UAE: 20% of all British universities' overseas presence is located in the UAE; British curriculum schools cater for 33% of all students enrolled at private schools in Dubai and 22% in Abu Dhabi; and, three British universities (Herriot Watt, Middlesex, and Bolton) have full-blown campuses in the UAE. In addition, the British University in Dubai (a UAE institution) has partnerships with Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Cardiff universities. And several other British universities are active in UAE; Exeter, Strathclyde, Salford, Manchester, City University London, London Business School, Bradford, Queens University, and Huddersfield.</p><h4>Some Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds are making significant investments in northern England. How will these investments propel opportunities and spark a mutually beneficial relationship?</h4><p>This government is committed to building a northern powerhouse to help the great cities and towns of the north of England pool their strengths and take on the world. The northern powerhouse is now recognized across the world as home to billions of pounds worth of exciting opportunities for international investors. There is huge potential, driven by our innovative private sector. It is home to 15.2 million people and contains five of the UK's ten largest cities. It accounts for 19% of the UK economy and exports over GBP60 billion worth of goods every year. Its levels of FDI are growing at twice the rate of the rest of the UK. Abu Dhabi has been a pioneer in investment into the north, including over GBP1 billion committed to urban regeneration in Manchester and GBP30 million into a Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre at Manchester University. The UK government too is investing in the north in transport, skills, science and culture. This includes GBP13 billion on transport up to 2020, funding ground breaking scientific projects and supporting exciting arts and sports ventures across the region. This joint approach makes us partners in prosperity. The UK offers the supportive environment that investors need: we are the fifth-largest economy in the world and were the second-fastest growing economy in the G7 last year. We are the highest ranked major economy on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. At 20%, our headline tax rate is the lowest in the G7 and joint lowest in the G20. This will reduce to 19% in April this year, and to 17% in 2020. We also have skills and talent, with four of the world's top-10 universities based in the UK. The UK is simply a great place in which to invest.</p><h4>The UK is looking to further reinforce its ties with the GCC. What is the role the UAE plays to achieve this endeavor?</h4><p>As the Prime Minister said during her address to the GCC leaders, the UK seeks not just to reaffirm a relationship that is of great historic value but to renew a partnership that is absolutely fundamental to our shared future: a partnership in politics, defense, security, development, and commerce. The Prime Minister has been very clear about the scale of our ambition and the extent of our determination to establish the strongest possible trade and investment relationships between the UK and the Gulf. A mechanism to help us achieve this is the new UK-GCC Joint Working Group which will examine how to unblock remaining barriers to trade and take steps further to liberalise our economies. We will work closely will all the members of the GCC as we develop and strengthen our relationship with the entire region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much is the government investing in MICE to further develop tourism in Panama?</h4><p>We have a Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) office and are investing in international firms that focus on the MICE segment, such as IMEX in Las Vegas as well as one in Frankfurt. The demand for events and conferences is growing and there is a great deal of potential here. We are definitely one of the most secure countries in the region and our hotel infrastructure and geographic position also give us an added advantage. There are five direct flights to Panama from various points in Europe that give us another window of opportunity within the MICE segment. Now everything needs to be creative and of high quality. On the hotel side, for example, for events we have modern international hotel chains. It is also important to be innovative with the technology we provide for events.</p><h4>How can Panama market itself as an appealing destination for this niche segment?</h4><p>Participation in international fairs is extremely important; we regularly sponsor events like International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA), which gave us the opportunity to promote what we have in Panama. As a meeting destination, we have the Atlapa Convention Center as well as a new convention center in Amador that is currently under construction and will be ready by the end of 2018. We also focus on developing the interior of the country; we will have another two convention centers in Chiriquí­ and Herrera. We have six daily flights to Chiriquí­ from Panama City with Air Panama and Copa, which connects Chiriquí­ to the rest of the world so there is great opportunity there. There are more than 10,000 rooms available around the country, plus 20,000 rooms in international luxury chains and middle-class chains in Panama City, which gives us many opportunities. For the MICE segment, the most important things are connectivity, hotel infrastructure, and locations to do events; we cover all three areas. We have different airports in the country and the expansion of Tocumen International Airport will be ready at the end of 2018, with 21 gates available in the new terminal. We will have to work with all our assets and put in greater effort into promoting the locations and sponsoring events. We also provide incentives for certain groups and exhibitions. We had the Summit of the Americas in 2016, which received a great deal of exposure.</p><h4>What is the importance of the new Amador Convention Center and how will it stand apart from Atlapa?</h4><p>Amador will be a completely different and modern convention center, with more room for exhibitions. Atlapa, for example, has an amphitheater with a capacity for 2,800 people; however, there will not be a theater in the new convention center because we want it to have more space for exhibitions and larger events. The important thing with the two convention centers is the opportunity to sell Panama as a whole because Panama is not only the Panama Canal. We have culture, history, and adventure. In every single province, there are unique attractions; for example, in Chiriquí­ there are mountains, beaches, and cold and hot climates in the same place.</p><h4>Which countries or markets do you target?</h4><p>We definitely target Latin America; however, the US is the most important area we have to cover. There are also many decision makers in Mexico as well as in Central America. However, as we are growing, we see great opportunities in Europe. Europeans are starting to look at destinations in Latin America because of security issues elsewhere. For us, the main target is the US and then Latin America. We would love to have a 20% increase in the number of rooms for groups and conventions by the end of 2017. We look at the long term and what we are working on now will show results in four to five years. Our regular partnership with ICCA helps a great deal and the most important focus is on technology and medical events. We work closely with medical organizations to attract such events to Panama.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OPEC's overarching ambition is to minimize price volatility in the market. What measures and strategies do you have in the event that oil price drops below the USD50 band?</h4><p>Firstly, let me stress that OPEC does not have a target price. The voluntary production adjustment decisions taken last year by 24 participating countries in Vienna at the 171st Ministerial Conference on November 30, 2017, and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers on December 10, 2017, were specifically focused on bringing forward the market rebalancing, and accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang to the five-year average. The collaborative and timely developments were taken to address the prevailing market realities, which should then lead to the oil price finding its equilibrium level. In terms of volatility, I think all producers, in fact all consumers, would like to minimize price volatility. This is natural. What we need to recognize is that short-term price fluctuations caused by such issues as geopolitics, supply disruptions, economic developments, and weather are natural. They are unavoidable. It is clear we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. However, it is important that we differentiate between such normal fluctuations and those that can be viewed as extreme. Extreme price fluctuations are clearly not conducive to the effective functioning of the market, particularly given the long-term nature of investments in our industry.</p><h4>Qatar's oil output is slated to be lower by more than 11% YoY in 2017. How well has Qatar performed in the implementation of OPEC's decision to voluntarily adjust oil production?</h4><p>Qatar is a major global energy player. While its oil production has fallen gradually in recent years, its natural gas production has continued to increase YoY. It is now a global hub for liquefied natural gas, and ideally positioned for the growing energy demand center of Asia. In terms of the implementation of the OPEC and non-OPEC decisions taken in 2016, Qatar has played an important role, as have all participating nations. To date, conformity with the decisions has been good. In the first three months of 2017, we saw overall OPEC and non-OPEC conformity at 86% in January, and a further advancement in February to 94%. In March, it was at the even higher level of 98%. We continue to seek further improvements, with our firm goal being 100% conformity.</p><h4>In January 2017, you held a meeting with Qatar's Minister of Energy &amp; Industry. What were the main points of that discussion and how do you assess Dr. Al Sada's role as OPEC's Conference President throughout a challenging 2016?</h4><p>Back in January 2017, I paid a visit to HE Dr. Mohammed bin Saleh Al-Sada to thank him personally for the great diplomatic efforts he undertook throughout 2016 as OPEC Conference President to bring OPEC and non-OPEC producers together. His judgement, guidance, and dedication in helping OPEC Member Countries agree on a production adjustment decision, and in bringing on board many non-OPEC nations, were a cornerstone of the great efforts aimed at rebalancing the market, supporting sustainable stability, and ensuring that the necessary industry investments return. His unwavering leadership in an extremely challenging 2016 went far beyond the scope of the Organization and helped to positively guide producers, and the industry as a whole. His term as OPEC Conference President in 2016 will no doubt be viewed as a momentous milestone in the Organization's history. It was an honor for the Organization to hear that His Excellency was awarded “International Oil Diplomacy Man of the Year 2016" at the International Petroleum (IP) Week conference in London in February 2017. This was a richly deserved recognition.</p><h4>Qatar's new Laffan Refinery formally launched operations in 1Q2017. How important is this project in the supply of petroleum products to the global market?</h4><p>The Laffan Refinery is a key part of Qatar's vision to process and add value to the field condensate produced from its Qatargas and RasGas ventures. The recent addition of the second refinery in the first quarter of 2017 has doubled condensate refining capacity at the complex to 292,000 barrels a day. There is no doubt that this development will be a vital new cog in the global supply of petroleum products. The development is also in line with the principles of Qatar National Vision 2030, which aims to create a sustainable economy and advance the standard of living in Qatar. The vision is to be applauded, and the OPEC Secretariat supports its implementation as the country looks to advance its economic, social, human, and environmental development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your most recent fleet expansion, worth more than USD18 billion, bring new improvements to Qatar Airways' operations?</h4><p>Qatar Airways prides itself on having one of the most modern fleets of aircraft in the sky. Our recent order from Boeing was history in the making and representative of the trust we place within Boeing to deliver aircraft for our growing fleet, in line with meeting the needs of our ambitious network expansion plans around the world. Our 195-strong fleet of aircraft is constantly growing as we strive to expand to even more business and leisure destinations. We currently receive a new aircraft every 10-12 days; without this robust program of aircraft deliveries we could not serve the new routes that are in our plans for 2017/18 or meet the needs of our passengers who are flying further and more often than ever before. Just in the last year, we have received our 30th Boeing 787 Dreamliner, our 7th Airbus A380, and our 14th Airbus A350. During 2017/18, our growing number of more than 150 global destinations is scheduled to increase by a further 14 routes. Our inaugural flight to Auckland in February this year was significant as it represented a record-breaking event as the world's longest commercial flight, taking 17 hours and 30 minutes and covering a distance of 14,535km from our hub in Doha. This was a truly magnificent start to the year, one that also sees us celebrate our 20th anniversary. All in all, our network expansion and fleet development naturally work in tandem; they are interdependent and only with these two elements complementing one another can Qatar Airways continue to reach for its goal of becoming the best airline in the world.</p><h4>What was the driving force behind the decision to increase your stake in British Airways owner IAG to 20%, and what new benefits will this arrangement bring to your company?</h4><p>Qatar Airways further increased its stake in IAG from 15.67 to 20% in July 2016 due to the many synergies that exist between the airline and IAG and its fellow member oneworld airlines. This was a direct result of the future potential we believe exists in the group and our increased shareholding reflects the strength of commercial and strategic ties between the companies. Qatar Airways supports the ongoing strategy of IAG and is highly supportive of the group's management team. In terms of the benefits that this relationship will bring to Qatar Airways and its passengers, the synergies that already exist between ourselves and the group's other oneworld member airlines, will only continue to grow and expand. For example, only recently in October 2016, Qatar Airways and British Airways expanded their existing code share agreement with a joint business agreement to include all non-stop flights operating between the UK and Doha, allowing both oneworld carriers to provide passengers with better links between the UK, Asia, Middle East, and Africa.</p><h4>What are some new services and amenities that work to differentiate Qatar Airways from rival airlines around the Gulf?</h4><p>Qatar Airways strives to put the passenger first at every stage of their journey, whether on the ground or in the air on board one of our modern aircraft. It is this simple factor that truly separates us apart from our competition and for why we are known as one of the world's best airlines. A significant step change for us on this journey happened in 2014 when we moved our operations to the newly created, state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport (HIA). With regards to our aircraft, we constantly invest in the latest generation technology for which we have become known the world over. Qatar Airways welcomed the Airbus A380 into our fleet of 195 aircraft in recent years, while we also welcomed the Airbus A350 as Global Launch Customer in 2014. One of our most recent product revelations is the Qatar Airways Qsuite, launched just recently at the ITB exhibition in Berlin. Qsuite pushes the boundaries in our continued journey to provide the ultimate premium travel experience. Operating on flights from summer 2017, the newly patented Qsuite will feature the world's first double bed in business class, while privacy panels that stow away will provide passengers in adjoining seats with their own private cabin. Central and adjustable TV monitors also allow the center four seats of the cabin to be transformed into a private suite, providing friends, colleagues or families travelling together the opportunity to socialize, dine, or work.</p><h4>How does Qatar Airways work with the Qatar Tourism Authority to raise the country's profile to prospective travelers abroad?</h4><p>Qatar Airways takes its role in helping to raise Qatar's profile to prospective travelers seriously, and in recent years we have seen Qatar establish itself as a true world-class destination for sport, entertainment, and the arts, highlighting Doha as a stopover destination to its millions of passengers. A key foundation of this progress has been a close working relationship with the Qatar Tourism Authority, and most notably in recent months Qatar Airways led an initiative to introduce a new free transit visa scheme to our passengers, providing unprecedented access for travelers to Qatar and its many cultural highlights, further supporting the country's soaring tourism industry. Qatar Airways is also a key supporter and sponsor of a number of world-class sporting events based in Qatar, attracting visitors from around the world. Qatar Airways recently hosted the first ever Qatar Airways Cup, where we brought our sponsored teams of FC Barcelona and Al-Ahli Football Club to Doha for the Match of Champions. We also sponsor other world-class events in tennis, cycling, and squash, ensuring that Qatar continues to build its reputation as a center for world sporting events.</p><h4>As 2017 marks the 20th anniversary of Qatar Airways as the national carrier, what is the company's outlook for the next 12 months?</h4><p>The success behind Qatar Airways lies with the fact that we never rest on our achievements; we focus on how we can better them each and every time for business and leisure passengers around the world. Without a doubt, 2017 marks yet another exciting year for Qatar Airways as an example of just this. In addition to being voted the World's Best Business Class by Skytrax, Qatar Airways has further enhanced the business traveler experience for premium passengers around the world with the recently revealed Qatar Airways Qsuite. Looking to our growing network, Qatar Airways has already announced 14 new destinations for 2017-18; adding Canberra, Dublin, Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro, and Santiago de Chile, to name a few. It is with operational excellence, vision and resilience that we look to the next 12 months and further ahead, championing the growth of Qatar Airways at all opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Lebanon's capacity of increasing its FDI flows in the short term?</h4><p>Lebanon can offer a lot to investors, and our slogan for this year is “the pleasure of doing business.“ Any investor can benefit from the doing business climate in Lebanon, from the human resources, lifestyle,  quality of education, and all of the fundamentals of the open market economy. It is true that the Lebanese economy has been affected by the Syrian conflict since 2011, but now, with the election of the new president and the formation of the government, we are expecting more political stability, which will contribute to the achievement of our ultimate goal: the enhancement of our business climate. I believe that Lebanon is on the right track, and will be able to achieve more growth in the years to come especially with the launch of its oil and gas extraction plans, and the reconstruction of the Syria peace process, which will surely attract more investment and encourage capital inflows.  </p><h4>Local, international, and Arab investors are key for the country, but expats also play an important role. How is IDAL working to encourage expatriates to invest in their homeland?</h4><p>Our target investors, the ones that have invested in Lebanon historically, are split into four main categories. One category is local investors, the second is the expatriates, the third is Arabs mainly from the Gulf area, and the fourth is multinational companies that invest in Lebanon to provide goods and services for the country, or use Lebanon as a hub for the region. However, due to the conflict in the region, the only two main categories that invested between 2011 and 2016 were locals and expatriates. Regarding the expatriates, we have been doing a lot recently; we participated at the LDE conferences held in New York, Sao Paulo, and South Africa. Organized by  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these conferences aimed to encourage expatriate investors not only to invest in Lebanon, but also to be connected with the country through three main axes. The first axis is to encourage investors to invest in Lebanon and create partnerships with Lebanese companies, the second axis relies on enhancing trade between Lebanon and host countries. The third is based on encouraging them to adopt Lebanon as an outsourcing hub, especially given the fact that Lebanese productive sectors may supply them with many high quality products, components, and services. The economic and cultural connectivity that Lebanon has with many countries is highly important, and this is something that expatriate investors and other investors can all benefit from.</p><h4>How is IDAL working to open new markets that are not traditionally seen as export destinations?</h4><p>In addition to encouraging investments, IDAL also aims to encourage and promote Lebanese exports. As such, we have launched a range of programs that subsidize exports in the industrial and agricultural sectors as for instance the Agri Plus and the Agromap Programs. We have also launched the M.LEB initiative (Maritime Lebanese Exports Bridge) in response to the closure of land borders due to the Syrian crisis. Although the aim of this initiative is to maintain our products' presence in the traditional markets, we wanted the exporters to get used to maritime transportation so they can go much farther and access new markets namely in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. IDAL also supports the promotion of the agrifood exports in the regional and international markets, through increasing the competitiveness of exporters, and providing agrifood products with a wider exposure to foreign markets. This also includes providing companies with financial assistance to participate in international food fairs. In this regard, IDAL sponsors Lebanese pavilions in major exhibitions, including SIAL, GULFOOD, ANUGA, FANCY FOOD SHOW, and HORECA. In this way they are contributing to improving the quality of agrifood products to meet international standards. The support is provided on a continuous basis to provide exporters with the financial and technical means to improve their production process and access new markets.</p><h4>How can Lebanon become a start-up hub for the region?</h4><p>This year IDAL launched a program as a business supporter for startups, to help them start their operations in Lebanon. This program aims at channeling ideas into a business model. It may help entrepreneurs on how they can choose the formulation of the legal infrastructure, how to register their company, register their trademark, their idea, and how to secure the money for business investment. I think that this program, along with many others launched by different stakeholders will support Lebanon  in becoming a startup and IT hub in the region. The government has a medium-term vision for boosting the IT sector and developing Lebanon as an IT hub.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a key government player in economic development and as the country's national investment promotion agency, IDAL's plan for 2017 will mainly focus on increasing employment opportunities in the outskirts of the capital, with an increasing focus on the areas with the highest incidence of overall unemployment and youth unemployment. To that end, IDAL will partner with public and private sector stakeholders as well as international organizations to identify concrete investment opportunities in selected regions and work on mobilizing financing to ensure the implementation of these opportunities. A special focus will be placed on identifying projects or clusters of projects in the agrifood and industrial sectors that use new technologies to enhance productivity and competitiveness. Projects in the tourism sector and its sub-sectors will also be identified given their potential for employment specifically of low-skilled labor. In 2017, IDAL will push for regulations that foster the business environment and will work for ensuring the approval of the new incentive framework that grants investors in eight productive sectors with a series of tax breaks. If implemented these incentives could provide a huge boost to accelerating Lebanon's entry into the knowledge economy given the special emphasis granted to projects with a technology focus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE leads the way in innovation in the Middle East. Which sectors have benefited the most from investment in innovation?</h4><p>Establishing a culture of creativity, knowledge, and innovation in the country is crucial to our socioeconomic development. Ever since the government began laying the foundation for an environment that encourages knowledge and innovation, we have seen higher interest in entrepreneurship. As a direct result SMEs and start-ups are getting access to much-needed funding. Efforts for human capacity building, especially among citizens, have been ramped up to complement economic growth. Knowledge and innovation play a crucial role in the country's efforts to diversify its sources of income as well by building an industrial environment fueled by knowledge, innovation, modern technology, and scientific R&amp;D. Additionally, sustainability is improved through the enactment of important policies aimed at promoting faster industrial growth in line with the UAE Vision 2021. All sectors are fully committed to the UAE's bid to create a knowledge- and innovation-driven economy thanks to their proven benefits. At the Ministry of Economy, for instance, we have launched 12 relevant initiatives and 39 projects covering a wide spectrum of creative developmental activities, specialized micro-projects, and manufacturing and research initiatives. As I have mentioned, the process of building a strong foundation for fostering knowledge and innovation is already in full motion, and we can already see positive results.</p><h4>With a 16% share of the national GDP, the industrial sector has been positioned as a beacon of economic diversification. What have been the major advances made by the UAE in this regard over the past year?</h4><p>In 2016 we witnessed a high-performing and vibrant local industrial sector thanks to key government policies such as the economic diversification strategy. The sector's core areas have remained resilient despite global uncertainties, in part due to this all-encompassing strategy, which also seeks to reinforce the performance and efficiency of the local business community. The UAE is now in fact the third most efficient market in terms of goods, which could be viewed as the result of our government's efforts to reduce our reliance on oil. The non-oil sector's GDP contribution in 2015 climbed to about 77% at current prices and 70% at constant prices. Economic diversification, along with the sustainability policy, has become more embedded in our various developmental programs and initiatives. For our part, the Ministry is fully committed to doing its share by continually supporting investment spending on strategic and value-added projects.</p><h4>The newly implemented Bankruptcy Law has raised expectations regarding better practice for indebted SMEs and tighter regulations to guarantee a more competitive economic environment. What is your view of the impact of this law on the national economy?</h4><p>The government has enacted this law and undertaken other measures precisely to fuel the growth of SMEs, which are considered the backbone of the local economy. Increased incentives, the establishment of a common definition for SMEs, and the provision of modern facilities and benefits tailored to fit the needs of SME owners and local entrepreneurs have been put in place to spur sectoral growth. Moreover, the approval of the Executive Regulations to the Federal Law on SME projects to incentivize local businesses and provide them with access to funding has further stimulated its expansion. The Ministry of Economy has forged strategic partnerships with various countries to further invigorate the SME sector, improve its competitiveness, ensure its sustainable growth, and widen its reach by facilitating its entry to new foreign markets, with an emphasis on innovation, technology, and knowledge.</p><h4>What are the economic prospects of the ongoing plan to build a vibrant knowledge-based economy in the UAE in terms of job creation, attracting young entrepreneurs, and contributing to the country's economic diversification?</h4><p>At the Ministry, we seek to highlight the role of industrial innovation in building a sustainable and knowledge-based economy in the UAE. This reflects our belief that innovation is vital to the country's ongoing diversification plan and the development of key economic activities such as job creation and entrepreneurship. All our efforts are geared toward putting the UAE in the top-10 countries on the Global Innovation Index, in line with UAE Vision 2021. The UAE has already achieved significant milestones and progress in its journey towards economic prosperity as evidenced by its inclusion in the 2016 Global Innovation Index. The country is now considered to be at the forefront of comprehensive economic development across the region. Furthermore, in terms of fostering a culture of creativity and innovation in the country, the Ministry of Economy has opened the state-of-the-art International Centre of Patent Registration (ICPR) in collaboration with its South Korean partner. Aside from overseeing the registration of patents in the UAE, the new international center will also conduct a skills development training program for professionals in the field of intellectual property as well as pursue research on relevant topics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments on your construction projects?</h4><p>The Nigerian economy has been in recession for the greater part of 2016 and continuing into 2017. There has been a rebound. However, it remains to be seen if that rebound is sustainable. In terms of our development in the Azuri Peninsula, we had a tough time last year with issues concerning financing and various other details. We soft-pedaled on construction and focused more on sourcing materials to ensure that even when we are at a low point, we can make up time with other deliverables. To help with our cost perspective and considering the liquidity situation in Nigeria, we engaged with export credits from Brazil to give impetus to our steel structure development. 99% of the steel has arrived and we are awaiting the completion of the concrete works. We hope to make up for lost time with the implementation of the steel, which is already onsite. We also looked at the best ways to complete the development within budget and provide a product that is affordable considering the current situation. We have had to go out more to do surveys and research. We look at different manufacturers and providers, compare their cost and quality standards, and consider the logistics of it and the transportation. We try to do all this to keep within budget without compromising quality standards.</p><h4>Will the success of the Azuri Peninsula depend in large part of the success of EKO Atlantic City?</h4><p>At the end of the day, the Azuri Peninsula is a subset of the EKO Atlantic City.  The success of the Azuri Peninsula has much more to do with how the overall Nigerian economy performs. We are all parts of a machine that must work in sync. However, it is true that from a micro and macro perspective, Azuri Peninsula and EKO Atlantic will work better if they are in sync with each other and if they can complement each other.</p><h4>What effects will falling real estate prices have on the Azuri Peninsula and EKO Atlantic City?</h4><p>One thing that this recession has brought with it is that mediocre players will phase out of the  picture over time. Only the strongest players will survive in this market under these conditions. Only the strongest players who understand the dynamics of construction and tie it with the perception and demand of the end user are able to continue in this space. The prices of real estate have fallen mainly because in most situations, quality never matched price. Now, we have customers who are more informed, who have a million needs with limited resources, and who know that they want what they are paying for and are more. Savvy than ever before. Now there are many empty developments; however, there are also other sectors of the market where development demand is growing. The real estate sector, unlike other major sectors, has subsets of the market that are relatively independent of each other. The low-income and luxury segments are as far away from each other as the sun is from the core of the earth because luxury is a feel-good factor, not a necessity.</p><h4>How do you expect real estate demand to evolve and what factors will drive real estate demand?</h4><p>Demand is key. In the past developers built, what they believed the market wanted. Today, companies have to listen to what the market demands and design their development based on studies and the current economic situation. Back in the day, Nigerians loved space. The cost of cooling or heating a flat, in an extreme environment, adds to the cost of day-to-day living and expenses, and the costs of maintaining that flat also goes up with size. Now, people opt for apartments with shared services. We are going back to how we started off as Africans; we all used to live communally. Even Westerners are going communal in some regards. Even our style of cooking calls for certain architectural requirements. Fire hazards are a real risk here in Nigeria. We need a back door and a front door, at least two points of access to the kitchen. We have to think about all these things when designing any building, be it a house or a flat in Nigeria. Real estate is all about adapting to the location and the specific cultural and lifestyle needs of that location and its people. Adaptability is crucial.</p><h4>What other factors contribute to the success of a company such as EKO Development in Nigeria?</h4><p>Whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, listening to the end user is key. A company cannot just sit down and assume what people want or need or are willing to accept and spend their hard-earned savings on. Some may want simplicity, a one-bedroom; others may want a lush kitchen, while yet others may not be planning on doing a great deal of cooking and may want a smaller kitchen and perhaps a more spacious bathroom or bedroom. A company has to listen to its clients, and that means doing a great deal of research.</p><h4>How is your company working to incorporate renewable energy options?</h4><p>We have thought about incorporating renewable energy into our designs right from day one. We have sought to utilize natural resources, to use natural light, use natural means of cooling, special windows to make sure the cooling stays inside while also letting sunlight in. We have even taken into consideration the position of the sun and shadows when building our towers. We have tried to be as close as possible with our top vegetation as well to see if we can harness the old habitat that once existed. We all live in a big food and energy chain, and when one element is missing, there is an impact, if not today then certainly in the future. We are interconnected with nature, part of a chain, and we incorporate this into our designs and developments.</p><h4>How has the recent trend of building new metropolises as standalone single cities in Nigeria impacts the development and cohesion of a city?</h4><p>Proper deregulation brings constructive competition. On one hand, it is a positive move; on the other hand, if not well managed it can be a disaster. When giving approvals for building a metropolis, the government must ensure that environmental assessments are done comprehensively and adhered to diligently from start to finish. There is so much to consider when a city is being built. Water, vegetation, air, soil, geology, geography, human needs, waste, energy, temperatures, climate: the list goes on.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Huawei positioned itself in line with the UAE's needs?</h4><p>Historically, Huawei positioned itself as a telecom solutions provider, but with the advancement of technology, our role has changed greatly to provide complete ICT solutions. Communications is not just for the telecom industry. ICT, digitalization and smart strategies are at the top of the agenda of governments around the world today. In response to this, Huawei has expanded its solutions to cover a wide range of industries as well as consumer needs. The ICT industry has become diversified and communications have become a basic human right, like electricity and water, and this evolution has had a dramatic impact on industries and economies. It has created enormous opportunities for business growth that is un-paralleled in modern history, and this is just the beginning of a new era. In the UAE, Huawei has realigned its business to support the country's efforts in creating a knowledge-based economy, one that is driven by the digital transformation is a main component of the UAE's national strategy. Huawei is committed to helping bridge the digital divide in UAE through four key areas: providing communications for all, broadband for all, nurturing ICT talent, and the application of ICT technologies to help different industries boost efficiency.</p><h4>How does Huawei's technology streamline business operations? </h4><p>As a global technology leader, Huawei is committed to helping customers achieve their business goals and sometimes that includes improving operational efficiency and reducing operational costs to streamline their businesses. As any enterprise organization would, Huawei looks to its technology infrastructure to ensure optimal efficiency while also ensuring that its resources are full utilized without waste and without adding a burden to the infrastructure. Leveraging ICT capability correctly provides the infrastructure needed to streamline traditional industries and drive business efficiency. There are three main steps that can be taken to achieve this. The first step is digitalization and the second is automation, by which we mean sensors giving feedback that generates actions. The third and final step is intelligence, where the technology can make changes or take decisions based on changes to the environment. For example, it can automatically adjust the temperature of a room depending on whether or not it is occupied. Utilizing these three steps enables companies to locate inefficiencies and eliminate them.</p><h4>How much opportunity does the PPP space present for Huawei?</h4><p>Huawei has multiple models for working with customers and partners. Our vision for the future is that, if everything is connected by the Internet and cloud computing is in place, big data can generate more ways for us to manage cities safety. Security will come through digitalization, intelligence, and automation. We are not ready to step into being a service provider and will never be a competitor of our clients. We want to continue collaboration with academia to jointly develop customized solutions for our customers. Masdar Institute is the top post-graduate institution in the country, and we are in discussion with them on the LT platform. We will work to generate green technology, space technology, and IoT technology to explore how IoT could serve the oil and gas industries. Together we will customize the IoT technology to accommodate clients like ADNOC. Huawei is mainly focused on infrastructure and we do not provide smart services and therefore need to work with partners that are welcome to come to our open lab to test and open their products so that we can go to market together.</p><h4>How much does Huawei invest in R&amp;D?</h4><p>“As of December 31, 2016, Huawei's had about 180,000 employees of which 45%, or about 80,000 employees, are specialized in research and development. In 2016 we spent USD9.2 billion on R&amp;D and in 2017, we expect that figure to rise to USD12 billion. We focus on very narrow areas, the first being devices such as smartphones, sensors and chips, the second being pipes; the fixed and wireless broadband through 3G, 4G, and 5G to the fiber. The third area is cloud computing-related technologies, which includes big data. These three areas make up the major part of our infrastructure but if you are a consumer you do not care about bandwidth or the technical terms such as 4G or 5G; what you need is user experience. When you promote bandwidth a lot of people cannot figure out what the benefit of 100mb is; so who cuts the gap is the application providers. With 100mb you can enjoy the full key, HD video and this makes a difference, not the 100mb but the fact that you can enjoy a VR experience without negative experiences. We attach equal importance to innovations made by scientists and engineers, and base innovation on customer needs and technological leadership. We attach equal importance to innovating applications, products and basic technologies, and invest in researching future-oriented cutting-edge technologies. As of December 31, 2016, Huawei has filed a total of 57,632 patent applications in China and 39,613 patent applications outside of China. A total of 62,519 patent applications have been granted. Globally, Huawei has 12 Regional Headquarters, 15 R&amp;D institute and centers, 36 joint innovation centers and 45 training centers. Products and solutions are applied in over 170 countries and regions worldwide. That makes a difference and brings up the topic of the ecosystem and how we need to work with the local companies and SMEs who could translate the infrastructure value into the customer's user experience. Huawei believes in open, collaborative relationships with local companies and SMEs who have the right ideas and a potential market which can provide value to the end users. They are welcome to come to our Open Lab to test their products and we are happy to go to market together with them. We work closely with our customers and partners to build a better connected world, by connecting people, people and things, and things and things. Doing so facilitates the free flow and sharing of ideas. We will drive the evolution of technologies, industries, and human interaction to build a better connected world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marks the 50th anniversary of Holcom, Information Technology Group's (ITG) mother company. How was 2016 for the company?</h4><p>It was a challenging year. The political situation in Lebanon was in a deadlock for most of the year. That of course slowed down developments, particularly in the public sector. On the bright side, at the end of 2016 we had an opening with the election of a new president and the appointment of a prime minister. That allowed us to achieve a good last quarter and end 2016 in relatively good shape. Of course, results did not meet our expectations; we had hoped to have a better year, but it was okay. We then started 2017 with a lot of hope. Lebanese people are optimistic by nature; to live and work in Lebanon, one has to be optimistic. Now that 1Q2017 is behind us, we still sense that the situation is not at its best. On the positive side, we witnessed the nominations of general managers and other tier-one officials by the government. Two important things remain: the budget, which needs to be approved soon, and the parliamentary elections. I believe that the elections will not happen within a few months, but in case a new law will be passed, that will surely have a good impact on the overall situation.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans both geographically and in your portfolio?</h4><p>There are two dimensions to this. Historically, ITG have been working in the region and our business is not limited to Lebanon. We have a presence in many territories around us.  We have projects in Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, UAE and Egypt. This kind of international development for certain parts of our portfolio is of course going to continue. Iraq has not been easy over the last few years, but now, with what is happening there on the security side, we will hopefully be undertaking some new investments as we foresee good developments. When it comes to our portfolio, we have organically developed some new activities. First, it is worth mentioning that as a group, we have traditionally operated under a 'value-added reseller' model. Under that scheme, we basically buy products &amp; solutions from IT major brands (such as HP, Cisco, Canon, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft) and we resell them providing added-value services such as implementation and of course local support. This is what we have been doing for the last decades. However, the IT market is changing. This kind of model is old and will be transformed into something new, where customers will buy technology differently. They do not want to buy IT products, manage them, install them and have employees run and support them; they want to buy IT as a Service (ITaaS). They need a credible company that has all of the skills and expertise to provide them with 'Managed Services.' Some people call that Cloud-based services, others call it Managed Services; there could be different names, but it is not a new idea; it is the concept of Outsourcing. Companies historically have been used to managing their own IT internally. Today, many businesses find that complicated; finding the right IT staff, training them, certifying them, and retaining them, in addition of course to operating an in-house data center along with servers and networking equipment. We are proposing services to manage customers' IT infrastructure, hence removing the IT complexity while improving their operations. They can focus on their core business, while we take care of their IT infrastructure and security. We have built data centers in Lebanon and can provide top quality Managed Services and solutions.</p><h4>What is your strategy to boost the use of Cloud services by all your clients?</h4><p>We are Microsoft's largest partner in Lebanon and are proposing Microsoft cloud computing solutions, in addition to other cloud-based solutions from other leading partners. We established, over a year ago, a company called Cirrus, which is affiliated to ITG, which specializes in the provision of managed services and cloud services. It is about going to the customers, and telling them that rather than having to manage their own IT, we can do it for them better and at a lower cost of ownership. We can give customers the IT platform, host their data, conduct backups, and do business continuity planning, and all they have to do is 'consume' IT and run their applications. It is like a subscription-based service.</p><h4>Do you find that banks, being more traditional minded, are reluctant to use services like yours?</h4><p>It is a question of time. Of course, banks are traditional and conservative by nature, but technology does not wait. What technology offers today was not offered five years ago, and what will be offered five years down the line will also be different. Banks worry about business continuity and securing their data. They also worry about speed, efficiency and performance. Five or six years ago, communications were worse than they are today. There were no options and plans for disaster recovery and for high systems availability, making customer services difficult in case of system's disruption. All of those issues have a solution today, and as time passes by, there will be even more options and possibilities. It is our role to think about how we can integrate all of those technologies in a way that will relieve the client from the complexity of the technology. Thanks to technology and innovations, it is true that things may seem to become easier over time, but in the back office, matters are becoming more complex. We have to plan and make sure we have the right people, certify them, build their skills, and ensure the same expertise in case of staff turnover. We are working to ensure a set of in-house skills, and amortize that over many customers. It becomes a matter of scale; it will soon be impossible for companies to do all that in-house.</p><h4>Over the years ITG has built solid partnerships with leaders in the ICT industry. Are there any M&amp;A (Mergers and Acquisitions) set to come in this year?</h4><p>We are always watching and assessing. In 2016, we were more in a mood of consolidating and restructuring what we have because during the past few years, we did a number of acquisitions. In 2016 we did one acquisition in the software field; we acquired a company that specializes in Microsoft CRM software solutions. It was a skill-set that we lacked, so we assessed that company and acquired a team of around 10 persons and integrated the CRM solutions within our software offering. The general situation during the last couple of years has not encouraged us to undertake more acquisitions. As mentioned above, we are rather focusing on transforming ourselves to embrace the new trends and challenges. That is our priority. In parallel, we are assessing some companies that need the financial backup of a group like ours, and which acquisition will expand our reach to more customers. M&amp;A is something that is always in the back of our minds.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of expertise can be exchanged between the UAE and Panama?</h4><p>Just like the UAE, Panama is an important player when it comes to logistics and international trade. During my time in the UAE I was able to visit DP World and the Jebel Ali Free Zone and witness firsthand what amazing operations they are. Panama has much to learn from Jebel Ali's level of technological sophistication and efficiency. For example, their state-of-the-art dashboard digitally interconnects all of the different aspects of their operation. Bringing aspects of international logistics like customs, regulations, and licensing onto one centralized platform makes the processes far more accessible for traders and clients.</p><h4>How do the UAE and Panama differentiate themselves as logistics hubs?</h4><p>Almost all free zones have what is called a one-stop-shop with all the different institutions involved in processing or awarding label permits, construction permits, and visas situated in one location. So for any logistics center, providing the client with an easy way to cut through all the bureaucracy, is very important. Taking it to the next level and having the entire platform digitalized and automated like what has happened in the UAE, is something we are working to achieve. An advantage that Panama provides is the special incentives for immigration, allowing foreigners to come in and work freely in Panama in our special economic areas. This attracts expertise and skilled workers from all over the world, which directly benefits local workers and businesses who are able to gain from their experience and insight. Knowledge transfer is very important to Panama, a small country that is still developing. Like the UAE, we also rely on expatriates to bring executive, academic, and technical skills to the country. The UAE has done this by creating an environment that embraces globalism, multiculturalism and is business friendly. We are looking to carve out a similar niche in Latin America by offering a cluster of incentives, ranging from location, to infrastructure, to ease of entry.</p><h4>Panama recently revised their financial regulations to boost transparency and align with international standards. How will adopting these standards improve the market and what can be learned from the UAE's example?</h4><p>In the last two years Panama has passed new laws to meet international finance standards to ensure transparency and support anti money laundry legislation, which resulted in us being removed from the FATF grey list in record time. Our experience has showed us that international standards and transparency in government are prerequisites to effectiveness and success. It's not enough to just have a resource or a specialized sector excellence in today's globalized world. As the UAE has demonstrated, adopting international standards is vital to competing internationally and pushing the boundaries of innovation is the only way to truly ensure success. The UAE attracts large amounts of FDI because their legal framework provides investors with confidence and peace of mind.</p><h4>You are in the process of opening a direct flight from Panama to the UAE. What opportunities could this present for growth between the two countries?</h4><p>We have seen how the drive to establish Panama as a hub for logistics, or as a hub of the Americas, has brought prosperity to Panama as well as businesses and investors who helped the country to develop. Therefore, a direct flight from Dubai to Panama would not only bring the nations closer and open up more opportunities for trade; it will also bring a region of the international business community right to our doorstep. In the same way Dubai is the crossroads between Europe and Asia, Panama seeks to be the bridge to Latin America. There is enormous opportunity as previously Panama and Latin America were deemed too far away for Middle Eastern business; a direct flight would alter the mentality. Ease of travel and ease of entry are major factors when trying to welcome the world to your country. Furthermore, the UAE is opening an embassy in Panama, marking a major step in the progression of political and economic relations between the two nations.</p><h4>How has Panama prioritized sustainable development and environmental awareness?</h4><p>Panama is a country that has been very consistent over the past 15 years regarding the promotion of sustainability and environmental awareness. Much like the UAE, in addition to taking part in transnational initiatives like the Paris Conference, we also taking serious steps to diversify energy sources, representing a wider global ambition to address climate change. In terms of energy, we are shifting our energy matrix to more renewable sources like wind, solar energy, hydroelectric power, and more. The UAE has led the way for this in the Gulf Cooperation Council and we are hoping to follow a similar pattern in Latin America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the substantial differences between the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011- 2016 and the NDS 2017-2022? </h4><p>The NDS 2017-2022 includes new priorities and faces different challenges, most notably in light of lower energy prices. However, it coincides with conditions more appropriate than the previous ones, in terms of capacities, acquired expertise, and learned lessons. In addition, there is an obvious commitment of the State of Qatar to invest these conditions positively via intensifying efforts to confront the challenges, in conformity with HH the Emir's Advisory Council Speech last November 2016. The NDS 2017-2022 will be more focused in terms of the number of results and targets identified and planned to be implemented in the first NDS 2011-2016. Overall, there will be a focus on the most pressing and vital objectives in the next period. </p><h4>What is MDPS' role in providing data on which the FIFA 2022 World Cup future plans are based? </h4><p>The State of Qatar implements multiple infrastructure-related projects in preparation for the host of many regional and international events, most notably the FIFA 2022 World Cup. Consequently, the statistical figures provided by the MDPS via censuses, surveys, and administrative registers are considered instrumental in the conduct and implementation of the plans of these development projects. It is noteworthy that there is ongoing cooperation between the MDPS and the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy via a technical team that provides data on the population, their demographic characteristics, and their locations, especially the places where the FIFA 2022 World Cup stadiums and public facilities are located. In addition, there is data on the number of hotels, residential units, and their capacity. The technical team tackles a set of surveys and studies, which the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy intends to implement in terms of tickets and housing prices. </p><h4>What types of statistics are more sought after by businessmen and investors in Qatar? </h4><p>The stimulus of the private sector and its competitiveness require development data that stand as a guide for investors to provide logistical needs and catalytic legislation, simplify procedures, and grant further pieces of land. The supply of data facilitates the private sector's and investors' access to the most productive sectors, such as the food industry, tourism, IT and knowledge, renewables, and culture and sport facilities management. It also helps to identify private-sector controlling mechanisms, mainly its quality services and products in respect of the government projects. In this regard, the MDPS conducts a quarterly survey called the Business Confidence Index, in which it provides significant data and indicators on the government and private sectors in terms of production and exportation and the difficulties they confront. The survey findings, released within the areas of “Development Indicators" and “Confidence Indicators," are published on our website. </p><h4>What is the MDPS initial plan for the census in 2020? </h4><p>The MDPS developed an initial plan to conduct an online census in 2020, which will substantially reduce the cost required by such projects. As a result, fieldwork that needs over 3,500 staff will be spared. Furthermore, data will be obtained from administrative registers available in the different government bodies and address directories. These registers will be supported by data available from sub-registers. The census preparation phase started by discussing the census-related concepts and statistical evidence which focused on the United Nations Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses. The GCC Statistical Center organized this panel discussion to prepare for the implementation of the unified census registration project at GCC level in 2020.The second phase, which will be implemented in 2017, features field visits to data providers and access to administrative registers in order to ascertain their suitability for census purposes. The third phase, which will be carried out in 2018, includes the conduct of an all-embracing assessment of quality and comprehensiveness of data to detect the register's flaws, and develop appropriate solutions accordingly by relying on the successful practices in this domain.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ministry supported the improvement of agricultural technology in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>One of the most important projects we are focusing on is the expansion of greenhouses. In 2004, we had around 200,000 square meters of greenhouse production; we have now increased that to 10 million square meters. The Dominican Republic has many advantages in terms of climate and microclimates that allow us to produce high quality products throughout the entire year. In greenhouse production, we have had specific issues with post-harvesting management. Therefore, we created a public-private alliance to resolve that issue and improve our export products' quality, particularly their shelf-life once they reach other markets. That is why we have been working with the private sector to standardize these post-harvesting management procedures. Another important project is our in-vitro laboratory, BIOVEGA. We established this lab with the aim of producing plants with high genetic quality and focusing on especially important commodities, such as bananas and plantains, with the goal of improving their productivity and resistance to diseases. We have teamed up with researchers from Belgium and France to do so. Another issue preventing us from increasing livestock productivity is genetics, so we built another lab called VITROGAN-RD. With this lab, we seek to transfer around 36,000 embryos to small farmers and producers to help improve their cows' milk production. Currently, our average milk production in terms of liter per cow per day is around 5. We can improve that more than 100% if our livestock production comes from breeds adapted to the tropics. Another of the most important products for the Dominican Republic is rice. Thus, we hired one of the five most qualified rice geneticists in the world—who happens to be from the Dominican Republic. Working just part-time for the Ministry, in merely two years he has already started to improve four of our national varieties of rice. We are also close to developing the first two hybrids from Dominican production.</p><h4>How does the Ministry support the promotion of agricultural exports?</h4><p>We have identified plant and animal health as a cornerstone for exports here in the Dominican Republic and we are working with different institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and many others to ensure our animal and plant health protocols are standardized and open for any market. On the other hand, when we took office, we had to face two very difficult issues. The first was the detection of the Mediterranean fruit fly in Punta Cana. Since we had no formal mechanism for identifying it, we sought help from institutions with the requisite know-how such as APHIS/USDA, MOSCAMED Guatemala, OIRSA, FAO, IICA and the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA).  When we started working in 2014, we had just 200 traps in the whole country to capture the medfly. Now, we have around 14,000 traps, and have now been medfly-free for two consecutive weeks and have had no larvae for more than six. The Technical Advisory Committee, which is made up of the aforementioned institutions and international agencies, wants to document our progress so it can be the standard for other countries, which makes us very proud, especially because of the fact that we turned a weakness into a strength. The second issue that we had to face here in 2014 was the audit carried out by the DG Santé, the EU plant health authority. On this audit, our country was found to ship too many of our products not meeting EU health standards. This meant we were threatened with losing access to the European market, an immensely important one, if things did not change quickly. Our reaction was to gather a team from the Ministry of Agriculture, the private sector, and other agencies such as the local Delegation of the European Union and started working on a protocol. We sanctioned exporters, suspended exporters licenses, installed systems of hard and cold water treatment in companies and implemented prerequisites for them to export. A year later, we went from 176 notifications just to 32. As a result, we also increased exports.</p><h4>What are the benefits and disadvantages that CAFTA has brought to the Dominican agriculture sector?</h4><p>The DR-CAFTA agreement is a trade deal which has brought many advantages to our national economy and our people. However, it also has brought many challenges, especially for the agricultural sector due to the way it was negotiated. The agreement has negatively impacted some of our most economic and socially important products. All together rice, chicken, beans, pork, and milk production affect more than 150,000 small farmers. For crops like rice and beans, the average farm size is less than three hectares per farmer, which demonstrates just how vulnerable these farmers are.  As a country we are trying to compete, but sometimes it is difficult to compete with much larger economies. For instance, the US has the 2014 Farm Bill, which includes huge subsidies for its farmers. Those subsides immediately take Dominican farmers out of competition. Commercial trade and agreements are important, but it is also important to ensure the wellbeing of all parties involved.  The trade relationship between the Dominican Republic and the US is very important, not to mention the very strong social ties. Total trade is worth more than USD10 billion a year and, as allies, we need to take care of each other. If we talk about agriculture in the Dominican Republic, we are probably talking about the country's most important economic activity, since every other sector has some kind of ties to agriculture. There are more than 400,000 agricultural producers in the DR. If these farmers do not have a way to make money, they will not be able to buy consumer goods like cars and electronics that mostly come from the US.  Our goal right now is to sit around the table with the US and talk about the possibility of taking care of each other by protecting those small farmers that are at risk, and ensuring that the DR-CAFTA does them more good than harm.</p><h4>What are the goals and priorities of the Ministry of Agriculture?</h4><p>We want to go from the current agricultural system to a precision one for many reasons. For starters, there is increasingly less water; hence, the need to switch to precision irrigation systems. This should be done for the entire banana, bean, and vegetable industries. We also want to introduce high quality and genetically strong seeds into every farm and every product. We are already introducing a variety of hybrid corns and want to tie these to the local production of chicken and livestock, which is already giving us promising results. We also want to increase technical services to small and medium-sized farmers by rebuilding our eight regional offices and becoming more of a technical service institution. By that, I mean that when a farmer needs specific assistance, he will be able to go to the office and get help at every stage through the end of production. This is what we must do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zambia boasts some 19 national parks and 34 game management areas. What needs to be done to enable Zambia to reach its potential as a global tourism hub?</h4><p>Zambia is blessed with a wealth of natural resources. Our game management areas (GMAs) alone cover over 22.4 million hectares. However, in order to fulfill its potential, the country must first improve its infrastructure, increase the number of bridges, and improve the road network, airports, and even airstreams. In Zambia, we have focused for a long time on the Victoria Falls, as well as other national parks in the southern areas, while neglecting the northern circuit and western and eastern provinces. However, we have begun to realize the importance of developing hospitality services across the country, and this momentum is being driven by the head of state himself. His Excellency President Lungu has transformed the Ministry of Tourism from a social ministry to an economic ministry. The fact that we now invest in tourism means we are on the path to reducing joblessness in the future.</p><h4>How integral is the private sector and FDI for tourism development in Zambia, and what partnerships have been made in this domain?</h4><p>Since I took up office we have engaged many people and interested investors from various parts of the globe. In Livingstone, we are developing a conference center with capacity of 5,000, as well as a five-star hotel facility. We offered 5ha of land to a Chinese investor in exchange for their expertise, signing an MoU to finalize the deal. Elsewhere, we have a group of financers from Saudi Arabia based in Dubai who will invest USD150 million in a hotel facility. Initially it was supposed to be in South Luangwa, but we seek to relocate this development to Kasaba Bay, an area that we want to develop. In general, we are aware of the important role PPPs can play in developing our tourism sector, and have come up with a business strategy we hope to complete by August 2017 that will outline our target partnerships and funding goals. These need to be assessed over a period of time, because we want to make sure we have the right end goals in our sights.</p><h4>According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), by 2026 tourist arrivals in Zambia are expected to increase to over 2 million. How will the government provide for this number while showing commitment to preserving the natural environment?</h4><p>It is extremely important to preserve the environment, protecting ecosystems, preventing deforestation, and ensuring we look after our wildlife. We do this in collaboration with the Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. One of the major challenges is poaching, which is unfortunately on the rise in Zambia. Some findings of illegal game hunting and trade by our Department of National Plants and Wildlife have found there is are estimated 4,000-6,000 poachers situated in the GMAs, which puts thousands of animals at risk. We need to ensure that we control and educate in order to reduce—even eradicate—poaching. We fund the training of about 85 game scouts across the nation, and hope to increase this number.</p><h4>What categorizes the government's marketing strategy to promote tourism, both worldwide and in Zambia?</h4><p>We have to embark on a vigorous marketing campaign by identifying critical markets. These critical markets include China, South Korea, India, and Russia, countries with large populations, and a high percentage of these who are interested in travel. Around 120 million people from China travel per year. We are given to understand that of the 120 million, 22 million head to Africa, which begs the question: why can't we tap into this market? That said, our aggressive approach does not ignore Europe. We have just signed a deal with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce, which will place electronic advertising in key places free of charge for two weeks in seven European cities. Local and domestic tourism is yet another aspect of tourism in Zambia that we need to work on boosting. Zambians themselves should be interested in their sites, so we need to reach out through other government agencies and ministries, such as the Ministry of Education. Increasing awareness through marketing, as well as improving human capacity in tourism, will be key if we want to see success in this sector.</p><h4>Who are the main players that contribute to the Tourism Development Fund and what will be the areas targeted for funding?</h4><p>The tourism fund targets the construction and maintenance of hotels and lodges and so forth through a tourism levy of 1.5% for all accommodation and events. This money, when raised, will be used within the ministry and our agencies to develop the tourism sector itself via product development, infrastructure, marketing, training, and research. We want this to be a conclusive development of roads and airports, and since we are constrained by limitations in our governmental budget, the only way to supplement this is through the tourism development fund. Our government funds in general are managed through the Bank of Zambia, but this tourism fund will be separate, with its own account at the Bank of Zambia and a committee appointed by the Ministry of Tourism, responsible for administering that fund.</p><h4>What are the strategic focuses to develop the arts sector in Zambia?</h4><p>The arts have been somewhat dormant in this country, which is concerning, since it is possible to develop talent through art, and through talent, job creation. Because of this, we seek to drive domestic film policy, working with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Information. We have abundant talent in this country. In the 1970s, Zambia was almost on a par with Nigeria with regard to the arts. However, now we are lagging behind. We have been flooded with Nigerian films here in Zambia. We have to wake up to the challenge, and to date, there have been no policies to drive this agenda. Our first step will be to hold a symposia calling upon those involved in the arts to find a way forward together. From there, we need to place an emphasis on art marketing and infrastructure. We do not have an art gallery in Lusaka, for example, let alone cultural centers in each of our provinces. In order to showcase our culture, performance, and dance, we need to remedy this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which programs currently have the most demand from students, and how do you expect this demand to evolve in the future?</h4><p>Qatar University offers 74 specializations, the widest range of academic programs in Qatar, tailoring them to meet the needs of Qatari society. The university offers 40 bachelor degrees, 25 masters degree, four PhDs, four diplomas, and a PharmD. At the undergraduate level, business law, international affairs, and mass communication are most demanded by students, while engineering management and the Gulf studies programs are popular graduate programs. Additionally, the College of Medicine has attracted a good number of students. The college enrolled 93 new students this year, including 58 Qatari nationals, for its class of 2022. This is an increase of 16% in the number of students that enrolled last year. This year, the number of students has increased to more than 17,000 at the undergraduate and graduate level. We expect this number to continue to grow each year. This reflects our commitment to providing high-quality education to Qatari and international students in areas of national priority. Qatar University offers academic programs that are aligned with international standards and best practices. This was achieved through accreditation of many of its colleges, programs, and courses by leading international accreditation bodies such as ABET, CCAPP, and AACSB, to name a few. Additionally, Qatar University offers its students an inspiring learning environment that ensures their success. Our students also receive practical training in different fields of work. This is an essential component of the learning process at Qatar University as it introduces students to the labor market and helps them gain the best practical and theoretical knowledge and skills that enable them to succeed in any business environment or sector.</p><h4>What kind of partnerships does Qatar University have with the private sector to facilitate research?</h4><p>Qatar University has established numerous research collaboration programs with higher education institutions and research centers in Qatar and beyond, which served to advance its international reputation and visibility. Our ever-increasing research efforts have resulted in over 2,674 co-authored publications with 1,209 collaborating institutes. All of this research has achieved top funding success under the National Priorities Research Program of the Qatar National Research Fund. Our partnerships with local and international institutions from the private sector also serve to engage students in academic, research, and other activities and bring them together with experts, specialists, and leaders from institutions around the world, such as the Korea Foundation, Osaka University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, West Virginia University, Xavier University of Louisiana, and many others. They also engender chair positions on issues that are of national, regional, and international import. At Qatar University, these include chairs in alliance of civilizations (ISESCO), civil infrastructure (QDSBG Group), humanities and social sciences (Marubeni Corporation), environmental materials (QAFAC), polymer (QAPCO), and ICT (ictQATAR), to name a few. Incumbents of these positions provide guidance and support to students preparing graduate and research projects and boost opportunities for their field experience and engagement in the world of work.</p><h4>What is the strategic goal of the new Health Education Cluster?</h4><p>With the establishment of the colleges of Health Sciences and Medicine and the presence of several successful health-related programs in pharmaceuticals and health sciences, Qatar University saw an opportunity to consolidate its efforts in these areas through the creation of a health education cluster to serve as a pillar of excellence in health education and research and stakeholder engagement. The cluster comprises the colleges of pharmacy, medicine, and health sciences. The strategic goal of the new health education cluster is to be based on strong research with a high impact on healthcare in Qatar. This is achieved by adding new healthcare professions in close collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health and the healthcare providers. Our research is focused on facing Qatar's major health challenges, including diabetes and heart disease.</p><h4>What strategies does Qatar University have to improve its international ranking?</h4><p>Qatar University does not look at ranking as a target but rather as an outcome for targeting excellence in research and education. However, Qatar University has taken steps to understand different ranking criteria, and proactively enhances its data submission to those agencies. In addition, the focus on improving research and education quality has improved the ranking of the university. Finally, Qatar University is working hard to improve its academic reputation through many venues including building partnerships and hosting international scientific events.</p><h4>What initiatives does Qatar University have to engage the community to ensure continued social development?</h4><p>Community engagement is an area that is at the heart of Qatar University's mission and vision. The university is committed to ensuring that campus life is an enriching environment for encouraging academic excellence, volunteerism, civic responsibility, and leadership. It also provides a wide range of programs such as Al Bairaq, the Life is Engineering Project, Gasna, and the Annual Computing Contest aimed at raising students' awareness of their future role in contributing to the country's development. Additionally, members of the community can gain further education and training in various disciplines through professional development programs across the university's colleges.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the 2017-18 academic year?</h4><p>We will continue to drive forward Qatar University's role as a social and strategic partner in national development. We expect to attract more students by providing smooth opportunities for people from various cultural backgrounds and various professional and academic interests. We also expect to increase the percentage of students graduating within a four-year period to 60%. We will also continue to advance our academic and research portfolio in line with international standards, and enhance Qatar University's position in international rankings to become one of the top-300 universities in the world and among the best 200 universities in at least two minors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the standout developments from the 100 smart initiatives and 1,000 smart applications in efforts to boost the economy?</h4><p>In terms of ICT infrastructure, we have implemented an artificial intelligence tool called Saad in partnership with the Department of Economic Development in the form of a new personal concierge that you can ask any business-related question to and it will reply accordingly. Recently, we started the first phase of registering new businesses for this service. We wish to use this technology across all government services after this initial implementation. Furthermore, DubaiNow[m1] , a mobile app created by the Smart Dubai Government last year, unifies several government and private sector applications into one, which means that people no longer need to go through hundreds of applications for government services. We have almost 55 government private sector services consolidated through one platform. The[m2]  overarching Smart City initiative is about unifying experiences across the entire city, regardless of whether it is public or private. We want all experiences to be simple, seamless, efficient, and safe. By launching Dubai Data we are expanding our services and initiatives to cater to all entrepreneurs and startups in Dubai so that they can benefit from government data. For example, if you are an investor and you want more data about the city, you do not want raw data but data that can be put through analytical tools to provide more insights. Through our platform, we provide analytical tools to deal with big data and enriched data pulled from the Internet of Things (IoT) around the city.</p><h4>How has the private sector responded to these initiatives?</h4><p>It is well known that the government loves megaprojects, but smart cities require both the public and private sector to be on the same page to achieve success. Government services represent 25-35% of the services individuals receive in a city, while the rest are delivered by the private sector. In 2015 we implemented Happiness Meters across over 500 government sector touch points. By mid 2016, we received an 89% happiness level across the city, and now by we bringing the private sector on board with us we will see a more holistic picture of the city. Implementation of Happiness Meters will also give the private sector the chance to make their businesses more efficient in terms of satisfying customers, and will also give them the chance to fortify their marketing campaigns.</p><h4>How can technology be used to help achieve happiness goals?</h4><p>Today, only the UK government recognizes the potential for new and upcoming technology such as Blockchain. Consequently, nothing has been implemented yet, but the government intends to adopt this. We launched the Dubai Blockchain Strategy in November 2016 with three main pillars to target having 100% of government transactions processed through Blockchain, to spark 1,000 new business opportunities through Blockchain technology by 2020, and create an international network through which tourists from up to 27 can enjoy seamless entry and experiences within Dubai. This is a very bold statement, and we are already piloting over 17 projects across the city. The projects focus around trade licensing, digital ID, digital payment, e-ticketing, and other components when it comes to the financial sector. Leading companies such as Emirates NBD, Dubai South, and Dubai DP World are already working on testing Blockchain technology. [NB3] There are plenty of projects using Blockchain technology and we at the Smart Dubai Office, in partnership with the Dubai Future Foundation, are unifying how Blockchain is used.</p><h4>How do you draw a correlation between technology and happiness?</h4><p>Our vision is to make Dubai the happiest city. For us, smart cities and happy cities cannot be mutually exclusive. If the technology will not bring added value, then it does not constitute a smart life. In May 2016 HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister &amp; Vice-President of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai launched the Happiness Agenda, which is aligned with the federal happiness agenda as we believe that happiness is attainable and measurable. As a government entity we need to focus on basic needs. Individuals want streets, roads, electricity, and water, as well as simple access to services. All of our projects should take all of these needs into consideration to make sure that we offer whatever people want from us. As Dubai is a melting pot of ethnicities from around the world, when we did our first snapshot of the service requirements, we segmented the community based on origin; whether they are Emirati, Western expats, Asian, from the Indian Subcontinent, South America, and so forth, to gauge the needs of the whole community. We targeted 10 items that include housing, education, and health, created a list of needs and were surprised by the variety of needs between groups. For Emiratis, the greatest priority has always been housing and locals traditionally always preferred to live in villas instead of apartments. Upon completing our study, we realized that in today's day and age the younger Emirati generation with smaller families is more comfortable in an apartment. Consequently, we are working with the construction sector to reflect the needs of the population in terms of diversity of housing options. We discover the needs of our people then go to our systems, make changes and implement policies that help our people the most. We want the people to know that happiness is attainable and tangible; it's not just an abstract concept. The Smart Dubai Office is working toward making the people of Dubai the happiest on Earth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[nizar-kammourie-general-manager-sawaco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the changes over the past year impacted your business?</h4><p>The most important point is that the government has come to realize that the oil prices will not return to the old highs witnessed during 2009. The government has, therefore, prioritized infrastructure projects, reduced the budgets of existing/ongoing projects, and, has focused on key sectors while slashing non-essential projects. The reforms which have been introduced over the last two years have, in a way, cleared a market which was sprawling with unprofessional companies. The market is healthier now because companies are more professional and are providing healthier competition. For those who could survive this difficult year-and-a-half, prospects are brighter. The government is also considering a reduction of subsidies on water, electricity, and fuel, and this will be done in a gradual manner over the next four to five years to enable the business community and general consumers to adapt to the new scenario. The government is also looking into increasing the privatization of the water sector which will help increase availability of greater funds, allowing for an increase in the number of projects in this sector. This will encourage entry of both local and international companies into the market. Local companies which, most often, lack expertise and capacity, will have an opportunity to join international players.</p><h4>How have you done this?</h4><p>We started by creating a JV with Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd. of Japan to create and improve our EPC capabilities. Our desalination-based private water utility, SAWACO, is expanding organically in Saudi Arabia and, we are looking into opportunities outside of the Kingdom. However, the size of assets required for the privatization of the market is so huge that we need companies with significant capital, as well as international and local exposure. At SAWACO we are, currently, targeting the mid-size desalination market. We have, under our management, a capacity of 40,000cm/d but are looking into increasing this to 70,000—100,000cm/d. Even this is considered as mid-market, but we are proceeding in this direction in a gradual manner. These assets are built on a BOO/BOT basis.</p><h4>What size projects have you been looking at over the past year?</h4><p>We are looking at desalination plants between 20,000 and 100,000 cm/d and water treatment assets between 25,000 and 100,000cm/d for wastewater treatment. This is the market segment where we would like to position ourselves.</p><h4>Do changes in the tariffs for consumers, such as the subsidies, affect your operations?</h4><p>Yes. In SAWACO for example, we are locked into long-term contracts with clients such as the ARAMCO and MODON. When there is an increase in diesel or power tariffs, it is not easy to pass on this increase to them because we have contracted with them for a fixed period of time. This puts pressure on us and it takes time to convince our clients to agree to an increase in price. This does have a bearing on our profitability, but with time we are able to adjust the rates and maintain an acceptable level of profitability.</p><h4>Are you looking at forming more relationships that are project-based to encourage finance?</h4><p>We are looking at some acquisitions in the water industry because we believe that, in order to grow, we need to have a minimum technical mass required for growth. Sometimes we are left only with two options: (a) either form a consortium, or (b) an acquisition and then take a decision as required. This is not easy but we are contemplating a couple of opportunities for acquisitions. We are also having ongoing discussions with groups around the world to acquire larger BOT concessions, all within the desalination field. We are working on both though it will not happen overnight. We are looking seriously at markets like Tunisia, India, and Egypt, in addition to KSA.</p><h4>Is SAWACO looking into renewable energy?</h4><p>SAWACO is very interested in renewable energy and we are contemplating a couple of investments in solar energy. We are also looking at zero liquid discharge (ZLD) for all desalination plants where we can take the brine water and recover salt and sweet water from it. Solar energy and ZLD can find a place here.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>It is not going to be an easy year, but is expected to be much better than 2016. The challenges of limited spending exist, and may persist until the end of this year. The market is getting healthier, and the remaining players are stronger and more capable. Moreover, the quality of projects open for bidding is high. From a realistic point of view we are not going to see the lavish spending that we saw in 2013 and 2014, but the spending will be more focused on prudent considerations at a state level. Serious companies will now have higher chances of securing projects than before. This is a positive outlook. Earlier we used to have innumerable projects to bid for, but now we probably have only a few dozens projects to bid on. Now the quality of the projects and the quality of our competitors is better than what we saw five years ago. The market is also in a clean-up mode and we can expect healthier competitive environment. Any correction or improvement in any market is painful at times, but the rewards are already starting to show up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With an investment of USD2 billion, the first line of the Metro is the second largest infrastructure investment in the country after the canal. How will it reshape the infrastructure landscape of Panama and what is its importance for the country?</h4><p>The long-term view for the Metro is actually a total of seven or eight lines, depending on certain factors. However, we are talking about a pretty robust network and have done the planning for this through to 2040. The first line was a USD2 billion investment, and that included an 8km tunnel. Line two is longer than the first at 21km and will have 16 stations and 21 more trains. We have been increasing ridership for the whole metro and are now at double the expected number of daily passengers. For line one, we originally calculated around 140,000 daily passengers, but we have had days with nearly 300,000, with the average hovering around 275,000. This has made us place an order for additional cars, and we are buying 70 new cars for line one. This purchase will be for both line one and will cover extra demand to feed passengers from line two. We are changing the fleet from trains of three to five cars each, thus increasing the capacity of each train considerably. This way  we can cope with the estimated demand: if you look at national polls, the metro is the number one entity in public satisfaction. We are always above 80%, which gives us a lot of happiness. We are proud to have done something that has really changed people's lives for the better in Panama.</p><h4>How are you working to encourage use of the metro in Panama City?</h4><p>This is one of our strong points even though it had  never been done before. We have a program called Metro Culture that has many different facets. There is free opera in the metro on Saturdays, which people have really taken to. We also have installed free libraries in the metro where you can pick up and drop off books. This was done in alliance with the Lions Club and 20-30 Club, and has been pretty successful. We have additional programs for disadvantaged youth where we offer information about the construction of the metro. Keeping all of these facilities clean is also high on our agenda.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges and obstacles you face on a daily basis?</h4><p>We started line two a year and a half ago, and line three is even longer and will go over the new bridge over the Panama Canal which will be the fourth to cross the waterway. Line three is 27km long and will be a monorail instead of a normal train because there are lots of hills on its route. Our metro is the only one in Central America, and the monorail will be the only one of its kind in all of Central or South America, apart from Sao Paulo. This will be a robust monorail with the latest Japanese technology. We see this project as a case study. Our collaboration with the Japanese International Corporation Agency (JICA) is important to us. We are going to award pre-qualified companies in the next three months and will then have a period of about six months for participants to submit their proposals. We hope to award the winning contractor at the end of 2017, with construction to start in early 2018.</p><h4>How many jobs is the Metro generating?</h4><p>During the construction phase, we are looking at about 3,500 jobs for each line, while the direct operation of the system will create about 500 jobs. We pay some of the best salaries in the public sector.</p><h4>What are your main targets, ambitions, and goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our immediate goals are to finish line two and later the extension to the airport. The Panama airport will go from handling 13 million passengers to somewhere closer to 18 or 20 million passengers once the new terminal is open. We must capitalize on this and then ideally finish line three by 2021 or 2022.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Kuwait's progress in diversifying its economy, and how is the ministry equipped to drive diversification of the economy?</h4><p>The 2015-2020 plan could be named “the rebirth." Kuwait was the first country in the region to build a comprehensive infrastructure between 1950 and 1960s. This infrastructure has reached it maturity and it is time to rebuild the country. But, infrastructure does not build countries, economies do; therefore, we have been concentrating on different initiatives to achieve the target of becoming a more open economy and focusing on diversification of its sources of income. This has been the cornerstone of the development plan. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) is committed to utilizing the Ministry itself and its affiliated bodies to enhance and improve the eco-system of Kuwait. We aim to achieve that by simplifying and automating the procedures and processes of establishing and maintaining business licenses and registration, while taking into consideration the best practices and latest technologies, enhancing regulatory requirements for trade and commerce supervision, and improving the skills of employees attending to those tasks.</p><h4>How can Kuwait use its vast resources to drive surrounding industries?</h4><p>Kuwait is one of the main oil providers in the world and is one of the top oil-reserves countries. The country has been successful in its partnership with global leaders in petrochemicals and we are witnessing more companies entering this market in Kuwait. At MoCI and our affiliates, we are taking into consideration the needs of businesses in those industries and are working closely with stakeholders to improve the underlying platform and enhance the process and procedures related to them. We are also encouraging international companies to enter the Kuwaiti market and the Kuwait Direct Promotion Authority (KDIPA) has been successful in executing and inviting international firms to start their direct business in Kuwait without a local agent, such as Huawei and IBM, along with many others that already have been operational. On the other hand, we will soon have the Authority for the Protection of Competition (APC) working at its full capacity to enhance and improve the competition in the Kuwaiti market as well as ensure fair trade for all stakeholders in the economy. The National Fund for SMEs has been working vigorously to consolidate and enhance and promote entrepreneurial initiatives among the youth in Kuwait in order to enhance the local business communities. The fund has been engaged in different financing programs and training and development program and we aim to that the National Fund will be a major driver in the near future and would be a factor in increasing the employment of Kuwaitis in the private sector, the National Fund also focuses on enhancing the engagement of small and medium enterprises in that field, in which we believe it would be an added value to the overall economy and assist as well in the knowledge transfer by linking international players with the know-how with local business to collaborate in the field similarly to what is happening between the multinational companies and the government.</p><h4>Kuwait has a strongly developing food market, with national giants, like Mezzan and Americana, increasingly becoming regional leaders. What potential can be further unlocked for the F&amp;B and FMCG market in the country?</h4><p>Kuwait is an active and versatile market for the F&amp;B and FMCG industries with major players in not just locally, but regionally. This has been the norm for a long time. Americana and Mezzan are indeed recognizable publicly traded companies, yet there are other players in those sectors, varying from SMEs to multinationals. We have witnessed many new brands in both industries originating in Kuwait and expanding into regional countries, which have been a great added value to our economy and we are aiming to encourage those businesses to expand into other countries and continents as well as encouraging similar businesses to take the foot-steps of the predecessors and increase the Kuwaiti foot-print in other economies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your international expertise and knowledge in the field of luxury hotel hospitality and management bring to a brand like St. Regis in Astana?</h4><p>My long experience and expertise in the hospitality business brings to the new hotel the sense of hospitality that is truly in line with the St. Regis international brand. My priority as a General Manager at the moment is to open the hotel, which we seek to accomplish by the summer of 2017. Following that, our priority is to position the hotel as it should be: as part of the most important hospitality brand in the world.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the evolution of the project?</h4><p>The project was born in 2014, when the property owner decided to transform a nice restaurant into a hotel. Construction started in spring of 2015. There have not been not many challenges from the construction end. However, one of the main challenges that we face is recruiting professional staff in a place like Kazakhstan that is still developing in the hotel and hospitality industry. That is why we will soon hold a career day in the major cities of Kazakhstan. The presentations will be held by our HR and Training Managers, and will include speeches from our specialists such as the Director of Marketing, the F&amp;B Director, and the Director of Finance to explain career opportunities to the young audience. Locals often think that working in hospitality means being a waiter, whereas there are thousands of opportunities with a great future. We have started with a strong training program for locals. At the same time, we continue to work and seek opportunities in the international market.</p><h4>This will be the first St. Regis brand in Kazakhstan. What will this milestone achievement bring to Kazakhstan's hospitality sector?</h4><p>The opening of St. Regis in Kazakhstan means we will set the highest standard in the hospitality sector. It is a big challenge; however, I have a great team that is young, enthusiastic, and active. They helped me develop this project and together we will overcome challenges. The St. Regis Astana will increase the country's visibility in terms of tourism. We have already started to receive many requests from abroad, and these are not necessarily linked to Expo 2017. St. Regis is not only a hotel, it is much more than that. It is a lifestyle.</p><h4>After Expo 2017, the priority for the country is to keep that flow of tourists. What is your vision on the future of the sector?</h4><p>Our vision is to continue to work in the tourism field. However, Kazakhstan should continue to invest in attracting people more from the business side rather than from tourism. To do so, there should be an innovative approach to organize more international events that can attract people from around the world, especially from Asia. Kazakhstan's geographical position is perfect to develop such kinds of business. Events that are regularly held in Europe should also take place here to attract people from all parts of the world, including Russia, Japan, India, the Middle East, and so forth. This could be a future business for the city. Unfortunately, however, this is not the vision, as I understand. We have already discussed this with bodies like the Convention Bureau, as well as shared our ideas regarding development with the Mayor of the city and some ministers. There should be some synergy between the public and private sector with a focus on the private sector.</p><h4>What support have you received from the government?</h4><p>There should be more support from the government, for example, in terms of working visas. It would be helpful, if there was more flexibility for employment visas; this would help the company invest in attracting people who can grow the local workforce. We should attract people to train local talent or else we will not be able to build the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government is increasingly considering PPPs for social projects. What is the potential for PPPs in healthcare?</h4><p>One of the key points of our program is the promotion of PPPs. There are different factors that can contribute to the success of PPPs. First, investment demand in healthcare is growing, not only because of a limited public budget but also because in the future, we need to promote private investment in social infrastructure. PPPs are also beneficial to the private sector by generating stable cash flows, since the government will always spend on medical services. One of the major changes is switching to a health insurance system in which the role of more transparent regulation and competition between hospitals is much higher than in the existing budget model. When, for example, a region needs a new cancer or neonatal center, such concession-type projects become available based on this new regulation. Unfortunately, because we are at the first steps in PPPs, we do not have enough capacity either from the government or the business side to develop great financial models like payment structure or legal agreements. That is why we have applied to international financial institutions like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. These pilot projects will help us find a better model and distribute the model among other projects. There are also more sophisticated issues. We have spoken to major biomedical device companies about our infrastructure and our need for new equipment and upgrades despite the fact that we are unable to make payments in a lump sum. We agreed to develop several types of contracts with long-term agreements, such as leasing contracts. </p><h4>What is the status of the new regulation around mandatory health insurance and how will it affect the healthcare system?</h4><p>The law on health insurance was supposed to be effective in 2017; however, we seek to shift the implementation to January 2018. The goal is to improve healthcare services in the country and maintain the same or higher level of quality and accessibility to make healthcare more cost-effective. Currently, the system is fully covered by the government's budget. Within this model, however, we are not truly incentivized to save money. With health insurance, there is a fund that takes  responsibility for society. The entire government contributes, so do employers and employees. That is why the first principle of the new insurance model is solidarity. The second principle is strategic procurement. The healthcare insurance fund is not just a paying machine. It is a tool to help us use money efficiently. The third principle is universal access. Everyone will have access to certain amounts of care. Another issue in Kazakhstan is that we have a huge out-of-pocket spending, about 35-37%. As an international benchmark, out-of-pocket costs should not exceed 20%. One of the goals of the insurance reform is to cover those services in the packages fully or partly, which will make the system more sustainable and also attract the private sector to enter the sector.</p><h4>Where do you see the sector going in the next few years?<br></h4><p>With our development program, we will introduce a new concept of value-centered care, which consists of organizing all health services around the value for patients. The reality, though, is that the system is rigid, so we need more than four years to change that. However, we have started to introduce some basic reforms. First, to make our primary care more attractive, we have to make it more accessible. Our primary care institutions are concentrated in large polyclinics for 25,000-50,000 people. Our goal is to increase the number of GPs by letting smaller institutions come into the market in villages, cities, and malls to make it more convenient and accessible for people to go there. Managing diseases together with patients and doing so in a more efficient way will bring a reduction in health complications. Lastly, we are also studying a new strategy regarding pediatricians. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The university was established in 2003. How has it evolved over the last 14 years and what have been some of the milestones in that period? </h4><p>Taif University was established as a branch of Umm Al-Qura University, and it has grown ever since and expanded as an independent university. It was originally two colleges: the College of Education and the College of Science. Now we have 19 colleges at the university in various disciplines, from medicine to liberal arts and everything in between. We also have three branches outside Taif in various small districts nearby, in Khurma, Taraba, and Ranya. The number of students has expanded throughout the years, from around 1,200 to 70,000 today. We are the biggest institution in Taif, be it public or private, and this is important for the development of the city. We think that a university in a region like Taif has a different role to play compared to universities in other cities or regions. We consider ourselves as the center of civilization and modernization of this city and surrounding districts. It is about education, introducing new ideas and arts, and introducing new ways of doing business and economics.</p><h4>To what extent is your focus on making Taif University more of a regional and international institution to draw in students and faculty members from all around the Kingdom and abroad?</h4><p>This is the ultimate goal. Taif has a lot of advantages, such as great climate and the best weather in the country, as well as proximity to places like Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah. We have a new project with the Commission of Tourism called Summer at Taif. It is a program in which we invite students from other universities in Saudi Arabia, the GCC, and around the world, to come and spend two months in Taif over summer, to study courses and subjects in Arabic, Islamic Studies, Arabic Culture, and visit historic places around Taif. It is an ambitious program. Last December, I visited the National University of UAE in Al Ain and we reached an initial agreement on an exchange program. It is invested heavily in summer programs for students outside of the UAE, and many Emiratis who come to Taif, preferring the conservative environment here. We offer those students an educational opportunity during their time in Taif. Part of the program is studying Arabic for three months in Taif. In the Kingdom, we have foreigner Arabic learning centers in Medina, Mecca, and Riyadh, with everything from beginner's level to advanced learning. Medina and Mecca have been attracting a lot of Muslim students coming to study Arabic and Islamic Studies in Umm Al-Qura University and other places, including many Malaysians and Indonesians. As for non-Muslim students who want to study Arabic, which is becoming a trend in many institutions and universities around the world, their only opportunity is to go to Riyadh, which is very hot in summer and that may not be a desirable feature for a destination. So we want to target this group of people who want to study Arabic but cannot go to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina as non-Muslims. In order to do so, we have been working to bring more non-Muslims here to study Arabic. Our efforts were fruitful with a visit from the different Consulates exploring opportunities for international students to come to TU.</p><h4>Privatization is on the agenda of the education sector. What do you make of this trend, and do you see an opportunity for private investors to contribute to the sector in general, or Taif in particular? </h4><p>My specialty is in quality of education, measuring it, and looking at KPIs and benchmarks. I believe that privatization is one of the most important methods to improve the quality and efficiency of education. The public fund is huge in education in Saudi Arabia. In recent years, it has become the number one in terms of expenditure. But you cannot see the effects of that in terms of quality, and I think the reason is that it is not privatized yet. Privatization will streamline educational methods and improve overall quality standards. People going to privatized universities will get to appreciate what is going on, they will see the difference, and will see that they are getting what they paid for. Privatization is a whole package. Before privatization, we unified the whole system. We used to have two different ministries: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education. Now they have been unified into a single ministry. We also now have the polytechnic colleges under that ministry. We need to formalize and have a strategic vision for the whole sector, not just for parts of it. In TU, we used to have different colleges and four polytechnic colleges around Taif. People wanted only to go to the university to get a BA, but not the polytechnics. Only the people who could not get into the university went to the polytechnics. We now have formed a joint strategy and program to make sure that the 20,000 or so graduates all have the best option to pursue an education, because not all of those students need to go to university, many could go to the polytechnic for their interests and needs. So we filter students according to their capabilities and the needs of the region and the country in accordance with Vision 2030 and the National Plan. Let us take the tourism market in Taif as an example. There is no doubt that the tourism market in Taif is blooming and that requires the need for hospitality graduates, for which you do not need a BA or a university degree.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>For 2017 we have a reform plan in motion for programs at our university. We did a program transformation for many of our 44 programs. We have funded this ourselves, supported by our investment fund, and we are reviewing all our programs in terms of quality standards and market needs. We used to have a preparatory year where students take general courses in English, mathematics, and some communicative skills. But we found out that instead of having this at the beginning of their university studies, a vertical and integrated process would be the best way to go. For example, students, in some programs, were studying English in the first year, and then completing the rest of their program in Arabic which will definitely result in forgetting all their English by the time they graduate. In order to avoid that, we verticalized the program so that they could study English throughout all their university years. We are also shifting toward more online programs, and we are also aiming at increasing the percentage of international students on our campus. We currently have a very small number of international students because we didn't have a dorm before. Our aim is to reach a 10% full-time international student population by 2020 and attract people from all over the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of your operations in the country?</h4><p>In 2005, Lactalis acquired Food Master, a local company that showed signs of success and progress. After 12 years, we have seen significant growth of Lactalis in Kazakhstan in terms of turnover and business expansion. Today, Lactalis has over one-third of the market share both in terms of volume and in terms of value, and our target is to increase it by innovation and new products. We have identified several factors for our success. The first is being a French company with global expertise in production and thus operating according to global standards in Kazakhstan. Secondly, we have 16 different quality control steps in our factories, which ensure the quality of our products produced in Kazakhstan. Another is our leading position in the market and our large distribution network covering the entire country, ensuring our products are available everywhere. Today, we have a professional team and 1,860 employees in Lactalis Kazakhstan. Another factor of our success is our presence across all segments and categories. We have a range of 200 SKUs across different price segments.</p><h4>What is the importance of Kazakhstan in the global Lactalis portfolio?</h4><p>Lactalis has in its portfolio the President brand, which is well known worldwide and sold in over 145 different countries. Kazakhstan is among the top-10 countries globally in terms of sales of this brand. This is a matter of great importance as Kazakhstan has a population of 17 million. Despite the different preferences of consumers, Lactalis is represented in every family in Kazakhstan. Even if someone does not drink Ultra Fresh Lactalis, they have President Butter or President Cheese in their fridges. We are in 100% of the fridges of every family in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Where do you want the company to be in five years' time?</h4><p>We have ambitions to grow our business in the country; one-third of the market share is not much and we have the potential to grow and understand where this potential lies. It takes time to grow the company organically, from organizational growth and growth of equity, people, and portfolio with a careful pricing strategy. No one could have predicted two years ago that the devaluation would come at the rate of 20-25%, reaching a cumulative devaluation of 86% over two years. The key in 2016 was that we gained experience of doing business in a difficult economic environment. We did not lose in volume and even grew by almost 2% in terms of volume in 2016 versus 2015, though due to devaluation we lost in terms of value. Now we are on a positive track and will reach pre-crisis levels, which is great. I believe we can go beyond pre-crisis levels.</p><h4>What is the status of the agriculture sector in Kazakhstan and what challenges need to be overcome?</h4><p>There are still many challenges; however, it is important that the government and president are ready to push the development of the agriculture sector. There is a new program that the Minister of Agriculture will elaborate on soon; for me this is critical. It is a matter of great importance and is why Lactalis continues to invest where we see ongoing support from the government. The government's financial support with subsidies, which we receive on an annual basis, is significant. There is a great future in Kazakhstan for Lactalis. We have only one-third of the market share and envision growing by perhaps 10% in the next five years.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>If the situation is stable with no devaluation, then I expect volume growth and cash flow growth. I am positive about the overall situation within the country; I do not expect a large jump but the situation will be stable and things will gradually start to improve. Our government predicted 2% GDP growth in GDP so the inflation rate is 7%, which I believe is great. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BI Group covers many spheres of Kazakhstan's construction sector, from private to public infrastructure. Where do you see the biggest demand for your services and in which sector in particular?</h4><p>We want to be present in every sector for the diversification of our business, so that we will do well when the market grows; if the market goes down then we can offset this by working for the public sector. In addition, it is an interesting period for us now because we are involved in the oil and gas sector. We do interesting projects with great responsibility. There are only two companies in Kazakhstan that can have general contracts, one of which is BI Group. The sector's standards and requirements are high and at a global standard. We are pleased to be able to do that. It was not as easy for us 10 or 20 years ago. 15 years ago, we started working with residential construction, nine years ago we started working with general construction, and two years ago we started working with oil and gas.</p><h4>You are eyeing expansion in countries like China, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. What potential do you see in these countries and how are these plans going?</h4><p>We started work in the Russian region in 2016, in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. We also started a contract in Georgia. The next step we want to take—though we do not know when—concerns developing our competence. We have increased the level of our engineers in order to be able to move to other regions and other countries. Three years ago, we also started work on a government contract in Uzbekistan; however, we were unable to implement it because unfortunately it is still a closed country. Georgia, on the other hand, is open and we were able to start our work there early. We were also in Iran, which is a hospitable country. Iran is great; however, the competition there is higher because Iranians have been excellent traders for a thousand years. Russia does not have that much competition. Currently, there are enough sellers in Russia; however, for Iran that figure is not enough because everyone is successful. In three years, we might be able to go to China with a contract. However, Russia is our target for 2017. That is a priority. We have an advantage there over other foreign companies because we are fast and have the Russian proficiency and mentality. We are like a Turkish company, but closer to Russia.</p><h4>How would you assess the construction and real estate sector today in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Unfortunately, we do not have the support of banks because it is not a great time for them. Loans are expensive and approximately 20%, which is too much. It is not a great way to start a business and is not supportive. That is a problem not only for our company, but also for the entire construction sector in Kazakhstan. However, the government will work with programs. It wants to boost the financial sector and include the construction sector. If it can do that, that will be good. If the sector grows, it might only grow by 10-20% per year. That is not that large for us. For the past five years, we grew by approximately 30-40% per year. We are growing faster than the sector here.</p><h4>Where will BI Group be in five years?</h4><p>We have a strategy to grow by two and a half times. Using the Russian market, profits will increase. We are the biggest construction company in Kazakhstan, but that is not that large for Russia. Even if we move to Russia and aim for a two and a half or triple increase, Russians will not notice our presence. The market is that big compared to the market of Kazakhstan. Now is also a great time to move into the Russian market. Though it is a time of crisis for them, it is good for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of Kazakhstan for the global operations of M&amp;M?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is an interesting and important market that is fast emerging because of an abundance of natural resources. Kazakhstani companies are increasing exports, while foreign investors are looking to invest in the country. There are many interesting projects and investments in the pipeline and M&amp;M Militzer and Münch focuses on the service and support of the projects and always offers high-quality service in the logistics area. </p><h4>What strategy will you adopt to attract new clients and gain more market share?</h4><p>We aim to pay strong attention to every customer regardless of magnitude in the market, while focusing on quality of service and constantly looking to offer the best pricing solutions in order to save customers expenses in the logistics area. We also look to improve routes and transit time for supplies—these are the points and advantages that support us. M&amp;M has many benefits—we are focused on regional solutions between Europe, North Africa, and Asia and we are represented by more than 100 branches in more than 30 countries worldwide with qualified teams and professionals at the helm.</p><h4>How do you assess doing business in this sector in Kazakhstan and what are the particular challenges and opportunities faced here?</h4><p>Forwarding companies work with the same railways, airlines, and shipping lines, so the main thing for us is to focus on our jobs and shipments, which is an opportunity. We are not a global player like DHL, for example; however, we are flexible and if a client needs to get our service and attention quickly, we are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We seek to provide special services to our customers because nowadays it does not matter only how big or how global a company is; the main issue for local customers is the pricing and terms of payment. Companies have to be affordable and flexible with the terms of payments, especially if they want to win large tender contracts. The risk for us is that sometimes we have to provide quotations that are valid for a year, which is not ideal for us, but we sign such contracts and work hard to save and increase the margin. Sometimes with one contract we have some losses, while for the next one we have gains; it varies and this is the case with every business.</p><h4>How would you assess the government's efforts to make the logistics and transportation sector more attractive?</h4><p>The government is doing a great deal now, especially for railway shipments. For example, it has upgraded the train from China to Europe and the UK, though there are still many gaps to work on and cover because it is an expensive project and it needs to pay more attention to the administrative costs of such services. Of course, the government could do even more for roads to connect the various regions; for example, there is a major issue in finding a company to transport shipments from Almaty to Aktau or Atyrau because there are no good connections. In the future, we hope to be able to provide a quick service for import and export customs clearance because there are still many gaps in the legislation and delays. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>Personally, I have confidence that all businesses can grow. It is good to have many competitors here in the business, but still  we can go out and win the business for our company. I am confident that we can grow and participate in projects, tenders, and provide a highly qualified approach to any job great or small. We will also work with small businesses in Kazakhstan to support them and help them to grow in order to develop international trade for Kazakhstani markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qazaq Air is a young company, having been established only two years ago. How would you describe its journey and successes so far?</h4><p>Qazaq Air has been a huge project and a wonderful opportunity. We have been successful operationally and that is the most important thing in aviation: safety, security, and successful operations. To provide some examples, in January 2016—which along with February is the worst month of the year for Kazakhstan's aviation because no one is up for traveling—we only had a 30% load factor on our aircraft. In January 2017 that number was in excess of 60%. That is great growth in the worst month of the year. Most airlines achieve just 70% load factor for the entire year. This success is the result of the increasing recognition of our company and of increasing business activity in the country, with oil prices picking up and benefiting the economy overall.</p><h4>Qazaq Air had expansion plans last year in terms of fleet and passengers, with a target of 250,000 passengers. How have those plans worked out?</h4><p>We set ourselves some challenging targets in our first year, but ended up carrying 215,000 passengers; we were a bit short of the target, though it was still a good result. We want to reach 450,000 passengers by 2019. We are generally conservative in our estimates, but believe that every number we put out there is reachable. We want to increase to five aircraft, up from three now. That will increase passenger numbers and will also mean we can use our aircraft more efficiently and cost-effectively. It would increase our capacity by 40%, translating into more flight hours per month, more frequencies on our popular routes, and higher efficiency of our route network.</p><h4>What are your most popular routes?</h4><p>The Almaty-Astana route is always popular and we do a daily flight on that one. Of course, every airline flies that route, so it is not the most exciting one. The interesting ones are, for instance, Atyrau-Aktobe and Uralsk-Atyrau, neither of which is flown by anyone else. These flights enable workers and people on rotation contracts to get home quickly and safely in much less time. The new routes we are looking at are in west Kazakhstan in particular, where we want to increase our business. We have three routes from Atyrau and want to increase frequencies on those routes. We only fly Uralsk-Atyrau twice a week and want to increase that to three times a week. We thus need to set up a maintenance base in West Kazakhstan as well. We are also looking at nearby international destinations in Russia, Central Asia, and possibly Azerbaijan now that Azerbaijan has relaxed visa requirements. That being said, we are a regional airline, not long haul. We have a range of 1,800km on our aircraft.</p><h4>When will Qazaq Air start thinking in profit terms rather than cost reduction terms?</h4><p>Our company is due to be privatized. To be privatized in Kazakhstan, a company should have three years of audited accounts and a decent financial history, and it needs to have at least visibility of profits in the future, even if it is not profitable at the time of going to market. We told our shareholders we will be ready to work on privatization in 2020.</p><h4>How does being a state-owned company affect your operations and what is the main difference with running a private airline?</h4><p>There is a great deal of paperwork and bureaucracy as a state-owned company, as there should be, because the company is spending public money. We have a “big four“ accounting firm audit us, we have CSR policies, produce reports and accounts, and comply with all national corporate governance issues and so on. However, these things are important in terms of the reputation of our company and Samruk Kazyna, the company that finances us. They are all great for the long term; however, they have real costs in the short term. The plus side is that we receive financial support from the state and have no trouble raising funds. So there are pros and cons to running both a public and a private company. In our position, it is better to be state owned under Samruk Kazyna. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-case-for-cautious-optimism]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main highlights of Air Astana's recent successes?</h4><p>We began as a start-up company. When I arrived 11 years ago, a great deal of work had been done to get the airline going and it was operating effectively. In the last four years, however, we have really broken through in terms of service levels, operational reliability, and, of course, our international image. To do so, an airline needs to have a certain number of aircraft, routes, and people who understand what it seeks to achieve internally in terms of corporate and organizational behavior. It is only able to achieve this when it has reached a certain critical mass; that is when it can really develop its internal culture and external image, which is what we have achieved in the last four years.</p><h4>Has Air Astana benefitted from low oil prices?</h4><p>Oil prices are a double-edged sword; on the one hand, our costs have fallen. However, the market has been very badly affected as the country is dependent on oil for much of its GDP and tax revenues. The overall effect has been that we have lost more than we have gained, though we are still profitable. The years following the 2008 recession were great for us; however, since 2014 when oil prices collapsed and the tenge devalued, it has been challenging. We reached the bottom in 2016. The oil price has partially recovered; however, we need to remember that Kazakhstan does not only have oil; it has huge mineral resources, and as there could well be an infrastructure boom in the US this could a great opportunity. I believe we will come out of the recession of the last two years in a good place.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the one-dollar stopover initiative launched by Air Astana and the potential of Kazakhstan's tourism sector?</h4><p>The initiative has been a great success and we are seeing a huge amount of stopover traffic. Our business to and from Kazakhstan is down by 18%; however, this year our transit business is up 92%. Any tourist who comes to Kazakhstan can stay for a dollar a day. There is revenue for hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, nightclubs, and so on. The average Chinese tourist spends around USD150 a day, not including airfare. Last year, we carried approximately 200,000 Chinese tourists, which is a great deal of money entering the economy. The potential for tourism here is transit business. That is how Southeast Asia—Singapore and Hong Kong in particular—built up its tourism industries, via stopover tourism. Of course there is potential for traditional tourism—there are people who are interested in winter sports holidays in Kazakhstan, and already flying here with us for this reason—but that is not mass tourism. The greatest potential is in stopovers. When people stop over, they take a short tour, get to know the place, and quickly realize that the country has in fact much to offer.</p><h4>Air Astana is the official carrier of the Expo 2017. How will this affect the company in the medium term?</h4><p>In the medium term the government's plan is to convert the Expo site into a financial center, and if this proceeds as envisioned, we will see a large amount of business traffic. It is a long-term sustainable project. The challenge is to make sure the financial center does in fact come to pass. In the short term of course we look forward to carrying many visitors to the Expo. It will showcase the best of Kazakhstan and could not come at a better time.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We are cautiously optimistic. We expect an 11% increase in business this year. We have two more Airbuses A320 NEOs on order for delivery mid-year. The government has made significant investments in infrastructure to jumpstart the economy and provide employment. In our case that affords some tremendous benefits. A brand new terminal will open at Astana Airport in mid-May, coincidentally our 15th anniversary. 2017 will be a watershed year and we expect that over the course of the next 15 years, Air Astana will become a widely known and much-respected glocal brand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year MG Holding started sales of the Residences at the St. Regis Astana, while the hotel is almost complete. Can you tell us more about the status of these projects?</h4><p>These products are the first of their kind in this segment, a luxury, fully branded residential product. The majority of actual sales will be officially completed when we have the building occupation certification from the local authorities. Based on our plans, the residences and the hotel will be completed in July. The interior will be done on a customized basis, because, as it is the luxury segment, we cannot provide similar finishes for every client. We have exclusive clients who want their own tastes reflected. We work with Wimberly International, a renowned interior design firm from London that did the interior design of both the hotel and the public areas of the residential building. The residences are unique, with access that is separated from the St. Regis Astana, though residents can still access and use the hotel services.</p><h4>In terms of investors' interest in the residences, do you expect them to be mostly local?</h4><p>We expect mostly high-net-worth locals. We do not just offer a residence; we offer a club. It is very much a status symbol, reflecting a customer's status, tastes, and standing in society. They will be part of a select community, the Astana elite, and others from around Kazakhstan. Things are now shifting to Astana, including the financial sector with the Astana International Finance Center, so there will be more need and demand for similar signature projects. There are similar products entering the market that will widen the portfolio of clients and we feel confident that we can compete in that environment, because we have a top-quality project out there. The increase in the scale of quality products is positive for us, with a larger market and more competitive environment in which we expect to thrive.</p><h4>How would you rate the luxury market today, and where do you see the sector going in the coming years?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is large; therefore, we should look at it by region. The luxury segment only developed in Astana in the last 20 years, whereas Almaty goes much further back. Therefore, there are still many opportunities for the luxury sector in Astana. If a company does the right thing in Kazakhstan and people get top quality for what they pay for and they love it, they will demand more. Quality is everything. That is what we try to deliver.</p><h4>How has MG Holding managed to be so successful in just five years?</h4><p>We have a top management team that is truly excellent. We also believe in outsourcing tasks and operations to make sure we do what we are best at while others do what they are best at—all of us are working toward a common goal. We pick our partners carefully, identifying who to work with in each area, before proceeding with a project. When we work with the best, we get the best. We have no limitations in terms of finding the best partner. For the St. Regis project, for example, we first identified the operator. Then, we looked for the best architect, the best interior designer, the top engineer, and so on. Of course, we also need a team that can manage all these teams; hence, our management company. We let those companies and teams perform and do what they do best, and we manage these projects. We believe in the power of teamwork and spare no costs to work with, find, and attract the best. We may be young, but we are confident in our segment and have strong partners to work with. If any factor other than quality takes precedence in selecting who a company works with, then it naturally compromises quality by definition.</p><h4>How much of your management team is comprised of local employees and is it a challenge to find talented locals?</h4><p>Whenever possible, we try to work with the local teams of the companies we work with, rather than with international companies. Still, it is a challenge to find good local partners and professionals with the right skill sets and experience, so we try to bring them together to have a contributory role. That being said, we have four brilliant colleagues just out of university, and we give them a chance to take the initiative and produce work for themselves, delegating responsibility to them. We want to get the younger and newer generations involved and to take pride in the work they do. It is also a much faster and better way to build experience.</p><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline here and abroad? What opportunities do you see in the future for additional segments?</h4><p>As a group of companies, MG Holding is focused on creating and delivering top class commercial real estate projects. While doing extensive research, we have identified potential and growing demand for the wellness industry, which perfectly blends with and complements the luxury real estate sector we are in—both commercial and residential. Thus, we have worked out a separate ambitious project and established an agreement with UFC Gym (US) in 2016 to be its master franchisee for the whole CIS region. We will be responsible for executing UFC Gym's master franchise in 11 countries within the region. That project will kick off soon and we have the most suitable locations to rollout the network of gyms. We are doing our research and want to develop a minimum of 15 clubs. One of the conditions of the agreement is that UFC Gym will come here and set up a management company; this will create opportunities for Kazakhstani citizens to work there. All these are handled by our MG Sport company, which we recently set up. UFC Gym will have a different approach to other fitness centers, mainly oriented to martial arts and sports like boxing, wrestling, judo, aikido, and so on. In this way we will create a life-changing and rewarding experience for our clients in the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We look forward to launching the St. Regis Astana and The Residences at the St. Regis Astana and developing UFC Gyms. In terms of the overall economy, I expect things to keep moving forward. Expo 2017 Astana will be a positive stimulus for future activities, especially in Astana. In our sector, there are still many untapped opportunities. We need to continue to do our research and homework. We have a positive outlook for what lies ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry working towards a “green revolution“ in Zambia?</h4><p>The country has been talking about diversification for a long time and in September 2016 the president made a deliberate move in parliament when he announced plans for a “green revolution.“ In line with this, in 2017 we have seen the budget for agriculture grow by over 158%. To us, diversity does not just mean moving the economy from mining to agriculture, but completely radicalizing the agriculture industry in Zambia. Currently, 70% of Zambia's working population is involved in some sort of agricultural activity, and yet agriculture only accounts for 9% of the country's GDP. My target is to increase this to 20% in the next few years, and we will do this by investing in research and extension services. It is important to make informed decisions about agriculture, both from an economic point and from a technical point of view, such as soil and fertilizer testing. Furthermore, we need to be able to track the income growth of farmers and measure the impact our reforms and energy is having on the sector. We will, therefore, compile a database. The final part is the necessity to dedicate a portion of the government's budget to financing agriculture for at least five years.  </p><h4>What incentives is the Ministry putting in place to boost crop diversification?</h4><p>Zambia has been monocrop economy for far to long. The majority of farmers in Zambia, close to 2 million agricultural households, grow mostly maize. To encourage crop diversification in 2017 we are supporting 10 crops with a smart subsidy of 75% for the production of orange maize, sorghum, millet, groundnuts, cotton, rice, soybeans, and cassava. Part of that is to also ensure there are market linkages. In the past, the government has only procured maize, but as we encourage the private sector we must provide a market for all the other crops, particularly cassava, which can be used as a food source, as a starch in industry, and for export. One of the real pillars of my ministership is a new communication strategy in terms of transforming the food culture in Zambia. In this country, yellow maize is associated with hardship and poverty, because in the past when the country had tremendous challenges in producing white maize, yellow maize was imported into the country. We have to change that mind-set and to do this we should call upon partners, stakeholders, and NGOs in food-related business to work together to change the mindset of Zambians.</p><h4>How will the ministry increase Zambia's participation in regional markets?</h4><p>Our plans for free trade zones, particularly in Kasumbalesa, are coming into focus. The DRC is almost a part of Zambia in terms of food supply, meaning this market is huge, not just for large businesses like Zambeef but also for small farmers in poultry and eggs. We have an agreement with the DRC in regards to illegal trade along the border, which stretches for almost 1,000km and makes it difficult for us to have formal trade. However, following discussions with the Minister of Finance we are debating how best to formalize this so-called “illegal“ trade by creating a free trade zone where everyone could be trading in a structured manner and with one currency, the dollar. Many companies have been reluctant to open businesses on that side of the border, because they are concerned about regulations and system frameworks for companies in DRC. With this, we could open up a booming market and considerable opportunities for Zambia.</p><h4>What are the other main challenges facing the agriculture sector in Zambia?</h4><p>We have also seen production and productivity affected by a lack of investment in mechanization and irrigation. We cannot even begin to talk about value addition in terms of manufacturing and agribusiness, let alone meeting the demand for export market, if we still face productivity challenges. Zambia has the potential to produce 10 million tons of maize per year, but only cultivates 3 million in a good year. In 2016, the region's food reserves ran out and other countries called on Zambia for support but we could not meet both domestic and regional market demand, and were forced to ban food exports. In the 2017 budget, there is a zero rating mechanization incentive for tractors and spare parts, which is important. If we are going to diversify and increase productivity, we need technology. We also have plans to create about 20 bulk water sites as major irrigation points to support a number of agriculture communities. We intend for this to be the first part of a nationwide water infrastructure of canals and dams, managed by technological innovation, to cushion farmers from bad weather cycles.</p><h4>In what ways are you planning to revise the FISP program?</h4><p>I intend to review the FISP in terms of our selection of farmers for the program and how the private sector participates. We have seen the government trying to withdraw from the agriculture sector in terms of input supply and allow the private sector to grow, and we have seen that this approach has not always worked, as many participants have abused the system. There have been cases of agro-dealers colluding on price inputs, or not having the capacity to procure or source enough input to meet the farmers' demand in some areas. Our farmers have to begin to take responsibility and understand that money will not simply fall into their laps. We want them to make money so that the government can make money. This shows the importance of developing a nationwide database through which we are able to track farmers and ensure that the support they are getting from the government is money well spent. We have also had challenges with participating banks, for example some of the E-voucher cards that we provide to farmers were delivered to farmers late in 2016. At the same time, this was only the second year of the E-voucher, and it is normal for there to be initial problems.</p><h4>What is the potential in Zambia for growing exotic fruits and cashew nuts?</h4><p>In my constituency, seven years ago I introduced the Citizens Economic Empowerment program, stressing the profitability of cashew nuts. Cashew nuts take seven years to mature, so this year was the first harvest. This illustrates changing attitudes to cultivation of crops in Zambia. Where in the past, the country was seen as one large farm and one crop was applied to it. Now we are taking a closer look at soil patterns. For example, the western province is very sandy, and while maize can grow there, it would be better suited to a drought-tolerant crop, such as cashew nuts. We have therefore embarked on a cashew program with the African Development Bank to support farmers beyond seeds and financing, giving them assistance in terms of infrastructure, agro-processing, and capacity building. Ultimately we intend to encourage the farmers themselves to take ownership. The total amount dedicated to the western province was USD55.2 million. The money is going to 60,000 farmers, of whom 50% have to be women and another third or so have to be young people. Ultimately the project will benefit over 600,000 people in the province. At the current rate, a ton of cashew nuts is the equivalent price to a ton of copper, which illustrates the potential of this crop.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Kazakhstan play in Huawei's overall portfolio and what is the country's potential for growth in the sector?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is one of few countries developing dynamically during the current volatile period. The government focuses on modernization and improvement of the communication and IT infrastructure, which is vital for sustainable development. This is why Kazakhstan experiences a high demand for the newest ICT products and solutions that increase people's quality of life and the efficiency of its businesses. As a leading global ICT producer, Huawei supplies products and solutions to governments and enterprises in over 170 countries, and more than one-third of the world's population uses Huawei products and solutions. Kazakhstan is a strategically important country for the company and we intend to expand our business here. The local representative office was set up in 1998, and in 2007 the company established the Huawei Almaty subsidiary, with 80% of employees being local. In 2016, the company was renamed “Huawei Technologies Kazakhstan" LLP. In Kazakhstan we cover all three of the corporation's business lines. In its carrier business, Huawei is innovating to support telecoms operators' digital transformation and is driving the development of cutting-edge technologies such as 5G and IoT connectivity, which promise to reshape the role of telecoms operators across numerous industries.</p><h4>How important is the consumer segment among the technology services and products of Huawei's portfolio?</h4><p>Huawei Consumer Business Group is among the top-three leading smartphone producers in terms of shipments in the world. Revenue for the year increased by 41%, while the number of smartphones shipped increased by 25%, far exceeding the growth of the market of 3.1%. In Kazakhstan, the results are much more modest; Huawei currently holds just over 6.9% of the smartphone market here and sales of Huawei smartphones for the first five months of 2016 grew more than five fold. This increase in market share was possible thanks to the development of a retail and distribution network and increased marketing activity; we have signed a contract with major players such as Technodom, Sulpak, Mechta, Evrika, MNI, and Kcell. One of the main tasks of Huawei is to raise global awareness, so the company is investing in a variety of sports, entertainment, youth, and other projects.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your initiatives to promote cooperation in e-commerce?</h4><p>We actively work with partners to develop cloud computing and big data platforms to help customers improve the efficiency of network transformation in all aspects, including architecture, hardware, and software services. Together, we help enterprises achieve success in digitalization. As for the promotion of e-commerce in Kazakhstan, Huawei is interested in cooperation and the implementation of joint projects in the field of promoting e-commerce and integration of payment systems. Ultimately, end users do not really care about the platform or application equipment being used. The main results are anywhere, anytime, with any device to obtain high-quality services. This is what we seek.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Expo present for Huawei, and what is your vision for Digital Kazakhstan 2020?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev, during his visit to China in 2014, met with Huawei Chairwoman of the Board of Directors Sun Yafang. Huawei expressed its willingness to support Kazakhstan during Expo by setting up connections for the exhibition premises so the numerous visitors and journalists from all over the globe could easily use mobile internet services. As for Digital Kazakhstan 2020, which aims to increase the number of regular internet users to 75% of the total population, Huawei has presented a concept for the development of national ICT projects within the framework of this program to the government. Huawei focuses on promoting the roadmap for the implementation of ICT projects. First of all we pay attention to the implementation of infrastructure projects to ensure the elimination of the digital divide and provide broadband internet access in remote settlements in rural areas, as well as the preparations for full-scale implementation of socially important systems such as e-learning and e-health.</p><h4>What other major projects does Huawei have in the pipeline in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We are proud that in 2013 we won the tender and became a partner of Kazakhtelecom and its subsidiary Altel network for the construction, equipment supply, and delivery of 4G next-generation communication services. Based on the contract, Huawei has to cover all the cities of Kazakhstan with a 4G network by 2018. To date, most of the work has been done and the republic's population has been able to enjoy high-speed internet and make calls. Since late 2015 other operators in Kazakhstan gained the right to provide 4G services and Huawei actively cooperates with them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you establish your first factory outside of Turkey in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Kazakhstan was the first country chosen by Efes because of the opportunities it offered in being open to Europe and having close ties with Turkey. Our brewery in Karaganda was the first investment of Anadolu Group in 1997. The total investment of Anadolu Group in Kazakhstan is around USD650 million, and the part invested through Efes Kazakhstan is above USD250 million for the three breweries we have—one in Karaganda and two in Almaty</p><h4>What have been the main achievements for Efes in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our main achievement has been to become the absolute market leader. In 2008 our market share was 25% and within three years we increased that to 55%. We brought many innovations to the market such as the new concept of fresh beer in a bottle. Typically the shelf life of beer is nine to 12 months, while the shelf life of the new concept created by us is four months. In addition to this, other new types of beer were launched, like easy-drinking lager (a mild beer under the Kruzhka Svezhego brand) and unfiltered beer</p><h4>What is your strategy for being a trendsetter in the market?</h4><p>First of all a company needs to feel the market. It should take some lessons from the past but it does not mean the same pattern should be repeated in the future. Companies should understand where the market is going. Nowadays beer markets in the CIS region are either declining or flat, due to many reasons like regulatory constraints and fall in purchasing power. Particularly in Kazakhstan, the beer market shrunk around 20% in the last five years. So, we continue investing in innovations to develop the category. Last summer we introduced a new category—unpasteurized beer in a bottle, called Three weeks (“3 “). Secondly, we want to pursue our goal of serving our consumers with products brewed from 100% natural raw materials like malt and hops, ensuring world-class quality and taste from our breweries equipped with latest technology.</p><h4>What strategy will you adopt to achieve your goal of doubling business by 2020?</h4><p>One of the strategies is investing not only in equipment, but also in people. In order to be successful a company needs good employees generating smart ideas. Generally in our industry, the turnover for employees is around 15%, while in our company it is 2.5% because we invest in employees. This year we provided 20,000 hours of training to our staff, or about 30 hours per person. Our employee engagement, which represents employees' satisfaction, is 76% compared to the country average of 62%. The second aspect is the portfolio of products. We continually emphasize the importance of innovation, because consumers are bored with purchasing the same product over five or 10 years, and so companies should give them something new.</p><h4>What will be your main focus for 2017?</h4><p>We already have three breweries but each year we make investments of more than USD10 million into Kazakhstan's market. We will continue to be innovative by launching new brands and creating new trends.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the consumption of alcoholic beverages in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The market is not growing steadily, mostly due to advertising bans. Now there are some initiatives from the mass media sector to lift this ban. Removal of the ban will help the beer market to grow. Elsewhere, draught beer channels selling beer in plastic bottles have been growing. The share of key accounts in beer sales in Kazakhstan is growing and there is room for growth in the future for that channel.</p><h4>The government seeks to introduce duty on alcoholic beverages. How will this affect Efes?</h4><p>Currently we pay an excise tax per liter of beer. It was KZT26 per liter but in 2017 it will be raised by 50%. This is of course negative for us, as it limits market growth. Also in 2016 additional tax was introduced for underground water usage. To overcome the increase in tax burden we should be more efficient.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>The market did not grow in 2016, and in 2017 we expect a decline due to an increase in the tax burden on companies. But we are the locomotive of the beer industry and locomotives never stop. We pull others behind us and will not stop because we know what to do and how to react to the market and we will continue in that manner. In 2017, although the market will decline, we will have positive growth. We still have good expectations from the market and we believe in Kazakhstan, the economy, the future of the country, and the people. That is why we are here and we will continue working to make life more enjoyable for people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[more-than-smoke-and-mirrors]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of your operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our first milestone was the acquisition of a state-owned tobacco factory in 1993 in what was one of the first examples of FDI in Kazakhstan. The times were incredibly difficult, with the country's economy in a desperate tailspin. The tobacco factory we purchased was not fully operational, causing cigarette shortages, and the market was flooded with illicit tobacco. We rapidly moved to inject capital and liquidity to re-start production. Our second milestone was the construction of a modern greenfield facility. We have been actively contributing to Kazakhstan's economy over the past 24 years by being a sizable investor and taxpayer. Last, but not least, was the introduction of non-combustible products, which potentially represent a game-changer for the industry.</p><h4>How do tobacco giants like Phillip Morris successfully operate in a world newly conscious about people's health and remain successful?</h4><p>Clearly, the safest approach from a health standpoint is not to consume tobacco at all. However, despite increased regulation and smoking prevention campaigns, there are still more than 1 billion smokers globally. According to the World Health Organization's base projection, this figure is unlikely to decline quickly enough in the years to come. Philip Morris supports regulation intended to reduce harm caused by smoking. The regulations should be well conceived in order to minimize severe unintended consequences, such as the emergence of illicit trade. Illicit trade is unregulated by its very nature, and defeats public health objectives. Besides regulatory tools, the product itself should be addressed fundamentally. Cigarette smoke contains flavor from the tobacco blend, and nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco leaves. It is flavor and nicotine that smokers enjoy in cigarettes. However, when a smoker burns (or combusts) tobacco, the resulting chemical reaction produces about 8,000 different chemical compounds, approximately 1% of which—including carbon monoxide, benzo[a]pyrene, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, benzene, and others—are known to be the causes, or potential causes, of smoking-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and emphysema. There is frequently an assumption that it is nicotine that makes smoking harmful. Nicotine is addictive, but it is not the main concern related to smoking. While nicotine is not risk-free (it can increase heart rate and blood pressure, for example), the main causes of smoking-related diseases are various chemicals produced as a result of tobacco combustion. As the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says, “it is primarily the toxins and carcinogens in tobacco smoke—not the nicotine—that cause illness and death." The conceptual thinking about how to reduce harm, while allowing people to continue enjoying tobacco, has been around for some time. The key concept is that tobacco should be warmed to a temperature, just enough to release nicotine and flavor—which is what consumers enjoy—but not enough to combust tobacco and produce smoke.</p><h4>Is this when you started producing iQOS, your new reduced-risk product line?</h4><p>We have been investing in the development of combustion-free alternatives since 2008. Our R&amp;D is focused on developing products that offer a flavorful, nicotine-containing vapor—but with far lower levels of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke. IQOS Tobacco-Heating System (THS) is one of the platforms in Philip Morris' innovation pipeline. It uses sophisticated electronics to heat a special tobacco stick to less than 350°C, temperatures at which combustion and smoke production cannot occur. While IQOS is not totally risk-free, our laboratory tests of its vapor indicate that it is significantly less toxic than cigarette smoke. We have run two separate 90-day exposure studies, one in the US and one in Japan. These studies reported that smokers who switched completely to IQOS THS reduced their exposure to selected harmful or potentially harmful chemical compounds (based on the measurements of biomarkers of exposure), and the levels of reduced exposure approached the levels observed in people who quit smoking for the duration of the studies. And, according to air-quality tests, the use of IQOS does not negatively impact indoor-air quality. So we believe that IQOS is a viable alternative for adult smokers who would like to continue using tobacco. Importantly, our research indicates negligible interest in IQOS among never-smokers and former smokers.</p><h4>What is your expectation for 2017?</h4><p>In the near to medium term I think the absence of bad economic news would be great news. Hopefully, consumers will be a little more confident going forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Industry Pioneers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[industry-pioneers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your comparative advantage over your competitors and the key driver of Galaksi's success over the years?</h4><p>The first reason for our success in Kazakhstan is that we were the first company in the non-energy sector investing in Kazakhstan. We opened our pipe factory in 1997 at a time when people were trying to sell their properties to enter other countries. We were the first company to produce plastic pipes, aluminum profile production, UPVC windows, and, in 2012, insulated glass chemicals. This year, despite the crisis we were the first company to produce window and door accessories in Kazakhstan. We have been pioneers, which means we have helped create new sectors for Kazakhstan. If we did not believe in Kazakhstan and the vision of the government, we would not invest. An important issue is that we have replaced imports by producing inside the country. The other area that we have changed is the quality of local production, although this has been hard because construction companies and decision-makers in the construction sector still have doubts about the quality of local production. We extensively promote “made in Kazakhstan" to change the negative perceptions about local production.</p><h4>What can be done to reverse the perception of Kazakhstan producing cheaper and lower quality products?</h4><p>It is not easy because European brands always have the advantage. This is not a coincidence because when it comes to our sector, for example, the windows, doors, and plastics sector, German companies have a large advantage because everyone believes Germans are the best. There are two sides: first, the Germans are indeed doing a great job and we respect them. Second, there are problems with the local production mentality in general. As a foreign investor we stand between these two issues. We are a local producer and try to build up to international standards for windows, doors, and facades. We work hard on this but are not German and do not have German employees to make these products. We have local employees and the results are truly great when we compare our sector to other countries. We are the only local producer that produces according to international standards. </p><h4>What are Galaksi's expansion plans?</h4><p>In 2016 we started exporting to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, Afghanistan, and Azerbaijan. Our business model is B2B and we try to find stable partners. We are still working on expanding our export market in the Eurasian region. Despite the crisis, in 2016 we invested in the production of window and door accessories in Almaty. It is the first and only factory that produces window and door accessories in Kazakhstan and is a great example of import replacement for the economy. Every raw material needed for accessories is locally present. Before our investment, Kazakhstan was exporting raw materials and importing finished products; but now everything is produced in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How has it been conducting business in Kazakhstan in the last few years?</h4><p>Since the end of 2014, the country's economy has been turbulent and every sector in the country has had very hard times. In the middle of 2016, our economy started to stabilize. The economy stabilized a little but not quite enough, which is better than instability in a bad economy. 2015 also saw great problems with the tenge. When the central bank started free floating the tenge the situation became difficult. For about four or five months there were times when the exchange, banks, and central bank all had different exchange rates in one day. For this reason, we prefer to have a stabilized bad economy than volatility. We are still in the midst of a crisis; however, this time we all know this is the worst crisis in our history and therefore must take care of our business, households, and operations.</p><h4>How would you welcome more assistance from the government to develop the manufacturing sector?</h4><p>The government is doing a great job to develop the investment climate in Kazakhstan, and we also have good relations with the Minster of Investment and Development when it comes to promoting investment in Kazakhstan. I see very good intentions on the government's side to make something good for the country and attract more foreign investors. This crisis showed that Kazakhstan cannot completely depend on oil. The government realizes this and wants to attract more investors, especially in medium-sized real industrial sectors other than oil and mining. The President is urging the government to change its regulations and develop an investment climate with more investors, and he is putting in place performance criteria for all these items. One of the key opportunities for this country is producing goods for which it already has raw materials. Despite all these positive steps, there are still some problems with infrastructure and regulations. Many investors suffer from the same infrastructure issue; for  example, we have a plot of land in an industrial zone in Brunday Iliski Raion, which we bought in July 2014 and are still waiting for electricity to start our investment there. We hope to have electricity there by the end of 2017. Another issue is that investors cannot buy land in free and special economic zones. A three-year lease contract does not provide enough time for investors to start in free and special economic zones. The government should consider changing the regulation surrounding free and special economic zones and make it more attractive and less risky for investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is RG Gold's growth strategy to achieve its goal of becoming one of the top mining companies by 2017 and increasing production 50% by 2018?</h4><p>Our strategy is divided into short- and long-term objectives. In the short term, we aim to expand our current capacity and remove bottlenecks in the production of oxide ores. We plan to build another crushing and screening facility that will help increase production by 50%. By 2018 we will produce about 1.5 tons of gold. In the long term, we want to work with primary ores where the main value is underground. We have about 4.2 million oz of gold in underground resources. We need different technologies to mine that and will need to build a comprehensive plant. It is a massive new facility that will require an investment of about USD150-200 million. Once complete, we will produce up to six tons of gold, making us a significant player in the market. We want to reach this objective by 2021. We expect the mine to operate another 15-20 years.</p><h4>Can you tell us about RG Gold's operations and major achievements over the past few years?</h4><p>In 2012, the company was acquired by new owners that were financially strong and business savvy. A few years earlier it successfully developed the Altyntau gold mine. 80km north of RG Gold, it produces over 300,000oz of gold per year. The company invested around USD700 million and successfully exited the project with a significant return on capital. We were confident RG Gold would follow a similar path. The first thing we did was build new and comfortable dormitories and recreational facilities. Health and safety were put forward as top priorities for the entire staff and integrated into all aspects of daily operations. We then developed a second open pit, invested in a new crushing and screening plant to double the production to over 30,000oz of gold per year, completed an upgrade of a hydrometallurgical plant, and built two new core warehouses. We generated enough cash to finance our exploration program. In 2016, RG Gold completed unprecedented exploration work that promises to result in a three-fold increase in resources—over 4 million oz of gold in an open pit. When converted into reserves, this will provide the basis for the company's future development. We expect JORC-compliant reserves to be reported in the first half of 2017.</p><h4>What are your future expansion plans and main priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>Our oxide ores are expected to last until 2021-2022. By that time we plan to design and build a new gold process plant that will allow us to treat primary ore, which requires intensive crushing and grinding before being treated by similar leaching technologies. We plan to retain world-class engineering firms that can help us design, build, and put into operation the most efficient and technological plant. We expect to invest over USD150 million of our own capital and debt financing. By the time the plant is operational in 2021-2022, we will produce up to 200,000oz of gold, which will make us a significant gold producer both in Kazakhstan and the CIS.</p><h4>Mining exploration can be risky and expensive. How do you overcome that challenge?</h4><p>Mining is a risky industry; a company runs the risk of not finding anything underground or finding something that is not economically feasible. The right approach is to conduct exploration in stages. Once it feels confident there is something underground, a company can invest more money. That is what everyone does. It helps mitigate risks and manage costs more efficiently. There are various ways to conduct exploration that do not involve digging, for example airborne studies, where we take photos that show magnetic fields and we determine where the prospects lie depending on that magnetic map. When the mining code reforms come into effect, they will help entrepreneurs and those who are prepared to take risks to take them with less obstacles and less investment, along with more certainty that if they find something it will be theirs. Once those risks are managed better, the industry will move forward much faster. Metal prices are going up as well, so that is also a big boost.</p><h4>How else will the new mining code affect and improve the mining sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>I have not seen the code as it is still being drafted; however, it is purported to liberalize the industry and offer easy, fair, and transparent access to exploration blocks. Many principles will be adopted from a similar code in Australia based on a first-come-first-serve approach and companies will not have to pay large amounts as they enter the sector. Companies will, apparently, have to make certain commitments in exploration, which will grow over time. The new regulations will help companies to do all the right things from the beginning, so there are incentives to explore and operate immediately, rather than just getting a concession and then sitting on it for three years, and so on. It will liberalize the market as well, with more players paying and then playing, so to speak. It will enhance the attractiveness of the mining sector. We support any effort to remove risks in the industry and promote investment into new exploration. This will bring a new dynamism to the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Some believe it will take a number of years for it to be a boom again, though the sector is steadily picking up. This is good news but it has to be sustainable. I personally believe we will continue to grow at this steady pace, though not at “crazy" growth rates, and we may end this year with around 4-5% growth, compared to last year. We have taken market share and expect to continue doing so next year as well. The two other business areas, construction and compressors, are stable but not picking up at the desired rate; mining in this part of the world is definitely Atlas Copco's key growth area.</p><h4>Mining exploration is on the rise in Kazakhstan. What opportunities does this offer Atlas Copco?</h4><p>Exploration is a part of what we do and it comes before mining. We have seen in 2016 exploration—on the underground side in particular—is picking up, though not much yet on the surface side. Next year surface exploration is expected to grow again. In South Kazakhstan there is a great deal of uranium and this is where Katco operates. We do not really have equipment for what Katco does; however, we sell portable compressors to it and we are developing a drill that will hopefully be useful for it that will be ready next June, possibly earlier. It uses old Russian equipment, which is cheap.</p><h4>Is transportation a potential segment for your portfolio?</h4><p>We do have equipment for the construction sector, so yes it is. There are remote areas in this huge country, so there are logistics issues, mainly deriving from the weather. In the north, roads are sometimes closed for days or weeks in the winter. There is a great need for new roads. It is mainly local contractors that build roads, but there is nothing truly big happening at the moment.</p><h4>Is there a trend in the mining industry to turn to high-quality Western products?</h4><p>Yes, the industry likes to use Western equipment but with Eastern pricing, which is unfortunate. There is constant pressure and all mines would certainly prefer to have European or American drill rigs but at Chinese prices. To overcome this, manufacturers have to try to educate their customers. It is not only about getting companies to understand that they have to pay for a great product; manufacturers have to make money too in order to support their customers adequately. If manufacturers are squeezed to the point where there are no margins, then they cannot employ people to support and service their customers; this must be clear. The difference between Western and Eastern quality used to be great but that is no longer the case. Eastern manufacturers have improved their quality, so the gap is smaller. Western manufacturers, meanwhile, focus more on aftersales. It is a big challenge to compete, and we are continually adapting our cost structure, because we have to make sure we deliver value to all our stakeholders.</p><h4>How attractive is Kazakhstan's mining sector to international investors?</h4><p>Many international players left the market because they expected the mining code to become law last year; so long as it is not enforced, very few will come, except for Russian players, which understand the mentality and culture. Australian and American miners need to have a concession for a good number of years to operate to justify investments of billions of dollars. Companies do not want to put their money somewhere where there are uncertainties. However, there is great potential in mining; it could be as big as Russia, as Kazakhstan is endowed with metals and minerals all over the country. Kazakhstan needs to create a stable and safe investment environment or no one will invest. The new mining law will be based on the Australian code but it has not been implemented yet. Mining has huge potential and could be bigger than oil and gas; there is copper, gold, zinc, chrome, iron ore, gold, and uranium as well as strategic minerals. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>I would like to see 10% growth. This is ambitious but mining is a cyclical business; if it bounces back it really will bounce back. It does not need to experience a boom. For example, we recently received an order worth EUR1 million, which two weeks later increased to EUR6 million; this demonstrates that things can change quickly. If we can get three or four such capital equipment orders a year then it is a different ball game. September was the best month in this region in the last two and a half years in terms of the orders received. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KMIC was able to almost double its income in 2015 compared to 2014 during the peak of the recession. What was the key to this success?</h4><p>The principle of our company is to meet customers' needs, regardless of the internal and external market situations. That is why the world economic crisis was not the starting point in the search for reserves; it was the reason for developing a new strategy, which included creating new insurance products, optimizing the agent network, improving business processes within the company, and formulating a competent investment policy. An integrated approach to the problem allowed our company to not only remain stable in such an unstable economic situation, but also to move to an entirely new level of development.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in terms of including new sectors to the portfolio?</h4><p>Currently, we have gone through the stage of expansive development and our priority is to improve the quality of provided services over the quantity. At the same time, we are not ready to stop there. Expanding the product line, reducing the time for application processes for corporate customers, and developing an attractive diversified portfolio for shareholders are the main directions in the development of the company that will be implemented. Today, we have representative offices in 22 locations in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The main objective of the company is to strengthen its position and become a reliable insurer.</p><h4>How do you plan to move from quantity to quality?</h4><p>In order to achieve this goal, we intend to improve insurance activity in several ways. Moreover, there are modern technologies and new developments in IT and customer service using modern techniques. Thus, our company excelled in the market and the proof of this is being ranked second in the general collection of insurance premiums in the market. We have developed a balanced reinsurance structure that allows our customers to be confident in their choices, because 90% of the portfolio is reinsured in the companies with a rating of A- or higher. Our partners include Lloyd, Hannover Re, Munich Re, Allianz Switzerland, ACE European Group Limited, AIG, and Swiss Re. At the moment, the company is a leader of insuring cargo, property, and air transport, and we intend not only to hold on to, but also to improve the trust of our clients and partners. Our portfolio includes a large number of enterprises that are the real engines of our economy, such as mining and processing industries, power-producing companies, financial institutions, oil sector companies, and international companies that represent their interests not only in our country but around the world. That is why our company will do its best to ensure every customer is satisfied with the quality of our service and the services we provide.</p><h4>Why is it important to be insured in troubled times, and how do insurance companies raise awareness of the need to insure business in such times?</h4><p>Insuring life and property of citizens has been a common practice in developed countries for a number of years. At present, this topic remains open in our country, because the share of insurance in GDP barely passes the 0.47% mark. Understanding the importance of the role of insurance companies in improving the culture of the Kazakhstani society, we regularly conduct campaigns aimed at explaining to potential clients the importance of insurance in the age of financial market instability. The main drive of the current market is compulsory insurance and property insurance. However, in the future our company predicts a transition to total coverage of all segments and trends of the market. In particular, the focus is on increasing the level of education of the insurance business community. The company is not one person; it is a whole society that the head of the company is responsible for. Insurance can protect a company from interruptions in production due to broken equipment, environmental risks, and more. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does NCOC overcome the challenges of a difficult year for global energy markets?</h4><p>Last year was significant for our company. NCOC reopened the first wells at the Kashagan oil field in September, and the first batch of oil for export from Kashagan was dispatched in October. We reported this to President Nazarbayev on the eve of celebrating 25 years of Kazakhstan's independence and he thanked and congratulated NCOC on behalf of the nation. At the same time, the global energy markets face significant challenges that require the industry to improve the efficiency of operations. Therefore, one of our priority areas is the reduction of our current costs.</p><h4>After years of delays and budget overruns, the Kashagan oil field has finally resumed its operations. What is the importance of Kashagan's re-launch for NCOC and its long-term impact on Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>Kashagan will have a production life of decades and its shareholders are expected to contribute billions of dollars in direct revenue to Kazakhstan in terms of taxes and share of production. Development of the project has already contributed a great deal toward the development of the local and national economy of Kazakhstan, and in a sustainable manner. More than USD13.3 billion has been spent on payments to local suppliers since 2004. The consortium has a long-term local content development program in place aimed to further enhance opportunities for local suppliers and improve the skills of local personnel. Around 90% of staff and contractors within the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA) are citizens of Kazakhstan. As Kazakhstan's largest direct foreign investment project, the North Caspian project has had a powerful multiplier effect on the economy, creating employment opportunities for Kazakhstani people and opportunities for local companies. Our most important contribution here is in Kazakhstan content. The North Caspian Project will serve as a reliable and long-term basis for developing state-of-the-art technologies and management methods in the country. A huge impetus will be given to economic diversification and industrial engineering, oil services, and construction industries development. Good conditions will be created for SMEs. Kashagan is not just one of the biggest oil and gas fields in the world, it is also one of the most challenging fields. It was these numerous challenges that pushed the boundaries of engineering and technology, setting new industry standards. All these obstacles were overcome by innovative technology and new approaches, which opened great development opportunities for Kazakhstan. At the same time, and throughout the development of the project, the consortium was committed to ensure the highest safety standards for the workforce, communities, and the environment.</p><h4>What is the potential for new exploration projects and field discoveries in Kazakhstan, and what projects do you expect to be involved in over the next few years?</h4><p>There are huge possibilities, even within the development of the North Caspian Project. We recently received approval from the government of Kazakhstan to start early engineering and design work toward a further expansion of Phase I production at the Kashagan field. This expansion project, called CC01, is an investment to increase production by 80,000bpd by installing additional raw gas compression and injection capacity offshore in the Caspian. The government's approval allows NCOC to undertake early engineering and design work in 2017, and to develop plans for further engineering and design work in 2018. The project, when completed, could grow the capacity of Phase I to a target level of 450,000bpd. NCOC has an opportunity to increase the capital effectiveness of our pre-invested assets, and we intend to do so with a relentless focus on cost reduction, applied at the earliest stages, through a disciplined value engineering process. NCOC is also studying the potential co-development of its Kalamkas Sea field and CMOC's nearby Khazar field. Together, these two fields have recoverable reserves of 67 million tons of oil and 9bcm of gas. We are confident we can find substantial cost savings through the joint development of these fields that will make their development economically viable, and if so, possibly also unlock the development of other fields in the mid-Caspian. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of Mosanada in putting Qatar at the forefront of the cultural and sporting world?</h4><p>Mosanada is responsible for all facilities-management services on the main venues owned and operated by the Ministry of Culture and Sports. Those services include planned and reactive maintenance activities, operation of equipment, minor new works, landscaping and events support, among others. Our projects and venue support includes international football events, the Open Qatar tennis tournament and the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship, which was held at the three new purpose-built multipurpose stadiums. Mosanada has significant experience in managing sports venues in Qatar and this knowledge will be invaluable during the lead up to the 2022 Football World Cup and beyond. Aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030, sport is a major pillar of investment in Qatar and it is our aim to promote it by having world class facilities, managed to international standards, by the region's leading provider in sports facilities management. At Mosanada we are creating something unique and are trying to capitalize on this opportunity.</p><h4>Mosanada has worked with Qatar's Ministry of Culture and Sports on several projects. What are some of these projects, and how has Mosanada contributed?</h4><p>Currently Mosanada manages 16 venues for the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The facilities within the Ministry of Culture &amp; Sports portfolio require a special type of facilities management. Operating several large-scale complex venues dispersed throughout the State of Qatar with multiple events taking place at any one time presents a significant challenge. Quite often events will have substantial footfall and be very much in the spotlight, both nationally and internationally. This requires Mosanada to have a professional site-focused team with the broader business supporting from a corporate perspective with event management and health and safety support, to name but a few.</p><h4>What are some of Mosanada's key projects and facilities that it manages outside of the sporting sphere?</h4><p>We are also responsible for facilities management at Katara Cultural Village. Katara is the cultural hub for Qatar and routinely has events focussed on culture heritage. The site is an iconic location near the West Bay and is popular with families and visitors to Doha. This location has a selection of restaurants and retail units as well as a large amphitheatre, car parking, and a beach. Mosanada also recently secured a four-year contract with Lusail Real Estate and Development Company for managing agent services at Lusail City. This demonstrates the diversity of our offering, from a cultural hub with outdoor leisure facilities to the complexity of the infrastructure at the municipal areas of a brand new city.</p><h4>What opportunities exist in sports facility management in the future?</h4><p>Mosanada is also responsible for the management of Aspire Zone, the biggest and most extensive sports venue in the Middle East. This location is experiencing significant organic growth as new facilities are constructed to deliver the Zone's strategic objectives including refurbishment of the Khalifa Stadium, which will be one of several stadiums that will be used to support the 2022 World Cup. Over the next couple of years we envisage that Sports FM will transition into a new vein of delivery where the FM provider not only operates and maintains the facilities, but they provide venue and event management as well. This will require specialist teams with skills ranging from FM Design Consultancy, Operational FM Delivery through to event organization and hospitality. At Mosanada, we have a longer-term aspiration to expand across the region, but for the time being our priority is to concentrate on the local market, with a primary focus on the sports sector, where we have an overwhelming number of projects coming up.</p><h4>How is Mosanada nurturing local talent to make Qatar an FM hub in the world?</h4><p>All our projects are supported with teams of professional facilities managers and engineers. Having these high-quality specialists within our teams provides opportunity to mentor and coach new staff joining our business. Training programs allow us to develop our staff to be FM experts. In this sense, Mosanada has developed its own behavioral safety training program, and we are the only FM business in the region that is a British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM)-recognized training center. This enables us to train our own employees against a globally accredited professional standard. As soon as the Khalifa International Stadium project is completed, we will coordinate with BIFM and Qatar University to create a program to develop local talent in the FM sector. We also support our clients in non-FM related activities such as the development of an environmental education program for the Aspire Academy and hosting undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>There are two reasons why 2017 will be an interesting year for Mosanada. Our main focus is to support major sports projects in Qatar as the FM strategic client. In addition, although there is continued pressure to reduce costs across all sectors in the region, we are supporting customers to streamline their services whilst maintaining the same high levels of service. Our outlook for the next 12 months includes a continued pursuit of growth in collaboration with our existing customers and searching out new opportunities to extend our service offering. We remain positive about our position in Qatar as the Sports Venue FM of choice. At Mosanada we are committed to quality in delivery and will continue to provide our customers with excellent service as we grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about L-Capital's operations and highlights since its establishment?</h4><p>We started as a financial consultant company eight years ago. We offered our customers optimum profit deriving from funds investment. Currently, L-Capital is an investment company. We look for projects, restructure them, and attract investments. We also implement promising joint projects in the area of logistics, construction, and gold mining with our foreign partners. We purchase minority participation interest in these companies and attract other investors if the investment is not enough. The main recipe for our success is the community of investors that we have worked with over the past eight years. We do not limit ourselves to working with large-scale businesses, and also have something to offer SMEs and even individuals.</p><h4>What is your vision of L-Capital's role in the strategy of diversification and national development in the years to come?</h4><p>We keep a wary eye on the economic and political agenda of our state. Currently, the Western Europe-Western China transnational project is being implemented in our country. In one's pursuit to exploit its advantageous geographical position between Europe and Asia to the maximum, Kazakhstan invests substantial funds in the development of road infrastructure. We, as a private company, invest our funds in the purchase of construction and road-building machinery in order to take an active role in the construction of railway lines and highways. We have plans to continue our activity in this field until 2020 as long as the construction of road infrastructure goes on. After that we will focus on the development sphere of logistics by redirection of investments into the purchase of automotive material and railway cars.</p><h4>L-Capital is also involved in attracting international investments into Kazakhstan. What is your company's strategy for this?</h4><p>There are certain nuances to this. A particular feature of foreign investment raising is the fact that large institutional investors (pensions, investment funds, insurance companies, venture funds) are not directly engaged in the search for investment projects. They involve investment agents for this purpose. These investment agents search for interesting projects, conduct due diligence, assessment, filtration, and suggest projects that meet the requirements of institutional investors the most. We are also seeking ways to search for foreign investors in order to offer them our services as an investment agent. For this purpose, we participate in various special events. One of the recent events that we took part in was the Asian Financial Forum held in January 2017 in Hong Kong with 2,700 representatives of investment funds and banks from Asian and Middle Eastern countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, and so on. I should mention that CIS countries were represented only by Russia and Kazakhstan. The Astana International Financial Center and our company, L-Capital, represented our country. We made presentations of our projects and saw great interest in them. We managed to establish business relationships with almost 150 investment companies. Another objective that we pursued was to carry out an IPO of a Kazakhstani company's shares (our issuer) at Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) and, though we ran up against certain difficulties of an objective nature, we found out that this line is very promising. Hong Kong investors are very interested in mining companies or those that have export and import relations with China. We have an opportunity to contribute to the IPOs of local business on the HKSE. So, if national companies are involved in minerals extraction or have trade relations witch China and are interested in the placement of their securities on the HKSE, they can make use of our services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the reason behind KASE's launch of a new section on commercial bonds, and how will this affect trading volumes?</h4><p>Being sensitive to our clients' needs and the high interest rate environment for our borrowers, KASE decided to launch a new instrument. We have seen plenty of short-term liquidity and if a company issues bonds with a duration of up to one year, we expect the rates of those bonds to be lower than for short-term bank loans, while attracting for longer periods is not attractive. Therefore, we offered the mix of short term and low rate commercial bonds that allow a company to easily manage its liquidity position. It is being issued by a company already listed on the KASE, which has a proven track record, stable earnings, and is capable of servicing short-term bonds. Furthermore we developed simplified procedures to register commercial bonds and listing of short-term bonds approved by the National Bank and KASE. This, coupled with reduced listing fees, put the product in growing demand from domestic companies. For example, we have two issues already listed and placed and one is to come by the end of this year. And we expect 10 more issues in 2018. </p><h4>What are the key aspects of your development strategy?</h4><p>Our recently approved development strategy for 2016-2018 focuses mainly on attracting new issuers, expanding the investor base, deepening the FX market through an increasing number of participants besides local banks, the improvement of risk management and clearing services, and IT upgrades. Our priority is to become a viable alternative to banks' funding for corporates and enhance economic growth through diversification of their funding; therefore, the high-priority clients for the exchange are growing small and mid-sized companies that are already producing goods and have perspectives to grow further. Over the last few years, the major source of funding for companies has been banking loans in dollars, which, given devaluation, led to significant losses. We offer the alternative financing on the stock market, promoting IPO. As per our estimates, more than 350 companies meet the criteria for potential mid-sized company issuer. One of the development aspects we see is a client-oriented approach of our business; therefore, we decided to emphasize the work with market participants and the exchange members. Furthermore, we have been working on KASE rebranding that reflects our new strategy and upgrade of KASE's website that is expected to fully launch in 2017.  </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017 and the next few years?</h4><p>We are still at the stage where interest rates are quite high for business to borrow and therefore lending activity is restricted. There is still uncertainty in terms of how the economy will perform, because we have near-zero growth so far and the forecasted growth for this year is 0.5%. The government is taking measures to support economic growth by expanding state sector expenses through the government program Nurly Zhol, which supports the development of medium-sized business in priority sectors of economy, investment in infrastructure, building affordable housing, and so on. Certain industries benefited such as agriculture, construction, and transportation. Oil prices have been slowing and oil industry output has been contracting. The other effect is that because of devaluation the average household income fell in real value and the population reduced spending. The National Bank is targeting annual inflation in the range of 6-8%. As per 11 months of 2016 inflation is already 7.5%. In 2017, target annual inflation is to remain in the range of 6-8%. Base rate was reduced to 12% from 12.5% with a band of +/-1%. This was affected by a fall in inflation month-to-month in line with the forecast as well as by continuing conversion of bank deposits to tenge and decreasing devaluation expectations among the population. As per estimates, nominal GDP will grow to KZT63.6 trillion from KZT48.4 trillion. GDP per capita will be USD7,500 in 2017 with a potential to rise to USD10,000 in 2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the changes that have occurred in Kazakhstan's economy in recent years?</h4><p>From 2014 to the present, Kazakhstan's economy experienced significant shocks from falling oil prices, reduced exports, and the depreciation of the national currency. The situation was further exacerbated by geopolitical crises and the slowing economies of Kazakhstan's main trading partners, in particular Russia, the EU, and China. In 1Q2016, real annual GDP contracted by 0.1% for the first time after the 2009 crisis. However, the measures taken by the government within the framework of anti-crisis programs to stimulate and diversify the economy partially offset the impact of shocks, maintaining employment and contributing to the development of non-oil sectors. According to preliminary statements from the Ministry of National Economy, in 2016 the economy grew by 1%. Such sectors as construction industry, agriculture, manufacturing, and transport had a significant contribution to the positive dynamics of the GDP. In addition, growth of investment in fixed capital financed by both the government and the private sector remains high. The dynamics of domestic consumption indicate a gradual adaptation of the population and businesses to the new economic conditions. In general, we can talk about a transition to a gradual recovery of the economy; however, this trend is unstable and depends largely on the stability of the external economic environment.</p><h4>How is the situation with the de-dollarization of the economy progressing?</h4><p>In January 2016, our statistics showed the share of FX-denominated deposits of individuals amounted to 80%: no one trusted the tenge and people were converting their savings to dollars. In that situation, monetary policy became ineffective and credit channels and the state securities market did not work. At that point, NBK started providing concrete measures to restore confidence in the tenge. First, we increased the recommended interest rate for tenge deposits from 10% to 14% and reduced the recommended interest rate on FX-denominated deposits from 3 to 2%. After some confidence was restored in the oil market, the tenge started to appreciate. Between January 2016 and January 2017, the tenge appreciated by 16%. People see tenge deposits as a more appropriate instrument to save money. Overall the share of FX-denominated deposits was 70% in January 2016 and at the end of 2016 it was 55%, so tenge deposits grew by KZT3.3 trillion over the last year while FX-denominated deposits decreased by KZT1.1trillion, which is roughly equivalent to USD3.2 billion. We analyzed the experiences of other countries and found that many countries that had a high level of dollarization spent many years to achieve the same results. For example, in Turkey a change in deposits dollarization of 10 percentage points was seen only after five years. My task is to bring this value back to the historical levels of 40% dollar-denominated deposits.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the consolidation talks in the banking sector?</h4><p>GDP volume in dollar terms in 2014 was roughly USD221 billion, which fell to around USD133 billion in 2016; this represents a dramatic decline of more than USD80 billion in just two years. Therefore, room for business activity has reduced significantly, which is why we talk about consolidation, not only in the financial sector but also in construction, mining, and other sectors. The period of easy money has ended; therefore, there is a need to find additional capital injection to the banks to provide liquidity. If a company does not have funds, it needs to consider some options to merge its assets and distribution of the market to achieve some effect of optimizing and reducing cost through optimizing management and others. Consolidation of the banking sector is therefore inevitable. However, I would like to mitigate the risks as some players might start an aggressive policy of attracting deposits of individuals' assets to try to save their institutions on the market. This is why I recommended being more careful in terms of asset allocation and providing more safeguards in such conditions</p><h4>What is your forecast for the domestic economy over the medium term and where do you see the biggest growth and development potential?</h4><p>The NBK estimates growth of the Kazakhstani economy in 2017 to be 1.5-2%, with oil prices set at USD40 per barrel. The positive—but still quite weak—trend in 2017-2018 reveals the slow adaptation of the economy to the new economic reality. The economy will operate below its potential level until 1Q2018, reflecting deflationary pressures from the domestic demand side. External demand is expected to be in the positive zone with respect to its potential by mid-2018, primarily due to the acceleration of economic activity in Europe and Russia, which will have a positive impact on the exports of Kazakhstan. Among sectors with significant potential are agriculture and the agro-industrial complex, in particular the development of animal husbandry, food production, and light and textile industries. In addition, our geographic location creates opportunities to improve transport and logistics infrastructure and develop our transit potential. Projects in these areas will attract foreign investments, particularly those of strategic partners such as China, Russia, India, Iran, and others. Currently, the government is actively involved in the development of potential sectors of the economy through financing the enterprises of the real sector at the expense of budgetary funds, supporting small- and medium-sized businesses.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017 and what will be the main focus of the NBK?</h4><p>The main objective of NBK's monetary policy is to ensure price stability. In 2017 we set the inflation target range at 6-8%. The main tasks are to overhaul the monetary policy instruments, as well as to create the pleasant conditions for lending recovery. Key measures will be taken to strengthen the role of the base rate. Moreover, the question of the clarification of the target rate in the money market will be considered. In order to adequately reflect the cost of money in the economy, the official refinancing rate will be equalized to the base rate. In addition, the reserve requirement mechanism will be improved. NBK plans to continue working on the formation of the risk-free yield curve, which is an indicator of market expectations on interest rates. NBK will continue to issue its own securities—NBK notes—with various maturities. If necessary, it will use its own portfolio of government securities for the purchase and sale of government bonds on the secondary market. Along with short-term notes and the auction for the purchase of securities with reverse sale (credit auction), NBK plans to introduce deposit auctions as part of open market operations. We are also highly focused on communication. We will continue to work on the disclosure of information on monetary policy directions, publishing decisions about the base rate and other instruments, also explaining the rationale behind the decisions. In addition, NBK will continue to publish forecasts of the main macroeconomic variables and analytical and statistical information, as well as the results of conducted research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background on GE's operations in Kazakhstan and how your international expertise is helping localize advanced technologies?</h4><p>GE has been working in Kazakhstan since the middle of the last century—our first sale was in 1930 for the mining industry. Today, we are proud to be active in nearly every industry with our broad technology portfolio. For example, GE engines are powering hundreds of KTZ locomotives and dozens of airplanes operated by Air Astana and other airlines. In addition, thousands of units of GE equipment are supporting the oil and gas and healthcare industries in Kazakhstan. Our overall approach is long-term partnership with the government and the country's leading companies on key projects to modernize industrial infrastructure. Our biggest localization success so far has been our partnership with KTZ. In 2009, the first GE-powered locomotive made in Kazakhstan rolled off the assembly line and onto the rails. To date, we have helped produce and modernize over 700 locomotives. Today, about 90% of freight locomotives in Kazakhstan are powered by GE engines, with much higher efficiency and lower emissions than the legacy fleet, and as a result, Kazakhstan has the youngest and the most fuel-efficient locomotive fleet in the CIS region. We continue to supply the engine kit, but everything else is locally produced. This project was destined to success thanks to the perfect alignment between GE's long-term commitment and the country's strategic priority to develop the non-resource sectors of the economy, as well as its vast geography and rail network, which is quite similar to other large countries like the US, China, or Russia. In fact, Kazakhstan is GE's second-largest rail market globally and our largest hub of locomotive production outside of the US.</p><h4>What other partnerships and programs do you have beyond the rail industry?</h4><p>In addition to working with KTZ, we are also localizing oil and gas equipment servicing by teaming up with our local partner ZKMK. That project includes a long-term technology transfer and license agreement, which will enable ZKMK to locally maintain the fleet of GE Oil &amp; Gas turbines and compressors installed across Kazakhstan and Central Asia. That is an important capability because it gives our customers confidence in knowing that potential issues can be resolved quickly with local resources. It also demonstrates GE's commitment to developing human talent by localizing technical expertise. We have had great success with this same approach in healthcare. In 2007, we localized expertise in maintaining medical equipment by establishing a service center in Almaty. That has supported the growth of our installed base to over 2,000 ultrasounds, MRIs, PET/CTs, and other high-tech equipment at hospitals and clinics across the country. In addition, we are also offering our Crotonville leadership training as part of our strategic cooperation with Nazarbayev University. GE is recognized as one of the world's top companies for professional development, and we are committed to helping train the next generation of leaders in Kazakhstan</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The current environment remains complicated and industrial growth around the world continues to be constrained by limited investment. At the same time, we are beginning to see positive signs on the horizon. The last three or four years have shown us that resource-rich countries can no longer rely on high commodity prices—they need to learn to adapt and live in a new environment. The president and government of Kazakhstan have taken steps to lay a solid foundation for future growth. I live and work in Astana and every day I see the great potential here. I am an optimist about the long term, and I am looking forward to what the new year will bring. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stimulating-thought]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you welcome the government's initiatives to stimulate economic growth?</h4><p>The oil industry remains the foundation of Kazakhstan's economic prosperity, but the government understands that it must balance the country's dependence on oil with other sources of economic growth. AmCham has devoted many council sessions to exploring strategies that will foster economic growth and investment. Taxation reform has been a particular focus for AmCham this past year, and we have been fortunate in being able to bring Canadian tax specialists and senior OECD speakers to the council to contribute to these discussions. AmCham pushed hard to persuade the government to retain VAT rather than replacing VAT with a sales tax, which would have been seriously detrimental to the country's investment climate. We were pleased that the government listened and decided to retain the VAT, although its implementation continues to need improvement. However, we sometimes feel that the government is doing too much through too many programs that come and go with the aim of stimulating economic growth. Strong economies develop when the entrepreneurial spirit is allowed to flourish and when the government is not deciding through actions that are reminiscent of outdated Five-Year Plans on how sectors should develop. The government must extricate its thinking from past economic models that set guidelines and goals for the country's economy. The population is well educated, energetic, imaginative, and has its own economic goals. Economic freedom is the best stimulus for economic growth.</p><h4>How challenging is it for the government to develop the SME sector? </h4><p>Although AmCham is not really an association of SME companies, we are mindful of Kazakhstan's need to encourage and support SME development. After all, the largest global companies all began as SMEs, and the entrepreneurial spirit in which Kazakhstan is so rich is the beginning of all economic success. But SMEs have a hard time developing beyond the early stages in Kazakhstan. Taxation, regulation, and corruption are obstacles that the larger companies can handle or combat, but smaller companies quickly succumb under pressure. The Customs Union has also not been good for SMEs, which cannot easily complete with the cheaper and more plentiful products that flow into the country from Russia and Belarus. AmCham held a council session on SME development last spring and has brought problems requiring solution from individual SME companies to the council, but the government has not shown adequate interest in supporting SMEs, despite lip service to the country's need for entrepreneurship. SME successes are few and far between.</p><h4>What trends or interest have you seen in the agricultural sector over the last year?</h4><p>Agriculture is high on the government's list of priority sectors for Kazakhstan's economic diversification and it is definitely an area in which the country could excel. However, although there is serious interest in developing agriculture and a large portion of the country's population is still living in rural areas and engaged in farming, agricultural policy awaits the fundamental reform essential to supporting agriculture and agribusiness. First and foremost, land reform is an absolute necessity, but popular resistance to opening up land ownership and land leasing has so far blocked the government's attempts at land reform. Social and educational reform to improve rural life and provide opportunities to young people is also necessary to encourage the population to regard farming as attractive and economically beneficial to their future. Although there are some large and well-known agricultural conglomerates operating in Kazakhstan, these are exceptions. Small farmers need support so that they too can make a good living and build a sustainable agricultural and agribusiness sector. The truth, as can be seen in the country's supermarkets or corner shops, is that Kazakhstan's food supply is overwhelmingly dependent on imports. Yet the country could be self-sustaining in agriculture and enjoy a high level of food security. This was the subject of a major AmCham conference two years ago, and is a constant topic in the diversification debate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Diversifying The Base]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[diversifying-the-base]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are your expansion plans progressing, and what have been the main highlights in the past year?</h4><p>The world economy stumbled in 2016 amid weak demand, falling commodity prices, and increasing financial market volatility in major economies. Donald Trump's election influenced the whole economy and perspective of the world for investors as well. Investors are switching their strategy toward protectionism, choosing to depress aggressive investment and to induce herding behavior among firms. The same situation is true in Kazakhstan; investors and companies are moving from being global oriented to more Kazakhstani focused, especially taking into account the devaluation last year. For instance, Europharma changed its strategy correspondingly in terms of its previous expansion plans to China. Nevertheless, we still plan on boosting our growth abroad, however with a little retardation. Europharma's revenue increased roughly by 30% last year, and the whole investment activity remained strong. We recently divested our assets in Alma TV, which was a prosperous deal for us. We see tremendous opportunity for Alma TV to grow and expand, especially taking into account its experienced management and decent business strategy. Ordabasy Group just received an admirable offer and we exited the business.</p><h4>What is the potential for mining to be a bigger driver of Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>In the last three years Ordabasy Group has invested USD300 million in gold mining, and as a result for today we have a gold processing plant producing and selling gold bars. We also perceive opportunities for the development of cooper deposits; for instance, we invested funds to expand exploration works to increase the resource base. One of the biggest advantages of this sector in Kazakhstan is that the revenue is linked to the US dollar, thus the conceivable currency risk is minimized. Since mining products are considered to be commodity, the demand is constant and linked to many markets; thus, all we have to do is to control costs and to ensure efficient management.</p><h4>How does Ordabasy Group intend to participate in the government's privatization program?</h4><p>The privatization program is an ambitious move, and one that speaks highly of the intent of the country's leadership to improve and integrate into the global economy and we would like to take an active role in it. A considerable share of our investment portfolio constitutes Kazakhstan Utility System, which generated, in 2016, an increase in revenue and EBITDA to the amount of 35-40% in comparison with the previous year. Management of KUS is ready to expand, thus the company currently is in the process of closing the deal on the acquisition of Ust-Kamenogorsk CHP from American company AES. Moreover, KUS was recently engaged in three tenders in a framework of government's privatization program, one of which resulted in a positive outcome. Overall, Ordabasy's team carefully analyzes companies within the privatization program, although the competition among investors is strong especially among local investors. For example, during the bidding process one local investor increased its initial price by 25%. Foreign investors are less active in the privatization program due to currency exchange rate risk.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>The last three years have been hard for the economy; however, from my point of view, it has reached the bottom and now we expect growth and stabilization. The economic situation is stabilizing, the exchange rate is strengthening, and interest rates are falling. Obviously we are affected by the Russian economy and political situation, so should Russian-US relations improve, this will have a positive effect on Kazakhstan as well. As for Ordabasy Group, we are focusing on the energy, mining, and agriculture sectors. For agriculture we have an extensive project in Zharkent City, the largest integrated fruit production facility in Central Asia, which will produce apples, peaches, cherries, and plums. The first harvest is expected to be in 2017; the production will be exported later. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[without-waste]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Talan Towers, developed by Verny Capital, was the first green construction project in Kazakhstan. As a pioneer of sustainability, how do you contribute to establishing a new culture of environmental friendliness?</h4><p>We do not follow trends or implement green technology just for the sake of it. We will only implement a feasible solution that makes sense, which is why we have a strict selection of what we will use. For example, we use waste water-to-water plants, trees, and bushes or façade glass that prevents heat loss in winter and deflects heat in summer. We widely use light bulbs that save energy. Even our new elevator systems in our buildings reduce energy consumption due to the optimal organization of people flow in the building. We seek to promote all these with our business partners and counterparts as much as possible for our real estate developments and what we will implement. </p><h4>Could you tell us about the importance of establishing large global conglomerate partnerships in the sectors you invest in? </h4><p>Typically, private equity firms do not have partners, but Verny Capital is not typical. It is important to have professional strategic partners in the industries we are involved in, like telecoms, gold mining, education, and hotel management. It makes us bring professional expertise and experience into the country without wasting time or making mistakes, and increasing the efficiency of our activity.</p><h4>How do you seek potential partnerships and where?</h4><p>There are some objective criteria and subjective criteria. Talking about subjective criteria, there should be some sort of chemistry between the partners and they should understand one other and have the same vision and core values. Objectively, a partner should be professional and have experience and a great track record of success. Our target is first to establish partnerships within Kazakhstan; however, at the same time we are open to international cooperation. We have realized it is not easy to manage businesses from afar so it is always a matter of management and control of the business, which is why global companies always have local partners in different countries.</p><h4>How can Verny Capital's expertise and knowledge of the local market be useful to large companies that want to do business in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have great experience being a local partner for global players. In developed countries the business environment is strict, competition is high, and yields are low so there are fewer opportunities to start businesses. New opportunities are in emerging markets such as Kazakhstan and CIS countries. That is quite obvious, which is why we mostly look at Kazakhstan for investment opportunities and we would be happy to enter new partnerships with respectable, professional, experienced, and successful global players. We know how to do business here and that is our competitive advantage.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for the next few years?</h4><p>Firstly, we will develop and expand our existing businesses such as gold mining through RG Gold, through which we just finished the first phase of exploration. In the last three years, we have increased exploration activity and found new reserves. As for the telecoms business, we understand that we need to expand our product line because of global trends in the telecoms industry. We also need to turn around the banking business because of the need for new technologies. The banking business is becoming more technological and we have to be ahead and play this game well or else we will lose. We will complete Talan Towers, which is a substantial development, and will follow with new opportunities, such as a wheat processing plant and many others. Gold mining is part of our diversification strategy but there are also great opportunities in agriculture. This opportunity should be assessed properly as Kazakhstan has a large territory with a small population and we have neighbors such as Russia, China, and India, which consume a large amount of food for which Kazakhstan has a great opportunity to supply. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Warmer Climate]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-warmer-climate]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major initiatives and programs launched by the IFK to improve the business climate in the country?</h4><p>Three years ago, our shareholder, Baiterek Holding, made a major decision for the IFK to acquire all the distressed assets that had been amassed at the Development Bank of Kazakhstan. We acquired about 36 depressed companies with a total debt of around USD800 million. We are now considering ways to make these companies attractive for investment. We have also developed our own strategy and have approached leading investment groups operating both locally and globally. The IFK partners with leading Kazakhstani investment companies and is in touch with nearly all the market players. Our final goal is to sell our portfolio when the problematic companies in it start showing some positive dynamics, generating some profit, and providing jobs. To date, we have created around 1,800 jobs. We understand that no one is willing to acquire a depressed portfolio. Therefore, we develop attractive investment tools that can satisfy our needs as sellers and the needs of investors buyers. That has been our main contribution to the development of an attractive investment climate in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>The IFK has strong ties with international investors. What areas and countries do you establish partnerships with? </h4><p>Alongside our work on depressed portfolio, we also work on new projects. One of them is a float glass factory in Kyzylorda that we are building in partnership with Stewart Engineers, an American company that offers floating glass technology services, and a local private investor. This was our first experience working with a foreign investor and we plan to expand it. However, in line with priorities set by the government, we seek investors from neighboring countries, mainly CIS. Russia is a major partner; however, it depends on the industry. The portfolio of IFK comprises companies across various sectors. For example, we have projects in the construction industry and most of our partners there are local; we also have textile projects in the south with Uzbek partners, with whom we will establish a consortium in 2018. We also run large projects in agriculture in the north, together with Russia. Our possible partners include China; we are now in the initial stage of negotiations.</p><h4>Within the government's diversification program, which sector will the fund focus on the most? Where do you see the most action in terms of investment?</h4><p>It is impressive that Kazakhstan has managed to create an investment climate that is attractive in any industry. This is because we have close relationships with China and Russia, which are now large markets. Many Russian and Chinese investors have moved their production lines to Kazakhstan and sell the products back home. Kazakhstan can offer attractive production costs across all the industries; however, agriculture is particularly attractive because of our vast territory, great soil quality, and close proximity to large international markets such as China and Russia. A total of 1 billion people willing to buy products made in Kazakhstan beat the odds of being a landlocked country.</p><h4>What challenges will Kazakhstan's business climate face in the coming years?</h4><p>One of the challenges will be the country's monetary policy. Its proximity to large markets comes with the understanding that these economies have their own currencies and will continue to have a great impact on Kazakhstan's economy, even greater than global trends. Our country is building an export-oriented economy. If the Chinese or Russian economy is struggling, that will have a nearly immediate impact on Kazakhstan because these are our major export markets. It will be difficult to immediately redirect our exports; transportation costs will increase and we may not be able to offer competitive prices in Europe, for example.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We need to stay positive; 2017 will be a good year for us. In order to do business in a country, a company needs to visit it. In this instance, Expo 2017 will be of great help there. We look forward to completing projects we started in 2013 and starting new ones. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[broaden-the-base]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the chamber's main areas of focus and initiatives since its establishment?</h4><p>By law we represent 100% of businesses in Kazakhstan in their dialog with the government at the local, municipal, and national levels. One of our responsibilities is to represent our business in the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union. Overall, our key responsibility is to protect our businessmen, and we do this on a case-by-case basis. We had 14,000 cases of businesses reaching out to us with problems. 40% of those cases were resolved in a positive way for the business. For example, some faced issues such as bureaucracy, taxation, customs, or various checks from the government. We want businesses to have clear set rules. We work to improve laws as at present there are numerous administrative barriers including licenses, certificates, and permits that companies have to obtain from the government. In the last three years, we have reduced the number of permits, certificates, and licenses required from 1,100 to only 300. The next step is to automate the process so that when a business has to acquire a certificate or a license, it does not have to be in contact with any other government officials, but can instead get it done electronically.</p><h4>One of the government's strategies is to have the SME segment contribute at least 50% of GDP by 2050. What is Atameken doing to this end?</h4><p>There are three things that businesses need in order to develop well: clear and well-defined regulations, access to capital, and access to human resources. Our work on making the regulations clear is obvious. As for access to capital, we have a finance association that all banks and insurance companies are members of. Interest rates, loans, and regulations are of course all determined by the central bank. We also work with the government via its support programs for businesses. For access to human resources, we collect information from employers regarding the professionals they need and discuss the issue with ministries and colleges. We also work with associations to set professional standards. We are developing an “Uberization" application that matches job seekers and employers. If a student lacks the specific educational requirements, Atameken will intervene to provide the necessary education. Besides these three aspects, there is more we have to do to achieve a 50% SMEs share in GDP, which at the moment is 25-26%.</p><h4>What potential do you see in agriculture being one of the drivers of Kazakhstan's economy in the future, and which other sectors are promising for growth?</h4><p>I see great potential in the agricultural sector, particularly in the organic segment. We have large and natural pastures that do not require any artificial feeding, so we can produce beef and lamb there. Certain Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have started purchasing lamb from Kazakhstan. We are the biggest producer of wheat in the world, and several years ago we were the number-one global exporter of flour. After agriculture, I see a great deal of potential in logistics; we can become a logistics hub between China, Europe, and Russia with railways and automobiles. We have a strategy for this, and it works; every year, the number of containers that go through Kazakhstan increases. The third sector is tourism. This sector has not been developed yet, but we have everything—mountains, sea, steppes—all of which are beautiful. We should develop infrastructure and service, which can be done easily and rapidly. Ecotourism is another potentially promising area. Besides oil and minerals, these are the three sectors that are the most productive. We are a young nation; we have 5 million people between the ages of 15 and 30. Young specialists, who developed the Uberization application, are now working on another application for the ecosystem on the base of the Expo 2017 in Astana. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the decision to establish the British Chamber last year?</h4><p>British companies have long been established in Kazakhstan, and have a strong history of investment and trading links with the country. For many years British businesses were connected in Kazakhstan through informal networks, such as the British Business Group, which was established by British expatriates who organized meetings and networking events on a range of topics, and through associations that have a broad membership base such as the American Chamber of Commerce. The British Chamber of Commerce was established to provide a structured organization to serve British businesses in Kazakhstan, in order to not only facilitate networking but also provide business-to-business services to its members and stakeholders. Although the chamber is an independent entity, it works in close partnership with the Department of International Trade (DIT), a British government department that assists British companies in international markets and supports overseas investors seeking to invest in the UK. The drive to set up the chamber came from both the British Embassy in Kazakhstan and the British business community itself, in particular through the hard work of the founding members, who contributed significant time and funding to get the chamber off the ground.</p><h4>Are you also involved in initiatives to attract and promote business investment in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>DIT assists UK businesses that are interested in investment opportunities overseas. For Kazakhstan, such enquiries from interested UK investors will generally be directly referred to the British Chamber, and so we form an integral part of the process for assisting UK companies to understand investment opportunities in the country, and thereby promoting Kazakhstan as an investment destination. In addition to this, our members and committee members have participated and spoken at a variety of international events over the last year, including several in London, where they are able to spread the word about the experiences of UK businesses investing in Kazakhstan. Our job is not to market Kazakhstan per se but to make sure there is appropriate sharing of information so that investors can make informed decisions.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the most investment opportunities here, especially for British companies?</h4><p>Oil and gas, mining, and the many services that support these industries are a significant area of international trade and investment, and this should continue to provide opportunities. Other sectors where technological innovation plays a disruptive role, including for example green energy and mobile banking, are areas that are likely to hold potential in the future. The government's commitment to the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) and its plans to apply English law sends a positive message to potential investors and is a great opportunity for UK businesses, lawyers, and advisors to add significant value to improve the level of transparency in the legal framework.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges in today's business climate in Kazakhstan that might discourage British investors? </h4><p>British investors—in fact all international investors—are attracted to destinations where they can expect not only strong returns on investment, but where there is stability and where they are able to predict with some certainty how laws and regulations will be applied to them. Kazakhstan has made, and continues to make, important steps in promoting an environment of consistency, but this is a key area where the perception of investors could be improved. The government is taking steps to achieve this, and its remarkably open dialog with international business associations such as the chamber helps. The relatively recent fall in the price of oil has of course created other economic challenges but for any country to succeed as investment destination, continuing to support the transparent and consistent development of the rule of law is fundamental in my view. </p><h4>What are your expectations from 2017?</h4><p>The recommencement of operations at Kashagan, increased stability in the oil price, and the positive effect of Expo on the economy make me cautiously optimistic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were appointed Mayor of the South Kazakhstan region in October 2016. Since then, what areas have been your special priorities?</h4><p>Modern Kazakhstan is experiencing truly tectonic changes. They cover practically all spheres of life. The “Plan of the Nation“ gave a special boost to the modern transformation and upgrading of our country. It is known as the Five Institutional Reforms for the Social and Economic and Political Upgrading of Kazakh Society. The initiator of these reforms was our President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The cardinal changes that are taking place presuppose Kazakhstan's entry into the list of 30 developed countries of the world. To achieve this noble goal, serious foundations have been established in our country. The major ones are civil peace, stability, and aspiration to increase social and economic stability. Kazakhstan, in the years of its post-Soviet and independent development, has gained recognition and trust from the world, including the business community. To govern such a large place as the South Kazakhstan region is a task of increased responsibility. More than 3 million people live here. The main priority is to ensure the significant role of the South-Kazakhstan Region in the country's economy. Its implementation includes a series of tasks aimed at improving the social climate and creating conditions for the development of SMEs. In this context, Kazakhstani society as a whole has been moving steadily for the last 25 years. Now the task of transforming Shymkent into the country's third metropolis has begun. Work has begun on improving the architectural appearance of the city, developing infrastructure, and landscaping. The main driver of the country's economy is the agrarian sector. Our region has historically been in the midst of favorable conditions for the development of agriculture.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in the South Kazakhstan region?</h4><p>Our region from an investment standpoint is attractive due to its great agrarian and industrial capacity. These two factors, in my opinion, are determining and the most favorable. A radical turn from the global attachment of mankind to hydrocarbon resources should start with a reference to the earth as the primary source of human wellbeing. At the same time, the conditions of the fifth techno-economic paradigm, in which the bulk of our countries are now, have urged us to turn to industrial changes. In our region, 11 industrial zones have been launched and are being constructed. Already today, 151 investment projects are being implemented. As part of the Business Roadmap 2020, industrial zones are provided with internal and external infrastructure. And this is done at the expense of the state. A special economic zone, Ontustik, has been established in the territory of the region. It provides competitive advantages for those who come there in the form of benefits and preferences and a special tax and customs regime. Participants are exempt from certain types of taxes. For example, corporate tax is 0%. Also, benefits are provided for property and land taxes. The VAT on goods will be eased in the territory of this zone.</p><h4>What measures and policies are applied by the local administration to attract local and foreign investors and strengthen social and economic development?</h4><p>First of all, relationships with diplomatic missions of foreign countries have been established. In 2016, we conducted five road shows in foreign countries. The forums Ontustik Invest 2016, Ontustik Tourism 2016, Kazakhstan-Israel Business Forum, and the Forum of Iranian Commodity Producers were held, and during this time 27 official delegations visited us. In early February, the Kazakh-Turkish Investment Forum was held, within the framework of which five memorandums on joint bilateral cooperation were signed. This year we will hold the international investment forum Ontustik Invest 2017. Examples of successful attraction of foreign capital include projects implemented jointly with transnational companies like pharmaceutical giant Polpharma of the joint-stock company ChimFarm. The South Korean conglomerate LOTTE Group invested KZT3.1 billion to complete the first stage of an upgrade on the confectionery factory Rakhat-Shymkent. Heidelberg Cement Group is finalizing an upgrade of the Shymkent Cement Plant to the amount of KZT20 billion. Russia's PharmaSynthesis Company started the construction of a cardiac drugs production plant in the Free Economic Zone in Shymkent. We also plan to implement projects including a textile factory, Azala Fabric, and the construction of a polypropylene production plant.</p><h4>The South Kazakhstan region is the location of an exceptionally cultural and historic city, Turkistan, which attracts thousands of pilgrims. What is being done to further advance the city as a tourist destination?</h4><p>Kazakhstan has initiated a program to revive the historical centers of the Silk Road, preserve the cultural heritage of Turkic-speaking countries, and establish a tourism infrastructure program. Also, the national company Silk Road-Kazakhstan has been established and, within a short period of time, it has managed to restore a significant amount of unique architectural complexes. Thanks to this, the traditions of Turkic-speaking peoples will be preserved for centuries. Turkistan is a place of worship for Turkic-speaking peoples. Turkistan is the heart of the Silk Road and the capital of the Turkic world. The abundance of historical and cultural monuments and artifacts along the ancient caravan track ensures great interest and attractiveness of the tourist product. The work of the Tourism Council under the government of Kazakhstan has been intensified. In particular, the Tourism Information Center was established, and that is a place where tourists have the opportunity to request any information about Turkistan. Today, the brand of Ontustik has been established, which is one of the marketing tools for increasing the competitiveness of the tourist region. We took into account the needs of tourists and developed entrepreneurship and cooperation, marketing strategies, competitive prices, and a competent and diverse product portfolio for Turkistan. According to the forecasts of culturologists, it is expected that there will be a significant influx of pilgrims and tourists to Turkistan. In 2016, the influx of tourists was about 1 million, and by 2021 it is expected to increase up to 6 million people. Therefore, the upgrade of the urban planning system is planned in order to establish a historical and cultural base and engineer tourist infrastructure to ensure high-quality service and create a stronger image as a tourist attraction.</p><h4>What are your expectations and forecasts for 2017?</h4><p>Specialists visiting Germany, the UK, Georgia, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and other countries will enable us to adopt best practices in the development of our engineering process, as well as enable the exchange of experiences with the establishment of smart cities. Already, we are receiving recommendations on how to improve the quality of management and proposals for developing and implementing innovative ideas, maximizing the effectiveness of public and private structures. Construction is already underway. Industrial zones are attractions for investors and one of the important areas that needs to be developed in the South Kazakhstan region. Now all requisite conditions are being created for foreign and local investors who are willing to cooperate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the major current opportunities and challenges in the Saudi housing market?</h4><p>The Saudi housing market is undergoing an unprecedented transformation to meet the growing demand for affordable housing. Today, the ministry of housing portal has 1.1 million families registered for government support in purchasing a home, and 500 thousand registered on the Real Estate Development Fund “REDF" portal, with more than 70% of beneficiaries earn between USD1,500 and USD4,000 a month. Recognizing the socio-economic drawbacks of this, the Government has committed to increase this percentage of homeownership from its current of 48% to 52% by 2020, equivalent to 800,000 new housing units to the market. This transformation is met with many considerable challenges, including the low productivity of construction sector, increases in building material costs, and the fact that the majority of homes supplied were single homebuilders. Only 200,000 homes out of 6 million homes were financed by the financial sector. These one-off challenges are additions to fundamental inefficiencies that have existed in the market historically, including low levels of private sector contribution to supply and a high reliance on government funding. The case for transformation is further amplified by the demographics of the country with more than 60% below the age of 35 years (more than 5 million people). This demographic challenge only makes the current market status more challenging. That said, the recent fiscal decisions have created hidden opportunities for the housing market. For instance, increased cost of living from the subsidy reforms will mean purchasing decisions for houses will be more prudent in size. Saudi Arabia has a culture that favors living in villas, due to family size and general habits. This created a challenge for the ministry as it was expected to supply only villa-sized housing at affordable or even no cost. However, now that financial decisions for families have changed, a larger variety of housing units can be supplied and be socially acceptable. Further, the increase in labor importation cost will all lead to different decision-making by developers and beneficiaries in the housing market. Developers will no longer find traditional labor-intensive building technique feasible and more competitive with the cleaner, higher quality building manufacturing models such as pre-cast forms and 3D printing.</p><h4>What role do these reforms play in the wider Vision 2030?</h4><p>The housing transformation is part of a larger national transformation within the Kingdom, toward a unified vision and 2030 targets. This national direction has resulted in large synchronized government efforts to try to solve national challenges, of which housing takes a lead. This multi-sector effort at tackling challenges and leveraging opportunities is considered a key condition to preparing the housing market to meet the backlog and upcoming demand. The first critical step undertaken was the restructuring of the Ministry of Housing. The ministry has only been around for eight years, however it has historically been the government's development arm. Today, the ministry has transformed to be the enabler and catalyst of housing, under the two main pillars of demand and supply. This shift in role was necessary to enable the private sector to take a larger role in supply of housing and finance. This is believed to be a more sustainable model of operation. Previously, the private sector shied away from operating in the middle and lower class housing market for many reasons; financial institutions are risk averse and they would rather finance the middle/upper class customer. The mortgage law was only recently implemented, with no off plan sales, while obtaining a license turned out to be a complicated process. The ministry today preservers in working along-side the private sector in order to facilitate a business friendly environment and create investment opportunities in order to shift gears in the sector. The new strategic direction will inevitably result in higher supply of better quality housing at more affordable rates.</p><h4>How is the ministry pushing to engage citizens and the private sector in these emerging opportunities?</h4><p>To enact a true partnership with the private sector, the ministry took a holistic view of the housing ecosystem and its drivers when activating transformational solutions. The PPP model is unproven in Saudi, with only a few success stories to tell. It was therefore imperative that the private sector was engaged and enabled across all components of the housing ecosystem. </p><h4>What have been some of the key milestones reached in the ministry's eight years in operation?<br></h4><p>Firstly, the ministry created a sustainable lending subsidized program through partnering with the financial institutions. This was done by relocating the lending activity from the Real Estate Development Fund “REDF" to the more efficient financial institutions. Furthermore, it subsidized the interest rates charged by the banks on its beneficiaries, and the REDF to use its USD50 billion assets to invest back into the real estate development sector, which is a major cash injection into the supply side of the sector. In addition, the ministry has worked closely with the Public Investment Fund “PIF" to establish the first mortgage refinance company in the country and increase the synergies between the company and the REDF to increase liquidity in the market and help create more than USD 20 billion liquidity in the financial system just for 2017, and the refinance company is aiming to increase the private sector share of the mortgage market from its current USD29 billion to reach USD128 billion by 2020. Such progress had the effect of encouraging the financial institutions to participate in the mortgage industry, and encouraged the securitization of the refinance company portfolio will be guaranteed by the ministry of financing creating more international appetite from foreign institutions, such as more than five institutions have committed to underwrite the whole offering before it began. Secondly, the Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency joined the Ministry of Housing to bring major economic incentives to the sector by lowering the home down payment requirement from 30% to 15% and ministry of finance has approved a program to lower downpayments for first time home buyers to 10% while providing a guarantee on the first trench of loss in the case of a default. In addition, the ministry was able to work with Ministry of Justice to resolve issues with foreclosure enforceability, the rent market, and the passing or introducing of more than 18 regulatory changes in 2016-2017. In addition, it established the laws and regulations for home ownership association, redrafted the “Subsidized Homeownership Regulations" to reflect today's market and anticipated changes in the future. The ministry also established its own regulated closed joint stock company to create a vehicle to partner with developers and other stakeholders and move faster and leaner in creating JVs, SPVs, funds, and other investments. In addition, the ministry went to gather accurate data on the market, on beneficiaries, and on the overall economic activity from the sector, and today establishing the National Housing Data Centre, where the ministry will be able to share accurate data with developers on the demand and help developers produce housing units that have a relevant and secured buyer. Finally, the ministry needed to create various incentives and schemes for the private sector to support the development of affordable housing in the range of USD150,000 to USD220,000 price per unit. To achieve that, it had to work on constant workshops and meeting with all stakeholders, and today, the ministry has launched the first two waves of its RFPs on its own infrastructure developed land, and has provided financial incentives to promote participation from the private sector, such as an advanced payment of up to 20% of the project cost to developers free of charge, underwriting to secure lower lending cost from financial institutions, offtake agreements for specific percentages of the project, higher financial support for developers using energy efficient installations, and faster home construction technology.</p><h4>What are your short-terms goals and expectations for the years ahead?</h4><p>Whilst undergoing this change, the ministry has faced public agitation as the backlog of ready housing and low cost loan expectations remained as they were. In an effort to showcase the same commitment to housing supply, but under a new optimized model of working with the private sector, the ministry publicly and privately committed to an ambitious plan of assigning 280,00 housing product in 2017 to its beneficiaries. This 280,000 products comprise 120,000 housing units, 75,000 lands and 85,000 financing products. All the while, the ministry has been contracting with the private sector to supply and deliver these products to the beneficiaries within a reasonable timeline of less than three years. An investment of USD20 billion needs to be injected to the sector, and that is exactly what is happening today. The ministry has received bids from international developers, have met with contractors, suppliers, facility management companies, and have seen the market activity picking up by 15% with construction even starting. In addition, banking activities have picked up and consumer booking have increased two fold from the lowest point reached which was in December 2016. The sentiment is rising as investors make the first move. A USD20 billion is required every year in the sector, and with input/output multiplier of 2.8 in the housing market will translate to USD56 Billion in more than 120 economic activity that the housing sector affects today, and despite any leakage, and the requirement to manufacture homes rather than building, such investment will translate to more jobs to Saudis who are more comfortable working in a factory setting than traditional building, and the likelihood of the cost to create one job in the sector should drop from its current USD500,000 cost is very high, and with the existing cost of job creation, we should see the economy adding at least 100,000 jobs in the next three years from the investment made in 2017 only. And if all the government agencies continue to work in the synergy they are working under today, than that number should more than triple by NTP 2020 target.</p><h4>How is this important to the private sector?</h4><p>I will take an existing example of a developer who is benefiting from the first mover advantage, and show some of the details of the partnership worth the ministry and how is this translating into return on equity. The Ministry of Housing has more than 2.5 million sqm of land, and this is in a major city. Private sector developers have performed initial concept designs and reached a utilization of around 10,000 residential units from apartments, town homes, and villas, as well as commercial space and recreational facilities, schools, and medical centers. The developer has committed USD25 million of equity, with the ministry contributing the land at a cost USD150 million. The expected net income for the shareholders is USD160 million in the worst case scenario and USD500 million in the best case, with the developer making four times their money in three years time in the worst case scenario and 10 times more in the best case. This translates into an IRR of 58% and 157% respectively. The ministry screens beneficiaries, then it markets the project for them and chooses the unit, with loans being interest free since REDF is paying for the beneficiary interest rate cost. The escrow account for the project and off plan financing is under the ministry supervision. Point is, this is a deal that cannot be achieved any where else in the world at this scale, risk is minimized and returns maximized, with every stakeholder a winner, the beneficiary gets an affordable home with high quality, developer makes a very healthy returns, and the ministry achieves its objective, while the ministry does make a healthy return from this project, but it uses the returns to subsidize beneficiaries by reducing the unit price either in this project or another project. This is merely the start of a long journey. A journey toward an better state where every citizen has a feasible option to buy their dream home at their disposal and where the market is supplied and financed by the competitive private sector. The clarity of the end goal, combined with the working mechanisms currently being built provide a compass and a vehicle for the ministry to reach that end state.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the energy sector in Abu Dhabi and what place does BP have within that?</h4><p>The changes in ADNOC's administration and the new vision of the Abu Dhabi government have made it clear that the country wants to rise to a different level. They have embarked upon a journey which will become the new benchmark for NOCs, where capability, technology, efficiency, and selectivity will become vital when it comes to building partnerships. The new mindset in ADNOC is to re-energize the entire industry and everyone is enthusiastic about keeping up in this fast-paced environment. For BP, this has made it easier to see how we can support ADNOC with our world-class technology and expertise, as well as contributing to Abu Dhabi's vision of a sustainable and highly profitable oil industry. We have been in the country from day one and have never wavered in our commitment. We are delighted with the ADCO deal that we recently signed—a 40-year concession with ADNOC that brings our partnership to a whole new level—and through which we are building a new framework for partnerships between IOCs and NOCs that will transform the industry in the region. This is a rather special deal because in the process Abu Dhabi became a ~2% shareholder in BP. It is an example of a strategic, value-added partnership. Broadly speaking, the whole industry is changing from a supply-driven industry to a demand-driven one.</p><h4>Under which programs is BP establishing knowledge and technology transfers with ADNOC, and how are both companies learning from each other's expertise?</h4><p>Our partnership with ADNOC includes elements of knowledge sharing and technology transfer but actually goes well beyond this. The challenges of recent years have enabled us to adapt to a more efficient way of working. We have led the way in restructuring our business, becoming more efficient and more performance-driven, and using the latest in modern technologies to develop our oil and gas assets. We have learned how to make our company resilient and have also been focusing on value over volume and on efficiency and modernization. We have also concentrated on developing new technologies. BP is a global leader in Enhanced Oil Recovery and low salinity water. We have also adopted new ways of leveraging data, IT and the digital world as a whole to create accessible new technologies. It is this collective expertise and capacity that we are bringing to add value to the NOCs, including ADNOC.</p><h4>BP is a strong performer in the adoption of Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies. How key are these practices in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>This technology is all about getting as much oil out of the ground as possible and pushing barrel efficiency to the limit. We do this by utilizing water flooding technology, low salinity, and bright water to 'flush' out hard-to-access oil. We have been applying a number of different technologies in Abu Dhabi, and this includes sub-surface modelling to enable detailed analysis of each and every structure within the reservoirs, helping ADMA-OPCO to map some of the potentially highly productive areas. This type of technology enables us to prioritize production locations and the type of technology we should deploy to recover the oil, helping to deliver value from the better reservoirs.</p><h4>Your recent contract with ADCO has set a new standard for further integration between IOCs and NOCs in the UAE. How will this agreement transform the energy sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The highlight of this agreement is the way in which ADCO is being structured and how it is enhancing the company using the experience of international companies based in the Emirate. Through these mechanisms, the agreement is actually helping to build long-term understanding of the subsurface and sustainability of the industry in Abu Dhabi. The new leadership in ADNOC and the revamp of its subsidiaries is designed to make it one of the best NOCs in the world, but also one that is able to leverage IOCs, in terms of their technology and capabilities. This landmark contract also involves other international organizations and we can also learn from them how to prioritize our capital so that we can compare and identify the best value for everybody at the table. In the particular case of BP, this contract brings a larger responsibility, which we proudly embrace. We have made it clear that we are fully committed to ADNOC and, after 75 years of partnership, are willing to go that extra mile to support the partnership.</p><h4>What do you see for the development of BP for 2017 and what are the main endeavors you would like to embark on in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>It is public knowledge that the offshore question is coming up on the agenda, with the ADMA concession due to expire in 2018. The next step now is for this process to be formalized based on the priorities of the Abu Dhabi government, the vision and strategy of the offshore sector, the allocation process that will be adopted by the government. On our end, we look forward to bringing real value to Abu Dhabi, be it in the upstream, downstream, or mid-stream segments, to deliver a holistic and integrated solution for Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is very selective in choosing its partnerships and this is the right way to do things. Companies are moving towards downstream and selectivity is important if more value is to be added to the industry. However, it is important to identify the niche areas that need further attention and put yourself at the front of an ever-changing industry. The leadership both of the country and of ADNOC understand that very well. We are grateful for the trust they have placed in BP and we look forward to demonstrating our commitment during this long process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reasons behind the 26.8% increase in profits between January and June 2016 compared to 2015?</h4><p>We are a government-owned development institution and acquisition of high yield is not our major goal. As a development bank, our major role is to promote the diversification of the economy in Kazakhstan and implement a new economy industrialization program of the government. Therefore, the indicator that would characterize the contribution of the DBK in this direction is an increase in our loan portfolio through increase in financing of sectors other than raw material-based ones, such as processing sectors primarily, which provides for the diversification of the economy. Our consolidated credit portfolio as of August 1, 2016 was KZT1.394 trillion versus KZT843 billion in August 2015. The visible increase is about 65%; however, if we exclude the devaluation effect, the gross increase will be about 20%. As for net profit, it should be noted that steps taken by DBK affected this indicator in some way. This spring we conducted stress testing on all our projects and realized the volume of credit portfolio is more sensitive to foreign exchange risks. About 15% of our projects seemed to be exposed to this risk and we thus decided to restructure these loans. Thus, we have diverted the financing from foreign exchange to tenge. These measures resulted in a good quality credit portfolio as of today, excluded the formation of any additional provisions, and, certainly, had an effect on net profit.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the prospects in Kazakhstan's economy for the next five years alongside the New Silk Road Project implementation?</h4><p>After the initiative of China to create the “New Silk Road Economic Belt," this program has been further developed. Now it is not only about leveraging the transit potential of the countries that the Silk Road passed though historically, but also the implementation of investment projects that would economically link the countries of the “New Silk Road." At present, the Kazakhstan-China Program on development of productive capacity is being implemented in Kazakhstan; it includes 51 large investment projects. The DBK plans to participate in financing part of these projects. All these programs such as the revival of the Silk Road, the government's industrial development program, and the creation of the economic union are all measures that are supposed to promote and continue the efficient diversification of the economy of Kazakhstan and further develop our partnerships with neighboring countries. </p><h4>What are some of the bank's ongoing and planned projects that will have the biggest impact on Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>We invest in large projects relative to the size of Kazakhstan. There was a standard that the loan amount should be not less than USD20 million, which was then raised to USD30 million. For the processing sectors of our country such projects are considered large ones. Currently, we have 36 investment projects in our portfolio and 11 export loans. This year we took the decision to invest in poultry farm construction in Akmola region with the capacity of 60,000 tons per year, the construction of transport logistical center in south Kazakhstan regarding the infrastructure, the construction of Turgussun hydro power station in east Kazakhstan, expansion and modernization of plant on nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing in west Kazakhstan for the chemical industry, as well as construction of the plant for sodium cyanide production in south Kazakhstan. The DBK has also invested in a project for the complete production cycle of railway wheels in the Pavlodar region. At the same time, we continue to finance important and significant projects to modernize the Atyrau and Pavlodar refineries, and to invest in greenfield projects such as the construction of a rail and structural steel plant in the Aktobe region. Rails have never been produced in our country before now.  In total, 83 new plants were put into operation thanks to the DBK's funding. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are IFC's most recent projects that have an impact on the country's long-term development? </h4><p>IFC is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector. In this context, it has invested over a billion dollars in Kazakhstan in the last few years. Much of our work has been in the financial sector; we support the development of the sector by making investments and strengthening financial institutions to help them increase access to finance for SMEs and entrepreneurs. To support the country's infrastructure, IFC advises the Ministry of Investment and Development to structure and implement an international tender for the Big Almaty Ring Motor Road (BAKAD). The transaction, the first of its kind, is considered a model for future public-private projects (PPP) in the region. The project is part of the Western China-Western Europe International Corridor. However, setting aside these larger projects, we are involved in many other small projects, for example with microfinance, that target the poorest and give them access to finance. They may not be large loans, USD5-15 million, but they reach a large amount of households. Going forward, we see infrastructure, agribusiness, energy and resource efficiency, financial, and capital markets as key sectors for private investments in Kazakhstan. We also see great potential for broader use of PPPs and support the country's privatization program.</p><h4>Many sectors in Kazakhstan, for example agriculture, have low penetration rates. What is your view on its investment potential?</h4><p>Agriculture has great potential. Kazakhstan has the fifth-largest amount of arable land in the world and, in terms of availability of new land, it probably stands at number one. It is also located in a region with about 3 billion people within a few hours of flying time. This huge population has become affluent due to sustained high economic growth rates in their countries over many years and this population has changing preferences as incomes have grown. The most notable change has been a gradual shift away from vegetable-based diets toward a protein-rich diet. Also there is a modern trend toward organic production. It takes about 7kg of feed to produce 1kg of beef. The feed, which is mostly grain-based, requires good land. And here Kazakhstan has the advantage. Kazakhstan has no limitation on land. It can even focus on organic production, which many countries do not have the luxury to produce. Therefore, Kazakhstan has tremendous potential in agribusiness. However, there are hardly any international investors there. We need to get the right investors into Kazakhstan's agribusiness with the right technology, as the agriculture business has become technical.</p><h4>What are your predictions on the opportunities and challenges Kazakhstan will face in the next few years?</h4><p>There are some good news and some challenges. Oil prices have stabilized, which is good for Kazakhstan. In the immediate future, this will help the country build up its reserves and take some pressure off the government budget, allowing it to spend more, leading to more economic activity, and, therefore, higher growth rates. This is an opportunity for the country to reform and the challenge will be to keep the ship steady and maintain the policy for change. As oil prices go back up, there will be a temptation to not undertake difficult economic reforms and make it more efficient and resilient. Central to sustained improvements in productivity are strengthening the business climate, greater room for private sector expansion in an environment of neutral incentives, and progress on the governance agenda. A well-functioning financial sector and improved access to finance remains an important element of the growth and diversification agenda. An important challenge is further developing the credit infrastructure and deepening local currency bond markets to develop multiple sources of financing for the private sector at competitive prices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main projects implemented by the ministry in the last two years and what has been their impact on the economy?</h4><p>We have been modernizing industry in the country as per our overall goals, and that started back in 2010. Our economy has begun diversifying since then and focused more on the processing and manufacturing industry. We have created a complex assortment of new tools in support of business and industry in this period. Our main priority has been to attract more foreign investment into the processing industry. We wanted to start with modernization projects in metallurgy, and now we are at the point where we export aluminum to Russia, whereas before we used to import aluminum from Russia. Our plan now is to increase the production of aluminum and diversify our production of aluminum goods. We are also developing small-scale steel plants and modernizing our metallurgical company ArcelorMittal. Right now it produces 4 million goods, and we have plans to increase that to 6 million and to diversify the production catalog. We also plan to build new railroads, with technology from Siemens, located in Aktobe. We have a partnership to produce locomotives with GE. We are trying to shift from raw material production to value added and manufactured goods. In chemicals we are modernizing our capacity for production of fertilizers. Russian company Eurochem is building a new fertilizer plant with an investment of USD1.5 billion. We also prioritize machinery production. About 40% of our imports are for machinery, so we are working on that. Machinery importation is also a great sign of industrial and economic development and demand, but we want to start producing our own machinery, too. We are also modernizing our refinery plants. We want to refine as much as possible of the 80 million tons of oil produced.</p><h4>These initiatives are part of the State Initiative Program for 2015. What is your assessment of the success of this program and how has it changed the country over the past two years?</h4><p>It is a long-term program that will go on until 2025 and even on to 2035. But already employment and job creation is up, and we are continuing with our goals to meet OECD standards for labor production.</p><h4>How important is it for Kazakhstan to initiate strong partnerships with big companies like GE and Alston, and how do you ensure you are able to establish partnerships with these kinds of multinationals?</h4><p>We place a great deal of importance on working with multinational corporations and attracting more FDI. We have a list of 50 multinationals that we hope to attract to Kazakhstan for various diverse projects. We have plans for each company, and are in contact and talking to all of them about potential projects that we can work on. We already work with 30 of those companies and want to make that 50. Our strategy to attract more FDI and multinationals involves meeting international and OECD standards, and we aim for a membership seat on the OECD Investment Committee this year. That membership would mean we are meeting all of the OECD's standards, and that is important to attract FDI and multinational investors. We are also working on institutional support for these initiatives to push them forward. Our investment company Kazakh Invest is a major step toward this goal. That company has the necessary authority and is a one-stop shop for all investors and transnational corporations. We also have another company, Kazakh Export, which will focus on export financing.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential for investors and in terms of driving the Kazakhstan economy in the coming years?</h4><p>We are focusing on four main sectors, namely chemistry, machinery, food processing, and retail. Those have the most potential for us, the country, and investors.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We have many goals in investments, industry, energy efficiency, labor productivity, and so on. We have annual goals that we always seek to achieve. By the end of 2017, we need to develop industry 4.0 in the country, which essentially involves digitalization and computerization. It is complex and ambitious, but that is our objective, and the contribution this will make to industrial efficiency and productivity has been proven in other countries, like Bulgaria. We need to make sure industry is ready for that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Nazarbayev held his first-ever visit to Serbia in August 2016. How has this event opened a new chapter of diplomatic ties between Serbia and Kazakhstan, and how would you describe bilateral relations today?</h4><p>Serbia and Kazakhstan have longstanding good and friendly relations. Last year we celebrated 25 years of the independence of Kazakhstan and two decades of bilateral relations. We have had the opportunity to confirm our friendship on many occasions. Serbia highly appreciates Kazakhstan's decision to support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia. We support each other in many international bodies. President Nazarbayev's first official visit to Serbia in summer 2016 played a pivotal role in intensifying our bilateral relations as well as in invigorating ideas for advanced trade and economic cooperation. In 2017, we will have an intensive exchange at the high political level. We plan to establish closer ties in the areas of security, culture, academic exchange, and many other fields. We look forward to Expo 2017 in Astana as an opportunity for our businesses to better explore a wide array of prospects for future cooperation.</p><h4>President Nazarbayev has previously commented on the great potential for trade between the two countries. In which areas do you particularly see the potential for enhanced trade, and what measures are being taken to reach your full potential?</h4><p>Our trade is indeed below its potential. Agriculture, construction, pharmaceuticals, transport, and tourism are all areas where we both see prospects for better cooperation. At present, there is much going on at the institutional level. Last May 2016, the supreme council of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) adopted a decision to start negotiations with Serbia on the unification of the trade regime, the result of which will be a mutual free trade zone between all EEU member states and Serbia. Concrete negotiations should start in 2017. We are still awaiting the formal decision regarding the export of Fiat vehicles produced in Serbia. We are also enthusiastic about the opening of direct flights between Belgrade and Astana and Almaty, which are in the interest of both countries and should happen during Expo 2017. This will allow much easier and faster communication, boost tourism on both sides, and offer Kazakhstani travelers other options to fly to the US via Belgrade, using Air Serbia.</p><h4>What opportunities does Serbia offer to Kazakhstani investors and vice versa?</h4><p>Kazakhstani investors will find abundant opportunities in Serbia. A Kazakhstani company, ZholZhondeushi, recently purchased ZGOP, a Serbian company involved in the construction, repair, and maintenance of railway lines, from Novi Sad. We hope to see more investors, particularly in the petrochemical sector, gas and oil industry, as well in other sectors where there is an ongoing process of privatization. I would also like to emphasize the potential for the establishment of mutual companies and transfer of know-how in the agriculture, food processing, and pharmaceutical sectors and a joint approach to third markets, particularly China. There is growing interest by Serbian companies in Kazakhstan as well. Some of the most renowned companies such as Tarkett, Energoprojekt, Tigar, Hemopharm, and others have already established themselves in Kazakhstan's competitive market. Having in mind that Kazakhstan has ambitious plans for urban construction, we believe Serbian companies in construction, equipment, and machinery, as well as interior design, are well suited for the job.</p><h4>How do you foresee future bilateral relations between the two countries evolving in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>I am enthusiastic about our prospects to build stronger political and economic ties. Both countries showed strong willingness to nurture these relations, promote dialog, and act as pillars of stability in their respective regions. The EEU is one of the most promising global markets and Kazakhstan itself has an excellent geostrategic position and economic potential for further accelerated growth. Serbia, with its economic, scientific, and cultural potential, as well as unspoiled nature, has proven to be an attractive business partner and a trusted friend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Kazakhstan's growing importance as a strategic partner for Turkey?</h4><p>Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan are deep rooted. This year we proudly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. During these years, we have maintained mutual will to further develop our bilateral relations. Kazakhstan is one of our leading partners in Eurasia and we continue to strengthen our relations through various mechanisms. The establishment of the Joint Strategic Cooperation Council in 2011 is a testament to the importance of our relations. I am pleased to see the growing role of Kazakhstan on the international scene. Kazakhstan has made remarkable contributions to the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts. I should also mention President Nazarbayev's praiseworthy initiatives to strengthen ties among the friendly and brotherly countries. I am confident Kazakhstan will further contribute to international peace and stability as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2017-2018 period. We will continue our cooperation with our Kazakh brothers in international fora.</p><h4>What measures are being implemented to  increase bilateral trade to USD10 billion?</h4><p>I strongly believe that this target is realistic as Kazakhstan is our leading trading partner in Central Asia. As a matter of fact, we have the necessary economic and trade mechanisms between the two countries. For example, the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) provides a useful venue to explore the ways and means to further expand cooperation. The last JEC meeting in Ankara in March 2016 was fruitful. I should also mention the Joint Road Transportation Commission Meetings and Business Council Meetings as valuable instruments in this regard.</p><h4>Which sectors of Kazakhstan's economy have the greatest potential for Turkish investment?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's economic developments are on our radars. We not only support Kazakhstan's “Strategy 2050," which aims to place Kazakhstan among the world's top-30 developed economies, but are also ready to join hands with Kazakhstan to pursue that strategy. Turkish direct investments in Kazakhstan reached USD2 billion, which makes us the fourth-largest investor in Kazakhstan. The total volume of the 475 projects that Turkish contracting companies have thus far undertaken in Kazakhstan is around USD21 billion. We are confident that Kazakhstan's ongoing efforts to modernize the country's infrastructure, transportation, and logistics will further provide favorable conditions to attract foreign investments. Energy, mining, transportation and logistics, defense, agro-industry, health tourism, information communication technologies, and software in particular are promising areas of cooperation. Another area where we support Kazakhstan's efforts is its aspiration to become a regional hub for transport and logistics. In this regard, the Central Corridor through Caspian Sea will be instrumental in enhancing our trade relations. It would be mutually beneficial to connect the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway to the Kazakh railway network through the Caspian Sea and Aktau Port.</p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Suffice it to say, development and peace go hand in hand. We follow a foreign policy that takes initiative for peace and development. To that end, we are active at UN platforms, G-20, and many other international organizations with like-minded countries. Our bilateral relations will certainly be brighter and stronger. In the last 25 years, we have made many achievements to further and deepen our relations. Yet, there is still great potential. Both sides have the will and determination to strengthen ties. We look forward to holding the third session of the Joint Strategic Cooperation Council this year in Turkey. At this meeting, which will be held under the co-chairmanship of President Erdoğan and President Nazarbayev, we will review the current state of our relations and set new goals. Boosting our cooperation in mutual investment and increasing our trade volume are among our major goals. Furthermore, we will make every effort to enhance our cooperation in culture, education, and tourism. As we celebrate the silver jubilee in our diplomatic relations, I take this opportunity to convey the warmest greetings from the Turkish people to the people of Kazakhstan and wish many happy returns. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan is showing a growing interest in Africa and your visit to Astana in 2016 was the first of a non-Arab African country. How does this event open a new chapter in relations between Kazakhstan and Senegal, and with Africa as a whole?</h4><p>This visit, part of the rapprochement between Africa and Central Asia, demonstrates a common will to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between our two countries in areas of the economy and security on a regional and international level, and a common respect for the principles of equality, partnership, and dialog in international relations. Without a doubt, we have opened a new chapter in the relations between our two continents and, particularly, our two countries; two countries that share many affinities, such as values of tolerance and respect for diversity in our two countries where an Islamic majority coexists peacefully with other religions; two countries animated by a spirit of openness and dialog. This meeting was, above all, an opportunity to appreciate Kazakhstan's expertise in the fields of energy and agriculture.</p><h4>In what areas of economic activity do you see potential for cooperation between the two countries? </h4><p>The sectors of energy, mining, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, and industry have been identified as key areas of the economy for cooperation. In Senegal, all our energies are mobilized for the development of these key sectors around the Emerging Senegal Plan (ESP). The priority is to improve the performance of our economy by an average growth of 7% per year, sustainable and inclusive, and place Senegal on the path of emergence. Between Senegal and Kazakhstan, we have signed an agreement between the Ministry of Culture and Sports of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Sports of Senegal to promote bilateral relations in this field. I also had the pleasure of meeting the major players in the economy of Kazakhstan during an investment conference hosted at Nazarbayev University, where I presented the projects and reforms underway to the investors and public authorities that I invited to seize the numerous opportunities in Senegal. </p><h4>How does Senegal intend to contribute to Expo 2017 and what is your vision on its long-term impact on the Kazakh economy? </h4><p>It is with great pleasure that we confirmed our participation in the 2017 International Exposition in Astana to President Nazarbayev, who granted me the honor of inviting Senegal. I look forward to taking part in this great moment of meetings, exchanges, and partnerships in Astana in 2017, the first Exhibition hosted in Central Asia. Senegal intends to actively participate in Expo 2017 in Astana under the theme “Energy of the Future," which aims to promote alternative sources of energy. This initiative is aligned with the overall objectives set in Paris and Marrakech at COP 21 and COP 22 where Africa, and, therefore, Senegal, stood at the forefront of the international commitment on the issue of climate. It is thus relevant to resolve the issue of energy and access to electricity on our continent, objectives that can be achieved with new technologies enabling us to envisage differently the energy of the future that is so vital to our development. Perhaps one day, just as Kazakhstan has organized the first international Expo in Asia, an upcoming Expo will take place in Dakar as the first in Africa.</p><h4>How do you envisage the future of diplomatic, economic, and trade relations between Senegal and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have the common ambition to establish a cultural dialogue and to broaden the components of this dialog in order to strengthen the bonds of friendship and economic, commercial, and security cooperation between our two countries. I hope that we will continue our cooperation and that we will also extend it to the educational and scientific associations of our countries, for example, in order to facilitate the exchange of our qualified students and specialists. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the evolution of bilateral relations between the UK and Kazakhstan and the growing importance of Kazakhstan for the UK as a strategic partner in Central Asia?</h4><p>We have a great relationship with Kazakhstan that continues to strengthen. This is underlined by high-level visits, such as the UK Prime Minister's visit to Kazakhstan in 2013, which kick-started our annual strategic dialog, and President Nazarbayev's visit to the UK in 2015. Each year ministers meet to develop our relationships across a broad range of issues.</p><h4>During the visit of former Minister of Foreign Affairs Yerlan Idrissov to London in late 2016, you both expressed your intentions to further develop relations in all areas of bilateral relations. What measures are being taken in order to strengthen diplomatic ties and expand economic cooperation?</h4><p>Our annual dialogs have identified some great ways to develop our cooperation. On diplomatic ties, as well as exploring opportunities for the UK and Kazakhstan, the dialog was a chance for us to welcome Kazakhstan to the UN Security Council. We look forward to working together to address the security challenges the world is facing in places like Syria, South Sudan, and Yemen. We also welcome the opportunity Kazakhstan now has to contribute further to the UN's approach to conflict prevention, peace, and development. On economic cooperation, we identified important projects across a range of sectors. We will work together via the UK-Kazakhstan Intergovernmental Commission to develop our mutual economic cooperation. The UK's Department for International Trade (DIT) has three major high value campaigns including in oil, gas, and mining—areas where UK companies have the skills and experience to partner with their Kazakhstani counterparts. I am delighted that Anglo-Dutch company Shell continues to be a major foreign investor in Kazakhstan as a major shareholder in the Kashagan and Karachaganak oilfields. In the financial and professional services sector, UK companies are increasingly taking opportunities to support Kazakhstan's ambitious reform program. TheCityUK, the trade association representing London's financial sector, provides legal advice and guidance to the new Astana International Financial Centre. I am also pleased to see progress that will see more equipment manufactured to international standards in Kazakhstan, with a joint task force formed to help reach this target. The task force will develop new joint UK-Kazakhstani business ventures and further improve our economic cooperation.</p><h4>In which areas of the economy do you see the highest potential for trade and cooperation between the UK and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We have great ambitions to increase trade and cooperation between the UK and Kazakhstan. We hope to achieve GBP420 million of export value wins from Expo Astana 2017. The extractive industries—oil and gas and mining—are key sectors and will be a core part of this; however, there are also increasingly new opportunities emerging. The establishment of the Astana International Financial Centre, to which the UK gave its strong support, gives the UK's financial and professional services sector a chance to increase trade and investment. I am also particularly excited to see how we can use our presence at Expo as a springboard to explore new sectors such as agriculture and smart cities.</p><h4>What lessons and practices can the UK bring to Kazakhstan's green energy sector, and how do you foresee the event boosting Astana and Kazakhstan's economy?</h4><p>Our commitment to green energy solutions is something we hope will build momentum across our international partners, including Kazakhstan. Our pavilion at Expo 2017 will promote the UK's creativity, innovation, and openness to tackling the world's energy challenges to a global audience. We are eager to share our experiences on energy diversification with the Kazakhstani government, businesses, and people, and believe there is further scope to work together. Over 100 countries and international organizations are expected to attend the Expo and this unique international attention will play a part in boosting the whole economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Dear people of Kazakhstan, the country has passed its 25-year development phase. As part of the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of our independence, we highlighted Kazakhstan's achievements and progress, which are well known and appreciated by the world community.</p><p>Kazakhstan has become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council since the beginning of 2017. Expo 2017 will be held in Astana this year, and we are the first country in Central Asia to hold such important global event. Also, the Universiade sporting event took place in February in Almaty, with the participation of over 1,600 athletes and delegates from 56 countries. All these are the results of the right political path and of Kazakhstan's great standing in the international arena. Kazakhstan shall join the world's top 30 developed countries by 2050. We will resolutely work towards this purpose.</p><p>As a result of the Nurly Zhol economic policy and the 100 Concrete Steps plan, we are going through the initial stage of a global transformation. Additional KZT1.7 trillion was allocated to support the economy for the 2014-2016 period alone. As a result, GDP grew by 1% in 2016, an important figure under the current difficult conditions. Today I pose a challenge to implement Kazakhstan's third modernization. It is necessary to create a new model of economic growth that will enhance the country's global competitiveness. I see five key priorities designed to ensure that economic growth above the world average, helping us steadily advance to becoming one of the 30 leading countries in the world.</p><p>The first priority is the accelerated technological modernization of the economy. We must cultivate new industries involving the use of digital technologies, such as 3D printing, online commerce, mobile banking, and digital services. In this regard, I charge the government to adopt the Digital Kazakhstan program. Also, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship is a factor of great significance in forming new industries. In parallel with creating new industries, we should give impetus to developing traditional industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, transport and logistics, construction, and other sectors. Firstly, it is important to boost productivity, starting from the introduction of elements like automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and the exchange of big data.</p><p>Secondly, there is a need to focus on the development of competitive export industries in priority sectors. For this purpose I entrust the government with the task of increasing non-oil exports by half by 2025 and with creating a council for export policy. Thirdly, the country's mining and oil and metallurgical sectors shall retain strategic importance for growth. Much attention is given to expanding the mineral resource base through active exploration and I entrust the government to adopt the new Code on Mineral Resources by the end of the year. Fourthly, agriculture must become the new driver of the economy. In this regard, within five years, the area of irrigated land must grow by 40%, investment in agricultural research must be boosted, and exports of food must grow by 40% by 2021. The fifth point of the economy's modernization is logistics infrastructure development. Therefore, I instruct the government to increase, by 2020, goods carried in containers by seven times and air passengers transport by four times. The last priority in this context is the construction sector, which shall become a full driver of the domestic economy.</p><p>The second priority is to enhance the business environment. One of our strategic goals is to ensure that the contribution of SMEs to GDP will be at least 50% by 2050. It is an ambitious but achievable goal, and to achieve it the following is needed. Firstly, the government recently launched a program of effective employment and business activity growth. Now the citizens of Kazakhstan in rural regions and towns can get microloans of up to KZT16 million for business operations. Secondly, the government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs (Atameken) shall take measures on the front end to reduce all business costs. In addition, I instruct the government to elaborate the framework on business deregulation by July 1. Thirdly, a reduction in the share of the state in the economy to 15% of GDP in line with OECD levels should give a new impetus to economic growth. The government is tasked with completing the privatization of 200 companies by the end of 2018. Fourthly, public-private partnership outspread is a strong potential for promotion of entrepreneurship. This refers to transferring a number of government services to business. All forms of PPP are critical to be used for the utilization of private funds, including trust management of state property, service contracts, and others. PPP is set to become a primary mechanism for infrastructure development, including the social aspect.<br>The third priority is macroeconomic stability. The key objective here is the restoration of the monetary policy and involvement of private capital in financing the economy. At present the National Bank has an important inflation target of 3-4% in the medium term. Also, it is tasked with implementing measures for banking sector enhancement. The National Bank needs to be given more rights for the state banks' operational control. Lastly, we need to further develop the stock market, which should be boosted by privatization. As for fiscal policy, it is necessary to radically improve the efficiency of budget spending. Optimization of the existing tax incentives is critical. New special tax regimes shall be taken into consideration in a new angle on the eve of the universal declaration.</p><p>The fourth priority is the improvement of human capital. Firstly, the role of the education system will change and become central to the new economic growth model. Training programs should focus on the development of critical thinking abilities and skills, and at the same time we should focus on IT-knowledge, financial literacy and of youth patriotism. Currently, 90% of the world's information is in English. Kazakhstan cannot achieve progress without mastery of the English language. Therefore, from 2019 teaching in some subjects in 10th and 11th grade will be conducted in English. As for the healthcare system, from July 1, a system of compulsory social health insurance will be implemented based on joint and several liabilities of the state, employers, and citizens. This system's effectiveness has been proven around the world.</p><p>Furthermore, pensions for 2.1 million retirees will be increased by 20% compared to 2016.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of First Gulf Properties during 2016?</h4><p>First Gulf Properties has been present in the local market for a few years now with a diversified portfolio of 15,000 units across segments including residential, commercial, low-cost accommodation, industrial, and warehousing. Despite the market downturn, one of the great achievements of 2016 was to maintain our occupancy rate at over 90%. In financial terms, we have been able to collect over AED2 billion on the property management side, a cornerstone achievement for our stakeholders. The operating model of First Gulf Properties is totally different to other companies in the sector, as we have four stakeholders: the landlords and tenants, who are our two types of customers; the municipalities; ministries and other government authorities; and the banks. We successfully navigated the adverse environment of 2016 because of the focused, professional, and competent people we have, along with our good understanding of the market and the need for flexibility. We also make use of our negotiation skills to mould our operations according to market trends and push for regulations to be adjusted in order to safeguard the sector's interests. This is one of our secrets to maintaining such high occupancy rates.</p><h4>How would you describe your portfolio mix between high, middle, and lower-end real estate?</h4><p>The inherent flexibility that characterizes FGP allows us to cover all the different segments of the market, especially in Abu Dhabi and we have high, middle, and low-cost properties. In 2016 there was a significant drop in demand for high-end properties because tenants started to become more cost-conscious and because this is an internally-driven market. We leveraged our portfolio in light of market conditions. For example, if a tenant has been living in one of our high-end properties, we can offer them alternative accommodation in the middle rental bracket. This is why we have been able to maintain our high occupancy rates and there has been no significant impact on us from changes in the market. We have a huge company with the appropriate economies of scale to cater to the economic cycle.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the impact of the recently implemented Property Law in Abu Dhabi and how does it reflect on FGP's daily activities?</h4><p>Business planning and decision-making are based on analysis, information, and intuition. The impact of the new regulations is that we have started to see more analysis for future business growth, therefore creating a win-win situation for the authorities, the regulator, and us. Today we have the information we require about the number of people renting, what types of products are available, and so forth. It is a healthy environment for new businesses looking to establish themselves here, and for continuity and growth. At a personal level, I felt the market needed this new legislation in order to analyze and have a necessary breakdown of information about the sector. Moreover, regulations and guidelines are especially important in a market facing the volatility Abu Dhabi has faced over the last eight years. There are always victims, whether it is the landlords or the tenants, and regulations are implemented to protect against fluctuations in the market.</p><h4>First Gulf Properties is a subsidiary of one of the larger banks in Abu Dhabi. How does this reflect in your operations?</h4><p>It reflects in the solidity of our processes and the extensive customer base we have. We have strict credit guidelines under our business model, meaning we manage the mortgages until the property loan is over, mitigating the risks. We also have a property management arm to manage the collection. This is why we have to be unique and distinguished to ensure there is a return on the investment for investors who make the choice to use our bank. We provide an end-to-end service for landlords and property investors, we look at the property and its location before financing is given, and we make sure the loan repayments are made. One of our competitive advantages is the quality of the services we provide and the attention we pay to ensuring customer retention. This is why customers that use our bank tend to stay with us even after they have repaid their loan.</p><h4>What do you foresee for FGP's performance in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017 there will be a merger that will yield huge opportunities for First Gulf Properties and our partner in terms of synergies. After the merger enters into effect in April 2017, we will become a market giant. We are looking forward to being able to leverage on our existing services and collaborations between both real estate arms and so forth. We already have activity with Reem Island, developing projects with over a couple of billion in investment. Abu Dhabi is unique in terms of its real estate demand and supply model as there is no volatility due to the regularized market. We are focused on building to lease at the moment and we will continue on this path during 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Msheireb Properties uphold its threefold approach of sustainability, modernity, and preservation of Qatari heritage within its projects?</h4><p>Msheireb Properties' vision is to be a pioneering development company that respects the environment, and takes Qatari architecture, history, and culture into consideration to create something in harmony with the landscape and heritage of the country. In the past, when Qatar first began to produce oil and gas, building designers and contractors did not take local factors such as these into consideration. However, based on Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's inspiring vision, we have taken the initiative to develop our own architectural language which works in harmony with our country's culture and environment, and this is the vision that Msheireb Properties follows. We felt that our country needed to identify its own architectural language, a style that really belongs to Qatar, something that is made by us, for us. At the same time we needed to modernize designs to meet today's needs and requirements, and take Qatar's architectural language into the future to restore the uniqueness of Qatar's built environment. To ensure continuity between the past and the present and create a city that brings the community together, Msheireb Properties has built modern sustainable housing which is environmentally friendly, cost effective, and in line with our architectural language.</p><h4>How do you assess the current development of Msheireb Downtown Doha project?</h4><p>Msheireb Downtown Doha project is divided into four different phases, and are pleased to have passed 80% of its completion. Phase Four is the last phase in development, and has been held back due to the metro station works. However, we are making good progress and have finished the public areas, trams, parks, and parking. We have also signed contracts for managing operations and maintenance of Msheireb Downtown Doha including the carpark. We have had discussions with the government about the possibility of creating our own municipal authority within Msheireb Downtown Doha as this will allow people to interact easily within our development. At this moment in time we are at the peak of our sales and leasing activities, with a lot of visitors coming to see the residential, retail, and commercial sites. Some tenants are even fitting out the buildings themselves. Other good news to share is that Qatar Financial Center (QFC) has decided to relocate to Msheireb Downtown Doha, creating a buzz with the entities that operate under QFC's umbrella and regulations, and positioning Msheireb Downtown Doha as a leading business gateway. As a smart city, Msheireb Downtown Doha provides business entities with a better platform to offer their services and be in close proximity to clients, be it banking, legal, retail, and many others. Due to its strategic location and close proximity to others businesses, we expect that more international companies will join our project, driving forward Qatar's economic diversification goals.</p><h4>Qatar is characterized for its wide selection of retail and hospitality options. What will make Msheireb Downtown Doha differ from what is currently on offer?</h4><p>Msheireb Downtown Doha is located in the heart of Doha, close to the corniche and surrounded by shops, museums, and businesses. In this sense, our location is second-to-none. In addition, the project is state-of-the-art in all senses: a smart city with a completely climate controlled environment, a great layout, and vibrant open main square, excellent five-star hotels including the first Mandarin Oriental hotel in the Middle East, high-end boutiques and stores, big offices and commercial spaces, the world's first 10,000-space integrated underground carpark, and great restaurants and cafes to choose from. There will also be a cultural forum that will be a driver of cultural activities in Doha, and offer several entertainment and leisure facilities such as sports and wellness centers, cinemas, theaters, amphitheaters, concert spaces, and more. We are creating a dynamic lifestyle environment for living, for work, for leisure, for everyone.</p><h4>How do you forecast the impact of Msheireb Downtown Doha project in the future growth of the city?</h4><p>I consider Msheireb Downtown Doha will become Qatar's epicenter, breaking down barriers that have been previously felt. It will be a dynamic city where people can interact and do business, as it has everything you could hope for as a living and working space. At the same time, this project will be a pilot for smart cities in the future. Msheireb Downtown Doha will become a real driver of transformation of Doha and the lives of its residents. Historically, Qatar has always been a place that has brought different people together. Our vision is to simply develop and enhance this for the benefit of future generations. Moreover, we have developed a blueprint that could be shared among different cities around the world. Msheireb Downtown Doha is a model, and we based our project on research about other smart city projects, and believe that Msheireb Downtown Doha could be a reference point for similar projects around the world. Furthermore, we see Msheireb Downtown Doha as a continual development, as we will keep improving the city.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We expect Msheireb Downtown Doha to open in 2017. We are currently working to attract people and businesses to the project's residential, commercial, and retail areas. We have tested the market and opened Msheireb Downtown Doha's museums and public spaces to visitors. The project is gaining attention in Qatar for its uniqueness and the transformative effect that it will have on the city. With Msheireb Downtown Doha coming to life this year, our ambitions are limitless. Once the development is fully completed in mid-2018, the project will be able to compete on a global level. After that, we will look to develop properties in the north of Doha and outside the capital. We always target excellence; therefore, we are selective with the projects we go for. We have big aims and plan to expand our operations outside of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[For the Long Run]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[simon-lee-president-samsung-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Colombian market for Samsung's strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>The Colombian market is already a big one but still has huge potential to grow. In terms of country size and population, which are already formidable, it's even more attractive for its growth potential. In this sense we are investing a lot and we are studying how to be a better member of Colombian society. The Colombian market is competitive for retailers. If we prove ourselves in the Colombian market we can prove ourselves in the global market. In this sense it is a critical market.</p><h4>What business lines have the most potential in Colombia?</h4><p>The mobile device sector is definitely the most attractive. Within our business portfolio, mobile is the highest portion for our business. Even though the penetration in mobile devices here is already at a global level. Technology wise, however, we have room to grow—in 4G and 5G, for example. Smartphones have already penetrated the Colombian market but the LT technology has a ways to go. We are focusing on how to spread out the LTE and 4G technologies to Colombian society. This is where Samsung's expertise takes the advantage in Colombia.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges you see in Colombia which are unique to the country? What are the main challenges you are now facing?</h4><p>I stayed here for 1.5 years and when I arrived in July of 2015 we were in the middle of an economic fluctuation, with the exchange rate badly affected. At the beginning of last year the exchange rate was around COP2,000 to the dollar, and at the end of last year it was COP3,000, a 50% devaluation. That impacted our business very negatively and still remains a major challenge. Nor is the macro-economic situation particularly promising, as inflation has also impacted us. These are some of the challenges of doing business here. The last thing is competition. There are too many players on the provider and retail side. Competition is a factor, and the market price is ever fluctuating. The visibility level is a little low, which also factors into our business. In the short term, competition is a challenge to our business, but in the long term it is good for us. It makes us stronger and the competition always forces us to make our product better, leading to better technology for the Colombian people. It's a good thing in the long run.</p><h4>How is Samsung partnering with local institutions?</h4><p>I am very proud of what we have done over the past year. One development is named the tech institute, the principle aim of which is to utilize our facilities and technology for the betterment of Colombian society. We have already developed certain facilities and products that we are excited to share with the Colombian people. We also have a corporation with SENA, where we set up some classrooms and now facilitate our products there in combination with their teaching methodology and our technology. When Colombian students learn how to handle technology and fix devices, it is a great example of our local partnerships. We are running the smart schools format as well. This year we developed a different kind of project called Nómada, a mobile classroom. We developed some equipment and then dispersed spot tablets, TVs, and even tables. We currently have eight modules that we sent out across the country to areas that don't have access to normal classrooms. It is a great tool to approach the people that live in rural areas like the Amazon or in the mountains. We can fold it up and take the classroom anywhere we go.</p><h4>How do you see the upcoming tax reform in the country impacting Samsung?</h4><p>Assuming there will be some tax increases, this means the final consumer price will increase. This will greatly impact demand. We are a little worried about this but will still overcome the situation. We will improve our product design, technology, solutions, and services.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>There are still some economic issues, not to mention the tax problem, but we can deal with these challenges and will grow in terms of sales revenue. In a decade or two from now, Samsung wants to be an aspirational and admirable brand. We are not just doing business without providing some solution-oriented products. At the same time we want to give insight to Colombian society as an integral member.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what areas does AURAK specialize?</h4><p>We currently have 22 degree programs, of which 18 are undergraduate and four at the master's level. Our programs match the market needs, and for this reason our main schools are engineering and business. We also have arts and sciences school, in which we have three undergraduate courses and one graduate course. AURAK aims to provide an alternative to the students not only of Ras Al Khaimah, but also of the region. We are one of the few universities that offer certain programs such as petroleum and chemical engineering. We also embarked on international partnership and signed an agreement with Nebraska University to offer a concentration in hospitality and tourism. Tourism and hospitality is an important specialization, especially when the whole UAE and Ras Al Khaimah in particular, place emphasis on tourism as one of the pillars of development. AURAK launched a series of cooperative agreements with a number of US institutions to encourage the study abroad and faculty exchange program.</p><h4>How does AURAK ensure quality education for its students?</h4><p>AURAK has a good reputation thanks to unique programs and low fees that do not compromise on quality. AURAK enjoys institutional local accreditation and all its programs are accredited by the UAE Ministry of Higher Education. At the same time, we work on international accreditation such as ABET for the engineering programs. So far, we have received an encouraging report for two of our programs, and we expect to get the final approval in 2016. We have already applied for a third program for next year. Our school of business recently became a member of the AASCB, and, in three years, we aim to receive the school accreditation. At the institutional level, we are working to accredit the institution with the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges (SACS COC) in the US. Furthermore, we take the credentials of our faculty members seriously. Our faculty is diversified. We are lucky in the UAE because there are many people who want to come and live in the UAE, and want to link their name with a good institution; for that reason, our research profile has grown tremendously.</p><h4>Does AURAK plan to undertake any infrastructure developments?</h4><p>We have a comprehensive master plan that was approved by the Board of Trustee in January 2016. Recently, a new building was opened that encompasses a gym, a cafeteria, a recreation center, auditorium, a conference room, and a nice lounge. It will also have some classrooms and an ICT center for technological education that is subsidized by the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority. It also hosts the school of engineering and the school of graduate studies and research. Campus development is a continuous process to improve the infrastructure, the landscaping, and to modernize, upgrade, and renovate the existing buildings and construct new ones. We aim to link industry with academia through creating partnerships with companies such as Julphar, Stevin Rock, or RAK Bank. The latter works with us to construct a new school for business. Our master plan involves individual buildings for all our schools and we hope to unveil new projects by next year. Needless to say, we plan to have more schools, more programs, and more degrees. Hopefully, in a few years, we will finalize our institutional accreditation with SACS COC and embark on a new era of development for the university.</p><h4>Will we see more universities establishing themselves in RAK?</h4><p>I see no harm in having new universities opening their doors in RAK. Competition can drive AURAK to be innovative, and having a competitor would force us to produce higher-quality graduates. Competition is always in the interest of the investors, and when I say investors, I mean students, families, or sponsors. If they are going to work in free trade zone institutions, the Ras Al Khaimah government will still have to have a regulatory authority to maintain standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you offer to investors?</h4><p>Strohal has been practicing law in Vienna since 1979. In the mid 1980s we opened our first office outside Europe, in Indonesia, and then in Singapore in 1992. During a visit to Ras Al Khaimah in 2005, HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi stressed the need for international English-speaking lawyers for the growing number of foreign investors in the Emirate. Later that year, as per His Highness' suggestion, we started operations and have been the only foreign on-shore law firm in the country ever since. We focus on business law in general, but corporate is our main task; however, we do not do litigation. When there are disputes, we hand it over to local law firms. We do everything in connection to company set-ups, like international taxation, labor, conveyancing, rental contracts, and so on. We focus mostly on foreigners entering this Emirate or any other of the other six Emirates. For this reason we also have partners in Sharjah, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi. In corporate law, we work with the two free zones offshore and onshore, as well as the other Emirates, and we also advise in Oman and Qatar. Oman, Bahrain, and Qatar are the areas where we are frequently asked to work outside of the UAE. However, in Saudi Arabia, due to its more strict sharia law, we prefer to use local firms for our clients doing business there. In the 10 years we have been practicing in the region we have not had a bad case yet.</p><h4>Strohal is a boutique law firm with no more than three or four lawyers. Is it part of your strategy to keep the firm small?</h4><p>Once a law firm has about 80 to 100 lawyers, at least one-third of its working power is dedicated to administration. I want to work as a lawyer and be here for the client, and so we offer a concentrated scope. Sometimes when we have one or two big clients that take all our resources, we hold off on taking on any new clients. Our four worldwide offices are in communication with each other, which means that we can use the back office in Singapore, Myanmar, or Vienna.</p><h4>What are the main factors that companies seeking to do business in Ras Al Khaimah should take into consideration?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has a number of advantages. Firstly, the free zones are much more flexible due to their size in comparison to those in Dubai. The free zones in Ras Al Khaimah tend to resemble a family-type administration. Secondly, the free zones here are much cheaper, particularly the rental costs. Company set-up license fees are almost the same across the UAE, but per square meter companies setting up here only pay a third of Silicon Oasis or a fourth of Dubai Airport Free Zone, and maybe only 10% of Jebel Ali. Furthermore, we have one large industrial park in Al Ghail in Ras Al Khaimah, which belongs to the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA). It costs around AED10 per sqm per year in terms of rental, which compared to Dubai's industrial parks is extremely affordable. Besides Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah is the fastest-growing Emirate in regard to the economy, tourism, and industry, including manufacturing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the RAK economy in the medium term?</h4><p>I believe Ras Al Khaimah will sooner or later overtake Sharjah and become the third Emirate within the seven. Tourism will be the main driver of the economy for the Emirate, followed by medium or light industry, which is settling here because labor and rental costs are cheaper. We are one of only three Emirates offering offshore services. There are many foreigners and Europeans in top positions, and to attract more people they are showing more open-mindedness and tolerance, which is evident from the invitation of foreign think tanks to support development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the pharmaceutical market in the UAE like today?</h4><p>
	The UAE pharmaceutical market is the most attractive market in the region, though it relies on multinational companies to supply innovative and essential medicines. Domestic products will expand over the long term because of fast approvals, high affordability, and growth of medical tourism. In the short term, scrutiny on drug prices will be higher for multinational companies; the UAE government will cut back spending on higher value, innovative drugs, which will be offset by an increasingly private market. Total pharmaceutical expenditure in 2015 is USD2.8 billion, growing by 9% compared to 2014. Julphar is a UAE-based pharmaceutical company and is one of the biggest manufacturers and distribution companies in the region and will continue to play a crucial role in supplying medicines to the local market. Julphar exports 90% of its products to 40 countries worldwide while 10% of its production is consumed within the UAE. The UAE imports about 85-90% of its medication while 10% is produced domestically, most of it by Julphar. Most local companies focus on producing generic products, rather than high-value, hard-to-manufacture products that Julphar pioneers. Domestic companies are not in the field of manufacturing biotech or bio-similar products because they are difficult to manufacture and not attractive to patients; they prefer branded products. Reduction in oil prices will lead to cuts in the budget of the Ministry of Health, which will encourage local manufacturers to produce more products at affordable prices.
</p><h4>Julphar has developed a large diabetes drug manufacturing plant. What products and successes have come out of the plant?</h4><p>
	Management made a wise decision when it made the move into this field; strategically, it is important to locally manufacture products that treat diabetes. Multinational companies stop supplying medication to countries in certain circumstances, which is where local manufacturers have to come in and plug the deficit. Julphar produces oral anti-diabetic products as well as insulin crystal, a major drug component in diabetes management. We established a state-of-the-art plant to manufacture the raw materials for insulin. It is a sophisticated manufacturing plant, and Julphar invested more than USD160 million in this facility, which can produce 1,500kg of insulin crystal a year. We are now preparing the registration dossier, which will cost another USD5 million. In order to continue to have a strong presence in the market, we undertook a number of initiatives to build on what was done in previous years. We have expanded our business to a new sophisticated area of medical devices with the launch of Dexcom G4 Platinum, the most accurate glucose monitoring technology. With this revolutionary, real-time continuous glucose-monitoring device (CGM), diabetic patients can easily and conveniently monitor their glucose level around the clock for better management of their diabetes.
</p><h4>
	What is the direction for Julphar in the coming year?
</h4><p>
	It is important to maintain our double-digit growth for both revenue and profit values. We will also work on another initiative to strengthen our portfolio by adding new products, increasing the number of licensed products from multinational companies, and opening new countries; it is crucial for Julphar to be the first in the market and gain the highest market share. The third initiative is to establish biotech and bio-similar products, such as insulin, erythropoietin, and epotin. There is a plan to add more biotech products to our portfolio. We want to increase our presence in Africa, which remains underserviced by many companies, in spite of the huge population and wealth in some countries. The presence of our manufacturing plant in Ethiopia will facilitate our presence in Africa. We have another joint venture project in South Africa with a local partner to create new business model that will increase Julphar's business there. We are proud that Julphar distributed more than 400 million packs all over the world carrying “Made in UAE." </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAK Hospitality Holding signed an agreement with American Kona Grill to open six restaurants across the UAE. What is the reason behind this move?</h4><p>Hakaya Collection, our lifestyle division focusing on entertainment, leisure, dining, and retail leasing, is an engine for company growth for multiple reasons. For our first venture outside the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, we chose to partner with a reputable and well-established brand rather than create our own. We have done this with the five home-grown outlets based in Ras Al Khaimah, and we thought it would be logical to take the business to the next level. Kona Grill is listed on NASDAQ, which was an additional attraction to choose this brand over other options. Together we agreed on a development and franchise agreement that is sustainable, feasible, and well thought out. We plan to open three outlets in Dubai, two in Abu Dhabi, and one in Ras Al Khaimah over a period of seven years and we are on track to open our first Kona Grill in the 1H2017 in Dubai. </p><h4>Would you consider further diversifying your portfolio?</h4><p>Our existing hotel assets are already in diverse locations; we have properties in the north and the south of the Emirate, the beach, the desert and the historic city center, right on the creek. As our portfolio is currently positioned in the luxury, upper upscale, and upscale market segments, we would potentially like to venture into extended stay, such as hotel apartments, and the mid-scale segment for leisure and business travelers. Jabal Jais offers a very natural platform for ecotourism and there are other significant attractions across the Emirate. There are plenty of development opportunities and we will identify the right ones at the right time.</p><h4>How does Ras Al Khaimah complement the tourism offering of Dubai and Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Even though each Emirate is promoted separately by its tourism authority, as a whole we offer compelling reasons to visit to a diverse clientele. Each Emirate is beginning to position itself accordingly, and Ras Al Khaimah has done the same. The reason our visitors come here is because of the Emirate's natural beauty and its sense of authentic Arabia. We are a unique escape for residents of the UAE as well; close to 50% of our business comes from the neighboring Emirates. We serve as an ideal destination for short breaks and family escapes to residents within the UAE. However, other nationalities choose Ras Al Khaimah for different reasons, such as longer but peaceful vacations or adventure tourism. One of the ways we complement the other Emirates is through our cultural and heritage attractions, such as the village of Al Jazeerah Al Hamra, where archaeologists are doing incredible work.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the tourism sector in the medium term?</h4><p>On the back of some terrific results last year with hotels reporting 6% growth in revenue per available room (RevPAR), 1Q2016 has been even more successful with RevPAR growth reaching 9.2%.  Our RAK National Hotels portfolio recorded an impressive 16% growth for 2015 and 16.4% growth for 1Q2016. These are quite impressive numbers and support our investment plans. We are on a growth trajectory and are extremely optimistic about the rest of 2016, but also for the years to follow because certain decisions and activities that came to fruition last year are expected to yield results in years to come. RAK TDA has set a target to reach 1 million visitors by 2019. Based on our numbers and the growth in the number of visitors we are experiencing month after month, we are confident that we will meet this target. Our supply is not excessive; a market is always made up of supply and demand. The pipeline of projects to 2019 is expected to add another 3,000 keys and from there, there is plenty of room for growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We owe a debt of gratitude to the State of Kuwait, and in particular Sheikh Thamer Ali Al-Sabah for his leadership and steadfast support. Furthermore, we are grateful to Kuwait for hosting this center, for being such a strong and valued NATO partner, and for its long-standing leadership in promoting regional security. NATO's Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) was designed to contribute to long-term regional security and stability. This center is a historic achievement, and NATO's first such presence in the Gulf region. We envision it to be a vital hub for cooperation between the alliance and Kuwait, as well as our other Gulf partners, including in our important fight against terrorism. We will work together in a range of different areas, including strategic analysis, civil emergency planning, military-to-military cooperation, and public diplomacy.</p><h4>How will this center strengthen the relationships between the ICI members and NATO?</h4><p>The security of the Gulf countries is directly linked to the security of all NATO allies. We face common security threats like terrorism, weapons proliferation, and cyber attacks, and we share the same aspirations for peace and for stability. Working more closely together than ever before is essential, and for that we have now developed individual cooperation programs with all our ICI partners, tailored to their specific security interests and needs. The NATO-ICI Regional Center in Kuwait aims to foster cooperation between NATO and ICI countries in the fields of the strategic and policy analysis, military-to-military cooperation, civil emergency planning, public diplomacy, and cultural awareness.  In addition, the Center will facilitate the implementation of our individual cooperation programs. It will also allow us to reinforce our level of interoperability, which will be key in responding together to future crises. Modern security institutions and well-trained local forces represent our best weapons in the fight against violent extremism. NATO has a long history of working with partners to project stability beyond our borders, including through enhancing the defense capacities of its partners. In addressing the most pressing security challenges of our time, we are much stronger together than we are alone, and that is what this NATO-ICI Centre is all about—deepening trust, building cooperation, and working together to make our nations safer. We are proud that NATO has a new home in the Gulf region and that we have opened a new chapter in our deepening partnership.</p><h4>What are the reasons for the establishment of this regional center, and why was Kuwait chosen?</h4><p>Kuwait has been a strong and dedicated NATO partner for many years and has been a driving force in building greater security and stability in the Gulf region. In 2015, we signed the NATO-Kuwait Transit Agreement to facilitate the transit of personnel and supplies to our NATO Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, and to make any future NATO activities in the region more effective. Back in 2004, Kuwait was the first country to join NATO's Istanbul Cooperation Initiative and also the first ICI country to establish the Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme with NATO. Today all four ICI countries—Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE—have these cooperation programs with NATO. This means that we will be able to step up our cooperation in many areas, including crisis management and the fight against terrorism; energy security; cyber defense; non-proliferation; defense against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons; maritime security; and civil emergency management. Our relationship with Kuwait and the other the ICI partners reached a new level last year, when all four countries opened diplomatic missions to NATO. On the sidelines of the opening of the Regional Center, we held a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Kuwait where we discussed regional security challenges and how we can work together to address them. As the Regional Center is the alliance's first such presence in the Gulf, it will be a vital hub for our practical cooperation. This is essential, because our security is directly linked. We have learned over the years that we are much stronger with allies and partners than we are alone. Because of that, I am extremely pleased that our cooperation with Kuwait and our other Gulf partners is reaching new heights.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Although education was the initial focus of the foundation, you are now reaching into other areas such as urban planning and development or health. What sparked this transition into other areas?</h4><p>Urban development, public health, and education are our three main focus areas, meaning that we touch upon the social aspect of research. One of the first linkages we created in our foundation was between education and health. We noticed a lack of real support in areas like depression, health, and wellbeing. Our mission is to improve social outcomes relating to those things. With urban development, a company approached us wanting to map the communities in Ras Al Khaimah. Since we found it interesting, we decided to go forward and it went quite well. There was no other research at that time on Ras Al Khaimah town, the city, and its livability. That linked back to education in respect to how the schools are based in the communities, and what kind of environment the communities are nurturing. We are interested in the use of public space and how these focus areas all work together.</p><h4>What were the most interesting findings of your research last year?</h4><p>We had a great medical health scholar on a Fulbright scholarship come in, and he was looking at medical tourism. The most interesting finding was the large amount of money that the UAE spent on sending patients abroad for health treatment, and in parallel to that how much is spent on bringing patients here for medical treatment. Another interesting study has been the development of space and the types of space worth preserving in Ras Al Khaimah. In education we are conducting a large study examining the impact of fathers' involvement in children's education levels and self-esteem. Those are just three examples but there are many others. </p><h4>Has any of this research resulted in practical implementation of the findings?</h4><p>The research we have conducted on male school dropouts has resulted in a pilot program in schools to help teenage boys. We also work with the local correctional facility because many of these at-risk boys actually end up in prison. Since then, we have been approached by a number of juvenile detention centers to help start establish similar programs for other young offenders. Having a dedicated focus on research in the area has promoted an increase in scholars approaching us to do more research on different topics, giving us leverage with organizations involving tourism and the municipality. While our work may not always have a direct impact on policy, it is working to address more and more local needs.</p><h4>In what areas will the foundation focus its research for 2016?</h4><p>We are going to look at the philanthropic sector across the region and how they operate. We also have a doctoral student coming to study art movements in the UAE and conduct research, which represents a larger emphasis on arts and culture. We also have our 5th annual fine arts festival, which showcases close to 100 artists from the region. Before this, there was not a place for people to gather together, and this event has attracted a lot of sponsorships from local businesses and has been a positive environment for the arts community. We have also awarded grants for research on nursery and early childhood education in Ras Al Khaimah, and another one looking at mangroves and some of the environmental impacts of development on the mangroves. These studies involve both physical and social issues. There is also a study in conjunction with the University of Sydney that will look at breast cancer and Emirati women. All of the previous work in this field has been normalized on US and Western populations but not on women in this region. They have done a lot of work at hospitals, and we will be working more on the awareness campaign and trying to pilot some studies for alternatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did RAK Academy manage to position itself as one of the pioneering schools in Ras Al Khaimah and the UAE?</h4><p>RAK Academy has established itself as a pioneer of high-quality private education throughout its 40-year history. It is the first private school in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah to offer co-educational, internationally accredited programs to a diverse and international student body. RAK Academy started with 40 students and now we have 3,410. The base of a good school is good teachers; therefore, a high quality of teaching and learning is at the forefront of RAK Academy. We have increased our standards of quality and qualifications for our teachers and have obtained accreditation from the Council of International Schools (CIS) and British Schools Overseas (BSO). We have adopted these organizations' key criteria to improve teaching and learning. We also develop student support services for a wide range of learning needs within RAK Academy, including English as an additional language. We find our students do not have a high level of ability to learn English so we have put this additional support in place. We adopt a new governance structure that deals with higher order matters, such as policy development, risk, and security. </p><h4>What have been the most notable changes in RAK Academy, especially taking into consideration the increasing number of expatriates and their changing demands?</h4><p>We now have three schools under one academy. The first school offers the British national curriculum (BC) from KG1 up to year six. We have a second school offering the Primary Years Program (PYP) and that goes from Pre-K up to year six. Both of these schools run at full capacity and they feed into our Middle School, which emphasizes the British model. That is followed by our secondary school, which offers both the advanced BC and the International Baccalaureate (IB). Students can choose between the BC and the IB programs. This is exciting for us because it enables our school to prepare both national and international learners. Students from Europe tend to do the IB curriculum.</p><h4>In what ways does RAK Academy prepare Emirati students to become leaders in the UAE's knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>We focus on offering world-class standards like AS/A Levels and IB diplomas, and on global citizenship so that UAE students understand different cultures and differences in people from around the globe. We give them the opportunities to engage in all sorts of extracurricular school events, such as sporting events, musical performances, art, and outdoor activities. We know our graduates are successfully practicing professionals in fields such as medicine, law, engineering, sciences, economics, business, and arts and humanities. Our graduates have already provided us with a second generation of learners because we have been here for 40 years.</p><h4>How has government's National Innovation Strategy affected RAK Academy and its curriculum for 2016?</h4><p>For years RAK Academy has adopted progressive policies and responsive models in order to meet the mounting expectations and ambitions of all its learners. In this light we believe our school is at the center of innovation and excellence, and at the heart of the community. With every learning cycle we revisit our strategic objectives. We learn from our collective experience and embark on refining our strategies to better meet the expectations of our learning community. We keep up to date with all the requirements from the Ministry of Education and, if there are any problems, we know they can be solved in discussion with the ministry.</p><h4>What can we expect from RAK Academy in the near future?</h4><p>We will open two primary schools, one in Al-Rams and the other in the Al Hamra area. We have already selected the locations and His Highness has approved them. Construction will start in June 2016. The schools should be ready for the new school year in September 2018. Moreover, we are upgrading and improving our facilities because we follow international standards and work toward obtaining ISO 9001 accreditation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the two main achievements of the university during these 10 years?</h4><p>RAKMHSU started with 22 students and now we have more than 1,200, representing 48 nationalities. Secondly, all our programs—dental, medical, and pharmaceutical and nursing undergraduate programs and master's in pharmacy and nursing—are fully accredited by the Commission for Academic Accreditation at the Ministry of Education. In such a short period of time, the level of growth that has taken place is enough to make anyone proud. It is really remarkable, and fortunately we are now also one of the most preferred destinations not only in the UAE, but also in the entire Middle East, for students who want to pursue the health sciences profession.</p><h4>How are you looking to develop and what aspects is the university focusing on?</h4><p>The main focus is to stabilize our academic programs, such as the curriculum, exams, and assessments, in addition to infrastructure. Initially we were in a temporary building, and in 2009 we moved to this building, and since then we have added two new blocks; one is the academic block and the other is a large sports complex. RAK College of Dental Sciences has its own state-of-the-art building. At RAKMHSU we believe that research is an important part of the whole spectrum of student and faculty life in order to acquire global recognition. Research is a must if a university wants to be recognized among top-ranking universities. In UAE, it is an area that is growing with more people recognizing its importance, even though the funding is one of the important requirements. We still make efforts to engage in research based on our budget and by establishing associations with other universities.</p><h4>What impact will the ministerial changes have on higher education?</h4><p>Fortunately, the UAE government has recognized the need for quality education that meets international standards. There is no confusion in that respect, so naturally whatever it is doing is in line with the strategy of maintaining quality of education.</p><h4>How would you evaluate RAK's current higher education regulatory environment?</h4><p>The Commission for Academic Accreditation is under the Minister for Education, which implements the accreditation process across the Emirates. There are some institutions that are outside the parameters of this Commission, for example institutions operating within the free zones. But in Dubai, for example, the authorities have come up with their own regulations for institutions in the free zones. All academic institutions outside the free zones must go through a process called the Licensing &amp; Accreditation process. We apply to the commission, it sends a team of international experts to undertake an assessment, and then it gives its approval to start the program. We welcome all of these processes as they maintain international standards.</p><h4>Looking ahead, how do you see higher education developing in the next five years?</h4><p>Even in times of recession there are two things that tend to remain unaffected; one is education and the other is health. That is for the simple reason that parents know that they have to educate their children, even if they are struggling financially. No country is willing to allow either sector to fail, as both are vital to the functioning of society. Higher education has become a necessity and education is considered the most important tool to empower society.</p><h4>Considering the high level of competition that exists among universities in the UAE, what can RAKMHSU offer students?</h4><p>If we take into consideration that someone coming from Dubai bypasses three medical colleges, four pharmacy colleges, and three dental colleges, and still comes to our university, that means that we have something special. Our management is unique, honest, and transparent; there are no compromises. The students from 48 nationalities and faculty from 26 nationalities are living harmoniously and focusing on delivering quality education.</p><h4>Do you see a positive future for Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The main philosophy of HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member &amp; Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, who is also the chancellor of the university, is that unless you bring in expertise and quality education, the country cannot progress and the easiest and most effective way of empowering people is through education. He wanted to establish educational institutions that deliver quality education, which will also ensure that students do not leave the country seeking quality institutions elsewhere. These institutions are now available in RAK and, in fact, they attract students from abroad, too. This, in turn, has a highly positive effect on tourism and economy. For the last 10 years, tourism has increased considerably, and education is playing an important role in that. For example, once a student joins us from another country, eventually all the members of their family will visit. The scholarships from the Sheikh Saqr Program for Government Excellence (SSPGE), under the patronage of HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al Qasimi, to nationals who study dental, medical, and pharmacy programs, and the full scholarship for nursing from the Ministry of Health, are also helping to attract nationals to RAKMHSU. Thus, RAKMHSU is not just an academic institution; it is also playing an important role in social change, too. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has RAK Hospital done to become a medical tourism destination?</h4><p>The fact that the UAE is so centrally located works to our advantage. Building on that, we have taken several initiatives to put RAK Hospital on the global tourism map. People receive the best medical treatment offered in the West at a fraction of the cost. One feature that makes us unique is our perfect blend of hospital services and hospitality traits. We offer spa services, quality rehabilitative care, a concierge service, and a homely and welcoming ambiance that complements the natural beauty of Ras Al Khaimah. Moreover, we also offer health packages specifically designed for medical tourists to make their travel arrangements and stay more comfortable and hassle-free. Today, RAK Hospital receives patients from 10 to 15 countries. Generally, patients visit the hospital for surgical procedures for heart or neuro surgery and joint replacement as well as rehabilitation. We have partnered with Swiss brand Sonnenhof Swiss-Health Ltd, one of the world's oldest medical tourism destinations, to boost our offering of premium healthcare and hospitality. We are now in our eighth year of operations and see more than 700 outpatients. Now we are at full capacity and moving into the next phase of expansion, in which the hospital will add 80 to 90 more beds in 2017.</p><h4>What else can be done to promote Ras Al Khaimah as a medical tourist destination?</h4><p>A physical presence in other countries makes a great difference. RAK Hospital, for example, has offices in more than 10 countries to help convert that potential. Ras Al Khaimah is already a popular tourism destination, so the focus should be to combine the medical expertise offered in the Emirate with promoting it as the place to relax and recuperate. More importantly, we should work to make RAK self-sufficient in terms of providing services to medical tourists, and already we can see that happening. For RAK Hospital, it is a bigger challenge because we are still new in the UAE healthcare sector. Having said that, there is no denying that we have made giant leaps and carved a niche for ourselves. </p><h4>Why are you moving into specialty care?</h4><p>While RAK Hospital has always contributed towards public healthcare, we have identified specific areas where we can support the community even further. Our specialities include cardiac, orthopedic, diabetes, rehabilitative, and eye care among others. There is a need to address each of the related ailments individually since we see a rise in all these health concerns among the UAE population. We have tried to keep a holistic approach towards all of them and brought in various campaigns to create awareness among the population.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for pharmacies and medical centers?</h4><p>We will open the first pharmacy in Dubai soon and also explore the feasibility of opening a few hospitals in the region. However, we want to cater to the demands of the UAE first before exploring options in Oman, which likewise has huge potential and undersupply.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the UAE healthcare sector?</h4><p>The UAE healthcare sector will boom for the next 50 years and the country will become a major player on the world map of medical tourism. Given the right mix we offer—JCI accredited hospitals, top-notch medical and technological expertise from around the globe, convenient strategic location, easy visa access, and logistical arrangements—we have the infrastructure to move in the right direction. The Dubai airport sees more than 2,000 patients every day who transit from here to other medical tourist destinations. Why not treat them here? The scope is tremendous. </p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are doing well and are working on a number of expansion plans. Currently we focus on attracting more international patients. We also want to open in new markets such as Pakistan and Afghanistan as these countries have health issues that we have solutions for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the Al Nuaimi Group start?<br></h4><p>The group had its humble beginning as a transport company in 1974. It was founded by my father, Abdullah Al Nuaimi, and in two years he diversified the company by venturing into civil construction and then to ready mix concrete production and supply in 1976. The group established itself in the construction industry directory of Ras al Khaimah and the Northern Emirates for its quality works and business ethics. Road works and civil construction are our strongest performers. However, all our companies in each segment perform well against their competitors in Ras Al Khaimah, the UAE market, and the GCC. Road works is our strongest division, but construction, ready mix, and piling are also great performers.</p><h4>What plans do you have for expansion beyond the GCC?</h4><p>In 2016 we remained conservative, preferring to wait to see how the market develops. We expanded into Egypt two years ago but had to halt our expansion due to the situation there. Also, we are seeking prospective clients to enter into the African market, either in the form of a joint venture or project management system. We still maintain our division in Saudi Arabia and Oman; we have achieved 70% of our targets in these two countries and aim to reach these targets by next year. In Saudi Arabia our operations are positive, regardless of the obstacles we face there. The authorities are great and we are doing well. The ready mix division in Saudi Arabia has become as strong as in the UAE and Oman.</p><h4>Are you currently working on any construction developments in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>We still have the Flamingo Extension 68 Villa by RAK Properties and a police complex project in Digdaga, where recently we cast the raft foundation of 2,000 cubic meters of concrete. We have a contract for 30 villas for the ministry, which has expanded to another 10 villas, and potentially another 58 on top of that. We have a construction contract for a showroom for some private businessmen and one prestigious private villa, and Khorfakkan Court was just assigned to us. Recently we signed a contract with RAK Municipality for a new slaughter house with modern amenities in the Al Ghail Area.</p><h4>How would you assess the current infrastructure development in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah was not affected by the recession of 2008 due to its stability and growth. The Emirate is blessed with natural resources, rich minerals, and the sea. There will be a great deal of development in the tourism sector but it needs to be planned and directed in a systematic way. Stable is the adjective I would use for Ras Al Khaimah, and I expect steady growth. The possibility for further development in Ras Al Khaimah is huge, as the tourism sector is showing positive signs and the Emirate has become a favorite spot for national and foreign tourists due to the balanced climate and value-for-money facilities. Waterfront apartments and hotel projects are in the pipeline on newly developed islands like Falcon Island and Al Marjan Island.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>We seek to be competitive with our prices for public-sector projects to not only maintain our workload but also to assist the government to do its job effectively. We are one of the few companies in Ras Al Khaimah that covers many segments in the construction sector. We still expect growth in 2016, though last year was much better. There are many key projects that the government will launch in the near future and we want to be a part of them, attaching our name to them. The development projects declared in Al Murjan Island and Mina Al Arab at Cityscape 2016 gives us and the construction industry in general a boost of confidence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAK TDA has a mandate to develop the Emirate's tourism infrastructure and its branding overseas. How did RAK TDA develop a strategy for this?</h4><p>When I joined RAK TDA I hired a research company to do expansive consumer research for Ras Al Khaimah on our key source markets and future targets. We then commissioned Mckinsey &amp; Company, Hay Group, and TBWA, and subsequently launched our new strategy in January 2016. We launched our new marketing campaigns based on Ras Al Khaimah's new branding, which positions the Emirate as a destination that is available to all, but with a focus on three main segments. Firstly, we want to focus on those who are seeking adventure and want to take advantage of our mountains and natural attractions through activities such as zip-lining in the mountains, diving in the sea, and desert safaris. The second segment is people who want to connect with local Emiratis and learn about its culture, heritage, and history. We have over 18 historical sites, some of which date back 7,000 years. The third segment is wellness seekers. We have the natural Khatt Springs, which have curative properties, and a number of spas.</p><h4>How does strong air connectivity and quality service complement Ras Al Khaimah as a destination?</h4><p>We cater to the middle market, which is where we want to position Ras Al Khaimah. The airport works closely with us to achieve the right sort of connectivity to help us reach our growth targets. In 2016 the Emirate had 820,772 visitors and our target for 2017 is to reach 900,000. We have set a target of 1 million visitors by end of 2018. The airport has signed a deal with Qatar Airways that connects us to 170 destinations, but the key focus remains Europe and Russia. Similarly, the airport also cooperated with Air India to further develop the Indian market. That has become our fourth-largest market, with fantastic growth of 28.1% in 2016. Russia is our number three market with an increase of 19.5%. Germany remains Ras Al Khaimah's top market with a growth of 24.6% even though the total number of outbound tourists from Germany has only grown by 3%. This means we have managed to capture a higher share of the German market compared to other destinations. Most of those arrangements involved co-marketing, so we put up dollar for dollar to market Ras Al Khaimah as a destination.</p><h4>What investments and infrastructure need to be developed to meet your 2025 target of 3 million visitors per annum to Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>There are two aspects, the first being supply, or hotel rooms and accommodation. The second aspect is demand generators or attractions. We do a combination of investing in attractions and also invite partners to invest with us for others. We work to our strengths and focus on culture and heritage, adventure, and wellness experiences. This will differentiate Ras Al Khaimah and allow us to complement the offerings of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the other Emirates. Ras Al Khaimah's increasing hotel and resort portfolio is expected to grow by more than four thousand rooms over the next three years. Targeting one million visitors by the end of 2018, we revealed during ATM 2017 the latest hotel signings to accommodate increased arrivals to the emirate. Attracted by continued high occupancy levels and growing RevPAR rates, in addition to the cost of land in Ras Al Khaimah being lower than in neighboring destinations, RAKTDA has announced an anticipated 4,445 new rooms to open over the coming years, ranging from three to five star properties. We seek to pitch some key factors to investors considering Ras Al Khaimah. Firstly, we are the fastest-growing destination in the UAE and the region. Secondly, we recorded a 10% increase in hotel occupancy throughout 2016, reporting an average of 71% from January to December, and an average hotel occupancy of 75% in the first quarter of 2017.  We are also confident that the demand generators we are building here will help drive our target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been RAK Properties' landmark projects?</h4><p>RAK Properties was established with the vision of HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi. At the time of inception we were seeking AED1 billion, but when we announced it, the demand far exceeded our expectations. Everyone wanted to participate and we reached AED56 billion. We discussed this with His Highness and we decided to aim for AED2 billion and return the extra money back to the investors. After that, we registered our company on the Security and Commodities Authority in the UAE because it is a public shareholding company. Our first projects were the Julphar Towers, where our offices are located, and Mina Al Arab, our biggest project. We started with the infrastructure of Mina Al Arab and the first phase of villas and apartments, which cost approximately AED1 billion. The plan at that time was to spend about AED10 billion on Mina Al Arab. There are about nine hotels planned along the coast together with a big mall in a specific area of the development as well. Unfortunately, by the time we were going to float a tender for these projects, the economic crisis hit in 2008. By that time, we finished and launched the first part of Mina Al Arab. Now we have around 2,500 units completed to date. Furthermore, around this time, we finished the RAK Tower development in Abu Dhabi, which was sold completely.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the market for eco-themed mixed-use projects such as Mina Al Arab in RAK?</h4><p>These types of properties are ideal because Ras Al Khaimah has not previously had high-quality buildings, gated communities, or mixed-used developments. So we decided to build hotels, malls, high-class villas, and medium-class apartments. The only difficulty we had was during the financial crisis. Otherwise, whatever we launched at that time was sold. The demand was high before 2008. After the crisis, we changed strategy and decided to follow market trends, which was affordable housing. Moving forward, we hope that the domestic real estate sector will continue to improve, although there are many economic difficulties and instability in the region. And yet our country is different because of the great infrastructure. We have almost 200 nationalities living peacefully, and there are no problems. We have around 10 million visitors to the UAE every year. In Ras Al Khaimah, we have a different topography from the rest of the UAE because we have the mountains, the sea, and the sand dunes. We are also close to Dubai, just 45 minutes away. All this adds value. Also, we have a well-established free trade zone authority and it attracts many investors. All this encourages us to pursue new projects.</p><h4>Why have you decided to expand beyond Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The UAE is a unified space and the Emirates complement each other. Whatever we do in Dubai or Abu Dhabi complements Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>What trends have you identified that will affect your approach to future projects?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah is a rapidly growing tourist destination, which is why we need to increase the number of hotels. I wish I had started hotels eight years ago. Another factor is that high-end homes are at the point of saturation. Mid-market houses are in demand now. There is demand in the high-end market, but people want beach front properties. The majority would like to have an affordable apartment or villa, so that is what we are now taking into consideration. Also, maybe people look for the quality of shops in the area that add to the destination, like Tim Hortons, Starbucks, and so on. It adds value to your projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been RAKDCA's aims and ambitions for the past few years?</h4><p>RAKDCA is the governing body responsible for overlooking all aviation-related matters in the Emirate; therefore, our main focus is on the safety, security, and regulatory aspects of aviation. We also concentrate on maintaining the highest standards of quality under the guidance of the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). We work with all of the RAK Government departments in order to create synergy for the promotion of the Emirate.</p><h4>RAK Airport is planning to start construction on its expansion in 2017. What will the expansion entail?</h4><p>RAK, under the vision and guidance of HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah and Member of the Supreme Council, continues to see strong growth in both the commercial and tourism sectors. The statistics reflect a huge air travel market existing in the four northern Emirates and Ras Al Khaimah is leading this growth with the largest market share, at over 44%. In line with this growth, RAK Airport is experiencing increased activity, therefore we will invest in its infrastructure development; including a new cargo terminal, passenger terminals, duty free shopping, corporate aviation areas, and security facilities to meet our customers' needs. We want to build six new aircraft gates, increase the number of check-in counters by 70%, and expand the retail space by at least 40%. The expansion projects follow a 26% increase in aircraft movements of scheduled flights in 2015. Furthermore, cargo business at the airport grew 51% in 2015, while passenger traffic increased by 17% over 2014. We believe there are strong business opportunities and prospective routes between Ras Al Khaimah and several overseas destinations with promising loads and yields.</p><h4>RAK Airport is expanding its routes through new airlines. What prospective airlines will fly from RAK?</h4><p>At the moment, Air Arabia is using RAK International as a hub, and it has increased its flight frequencies to the 10 destinations it serves from the Emirate. Air Arabia connects Ras Al Khaimah to the rest of the world on short to medium haul routes. Moreover, it is also planning new routes from RAK International in 2016 across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. New charter operations also started from Germany, Poland, Latvia, and Russia in 2015. RAK International also signed new deals for maintenance, repair and overhaul as well as aircraft decommissioning during 2015. In terms of new airlines, Qatar Airways started its operations in February 2016, and with this we intend to attract more tourists and connect the Emirate to long-haul destinations. Finally, Air India Express is the latest in the growing number of carriers to be operating from RAK International Airport to India. This is a massive service to the growing numbers of Indians residing in RAK.</p><h4>What does the future hold for RAK's aviation industry?</h4><p>As we see unprecedented growth, the challenges of providing secure and safe skies will be our highest priority at RAKDCA. The aviation markets in the UAE and around the world are innovating constantly, and we are preparing ourselves to welcome operators who demand the very best in service, safety, and security. In conjunction with Air Arabia we are establishing a regional market that has now gone on to international markets with the addition of Qatar Airways. This will promote other carriers to base their operations out of RAK Airport, as we offer convenient, cost effective, and efficient solutions without any time delays. RAKDCA is committed to providing safety and security to all these carriers as this is their prime objective. Not only that, we are committed to partner with tour operators and hotels in the region to welcome tourists from around the world. We have provided services to charter companies with special rates and coordinated with hotels in RAK to provide extremely competitive rates for crew and passengers. HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Ruler of RAK and Member of the Supreme Council, has provided exceptional leadership, vision, and clarity to action the development in and around RAK. This has been further complimented by the dynamic and young leadership of HH Sheikh Mohammad bin Saud Al Qasimi, Crown Prince of the Emirate of RAK. His Highness the Crown Prince has catapulted the growth and development factors in and around RAK by focusing on state-of-the-art technology for the aviation sector, service industry, e-government, and overall ease and comfort for the visitors to this great Emirate. As the operators grow, we will see more hotels, resident hotels, shopping malls, government departments, free zone activity, and many other elements bringing growth and forging an emirate of choice in the process. We are geared to be considered among the best cities in the world and look forward to making our great nation proud. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is there an awareness of the importance of integrating tech into business in Saudi Arabia, and how are companies embracing the changes that technology brings?</h4><p>The maturity of the market is clear to all vendors, and that is why people have started investing here. The majority of businesses have realized that without technology, without digitalization across their operations, it would be difficult to sustain and continue growing in this market. As a result we are no longer trying to educate the market on the importance of technology. Instead we are talking about how to acquire and adapt technology, and how to utilize it to the maximum benefit of your organization. There is a clear connection now between technology, transformation, and economic diversification. The digital economy is at a mature stage in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How is this relationship between digitizing processes and job creation playing out in the Kingdom?</h4><p>While it looks like there is a conflict between being more productive and getting more jobs, the fact is that there is not. Examining the relationship from an economic perspective and looking at productivity per industry, what is needed are more highly trained people to take new roles. The government is moving to other industries to make them more productive, but also to train more qualified and able people. Opening a new stream of business for government and industry helps both and improves the productivity of the overall economy, which creates new jobs, especially for Saudi youth. You cannot have productivity without job growth. The government-backed Saudi Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020 aim to have half a million new jobs open by 2020, and at the same time it is pushing hard for technology, especially digital. We do not see any conflict because the technology helps create new industries, and to benefit from the global trends that are driving job creation across the planet.</p><h4>What kind of public sector projects are you involved in?</h4><p>We are working on many projects today in the public sector. We have projects with the General Authority of Zakat and Income Tax, and many others, but individually these are not the most important part of our approach. What is key is that we have a vision for this market and a plan for the next 10 years. This market will continue growing in the digital sphere. Growth is not the issue here, the issue is how to build capabilities and make them available for the benefit of the economy and to put the right investments on the ground. We realized that the government would like to leverage SAP solutions but it needs to have it in the country. It is not willing to put critical data outside the country. We understand that we have the best solutions, but need to be localized to work best for the government. We also see a lot of industries that are evolving and transforming by innovating here in Saudi Arabia. For example, in the oil industry, they have their own patents. They need software support, but not outsourced support. We have built a center for it in Saudi, and as part of this effort, we have created a digital hub. We have to be humble, and have to admit that there are other smart people in the market who can add value to the economy and help it to transform. We created a digital hub for them, which is a platform that enables them to put their ideas and then we develop it together and make it available to the economy. This platform is open to anyone. In summary, we created a platform that provides solutions; we created a localization team just to ensure that all local regulations are respected so the government does not need to go and customize things; we created a co-innovation center to allow a space for companies to build solutions together along with SAP; and we have opened the platform for the rest of the IT community so that they can give their ideas and help us. This hub can and will transform the business.</p><h4>Are you pursuing projects in the healthcare and education sectors?</h4><p>When it comes to healthcare, what the government is trying to do now bring the expertise and productivity of the private sector through public private partnership. The regulation and supervision of that sector and of complex partnerships could not happen without digital technology, without a company like ours. We are moving in the right direction, gaining ground in the sector because we came with the experience from other markets and are helping to build these partnerships between the public and private sectors. This will save the government a lot of money, but that does not mean we lose business there. In fact, healthcare was one of the best sectors for us last year. Regarding the education sector, while there were not many initiatives from the government in this sector last year, we see strong potential. There were initiatives on education in the private sector, and hopefully the partnership between private and public sectors can also happen for education as it has for the healthcare sector. However, the transformation of the education sector will begin in the coming years, and we are poised to develop solutions there as well.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2017?</h4><p>We have already made the investments that will fuel the next phase of growth. We have created a full-fledged digital hub, a big investment from our side. We started last year with cloud services for STC, which now provides SAP solutions to business through its platform. We need to shift our capabilities to the next level in 2017, as we anticipate growth with more leveraging of digital technology and more investment up front. We are making major investments this year to build this hub, train people, and make it ready for the government to leverage. We are building a global hub, which will serve not only the country, but the Middle East and Africa as well. So, we need to keep the activity up and build capabilities so that we are in a good position as rapid changes in the Kingdom continue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Al Hamra Real Estate decide to focus on the high-end segment?</h4><p>The Al Hamra group was established to help develop the residential and hospitality offering in Ras Al Khaimah. Through Al Hamra Village, which is today a flagship project not only in Ras Al Khaimah but in all of the northern Emirates, the real estate arm of Al Hamra Group quickly established itself as a premium lifestyle developer. We saw a need for quality homes and in a natural and serene setting that would offer value to investors and homeowners and developed a community that offered all those at an exceptional value. We have who people from other Emirates that have chosen to live here and commute to other Emirates.</p><h4>What is the state of your flagship project and what projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>Al Hamra Village itself is over 77 million sqft in size, it is set along the shores of the Arabian Gulf, and is anchored by a championship golf course, state-of-the-art marina, several hotels, a shopping mall, more than 1,100 villas, and nearly 2,500 apartments already completed and delivered. The latest project within the community is Bayti, a selection of town homes with three or four bedrooms plus a limited selection of large, six-bedroom villas. We have started handing these over to our investors and new residents are moving into their new homes. We have plans for an international school, which is in the tendering stage. We currently have more than 91% of our land bank in Al Hamra Village fully developed.</p><h4>What is Al Hamra Real Estate's growth strategy?</h4><p>We have a strong hotel portfolio and we have two flagship shopping malls in the Emirate, Manar Mall and Al Hamra Mall. We are solidifying Manar Mall's position as the number-one mall in the Northern Emirates by undertaking a major expansion and doubling its size. Al Hamra Mall will also be looking at further expansion as it becomes more and more popular with shoppers, tourists, and retailers alike. Finally, we have some of the best hotels in the northern Emirates. Waldorf Astoria Ras Al Khaimah, Hilton Al Hamra, and the Ritz Carlton are all a part of Al Hamra's portfolio. We will look at expanding our hotel offering in line with the tourism growth plans of Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>What is your outlook for RAK's real estate sector?</h4><p>Clearly we are bullish on the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah and that is where we will continue developing further products. Every report that we look at with regards to our GDP growth and tourism gives us confidence that we will have steady growth. In Ras Al Khaimah we do not go through the big peaks and troughs like some primary markets here; it has always been steady. Our rents are continuing to go up and this year we have seen rental values increase between 5 and 8% and that is low for us; usually it is around 15% or so. One of the drivers of this is the lifestyle offered here. For example, even today for the price of a one-bedroom apartment in a nice place in Dubai you can buy a three-bedroom villa on the golf course, so it is a choice of lifestyle.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are continuously looking for new opportunities. In a real estate project a new announcement or a new project cannot happen spontaneously. We make sure that we go through all the details before we make such announcements. That is one of the reasons we do not go out and make announcements on projects of thousands of units; we control the supply of what we are putting out in the market, therefore we are able to complete what we have announced on time and on budget and that is the reputation we have built for ourselves so far. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Al Marjan Island's unique investment environment?</h4><p>At the moment there is a diverse portfolio of hotels, hospitality, and leisure assets in Al Marjan. We have ambitious growth figures, one of those being 8,000 keys for the whole of Al Marjan. So far we have around 1,500 operational hotel rooms between three hotels; Hilton DoubleTree, Rixos Bab Al Nahr, and Al Marjan Island Resort and Spa, which is managed by Accor. That figure, by itself, is already impressive considering that we have been operational for only two years. An example of investor confidence is the Hilton DoubleTree. Only one year after its opening in January 2014, it decided to open another piece of land to develop an additional 240 hotel keys in order to reach 700, meaning a 44% increase in just one year. No international brand will undergo this expansion unless it is sure about the destination in which it is investing. International brands believe that they have to be early birds in the Al Marjan development before someone else catches it.</p><h4>How are you attracting foreign investment to Al Marjan Island?</h4><p>We are transparent in everything we do and say in order to enable investors to make sound decisions. We adopt this transparent strategy towards our potential investors so that they know exactly what the rate of return is. However, we also believe that we need to drive the market ourselves, and for this reason, we also develop our own products. This way, we can also lead by example. We have a good business model that can make investors trust us; they can visit our products and they can feel confident about Ras Al Khaimah as a whole. The strategy is simple; we create value for our existing investors and they demonstrate this generated revenue value to other potential investors. We believe that the strategy we are working with is the best and we are focusing more on roadshows in China, Russia, and Europe, so we seek investors from those areas to enhance the existing ones. Currently, on Al Marjan Island, we have different types of investors. We have investors from the UAE, the GCC, India, Pakistan, the UK, and the Czech Republic, amongst others.</p><h4>How will Al Marjan Island complement the future of RAK's tourism industry? </h4><p>In Ras Al Khaimah, we do not promote ourselves to an investor as a short-term cash flow generator, we promote ourselves as a long-term value creator. We invest in the full master plan of Ras Al Khaimah and not just on Al Marjan Island as a development, so that is why we are selling a business opportunity in the Emirate and not just Al Marjan Island. There is a strong direction from HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, to develop Ras Al Khaimah as the leading destination for authentic culture, tradition, and adventure. Ras Al Khaimah aims to attract around 2.5 to 2.9 million visitors by 2025 and, in order to do so, it needs around 15,000 hotel keys to be developed and 8,000 of them have to be in Al Marjan Island.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>There is great potential to expand projects. Many eyes are focused on Al Marjan Island, not only from the UAE but from abroad, too. We noticed that there is demand from prestigious international hotel and hospitality brands in Al Marjan Island, and they are asking us to enhance the interaction with international stakeholders and investors in order to create partnerships with them. This way they can both benefit, whether it is as an international hotel brand or a foreign direct investor. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2010 all the ports in RAK were brought under the umbrella of the Saqr Port Authority. What was the reasoning behind this? </h4><p>This was to streamline the management and increase efficiency and profitability. Saqr Port and RAK Maritime City were already profitable but the other ports needed to be improved.</p><h4>What is the importance of Saqr Port for RAK and the wider region?</h4><p>The port was constructed in 1975 to serve RAK's quarries. Today, it is the biggest bulk port in the MENA region by far and throughput is about 55 million tons per year. Around 80% of that is composed of aggregate products and the remaining 20% falls into the other products category. These are being exported to various parts of the world, including the Gulf, but mainly to areas with a high level of ongoing infrastructure projects, like Kuwait, Qatar for the World Cup, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and India, amongst others. We also import products, such as coal, to serve the industries here in the northern Emirates, and all the fuel for the northern Emirates' petrol stations. Our business is predominantly the export of commodities derived primarily from the quarries here in RAK.</p><h4>What regulatory changes should be made to boost RAK's maritime industry?</h4><p>RAK's maritime industry already has a bright future. I do not see any need to change the regulatory procedures as everything runs smoothly. Saqr Port, RAK Maritime City, and the other ports are operating profitably but we are definitely exploring various diversification options, especially in light of the downturn in oil prices.</p><h4>Can you outline the Emirate's port facilities and their expansion prospects?</h4><p>We have five ports. Next door to Saqr Port we have RAK Maritime City, a free zone from which we lease parcels of land to major companies. Then we have Ras Al Khaimah Port as an extension of RAK Maritime City, which is for vessel repairs, warehouse storage, and part of it is a free trade zone. Al Jazeera Port is predominantly for shipyard repair, cargo, and cross quay work. Then we have Al Jeer Port, which is currently dormant, though we expect to open that in the next few months for marine, leisure, and small cargo vessels. With Al Jeer Port, we embarked on an expansion program to develop one or two deepwater berths. The output of the quarries justifies expanding the capacity and catering to much larger ships. We also seek to revitalize the container industry by bringing the import and export of containers back to RAK and hope that will come to fruition in the next 12 months. At RAK Maritime City we have made an agreement with a company to construct a large fertilizer plant. It will import the product, manufacture, and then export. We also explore the possibility of a refinery and a large tank farm with various partners at the moment. RAK Maritime City sits on 6 million sqm of land. 3 million sqm of that land is surrounded by exclusive access to the quayside, which is full, while the other 3 million is earmarked for large projects, tank farms, refineries, fertilizer plants, and a power station.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>As far as RAK Ports is concerned, it will be another successful year, and we will achieve the targets that we have set for ourselves. We predict growth this year to be 3 or 4% higher than 2015. Over the last 10 years growth at this particular port has more than doubled, but we can only grow within the current constraints. When we complete our new berths and boost capacity, growth will speed up again. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do prestigious clients such as Emirates, Etihad, and Virgin America choose you as their preferred manufacturer?</h4><p>We have a strong reputation now, but of course we did not at the beginning. It was a cold start as no one was familiar with our name or brand.  We were convinced that there was a need for a professional company that could build crew training simulators and offer local support to the “golden triangle" of Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways, three very large and powerful airlines that were previously being serviced by companies based in Germany and the UK. I felt that if we set up our operations here and stayed the course we should have a good future. This strategy appears to have worked.</p><h4>Why have companies from other parts of the world, such as Virgin America, decided to use your products instead of those closer to home?</h4><p>Firstly, we are focused on composites as this was our core business. Commercial aircraft have traditionally been manufactured from aluminum, but today they are manufactured from composites. Right from the beginning we were manufacturing simulators using the latest composites technology whereas our competitors in Europe and the US were using steel and aluminium. This gave us an advantage—it enabled us to be more creative and allowed us to innovate. On the other hand we had no government support or bank facilities. As it was a question of survival we just had to work harder.</p><h4>Recently you signed an agreement with L-3 Link UK Ltd for the supply of full flight pilot simulator sub modules. What does this mean for Spatial Composite Solutions?</h4><p>Our cabin crew training demand has always been contract based, which is not continuous business. Until now, we have never really been able to plan or discuss with our bank what our order book would look like for the following year or beyond. The contract with L-3 Link UK Ltd is a five-year renewable contract. We will build modules for pilot simulators exclusively for L-3 Link UK Ltd, but we will not be involved in any sales and marketing activity. We will build the units to L-3's specification and that work will be ongoing. While the profit margins are modest, this type of business gives us continuity. It allows us to put long-term plans and new procedures in place. It has given us a backbone of stability and enables us to look to the future with confidence.</p><h4>How is Spatial Composite Solutions implementing state-of-the-art technologies into its products?</h4><p>We decided in the early days to buy some quite sophisticated equipment including a five-axis CNC that we ordered from the US. Prior to issuing an export license we had an inspection visit from a US government official who advised us that the piece of equipment we had ordered was classified as a precision instrument, which apparently requires State Department approval before it can be shipped from the US. We were later advised that the device has “nuclear capability" and this was what triggered the interest from the State Department. When we made this investment I was worried whether we would have enough business to justify the outlay; however, it turned out to be one of the best decisions we ever made.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have witnessed the expansion of our manufacturing facility as well as our human capital. My challenge is to manage the expansion and new people whilst ensuring we can still retain what has made us special until now. Our business in the US in particular is growing apace, and we will announce some significant new contracts there soon. For an SME in Ras Al Khaimah to be in this position is a long way from where we started and is something we would not have thought possible in our early days. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Guardian Glass decide to start operations here in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>This plant came about in 2007, at a time when the UAE was experiencing a construction sector boom. Guardian Industries Corp. and its partners, The National Glass Manufacturing Company (Zoujaj) and Eastern Company for Industrial Investment Ltd, chose Ras Al Khaimah to expand capacity and meet our customers growing need for glass. Today, Guardian glass can be found on many iconic projects around the world, including the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab in Dubai, the clock tower in Makkah, and the Yas Viceroy Hotel in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Where does Guardian RAK focus its exports?</h4><p>Around 45% of our production stays in the UAE, with the next largest countries being Oman and Qatar. We ship to 44 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, and we currently ship over 200 containers of glass per month to the US. We are supported in the region by another Guardian JV plant in Saudi Arabia. We leverage this plant in the UAE by having access to the ports nearby, so we import materials right into our port in Ras Al Khaimah. At the same time, we ship out containers through the Jebel Ali port to Africa, the Far East, Japan, or New Zealand.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>Our culture and vision are focused on creating value for our customers and society and we constantly innovate to improve the value we create. We are one of the world's largest producers of high-quality, high-performance glass, supplying best-in-class products and services to our customers. When countries such as the UAE or Bahrain launch their building initiatives, we are ready with our products and we make sure that our employees are also ready to rise to the challenge. Guardian is at the forefront of technology. At Guardian's Science and Technology Center in Michigan, award-winning scientists are continuously working on new products. Our new Guardian SunGuard® HD Plus glass series, now being produced with a new coater in Saudi Arabia, is a direct result of listening to what our customers needed in the region.</p><h4>How has Guardian adapted its products to the climate conditions in the GCC?</h4><p>The new vacuum magnetron sputter coater at our Saudi Arabia plant—the first of its kind in the region—is an example. New regulations require buildings to maintain minimum insulation properties, only achievable with coated glass. Guardian's high-performance, energy-efficient products provide unsurpassed insulating properties to facade glass. Guardian coated glass products can also support the newly formed Saudi Energy Efficiency Center and its mission to reduce energy consumption. This new coater allows Guardian to develop and produce coatings to meet these specific requirements of the region. Customers in the UAE and across the region depend on Guardian Glass for products that not only make living in such climates more comfortable, but also more energy efficient. Architects across the region use Guardian Glass products in order to meet building codes without compromising their architectural objectives.</p><h4>What is Guardian RAK's strategy against the region's current economic slowdown?</h4><p>We have seen some challenges domestically but, as a global company, we have many options, and Guardian RAK has many customers outside the region. We ship our glass to more than 44 countries. Guardian has 25 float glass facilities like Guardian RAK around the world and our sales and marketing teams are always looking for new ways to create value for our customers.</p><h4>How do you see the future of the glass industry in the Middle East and the UAE?</h4><p>It is still strong in the UAE, and we see that projects are moving fast. Our customers are constantly asking for shorter delivery times.  In the Middle East, where intense sunlight and high temperatures are a fact of life, coated glass is becoming an essential building material. Guardian is prepared to meet the needs of the region for high performance glass. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most pressing environmental challenges concerning RAK at the moment?</h4><p> The major environmental challenges, which are presently faced by Ras Al Khaimah, are environmental protection and development, pollution control to mitigate environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change, encourage sustainable use of natural resources, and educate people about environmental awareness. The Environment Protection and Development Authority-Ras Al Khaimah (EPDA-RAK) was established in 2007 to achieve the goal of a clean and healthy environment and sustainable socio-economic development in Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>Quarry crusher and cement production are the major industries in RAK. What measures does the EPDA implement to control crushers and quarry activities? </h4><p>The EPDA-RAK inspects and monitors regularly the operation practices and management of quarry and crusher industries and enforces the regulatory guidelines for environment protection and conservation of natural resources in and around the industry, for example, all quarries and crushers establishments must have an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) from the Ministry of Environment and Water (MEW) and thereafter an Environmental Licence/Permit issued by EPDA-RAK following the approval of their Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) reports and other requirements. These industries are instructed to keep dust and noise control systems like hangers and curtains, bag-filters for dust collection and encapsulation devices in place during the crusher operation and maintain air quality parameters within the prescribed limits. The quarries and crushers in RAK are the most eco-friendly in the UAE in terms of compliance of environmental regulations.</p><h4>The hospitality sector is booming in RAK. What is EPDA doing to control the impact of the hotels on the environment? </h4><p>With the increasing socio-economic activities in RAK, the tourism industry including the number of hotels is also increasing and adding to the environmental stress. EPDA-RAK has been working with the hotel industry to find solutions to environmental issues concerned with the environment protection and development in accordance with the recommendations of the UAE Federal Law. The aim of these initiatives was to produce environmental awareness about pollution control measures, sustainable use of water and electricity, waste management and conservation of flora and fauna. The hotels are cooperating with us in the implementation of our recommendations. </p><h4>RAK is known as the industrial Emirate, and many manufacturers chose to base themselves here. Does that make it more difficult for the EPDA to achieve its targets? </h4><p>Industrialization is the key to economic development but it also causes environment pollution and increased consumption of natural resources like water and energy. Now we have many scientific, technological and economic solutions available to deal with the environmental problems we face. For example most of the industrial activities in RAK are restricted to three industrial parks/economic zones away from the residential area, which keeps most of the pollution concentrated in that area. This also makes the task of monitoring, controlling and managing pollution easier and effective by EPDA-RAK and the industries management. In this way EPDA has expertise and experience to deal with the environmental problems associated with the industrial and economic development in the future also.</p><h4>Has the work of hte EPDA been recognised, and what are the department's areas of priority for the year ahead? </h4><p>EPDA was awarded the Best Government Department Award in 2014, as well as the Best Department Award consecutively in the year 2013, 2014 and 2015, which is something we are very proud of. Our key aim is to cope with the environmental problems associated with the industrial and economic development of RAK. We are currently developing our capacity terms of work place expansion, infrastructure, such as e-services, work force, and expertise to meet those demands. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAK Ceramics realized solid growth in 2015, accounting for a 10.2% increase in annual profits at AED310.3 million. What were the key highlights of 2015?</h4><p>It was our 25-year anniversary in 2015 and we have much to be proud of. Over the last 25 years we have helped to create icons, build marvels, and our products feature in some of the most iconic buildings in the world. In 2014 the board approved a Value Creation Plan (VCP) designed to streamline our business and unlock hidden value for our shareholders. In 2015 we continued implementing the VCP and have started to see positive results. We invested in our core businesses through capacity expansions for sanitaryware in the UAE and Bangladesh, by doing so strengthening our focus markets in the UAE, GCC, India, and Bangladesh.</p><h4>Are there any untapped markets around the globe?</h4><p>The focus markets for us are the GCC, India, and Bangladesh followed by value markets such as Europe, MENA, and Northwestern Africa. Other markets where we see opportunities are the Americas and Russia. These are important markets where we are selling but do not yet have a strong presence.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Iran?</h4><p>We invested in Iran before the sanctions were imposed and the investment was financed by the World Bank. Iran has an abundance of raw materials, energy, and manpower, and is the fourth-largest ceramics market in the world. Since the sanctions have been imposed, we have scaled down operations to adhere to the required regulations. However, we have a long-term vision for the Iranian market both domestically and as an export center once the sanctions are lifted.</p><h4>How can the ceramics industry implement innovative practices and how is RAK Ceramics doing so?</h4><p>From the beginning we aspired to have the best machinery, the latest technology, and produce the best products for sale in the world. During the 2008 crisis RAK Ceramics was among the least affected and we continued to invest in new technology and were the first factory in the region to introduce digital printing. This allowed us to enter many new segments at the time such as marble, stone, and different surfaces. Technology and innovation are at the heart of our philosophy and we have continuously led the way in terms of product innovation. We are now one of the largest ceramics manufacturers in the world and have evolved from being a manufacturer of functional ceramics' products to becoming a comprehensive producer of ceramics lifestyle solutions</p><h4>What mechanisms is RAK Ceramics using to mitigate the current economic and geopolitical situation in the region?</h4><p>In 2015, we experienced a 10.2% growth in annual profits and in 1Q2016 we have also grown by another 10.8%. However, there is no doubt that the geopolitical conditions are not the best. As a company, we have always followed market diversification. Our strong presence in the UAE is driven by innovation, new products, reliability, and quality, and we are gaining an increase in market share over our competitors</p><h4>How has RAK ceramics contributed to Ras Al Khaimah's economic development?</h4><p>We are raising the flag of the UAE all over the world. We employ 15,000 employees globally and over 8,500 of them live in Ras Al Khaimah.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>In the short term we will remain focused on the VCP and will continue to exit from non-core and non-strategic assets such as contracting activities and non-profitable businesses. We have already successfully completed many initiatives and the VCP is unlocking value across the business. We will continue to focus on expanding our core businesses and streamlining operations. In particular, expanding our high-margin sanitaryware and tiles businesses in the focus markets of the UAE, India, Bangladesh, and Europe; developing improved integration across the business; streamlining our distribution networks; and unifying our brand positioning globally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the link between Stevin Rock and RAK Rock? </h4><p>Stevin Rock was founded in 1975 as a 100%-owned subsidiary of Dutch company Volker Stevin until it was acquired by our new parent company, Dragomar, S.P.A., in 1990. That year we formed a joint venture to support the building of the Ras Laffan Port in Qatar, for which we supplied 5 million tons of material. In May 1996, the government of RAK purchased Stevin. Until then, RAK Rock and Stevin Rock were two separate companies that competed for projects. RAK Rock remained loyal to its code, which was to supply raw material feed to the cement plants, even though both Stevin Rock and RAK Rock are owned by the government. In October 2007 we discussed the unification of the management of our companies, although the companies remained technically distinct for various strategic reasons.</p><h4>What are Stevin Rock's landmark projects?</h4><p>We were involved in all the megaprojects in Dubai, such as Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, the World Islands, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Metro, Dubai Mall, Dubai International Airport expansion, JBR projects, Dubai Festival City, and Jebel Ali Container Terminal, amongst others. At the moment we are involved in projects such as the Upper Zakkum project, SARB, Das Island by ADNOC, Small Boat Harbour, and the new LNG terminal project in Bahrain.</p><h4>What are the main export markets?</h4><p>Around 25% of our production went to markets outside the UAE. In 2015, we were invited by the Qatari government to discuss supplying the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We signed a QAR1 billion contract, which would make us the largest raw material supplier to Qatar over the next five years, and we would supply around 40 million tons over five years. Along with that, we expanded our capacity, building a new crushing plant for AED150 million and expanded our harbor for AED30 million. We are now ready to commission our new plant to supply and support the Qatari market first and foremost. After India and Africa, we decided to expand into Europe. We are also the lead supplier to Bahrain and Kuwait. We supply the cement for a GCC-funded, USD5 billion housing project, and in Kuwait we supply limestone to a cement factory there. Our new target is London, and we are building a new deepwater berth for the purpose, which will help us halve sea transportation costs to London.</p><h4>How much importance do you attach to environmental standards and eco-friendliness?</h4><p>In our industry we have to practice the latest and best standards and look for the latest technologies all the time. Therefore, environmental control measures have accounted for around 10% of our capital expenditure over the last five years, during which time we have implemented and maintained an environmental management system that meets all of the requirements of ISO 14001:2004. We work in close cooperation with Ras Al Khaimah Environment Protection and Industrial Development Authority, including introducing across all our sites advanced dust extraction systems that prevent environmental pollution. We have also totally enclosed all primary, secondary, and tertiary crushers, as well as screens, conveyors, and product bins. As well as further improvements in encapsulation, 2016 will see the development of the fogging cannon spray system principle and the trial and subsequent use of wetting, foaming, and crustacean additives in dust suppression water.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We started our new expansion plans forecasting the demand of aggregates in the GCC and other Asian region. We expect to add a new production line, called crusher 22, producing 12 million tons per annum at the Khor Khuwair quarry. We are also expanding crusher 11, producing an additional 1.5 million tons per annum at Al Ghail quarry. There will also be crusher improvements and expansions targeting the production of an additional 1 million tons per annum at Kadra quarry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In October 2015, Utico and a Spanish energy firm, Grupo Cobra, announced the first private joint venture in the Middle East to build a USD195.7 million water desalination plant in RAK. How will this project contribute to the growth of RAK as well as the UAE?</h4><p>It is a project that has set a benchmark in terms of private water desalination projects. Governments, not private companies, have typically undertaken these kinds of projects, making it a first within the UAE. On April 19, we received a Global Water Award distinction for "water deal of the year," and that was in recognition of this project being uniquely and privately financed as an independent water project (IWP). This project has set a benchmark not only for the UAE but worldwide. Water utility demand always grows with the growing size of the economy and GDP as well as through un-served areas that were not yet on the grid. We have laid nearly 400km of network to access these un-accessed areas, which is further adding to GDP and demand. A third factor is how economical this project is. The retail cost of water is lower than the cost for government projects, and one of the reasons is that the government does not have to give a guarantee on this project. But the government of RAK has been very supportive in terms of facilitating the means for us to be able to achieve a project like this in terms of land and permits. Of course, there were no freebies, but when you follow the rules, everything is open and clear and efficient for everyone. </p><h4>Are you planning any similar projects in the region?</h4><p>We have signed a deal with Sharjah, where our transmission line is under construction with approval from the government of the UAE , and we have a water transmission and storage project between RAK and Sharjah. We also have the potential to add Umm Al Quwain and Ajman if required. The other projects we are working on besides desalination and transmission and storage projects include a solar power plant and a pumping station and storage for all the plants, not just this one. Our long-term aim is to have three days worth of storage, and what we are building now will provide two days worth of storage for our facility.</p><h4>What further regulatory changes would you like to see put in place to boost the industry and create fair competition?</h4><p>Fair competition has to be fair to everybody, and that is not easy. The most important thing is that the system is fair to the consumer, be it industry or individuals. The consumer has a responsibility not to be wasteful, whereas we have a responsibility in making sure what we provide is sustainable. At the end of the day, the government wants to serve its citizens, we want to run an efficient business, and consumers want to have access to healthy, sustainable, and affordable water. A complex calculation is needed, and we are trying to convince the government to take the necessary actions to bring this about.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2017?</h4><p>Even though oil prices are low, the fact that we can finance these projects on our own shows how strong our projects are and how strong our business model is. This model is here to stay and it will help governments to develop their water and power sectors in a different manner. We build without government guarantees, which changes the IWP development landscape. Government guarantees can lead to corruption because government employees know the government will pay the bill eventually for default and one can just pass it all down the chain. Guarantees can also lower the credit ratings of an Emirate or the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does your highest demand come from in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>When it comes to downstream customers, RAK Ceramics is our biggest, although we have a number of glass factories and other industrial users, as well as utility companies (both power and water), among others. Ras Al Khaimah is an excellent place to set up businesses in terms of the fiscal environment and labor and living costs. Having a reliable gas supplier adds to the extremely attractive proposition for industries establishing themselves here.</p><h4>What are RAK Gas' plans to start oil exploration in Somaliland this year?</h4><p>Somaliland is a wonderful region for hydrocarbons, geologically very similar to Yemen. The historic political issues still make it a very under-explored prospect. There are various international companies similar to RAK Gas, such as DNO and Genel, which are exploring there and are also excited by Somaliland's geology. However, it is early stage exploration, and the next step is to acquire some seismic data. We are working on a program to collect data with the government; we plan on collecting about 800km of 2D data, and after that we intend to drill a well in a couple of years' time</p><h4>Are there any other markets where you see potential to expand?</h4><p>We have built a very good exploration portfolio including Tanzania, Malawi, Egypt, and Somaliland. These are all excellent geological provinces with extremely high potential for finding oil and gas. But we want to find more oil and gas domestically so that we can expand our supply and further reduce the price of gas for our customers, so finding new fields and reserves in Ras Al Khaimah is our priority. At the same time, while oil prices are currently low, there is much potential and opportunity to pick up new assets in the international market.</p><h4>According to the International Energy Agency, the base of growth of the gas market is believed to be slowing down in the coming five years in the Middle East, despite being one of the fastest growing markets in terms of gas demand. What is your outlook on this and what can be done to speed up growth again?</h4><p>The demand for gas is very much linked to the price. If you can price gas cheaper than liquid fuels on an energy equivalent basis, or low enough so that you can compete with solid fuel, then the demand will go up considerably. It is a shame that despite the broader region having some of the biggest gas reserves in the world, and with gas being the cleanest burning and most environmentally friendly fossil fuel there is, the economics for some businesses still support coal importation. That is unfortunate, but that is what the market is. So the way to significantly grow demand for gas is by dropping the price.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are focused on bringing more exploration companies to Ras Al Khaimah, but exploration takes time, so in the meantime we are also looking to secure longer gas supplies from third-party sources to ensure a continued reliable supply for our customers. At the same time, we are open to other alternative sources of gas and we are very conscious that our customers are looking for cheap supply sources.  We are talking to a number of companies about different approaches. LNG and compressed natural gas are options, but we will see where the discussions end up, and they will in any case take more time. In the short term, Dolphin ensures we have a reliable gas source that meets our needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The local and regional banking sector is facing challenges due to lower deposits following lower commodity prices. How has that affected RAKBANK's operations as the country's largest SME lender?</h4><p>Undoubtedly 2016 has been a very difficult year for RAKBANK. Not only are we the largest SME lender in the country, but also close to 30% of our total book through 2015 was exposed to the SME segment. Even our retail portfolio had quite a lot of SME-related lending in it, for example personal loans to SME employees and auto loans to owners of SMEs. It has had a significant impact on our numbers with loan loss provisions rising sharply for 2016, as was the case in 2015. This was a deliberate strategy of the bank implemented around 10 years ago to move into SME lending as its predominant driver of profit. This is a strategy that has benefitted the bank for many years, but over the last two years SMEs have been running away from the country at a rate never witnessed before, even during the global financial crisis. Many small business owners were simply over-leveraged and, when economic activity slowed, they could not afford to repay their debt. With the lack of bankruptcy laws, the typical approach was to leave the UAE and perhaps work things out with the bank from their home country. Two years ago RAKBANK set out on a strategy to diversify its income base and of course it is difficult to do this in the midst of an epidemic within the SME segment, but our diversification strategy is beginning to work. That said, it will not be quick enough to make up for the challenges in the SME sector in the short term.</p><h4>What impact will the new bankruptcy law have on the bank?</h4><p>It is still too early to comment in terms of how effective it will be. My understanding from discussions with various experts is that the law is extremely well drafted. The challenge will be in the implementation because it is new and the technical and intellectual infrastructure needs to be developed, and the whole process, including the court system, needs to be aligned. It will take at least a year until it becomes effective in practice, but at least it is a well-drafted law by all accounts and has all the fundamentals. It is just a case of the system catching up and getting in line with it, but its implementation is certainly welcomed by RAKBANK.</p><h4>How has the bank's internal diversification strategy been rolled out?</h4><p>RAKBANK, by its nature, will always be predominantly a retail and small business bank. However, if we have a broader and larger balance sheet that is more diversified than our current one, then we should be able to do better throughout the economic cycles. A bank may not always maintain the same level of return on assets or equity, but generally in the longer term we should see a more stable profit position. One of the things we decided was to move back into wholesale banking. Our view is that, by YE2019, when our next three-year strategic plan commences, wholesale banking should represent about 30% of our book, compared to 8% at YE2015. We have also moved back into banking in Ras Al Khaimah over the last two years and have become more active in the wholesale and retail banking spaces because they hold good opportunities. We have the ability to meet people easily and it is only proper that RAKBANK should be the primary Bank in Ras Al Khaimah. It is good business and we have a natural advantage that we want to capitalize on now. The other big push for us is into mortgages. In the past our strategy had been high-risk, high-return lending, and clearly mortgages and wholesale banking do not fit that philosophy. The margins are lower and therefore growth is slower. Another by-product of that is we now require a larger balance sheet to achieve a similar level of return. Having said that, RAKBANK is still the best-capitalized bank in the country.</p><h4>How is RAKBANK's Islamic finance division performing?</h4><p>Islamic Banking in the UAE has to a large extent been more of a complementary offering. It has tended to be Islamic banks or banks offering Islamic services that match what they offer in the traditional banking space. We see an opportunity to develop unique products in Islamic Banking; for example, RAKBANK is about to launch a new Islamic product that has not been done in this market before and is something we do not offer in conventional banking. Even in the conventional space we have recently launched a new mortgage product and we will be developing an Islamic equivalent to in order to service all our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the structure of the company changed since it was established?</h4><p>Union was founded by HH Sheikh Tariq Al Qasimi 30 years ago. It started as one company and has since expanded to over 30, covering a diverse range of sectors. A few years ago we underwent a major restructuring, and today Union's portfolio consists of 10 performing companies that hold big potential for expansion and revenue. We have diverse investments, covering numerous sectors from transportation to hospitality, manufacturing, as well as real estate. In the transportation sector, we have shipping and logistics, and the focus of these companies are the 4PL solution or bulk chain supply management, which is a management solution for bulk material. Union has two types of companies involved in manufacturing; the oil and gas sector, including steel fabrication, and water plastic tanks and other plastic products. In F&amp;B, Union is a major partner for the Icons Coffee Couture brand with eight shops in the UAE and four shops in Qatar and Bahrain, with more shops coming in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. By the end of 2017, Icons is planning to have more than 20 operating coffee shops in the GCC region. Icons' brand is health-orientated organic coffee, which is already popular and the trend is starting to gain traction. Union also has a catering business providing industrial catering and event catering in the northern Emirates, serving around 45,000 meals per day. Real estate is one of our biggest divisions, from development to property management.</p><h4>Where do you hope to expand, geographically and sectorally?</h4><p>Our future expansion plans will depend on the sector. We have made a conscious decision to concentrate on the current market, but Union's next step we will be to move into the GCC, which is a natural growth area for our company. Our future expansion will be the in GCC, East Africa, and probably Turkey, depending on the situation in these places. Union is also considering the CIS and India as potential growth markets. We do not say no to any investment, but it depends on the investment itself. We are focusing on expanding through our 10 best-performing units because the market is there. Thus far, we have not ventured into the financial sector, but such a move is part of our strategy for the next five years. The health sector is another area in which we see huge potential, in particular health services such as rehabilitation and post-surgery services.</p><h4>Are there any specific requirements that a company must have before you invest in it?</h4><p>Union has stringent requirements. We invest in brownfield projects. Once the value of the product has been proven, we look at forming partnerships.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the future of the UAE economy and what role will Ras Al Khaimah play in that?</h4><p>Real estate in the UAE and the region will present huge opportunities for the next 10 years. There is a comprehensive government plan in place to transform the UAE from an oil-based to a knowledge-based economy and this will require a great amount of infrastructure and investment. For Ras Al Khaimah, this will translate into a greater focus on industry, related services industries, and the infrastructure to support both. Out of the 11 cement plants in the UAE, seven are in Ras Al Khaimah. Much heavy industry is located here, including RAK Ceramics, which is one of the biggest ceramics manufacturers in the world. There is a long-term vision in place that will take us to 2020. A lot of people think that 2020 is the end point, but for us that date is just a milestone and we will keep improving and moving forward far beyond it.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>For us, 2016 was the beginning of the rise. Several projects were put on hold because of low oil prices, but with prices recovering we are expecting those projects to progress. Toward the end of the year we'll not see a total recovery but continued improvement, and I believe this trajectory will endure until 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have been taken to increase the quality-of-life satisfaction levels of the residents of Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>In the last few years RAK Municipality has taken serious steps toward the development of the quality and lifestyle of Ras Al Khaimah. The mandate of RAK Municipality is to be in charge of all the municipal affairs related to people's quality of life. This starts from day one until the end of construction and maintenance. We are also in charge of public health and the development of initiatives and infrastructure proposals, in association with Ras Al Khaimah's Public Works and Services Department. Ras Al Khaimah Municipality, in the last few years, has managed to accommodate the requests of people, whether it is for local Emiratis to have their own plots and build their own residential units or monitor the development of serious infrastructure projects related to the quality of life in the Emirate. These projects are not being done just by RAK Municipality but we also act as the facilitator for these projects; from getting proper land allocation to facilitating processes, while ensuring that the necessary quality assurance and standards are implemented at the same time. We get the best use out of the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah. If we focus on town planning, for example, we have done a lot of neighborhood community design. For example, we have allocated around 2,000 plots for local Emiratis that will be developed by the Sheikh Zayed Housing Program. In terms of accessibility, the Municipality, in coordination with the Ministry of Infrastructure Development, is working on the RAK ring road and other highways that will connect Ras Al Khaimah to other Emirates. Ras Al Khaimah ring road is 85% complete and is expected to be opened in 2017. It will immediately connect Ras Al Khaimah to the 611 and Emirates Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed E311.</p><h4>What are the biggest projects that the Municipality is involved with at the moment?</h4><p>There are a lot of projects, such as Etihad Rail, the housing programs, and our own small local housing in different areas. Because we are the master planner we are the owner of the land bank and therefore in charge of everything because our role is to coordinate the process together to manage integration and ensure it is used in the best way. We think on an overall perspective about how the city will look in 10, 20, and 50 years and what we need, as a municipality, to improve, protect, and revitalize. Ras Al Khaimah has grown on the back of planning and vision, and our role as RAK Municipality is to translate the vision of His Highness for Ras Al Khaimah into reality through the implementation and integration of all entities' visions together in one platform.</p><h4>What do you think Ras Al Khaimah needs to evolve and boost its economy further?</h4><p>In the near future, the free zones and industrial areas will grow due to increased connectivity and we expect developments in the real estate and tourism sectors are going to have a great impact on Ras Al Khaimah's GDP. The Emirate will develop as a diversified economy through different segments; industrial zones, free zones, technology parks, real estate, tourism, manufacturing, cement, ceramics, and pharmaceuticals. All these developments are going to create job opportunities and people will move here, for which you need infrastructure, connectivity, and accessibility. This is how we plan our development; we phase it, we monitor it, and then we implement it. Our goal is to meet the requirements of the people in a contemporary manner that fits the requirements of the future. We focus on quality of life, happiness, the attractiveness of the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, and the look and feel, ideas, initiatives, and innovations; these are the main elements that we focus on as a municipality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fitch gave RAK an 'A' rating with a stable outlook for both the short and long term. What is the main factor behind the Emirate's impressive economic performance?</h4><p>The Emirate's biggest revenue stream is not from oil but from the export of construction materials to neighbouring countries. This is one of the main reasons why RAK enjoys a stable economy. Although some GCC countries are cutting back on construction costs, the demand for construction goods is still high, plus the Emirate also exports to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The diversified activities within RAKIA and RAK FTZ are also a strong indicator of Ras Al Khaimah's diverse economy, as well as the development of the hospitality industry in the recent years, which substantially increased the number tourists coming to the Emirate. Both RAKIA and RAK FTZ plan to further support this strong position by embarking on major infrastructure advancements that will help bolster the influx of investors.</p><h4>What makes the Emirate such an attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Ras Al Khaimah has a strong trading heritage, which continues to this date through continuous infrastructural and economic developments. Today, RAK poses one of the most ideal investment destinations in the region, and made the list of top-10 small- and medium-sized global cities of the future, among the likes of Edinburg and Zurich. What is great about the Emirate is its cost effectiveness. Costs are lower here, from operating a business to living in the Emirate. Another important factor is business friendliness. RAK is very business friendly and follows clear and transparent regulations that lessen the bureaucratic requirements that have to be fulfilled by investors. The connectivity of the Emirate to the world's fast-growing economies is also a key asset as well as the premier residential places and schools. Overall, Ras Al Khaimah provides convenience to foreign investors, offering them everything they need to grow their business and at the same time, live a comfortable life away from home. What is even better is the high level of collaboration between RAK FTZ, RAKIA, and other government entities to further ease doing business and ensure the smooth establishment of new companies. For example, our Government Services Department in both RAKIA and RAK FTZ works efficiently with RAK Immigration to quickly issue all types of visas, as well as with the RAK Chamber to help clients easily acquire Chamber of Commerce membership. We also have a great relationship with RAK Municipality. In fact, late last year, RAK FTZ signed an MoU with the municipality that helps us quickly grant licenses to our clients. All organisations are working as one, and this is the kind of culture that foreign investors can greatly benefit from.</p><h4>In terms of your medium-term plans, what are some of RAKIA and RAK FTZ's major upcoming projects?</h4><p>This year, with RAKIA, we are set to begin master planning the Al Ghail Industrial City project. It is a business environment that will occupy 24 million sqm of land. Labor accommodation will also be built in Al Ghail Industrial Park, as well as warehouses for light industry and logistics use. The same units will be built in RAKIA's Al Hamra Industrial Park. Improvement of the road networks in both industrial areas is also in the pipeline. Additionally, we will construct a new commercial building and inaugurate a one-stop shop location that will house all RAKIA's services. As for RAK FTZ, we will also be doing more infrastructure developments to help provide a healthy growth environment. We will be opening another one-stop shop physical location for the clients' convenience as well as continuously enhancing the infrastructure of RAK FTZ's Industrial Park and construct new warehouses in the Technology Park. The warehouses will feature a showroom where manufacturers can store and display their products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What characterizes RAK FTZ?</h4><p>RAK FTZ is one of the fastest-growing free zones in the UAE. It is characterized by cost-effective and flexible business solutions that perfectly suit the needs of different investors. RAK FTZ was established by an Emiri decree in 2000 with a mandate to provide custom-made business solutions to aspiring entrepreneurs and expanding international companies. Currently, we are the proud investment destination for more than 8,600 international investors from over 100 countries and over 50 industry sectors. We offer our clients a full range of incentives, which include a stable and tax-free business environment, ready-made facilities, award-winning client support services, fast-track issuance of visas and licenses, as well as quick and easy business set-up. RAK FTZ is a business-friendly environment that presents immense growth opportunities across its four free zone parks, which include the Business Park, Industrial Park, Technology Park, and RAK Academic Zone. Moreover, RAK FTZ provides the same advantages as other free zones such as zero taxes, 100% ownership, no restrictions on capital and repatriation profits, and freedom from customs duty. What sets us apart from other free zones, however, is that we offer all of these at an economical cost. RAK FTZ also uniquely allows the construction of labor accommodation on site to help eliminate the cost of labor transportation. Being situated in Ras Al Khaimah, our investors can enjoy operating a business and living in comfortable housing at a cost that is 25-50% less than in other Emirates.</p><h4>How will your strategic partnership with RAK Municipality help boost the competitiveness of the Emirate?</h4><p>RAK FTZ actively enters into various strategic partnerships with international and local government bodies. The MoU between RAK FTZ and RAK Municipality covers various partnership activities and commitments that focus on improving the free zone's services to its existing and potential clients. It will speed up documentation and license approvals, issuance of no objection certificates for food, veterinary and cosmetics industries clients, as well as the adoption and registration of RAK FTZ's new properties. The MoU will also let RAK FTZ gain access to the governmental land database in order to utilize unused government-owned land for investment in different industries. Our partnership with RAK Municipality will further boost the business-friendliness of not only the free zone but of the Emirate in general to international investors. Time is very important, especially for investors. When they hear of a place where they can save time and money, and at the same time get access to high-quality services and facilities, it immediately draws their attention. With Ras Al Khaimah's different government agencies working hand in hand, investors will surely flock to the Emirate.</p><h4>In which countries do you see a special interest for Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The free zone has been actively sending delegations all over the world. Last year, we went to several countries around the world to present the unique business opportunities offered in Ras Al Khaimah and the UAE. We visited Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Australia, India, Pakistan, China, the UK, Jordan, France, and Germany. All of these have been very successful but we particularly saw major potential for China and Europe. In fact, we have conducted five roadshows in China in 2015 in the cities of Foshan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Zheijang, and Beijing. Our international offices in Turkey and Germany help us focus on attracting European investors as we see high demand and enquiries coming from the region. We have built a solid global presence through our international offices. Aside from Turkey and Germany, we also have a regional office in India, which is also one of our most important markets. We continuously see many Indian investors coming to register in Ras Al Khaimah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What attracts industries to Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The low cost of production, great location, access to manpower, and government support encourage investors, as they can market their products all over the world at convenient prices. Pricing is one of the most important issues, because it allows the factories to compete with other companies. Here in Ras Al Khaimah they can produce at low cost and high quality. It is easy to get a license to open companies and this can be done quickly, as can connecting the facilities to water and electricity. Everything is much easier than it is in other places. Some companies receive a license in one day, and here at RAK DED you can renew your license in 15 minutes. It is easy to contact the decision makers and explain your future plans. HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, encourages officials to ease administrative procedures for customers and open their doors wider in order to be in direct contact with customers, investors, and other interested parties.</p><h4>How has the drop in oil prices affected the export of construction materials?</h4><p>The oil price has affected not only Ras Al Khaimah, but all of the world. However, everyone must still invest in the construction. Construction is an intrinsic part of any country's development, so there will continue to be demand for those products. In times of crisis companies are given the chance to look for alternatives, to find a new market for example. If a company bought from me before and then it buys less I will have to look for somebody else, so there is potential to break out and find new markets.</p><h4>What markets outside the UAE and GCC offer potential for Ras Al Khaimah's businesses?</h4><p>Asia is one of the best markets as well as Africa. We are targeting developing countries that have large populations and where we can easily take advantage of the low prices of our raw materials and products.</p><h4>You recently received a delegation of Latin American diplomats. How did this visit come about and what can Latin America and RAK bring each other?</h4><p>There is already some trade between us and some Latin American countries, and there is potential for more. These are still small numbers but we are trying to increase them. As I mentioned before, during tough times countries have to seek new markets. South America has a large population and many products to export; we are trying to explore new channels of mutual commerce and industry as well as opportunities for re-export. Some of our manufacturers open factories in Latin America because there is good potential, and there are raw materials that we can bring here. Latin America exports all over the world, so why not boost our relations with it?</p><h4>How do the operations of the DED align with the federal government's long-term policies?</h4><p>We are all under one umbrella. The advantage here in Ras Al Khaimah is that we are flexible with our procedures. At RAK DED, we are trying to reduce the number of processes for investors to get a license, and to be closer in tune with investors' concerns. In the near future we will have new mobile applications available on the Apple App Store and on Google Play. Through this app clients will be able to do many things, like renewing their license or changing or opening a new license. We have already presented this project to His Highness Sheikh Saud, and he gave us the approval to start this in Ras Al Khaimah. It will connect all of the people who have licensing in Ras Al Khaimah and this district. It will also have other features such as location services, a job search engine, business networking capacity, and advertising. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Due to protracted commodity price declines, the UAE has been reducing overspending. How can the UAE find the right balance between holding back public spending and maintaining healthy economic activity?</h4><p>The UAE is facing a similar challenge as other states in the region: maintaining economic activity at a time when spending needs to be adjusted to reduced oil revenues. That being said, the UAE is in a better position than many other countries because here you already have a more diversified economy. The non-oil economy is driven by factors like trade, tourism, and finance. The UAE has to continue with the strategy of relying primarily on the private sector to drive growth at a time when the government is going to have to scale back big construction and other projects. The UAE growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 2.5%, which is above the GCC average. However, there is a distinction within that between the parts that are driven by oil and the parts that are not.</p><h4>Higher government revenue would create much needed room for fiscal maneuvering. What steps should the UAE take to increase tax revenues?</h4><p>We have been of the view that the UAE, and GCC countries more generally, all need to begin to develop non-oil based revenue sources. Among the most important instruments is the introduction of a VAT, which could be put in place in a coordinated way throughout the GCC. This could generate about 1.5% of additional GDP based on our experience in other countries. So that would be a positive step. It would also be useful to explore whether some sort of low rate of corporate tax can be introduced. There are two things you need to consider in the GCC and UAE; these countries have substantial buffers they can draw on and do not have to make dramatic adjustments in terms of cutting back spending, raising taxes, or trying to reach a balanced budget overnight. That's why we think it is a perfectly sensible approach for the UAE to run fiscal deficits as it tries to adjust only gradually to the new realities of oil prices. In doing so, the authorities have to be careful about how they finance those deficits, because if you finance the deficit disproportionately from the domestic banking system, you could create liquidity shortages in the banking system, which may then have a knock-on impact on credit availability for the private sector at a time when you want the private sector to be more active. So instead it may make sense to draw on your assets and also borrow internationally. These various financing options need to be balanced. </p><h4>According to the WTO, the UAE has maintained its position as one of the top trade economies worldwide, reaching a trade volume of AED1.5 trillion in 2015. How can the UAE help counter the weakening of worldwide trade?</h4><p>It can help counteract the slowdown in global trade by being at the cutting edge of efficiency, speed, and cost. It is going to be a tougher market for trade, because world trade is not growing at the same pace. The UAE has a good geographical location as a point for transit trade, but there will also be competitors. The UAE has to stay at the forefront and keep its edge, which has been the formula for its success so far. It has to keep ahead of the curve, keep moving forward, and keep innovating. There is no space for complacency, because margins will be pushed as competitors grow and become more efficient. The UAE's diversification plans are indeed already quite advanced and the economy well diversified. The key for the UAE, but also for other oil exporters in the region, is to keep thinking outside of the box and in terms of finding ways to foster diversification and to develop the non-oil economy over time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, the UAE has delivered nearly half of the foreign aid budget to developing projects in Egypt. How crucial has UAE aid been in stabilizing Egypt and promoting development?</h4><p>Egypt and the UAE have always shared special and close relations at both official and popular levels. Today, ties between the two Arab nations are developing on all spheres at an unprecedented rate and are considered as a model upon which inter-Arab relations should be styled. Strong bonds of friendship with UAE's leaders HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan,  HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan have reflected on the growing political and economic ties between both countries, and as a result the UAE ranks high among Arab and foreign countries investing in Egypt. Cultural ties between both nations are also reaching new horizons, in light of the common social and cultural heritage both peoples share. During recent years, the UAE has become one of Egypt's most important strategic allies as well as a key development partner. This was demonstrated by the stance taken by the UAE following developments in Egypt in the past few years and the support it has pledged to Egypt's stability.</p><h4>The New Suez Canal opened last year. Has Egypt seen much interest from the UAE to develop special economic zones near the canal, like Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, which have developed efficient business-friendly centers of industry?</h4><p>Boosting the contribution of the industrial sector to Egypt's economic growth has been one of the key components of our development strategy over past years. The Suez Canal corridor is one of the most prominent projects in Egypt. In November 2015, we launched the first phase of the Suez Canal Area Development Project. The project envisages the promotion of special economic zones and industrial areas. Work is now underway for the infrastructure in the area to turn it into an international investment destination, a global logistics hub and an industrial center for the new Egypt. As an integral part of this vision, the government is currently reviewing the special economic zones law to improve the tax and investment incentives offered to investors in these zones. The UAE was at the forefront of countries showing interest in this ambitious project, given its commitment to supporting Egypt's comprehensive economic and social development process as well as its successful experience in managing special economic zones. The Emirati interest in the Suez Canal project started early in phase one, where Abu Dhabi's National Marine Dredging Company was instrumental in delivering the New Suez Canal on time, leading a consortium of four of the world's largest dredging contractors. Momentum has now switched to Phase II of the project, the new special economic zones, which offers a huge opportunity for the UAE, particularly the private sector, to set up industrial parks and logistics hub. I met with several groups of Emirati businessmen and investors in recent years and they showed great interest and commitment to increasing their investments in Egypt, and we are currently cooperating with them in order to translate this interest into tangible actions and projects that would be of mutual benefit for both sides.</p><h4>How do you envision future relations between Egypt and the UAE?</h4><p>We seek to develop and further advance the already outstanding relations both countries share at all levels to serve our common interests. At the bilateral level, Egypt and the UAE will continue to strengthen the political, economic, cultural, and social ties that have been established since the UAE's independence in 1971. There is a large Egyptian expatriate community in the UAE, which has positively contributed to its development and modernization process during the past decades, and many Emiratis have a strong affinity to Egypt, where they have received their education at Egyptian universities and enjoyed some of Egypt's most attractive tourist destinations. The political leadership in both countries is interested in seeing these relations further prosper and flourish to serve their mutual and regional interests. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon's economic growth is projected to double in 2017. How does the Ministry evaluate these prospects?</h4><p>The prolonged crisis in Syria continues to dominate Lebanon's outlook with losses exceeding USD13 billion to date as per the World Bank estimation. Moreover, growth has been subdued due to further pressures on the economy's depleted infrastructure, the chronic trade and fiscal deficits, and the lack of public and private investment. However, the major political breakthrough of the presidential election of the president and formation of the government will again help boost the confidence in the economy and spur growth to return to the levels registered between 2007 and 2010. Moreover, we see consumer and investor sentiment improving alongside the inflows of tourists and capital. However, the country can witness major positive improvements only if structural reforms are implemented. These reforms are aimed at improving consumer and investor confidence, boosting economic growth, accelerating deposit flows, and strengthening financial stability. These reforms include those that reduce infrastructure bottlenecks (mainly through the adoption of the PPP law), enhance the business environment for Lebanese enterprises to grow and create jobs, and encourage investments in sectors where Lebanon holds a comparative advantage.</p><h4>What initiatives is the ministry taking to protect those sectors considered at-risk, such agriculture or industry?</h4><p>The Protection of National Production Legislation and that was adopted in 2008 governs the international commercial practices that cause injury or threaten to cause injury to the domestic industry or agriculture in Lebanon, or retard the establishment of such industry or agriculture, specifically when a given agricultural or industrial product is being dumped, or subsidized by the governments of the exporting authorities. This legislation is also applied on increased imports that cause serious injury or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry or agriculture in Lebanon. As a result of the investigations taking place, measures could be taken to protect domestic industry in the form of additional tariffs for a limited period of time. As such, this anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguard mechanism is used to protect any Lebanese sector or product at risk from the increased imports.</p><h4>Trade accounts for 27.5% of the country's GDP, with the main partners being Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. With all the instability in the region, what steps have been taken to improve Lebanon's balance of trade?</h4><p>The Ministry of Economy and Trade is developing a strategy aimed at balancing trade flows with new and existing markets such as the Mercosur, Africa, Iran, Russia, and others. Our aim is to work toward decreasing the gap between our imports and exports. As such, several studies and research are being undertaken to identify the products with export potential to these markets of interest. Some these products include wine, olive oil and agro-industrial products, jewelry, fashion, crafts, and ICT.</p><h4>How is Lebanon's accession to the WTO progressing?</h4><p>The process is being expedited technically as per the roadmap agreed on with the WTO. In fact, the technical team at the ministry is finalizing the accession package, including the goods and services offers that will be circulated to WTO members in preparation for a working party meeting that is expected to take place in May. It is important to note that we are engaging with all relevant ministries and stakeholders to make sure that Lebanon's best interests are sustained and that offers are prepared meticulously to avoid as far as possible any obstacles or misunderstandings in the future process.</p><h4>The Ministry is working on a law that will encourage insurance companies to merge by giving them subsidized loans. What are the main highlights of this law?</h4><p>The law is still a draft; however, it is in its advanced stages. We at the Ministry of Economy and Trade encourage these mergers, as we believe they would enhance the capital of companies and consequently enhance their ability to compete locally and regionally. The insurance sector is an important sector and the ministry will undertake all the necessary measures to achieve its constant development and growth.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our priority is definitely to build on what has been done in the previous years and mainly with regards to undertaking the necessary procedures aimed at protecting the Lebanese consumer, attracting FDI and spurring exports, enhancing SME development, and mitigating the impact of the spillovers of the ongoing Syrian crisis. With regard to consumer protection, we believe that a well informed and a well-protected consumer is critical to a strong and stable economy. We will continue to enhance and stress on the very important role played by the Directorate of Consumer Protection at the Ministry. On the FDI and exports level, our goal is to enhance the business climate to encourage investments and trade and the movement of capital inflows. This will mainly be done by strengthening current relations and establishing new ones by opening up to new non-classical markets to trigger investments and spur Lebanese exports. This comes in addition to improving market access through the participation of Lebanese companies in international exhibitions through agreements with partner countries. With regards to SME development, we will undertake the needed steps to ensure the implementation of the National Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprises that was launched in December 2014. This will allow for job and growth creation. We are organizing roundtables, joining major stakeholders and tackling important topics in this regard and covering all the regions in Lebanon. And last but not least, the ongoing Syrian crisis has had tremendous spillovers on our economy, and as such our goal is to mitigate them as much as we can. Work will be done through the inter-ministerial committee, the LCRP whereby the needs and budgets have been identified, the international committee support and interventions are extremely crucial for the attraction of the needed funds to cover the developmental issues of Lebanon such as infrastructure projects, strengthening the public sector institutions and implementing reforms, besides humanitarian and relief activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) is experiencing strong growth both in the tourism and manufacturing/industrial sectors, driven by significant levels of foreign investment. What are the key factors that make RAK an attractive destination for foreign capital?</h4><p>First and foremost, Ras Al Khaimah has a long history of both political stability and social harmony, accompanied by a track record of policy consistency guided by the principles of economic openness, modernization, and diversification. These are vital because they provide fundamental building blocks for development and prosperity, and are the first things foreign investors examine when they choose a location for their business. We continue to build upon these intrinsic strengths of the Emirate by offering an attractive investor-friendly environment with rule of law, no taxes, and an easily navigable administrative system. The World Bank Doing Business study, published in April 2016, ranked RAK the 45th most business friendly place in the world out of 190 countries surveyed, well ahead of all other GCC countries. This is a testimony to the success of our ongoing efforts to create the best physical and legal infrastructure for industries of all kinds to thrive in this Emirate.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where do you see potential future FDI into RAK coming from?</h4><p>Given our geographical location and fundamental institutional strengths we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of investment inflows from the advanced economies of Europe, US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, as well as from emerging markets in Africa. Investors from developed countries tend to find the aforementioned combination of our low cost base, light administrative burden, and exemption from taxes highly compelling. Investors from the Subcontinent and lesser-developed parts of the world are attracted by the rule of law, political and social stability, and high-quality infrastructure. That said, We continue to diversify the economy, and are conscious of the necessity of having a diversified pool of investors. From our point of view, Asia is under-represented in the Emirate and through more highly targeted awareness campaigns we can attract more firms from Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea.</p><h4>There is a high ratio of expatriate workforce in all major sectors of RAK's economy. How does the Emirate ensure that young Emiratis are given the opportunity to engage in RAK's economic growth? </h4><p>RAK's economic growth and development is all-inclusive, but at the same time we pay close attention to the needs and conditions of our young population. Education is the key element of our strategy to empower local young people. We have several programs aimed at developing entrepreneurship and raising the level of technical skills, which complements our initiative to develop SMEs. Over the past ten years a number of educational institutions have been established in the Emirate, such as AURAK and RAKMHSU, and having these institutions here enables local students to obtain tertiary education in a number of disciplines at an affordable price without having to leave the Emirate.</p><h4>The rating agencies give RAK an 'A' level with a 'stable' outlook. From RAK's perspective, which fundamentals need to be focused on for a higher rating? </h4><p>The sovereign rating assigned to us by Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P give due recognition to our many credit strengths; political stability, ease of doing business, track record of fiscal prudence, and a low and declining debt and interest burden. Where we need to improve is in the provision of macroeconomic data needed for economic analysis and forecasting. This coincides with the UAE's push for more accurate and wide-ranging work on big data. We need to be able to provide robust and credible statistics about the Emirate, and to do that we need to overcome some institutional deficiencies in our data gathering and analysis. We are well on the way to accomplishing that with the establishment in July 2016 of the RAK Statistics and Studies Center. To strengthen our statistical capability, we also need to improve governance, especially as it pertains to the management of state owned enterprises (SOEs). We have a large number of SOEs, which provide the majority of the Emirate's revenues, and we need to improve policies, processes, and transparency in order to have better oversight over these entities and expand their level of efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the domestic legacy of the Summit of the Americas which took place in Panama in 2015?</h4><p>From a diplomatic standpoint, this government under the leadership of President Varela and Vice President and Foreign Minister Isabel Saint Malo has been able to achieve a balanced foreign policy contrary to what happened in the last part of Martinelli's tenure. Nowadays, we have excellent relations with every country in the Americas, including those in the Bolivarian Pact. We have good relations with Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador and, of course, great relations with those of the Pacific Alliance such as Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. We also have observer status in the Pacific Alliance and are considering whether to participate as a member. In this scenario, Panama has been able to act in the different multilateral entities in Latin America as a facilitator and a bridge for dialogue among different parties. President Varela has had exceptional relations with almost all of the Presidents in the region, especially the US, which will continue under the Trump administration.</p><h4>What has to be done to become part of the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>First of all, we have to decide if we want to enter the Pacific Alliance, a decision our Foreign Relations Ministry and the Ministry of Commerce and Finance are considering. They will have to submit a recommendation to the cabinet, which will probably happen in the first half of 2017. We will have to check the steps that have to be taken for Panama to form part of the Alliance, which is a commercial alliance that also has economic and political components that will have to be put into balance. Once decided upon, we will have to meet the required criteria. One thing that is needed is to have a commercial treaty with all of the member countries of the alliance and right now we do not have a commercial pact with Colombia. Therefore, we have to check and evaluate and then meet all of the criteria.</p><h4>2015 marks the beginning of the government's 2015-2019 strategic plan: what has been achieved so far and what are the government's main short-term priorities?</h4><p>On December 31, we reached the halfway point of our government. We still have 30 months to go and there are three areas of focus. One is the institutional area, and in that sense the Varela government has been able to restore some institutional balance in the country. Unfortunately, in the last three years of the Martinelli government there was a form of government that did not take into account the institutional balance that is needed, and both the judiciary and legislature have become an appendix of the executive branch. The other issue is economic; in our first full year of government in 2015 we achieved a 5.9% economic growth. In 2016, we are targeting between 5.3% and 5.5% growth. Even though there will be economic deceleration we have to bear in mind that we are keeping inflation low, at less than 2%, and will still grow the second most in Latin America behind the Dominican Republic. The growth forecast for 2017 is between 5.8% and 6%. In 2016, we were affected by several issues: the first was the so-called Panama papers, which were unjustly named because the banks involved were not in Panama. But it had an effect on the country all the same.</p><h4>What should Panama do to improve its image as a transparent and reliable country to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>This effort began immediately when we took on new business and enacted important pieces of legislation. We were also able to set up different mechanisms for reporting suspicious activities, which include obliging lawyers to report suspicious activities to the financial analysis unit. We have also signed a multilateral assistance tax relief bill, which has been signed by approximately 100 countries. In the beginning of 2018, we will take part in an automotive exchange of information between countries to ensure everyone has adequate safeguards to prevent information being used by third parties. Hence, we are taking steps that are being recognized by the OECD. We have good bilateral relations with major players such as the US and Germany. There is one notable exception, France, who without any justification has targeted Panama and is about to include us in a grey list beginning in January. We feel this action is not warranted, but the reason they are including us is because they say we are unable to provide information regarding the accounting information of a company. However, when they signed a treaty with us they were aware that our commercial code did not require companies who are not operating in Panama to require accounting information in Panama. We reformed the law and Panamanian companies or entities operating here now have to make their accounting information available.</p><h4>What are your main targets and goals for 2017?</h4><p>As far as infrastructure is concerned, we have been able to conduct public bidding on all the major infrastructure programs that we want to go ahead with. Only two are pending: the public bid for the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal and the third line of the metro system. These are projects that will be inaugurated by the new government in 2019. We will also complete the expansion of the highway between the bridge and Arraiján on the western side of the Panama Canal. We are also going to expand the Inter-American Highway from Chorrera in the western part of Panama to San Carlos in the touristic area. We will continue all the other infrastructure projects—some of which we will be able to inaugurate in 2017, some in 2018, and line two of the metro in early 2019. We want to create the economic conditions to keep economic growth between 5.8% and 6% for 2017 and keep fiscal discipline. When we inherited the government we had a public deficit of 4.0% and have been able to continue infrastructure investments, but with fiscal discipline. This means we are under the limits of the fiscal social responsibility law which sets certain standards for certain thresholds for public indebtedness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nestlé in the Dominican Republic changed since it got its start?</h4><p>2016 marked Nestlé's 150th anniversary and 2017 will mark the centenary of our products' presence in the Dominican Republic. Four decades ago, the government came to us to help develop the dairy sector and we focused specifically on helping farmers enhance the quality of their milk. This is something we did district by district and farm by farm. We provided loans, training, and technical support and, today, we buy milk on a daily basis from 1,100 farmers. Other companies have followed our path, which we are proud of. Secondly, our two local factory application groups research local tastes, which allows us to develop products specifically for Dominicans. One example is the Maggi Gallinita, which is powder bouillon, the first in the Dominican market. This is how we have adapted over the years, by developing alongside the local community and helping to create jobs in agriculture.</p><h4>What advantages of the Dominican Republic contribute toward the success of Nestlé?</h4><p>It started 100 years ago when there was a large demand for condensed milk, which was really a novelty at the time. The biggest factor is that Nestlé is well embraced locally. We did a survey and seven out of 10 people believe that Nestlé is a Dominican brand, which shows how well entrenched we are in the country. It is also well situated for us and allows us to have a small hub in the Caribbean, for example, from where we can export to Trinidad, Jamaica, and Cuba. This makes a huge difference—the historical presence, our local knowledge, and a burgeoning consumer base.</p><h4>Which products see the most growth and how do you see the Dominican market's demand changing in the next five years?</h4><p>The Dominican consumer is demanding. They are proud of their origins and what is produced here. At the same time, the Dominican consumer is modern and follows trends in the US and Europe, like lactose free, gluten-free, low cholesterol, and high-protein products. Therefore, we need to listen to them and adapt. Today, we rely essentially on three categories, which are dairy, infant nutrition, and culinary. The categories that are growing the most are coffee, particularly our newly launched Nescafe Dolce Gusto, Purina pet care products for cats and dogs, and Nestlé Professional, which are tailor-made products for hotels and restaurants.</p><h4>What do you see as the biggest future obstacles to food production and distribution in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Productivity has been improving since the CAFTA-DR agreement but at a slow pace, and this is something we continue to focus on and train farmers accordingly. One problem is the dry season; the hot weather makes the output of milk seasonal. There is nothing you can do to solve this issue 100%, but you can do things like give farmers more access to water through pumping and drilling. If producers can learn how to use water more efficiently, there are a lot of opportunities in the productivity of milk. One of the challenges is to have products produced on a larger scale and with higher quality, as they are in the US. It is going to be critical because agriculture is so important for the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>What are some of Nestlé Dominicana's projections for growth in the next five years?</h4><p>That the economy is growing between 5 and 7% is enormously helpful; therefore, we will likely see high, mid-to-high single-digit growth in 2017 and double-digit growth in 2018. For that to happen, the key priority must be to innovate and create shared value. We want the innovations to represent a minimum 15% of our sales; therefore, we are restructuring our innovation, marketing, and sales teams to accelerate insights coming from the market. There will be many new products coming out in the next few months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key strengths of Selangor State?</h4><p>Selangor is centrally and strategically located in Malaysia. We have world-class infrastructure, good road networks, and strong port and airport connectivity. Our seaport is the 12th largest in the world and the second biggest in Southeast Asia, after Singapore. We have 17 major highways in our state, enhancing mobility among our population. Our second biggest asset is the talent pool; we provide the most skillful labor force in Malaysia.</p><h4>What are your focus areas in manufacturing?</h4><p>We focus on five main clusters: life sciences, electrical and electronics, transport equipment—which covers automotive and aerospace—food and beverage, and machinery and equipment. Apart from these main clusters, we place special emphasis on four other areas: biotech, aerospace, the halal industry, and e-commerce. For these four, we set up special councils, of which three are already in place. In 2015, we inaugurated the Selangor Information Technology and E-Commerce Council (SITEC), focusing on IT and e-commerce development. We also set up the Selangor Bio Council to move the biotech sector forward as well as the Selangor Aerospace Council to ensure that all aerospace-related projects proceed as planned. We are now in the middle of setting up the Halal Selangor Council.</p><h4>How do you take control over talent development?</h4><p>We work with universities and try to connect them with the industry. We look at various models on how we can bring them closer and bridge the gap between the demands of the industry and the skills and knowledge of graduates. We formed Talent Initiative Programs that can function as a platform for industry and academia. We also have a training center, the Selangor Human Resource Development, aimed at the development at vocational training. Here, we venture into another program that will enable students to further their academic career at the university level after their vocational training. We tailor these programs to the four focus areas for growth that we have outlined.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the biotech industry?</h4><p>We have few focuses under life sciences, and these include pharmaceuticals and biotech. For biotech, we will develop a special dedicated area called Selangor Bio Bay. We plan to launch it by the end of 2016 or early 2017. We have almost 1,000 acres, close to Westport, allocated to this project. Centrally, we will develop the biotech center, with a number of related facilities around that. We will invite other companies to operate here as well as residential and commercial real estate developers. As we are still in the research phase, we visit Australia, Korea, and San Francisco, and Boston in the US to get input.</p><h4>What are your efforts to attract more investment in the halal industry?</h4><p>We are the first state to develop a halal park, which we called the Selangor Halal Hub and it is located in Pulau Indah. It was set up in 2003 and has attracted a number of investors in the food industry, among others: F&amp;N Dairies, Mewah Dairies, Kawan Food Manufacturing, Sydney Cake House and Ramly Food Industries. We planned to enhance the Halal Park by adding the Halalan Toyyiban ecosystem through another initiative, Halal International Selangor (HIS). HIS is set to become a single community, a global market platform for the Global Halal Toyyiban Trade and Industry. The initial program is to facilitate the Human Capital Development program via the introduction of Halal Technical Competent Person (HTCP), a competency-based education and training program. This program is envisaged to facilitate and accommodate the halal industry with competent halal human resources required by global halal industry. All halal certified companies can appoint one of their staff to be this HTCP to ensure that all the company's processes are halal compliant. It is similar to the manufacturing industry that requires HSE and QA officers. We design complete modules and intend to market this abroad as well. We have spoken to some potential partners and are happy to hear that these standards will be recognized domestically and in the international market. We will not limit ourselves only to food and beverage; the Halal industry is much larger than that. Furthermore, we are progressing on the planning of other halal ecosystems, such as e-commerce platforms and distribution chain.</p><h4>Regarding e-commerce, what are your efforts here?</h4><p>Since 2015, we have had several e-commerce initiatives. One of the most fruitful ones was a program for training SMEs to develop their own apps and to become online sellers with their products. Initially, we targeted having 220 merchants online by the end of 2016, and were happy to have 187 companies that had successfully opened a web store up to date.  Within 13 months, the Selangor Information Technology and E-Commerce Council (SITEC) had organized about 30 E-Commerce classes and startup sharing sessions with an average attendance of around 100 people per class. SITEC also successfully organized several international conferences focusing on e-commerce, including a trade mission to Taiwan to touch base with 1,000 merchants there during a visit to five major cities. We also have the Selangor Digital Creative Center, where we provide co-working space for these SMEs, a center that functions as a startup incubator.</p><h4>How do you interact with Chinese investors in Selangor?</h4><p>Chinese investors are attracted to the large infrastructural development projects across the country, and most of these are carried out by the federal government. We do not target companies and investors, but instead focus on those that bring new technologies and are active in innovative manufacturing.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for Selangor state?</h4><p>We have annual KPIs for foreign investment that we attract in the manufacturing sector. In 2015, our target was MYR8 billion and we managed to get MYR7.96 billion. In 2016, we target MYR6 billion, slight lower due to the uncertainty in global economics. This is FDI and DDI combined. Looking at the momentum and the trend for the first quarter, we are optimistic we can achieve this. Great examples of this momentum are the partnership between Rolls Royce and UMW and the fact that Airbus also chose a local engineering company to become a global supplier are good indicators for us. We have also seen a few large Japanese companies that announced expansion of the projects, mostly in the field of electronics and automotive industries. With these investments, we feel comfortable we can reach our targets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given your family's long history in education, how is the current period different, and how has your business grown?</h4><p>UBT Company is focused on investments, consultation, and operations for higher education, professional training, and knowledge transfer beyond high school. The company holds all of its endeavors as an investment firm, including the eponymous university. We focus on undergraduate, graduate, and executive education. We have a vision, but we need to understand where we come from as well. I come from a family that has chosen education as a career for hundreds of years. My brothers, sister, father, uncle, grandfather, and his brothers are educators, and my ancestors have pursued this profession for many generations. Education is in our blood, so we continue on the same path. However, today we are operating the first for-profit business model that the family has ever used. We believe in sustainability, and a business model must underpin any sustainable operation.</p><h4>Aside from UBT, what are your key investments today?</h4><p>We are proud to have executive training programs for three of the main companies in the western part of the country, and provide executive education in multiple countries through our partner certification bodies. We also cater to the changes that have happened in the education market. Today, there is a greater mix of higher education, training, and vocational education. In line with that, we have invested in new sectors through our UBT Academy brand, encompassing English Institutes and the Higher Training Institute. The latter will provide the knowledge and skills required for jobs and will be completely focused on the job market.. In May, we will announce these new schools after getting curriculums developed and approved by the Ministry of Education and the TVTC respectively. We will operate the English Institute on a franchise basis throughout the GCC. We have already had initial talks with interested parties in the Gulf region, while we plan to have 12 branches established and serving the different parts of the country eventually. We are keen to find investors who would like to promote quality English language education. We will operate those centers with partners investing capital.</p><h4>Vision 2030 has a clear vocational and training component, as well as a clear intention to increase private participation in the sector. Are these investments a reaction to those plans?</h4><p>They want to see proportionally fewer students in universities because current universities simply do not meet the needs of the market. Today the country needs to quickly and efficiently equip large numbers of young people with the right skills to do specific jobs. Right now, vocational and training schools are seen as the most effective way to provide careers for the Saudi youth. That is why we are investing in the vocational business and training and leveraging our existing resources in line with Vision 2030's goals and objectives. There are more than 85,000 teachers in the region qualified to receive teacher training and self-development, and we aim to serve them. We want to produce the best teachers we can, and that is a specialized training endeavor.</p><h4>Is it a challenge to meet the demands and requirements of the private sector, and how do you deduce which skills are in demand?</h4><p>We review the course content of our programs every year to ensure each is in line with international programs and processes. For example, we have recently been approved to deliver 26 new minor programs for the engineering college that cater to tomorrow's engineering and technology needs, as well as today's. We have an engineering school, a business school, and an advertising school. We are the only university in the Middle East that has an advertising school, and yet advertising is a USD24 billion market in which 94% of it is a macro outflow of cash outside the country, because the advertisers and agencies are not Saudi. So we want to change that, and our innovation in this area speaks to our awareness of the needs of the market. Our first batch of around 60 students just graduated, and they are all either employed or self-employed, every single one of them. That is the highest employment rate for a graduating class we have reached in 16 years. The Jeddah College of Advertising was created in partnership with Bucks New University in the UK. We did not have an advertising agency ourselves, so we had to learn to create that industry here. We learned for six months in the UK, going from one agency to another, and then we applied our findings here. So for every one of our programs, we tailor our operations to address market and employment needs, and in September 2017 we will have a set of newly reviewed programs that ensure our graduates become better equipped for the market than they have ever been.</p><h4>Are there any plans to expand your operations in other Muslim countries outside of the Gulf and the Middle East, places like Malaysia or Indonesia, and what is your vision for the evolution of the UBT business?</h4><p>Ultimately we want to be a global institution, yes. We do not just consider this a business. It is something we believe in. We believe everybody should have access to the best education possible. We have done our best to create a model for everyone, regardless of country, culture, or region. We also believe in private education, and that every single company or investor can do it through a for-profit business model. Furthermore, I urge the ministries of education and finance and investments to allow for companies that own universities and schools to go to IPO. The more transparency there is for the public, the better governed these businesses can be. Today's global business model allows for IPOs and public sharing, which was not the case hundreds of years ago, of course. We need to focus on the possibility of companies invested in education going to IPO. There is no reason they should not, not from either a business standpoint, or a religious standpoint, or a legal standpoint. It is important for the sustainability and transparency of the education sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the last five months, one of the prevailing sentiments in all my conversations with GCC leaders has been this sense that in challenging times, you turn to your oldest and most dependable friends. That is the spirit in which I come to the GCC today. We have a rich history on which to build. From the very first treaties, in the mid-17th century, which saw the East India Company reach agreements on British trade and a military presence in Oman, to our deep partnership as Cold War allies, the UK has been proudly at the forefront of a relationship between the Gulf and the West that has been the bedrock of our shared prosperity and security. As the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, I am determined that we should seize the opportunity to get out into the world and to shape an even bigger global role for my country, to build new alliances but more importantly, to go even further in working with old friends, like our allies here in the Gulf, who have stood alongside us for centuries.</p><p>In accepting the honor of addressing GCC leaders, I seek not just to offer a message of continuity, but to begin to build a bold new chapter in our cooperation; to forge a strategic relationship, a relationship based on true partnership and an enduring commitment between our countries and our peoples; a relationship through which together we can meet these great challenges to our shared security and prosperity, and grab this opportunity to build an exciting future for the generations that follow us.</p><p>When I think of the growth of this region over the past 50 years, from the transformation of Dubai to the position of the Gulf as the UK's third largest export market, I never forget that the bedrock of this prosperity and stability has been the relationship between the Gulf and the West. Now, in this period of uncertainty, is the time to recommit to this relationship.</p><p>Already the Gulf is a special market for the United Kingdom. Last year alone, trade between the UK and GCC was worth more than GBP30 billion. At the same time Gulf investment in the UK is helping to regenerate cities from Aberdeen to Teeside, and from Manchester to London. I am determined that we should do everything possible to build on this and elevate our trade and investment to an even more ambitious level. I will continue the work that the UK has been leading over the past three years to make London one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world.</p><p>Free trade makes us all richer. It creates jobs. It increases investment. It improves productivity. It transforms living standards and creates opportunities for all of our citizens. And nowhere is that more important than here with our friends and allies in the Gulf. I am delighted that we agreed yesterday to set up a new Joint Working Group to examine how we can unblock remaining barriers to trade and take steps to further liberalise our economies for the benefit of our mutual prosperity.</p><p>For example, we have just reached a new agreement with Saudi Arabia to allow British businesses to obtain five-year multiple entry visas for the first time, creating new opportunities for more bilateral business. And we have agreed that in March next year, the UK will host an event on Gulf national transformation and economic diversification plans at the Mansion House — for centuries, a home of finance and trade at the heart of the City of London.</p><p>Also, I can confirm that the UK will take part in Dubai's Expo 2020 continuing the tradition started in Britain with The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in Hyde Park in 1851. Dubai 2020 will offer an enormous commercial opportunity. There will be over 180 nations taking part with more than 25 million visitors expected — from the world's top business leaders to its biggest investors. It is an opportunity that I am determined we should seize together.</p><p>I want us to explore whether in this dynamic and diverse market, we can forge a new trade arrangement for the whole of the Gulf area. I want to leave no-one in any doubt about the scale of my ambition or the extent of my determination to establish the strongest possible trading relationships between the UK and the Gulf.</p><p>Just as we take every possible step to break down the barriers that are restricting our trade and prosperity; it is also important that we continue the work to bring our peoples together and to ensure that the benefits of greater prosperity are shared by all. We all recognise that there is some way to go before we can say that these economies really work for everyone. But I have been encouraged by recent economic and social reforms you have taken forward and by the bold vision set out by all of the Gulf States for more fundamental and lasting change, most recently with Abu Dhabi's vision for 2030.</p><p>This vital strategic relationship between the UK and the Gulf — a partnership steeped in so much history and so full of potential for our future — now demands even more concentrated efforts. That is why I want to continue the hugely positive discussions we had in this first ever UK-GCC dialogue at leader level. I am delighted that all GCC leaders agreed to make this an annual event. And I look forward to welcoming them all to London in 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE projects a growth rate of 4% for 2017. Which economic sectors will drive this growth?</h4><p>The non-oil sectors will provide the needed impetus to drive the country's economy this year and beyond. As the UAE steadily moves toward reducing its heavy dependence on oil revenues, we expect to see a number of relevant initiatives and programs designed to strengthen vital sectors such as renewable energy, tourism, education, science, innovation, and information technology dominating government policies and regulations. This is clearly evident in the country's Higher Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation in which more than 100 initiatives worth over AED300 billion have been identified. These key initiatives cover the health, education, energy, transport, water, and technology sectors. At the Ministry of Economy, we are promoting investment spending on value-added projects, among others, to help diversify the state's sources of income. The year 2017 will present broader prospects for growth in our local industries, thereby reinforcing the country's resilience to global economic changes and other key evolving variables. Given our progress, leadership, and global competitiveness, we are on our way to building a knowledge- and innovation-driven diversified economy. As for the UAE's economic performance, its real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2015, with the country more or less maintaining the same pace in 2016. This gives us a clear indication of the competitive progress of our national economy, even amidst all the challenges and difficulties that have negatively affected many economies worldwide, developed and emerging alike.</p><h4>How have the Ministry's efforts to attract investors been reflected in capital inflows into the country and what is the UAE's current position in the global trade arena?</h4><p>In terms of FDI, total flows to the country in 2016 amounted to about USD10 billion. The size of cumulative investments, on the other hand, reached about USD119 billion toward the end of 2016. We believe that the policies and legislation that the government is working to enact by 2017 will have a significantly positive impact on raising foreign investment flows into the country. Investment growth was not just limited to inflows, though; the volume of the UAE's outbound investments stood at USD9.3 billion in 2015, up from USD9 billion in the previous year. This made the UAE the largest Arab foreign investor in 2015, with the cumulative balance of its investments reaching USD87.4 billion. The country also maintained its prestigious position as a regional and global capital for foreign trade and an influential import, export, and re-export hub. The UAE's non-oil direct exports grew significantly in 2015, exceeding the previous year's rate by 22%. For the first half of 2016, the UAE's total non-oil foreign trade reached AED790 billion or USD215 billion. We estimate the continuation of this upward trend in 2016 with a growth rate of 5%, and in 2017 with a growth rate of 7%.</p><h4>How has the Ministry of Economy been working to increase the contribution of industry to GDP to reach the 20% target by 2021?</h4><p>Our initiatives involve providing support on all fronts for young local entrepreneurs and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), giving them unprecedented access to an environment in which they can thrive and play a bigger role in the UAE's economic progress. Additionally, the ministry seeks out more key industrial investments to boost the growth of Emirati industrial companies and generate new jobs for UAE citizens. The approval of the Foreign Investment Law reflects the government's commitment to prioritizing value-added projects in industrial sectors, among others.</p><h4>You have been an advocate of the positive transformations the UAE Investment Law will bring about. How will this law foster FDI and the framework for fruitful PPPs in the country?</h4><p>Since the new foreign investment law allows for 100% foreign ownership in government-approved sectors, we expect to see robust FDI and more fruitful public-private partnerships in the near future as a result of its enactment. The law has essentially made it easier for regional and international businesses to enter the local market and this access will arguably lead to an influx of investments from key markets at the regional and global levels. The local industrial sector, which is one of the main engines of a post-oil economy, and other domestic businesses will benefit from higher FDI especially in terms of increased competitiveness and accelerated development.</p><h4>How has the UAE been developing the non-oil sector, and which industries are leading the way in propelling the country's exporting capabilities?</h4><p>We have made significant progress due in part to the government's stronger emphasis on knowledge, innovation, advanced technology, human capacity building, and scientific research given their impact on the overall development process. Our economic diversification efforts have already resulted in high-performing non-oil sectors, which stand to increase their aggregate economic contributions to 4.6% by 2020. The UAE's robust economic, trade, and investment relations with key Asian and African markets, as well as other countries, will drive our non-oil export and re-export activities in the short and long term. The rapid development of the industrial sector saw industrial investments rising from AED127.6 billion in 2015 to an estimated AED130 billion by the end of 2016, which contributed around 12.1% to the non-oil GDP. Meanwhile, the tourism sector is another important contributor to national income. It is expected to gain more importance moving forward and will strengthen its role as a major feeder to the national economy. The country will rely more on tourism during the transition to a post-oil economy given its close association with many other sectors. It is considered to be a main driver for retail, shopping, entertainment, and aviation and plays a prominent role in generating jobs and stimulating investment flows to hospitality and infrastructure development. Moreover, it provides valuable opportunities for the success of small- and medium-sized enterprises. All of these and other efforts and endeavors will bear fruit in the near future and help gain more achievements in national and global economic indicators. The outlook is bright in light of UAE President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's designation of 2017 as the “Year of Giving."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you educate and change the mindset of Nigerians to encourage them to use a safe deposit system?</h4><p>This business mostly works on referrals. Some people come to us as a result of robbery because it makes them realize they need to use a professional safe deposit service. Many people are surprised that a service like this exists. The first three years of business were tough and we worked to establish our business through personal recommendations and referrals. We are fifth in terms of growth in our segment; however, this is a new type of business for Nigeria and it takes time to build a reputation and trust. It will take a long time to build up people's confidence in the safe depository industry here. We continually do software upgrades to improve our security systems and keep up to date with the latest technology so that our security cannot be compromised.</p><h4>What is the general profile of your clients and how do you expect that to evolve?</h4><p>We have more individuals than company clients at the moment. The general public is not particularly aware of our services yet; therefore, the reality is that our individual clients tend to be from the elite—well-traveled people who understand the safe deposit concept because they have used it in other countries.</p><h4>What are some of the unique security challenges that individuals and companies face in Nigeria that would make them think about using a safe deposit service?</h4><p>As individuals, it is not in our culture to keep things with someone else. This culture coupled with a lack of trust in law enforcement is a challenge in terms of keeping your private possessions safe in Nigeria. In terms of the challenges companies face, there are many fire incidents at commercial properties here; however, many businesses do not take out insurance to protect their premises, nor do they have back-up copies of their vital documents. Hence, when companies have a fire they tend to lose a great deal of documents. We offer them the opportunity to keep their back-ups here. Our services are also useful for businesses that want to compartmentalize their information to maintain the integrity of certain sensitive data. For example, a particular department in a company might use our services because its office systems are not secure enough. There is also a trend toward more marriages failing in Nigeria now and women are starting to understand the need to keep certain valuables safe to protect their financial position and independence. In Nigeria, if a man dies his family will often try to take everything away immediately. Women can keep their possessions safe with us and no one will be able to access them or even know they are kept here. Women will often do this to protect possessions for their children in the future.</p><h4>What needs to be done to empower and unleash the potential of women and girls in Africa and in Nigeria in particular?</h4><p>We should start by knowing that we do not just belong to the other rooms, despite what the president said recently about this. Also, if we want to empower women, we have to start with the children and the way we raise them right now. We have to ensure that our children understand from an early age that women are not just supposed to be a wife and mother. In Africa, the attitude of families is generally still that they should pay more attention to the education of their sons than their daughters. It is supposed to be equal. We really need to reexamine the education we are giving our female children and bring them up in the right way so they know they are not just meant to be a wife and mother; they can be a president too. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government will set up a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). What type of incentives will this institution offer?</h4><p>We realized that the creative arts, in particular music, film, culture, and literature, are facing challenges due to a lack of institutional funding. Because of that, they have had to think very small and were unable to achieve anything of magnitude. The challenge that creative industries face in Nigeria is piracy within the distribution chain, and that is partly due to the failure of the government to protect the intellectual rights of this community. At the base of all this is the fact that unlike other sectors, the arts lack a specific bank or fund, which can be found in other sectors such as the Bank of Agriculture, where applicants can get funding at a rate that is almost subsidized. In the case of the creative industries, it is even more challenging as it is an unstructured industry; it is an industry that thrives on the talents and skills of individuals. What is being achieved in music today and the film industry has been done largely without governmental support. If we are able to support them with the National Endowment Fund, we can definitely boost the sector.</p><h4>What measures is the ministry implementing to combat piracy?</h4><p>Piracy is a problem of monstrous proportions; for every 10 movies eight are pirated. There have been several suggestions on how to tackle the issue. Our experience in fighting piracy in the entertainment industry is that we cannot continue to fight piracy using the same methods and tools as in the past. Pirates are well funded, motivated, and organized. The incentive is huge because from investing nothing they can make millions of dollars out of the sweat of artists. Piracy is not just restricted to films and music; it goes to books and even to cable and satellite television. We need a combination of factors to fight pirates. We need to strengthen the capacity and abilities of all the agencies that fight piracy. The police need to be encouraged and I would recommend a national task force against piracy, as it is a real economic crime. Moving from analog to digital broadcasting will also help because it will make it easier for filmmakers and musicians to release their work directly to the channels, hence unofficial channels will have less success.</p><h4>You have repeatadly advocated  for the revival of festivals. What major cultural initiatives can be expected to take place in Nigeria in 2016?</h4><p>We seek to create a calendar of festivals. I have asked my cultural department to reach out to their counterparts in all the states and have asked the various directors of culture within the various states to give us a list of at least 10 festivals in their state in order of priority and importance. When I have that compendium, I can market the various festivals. Hence, anyone coming to Nigeria will have an idea of what festival is taking place at any particular time. I am also working with the British Council and we have a couple of seminars and workshops on the creative industry and part of this concerns conducting research on the various creative industries. Festivals are a veritable source of job creation. For example, it takes 100 people to stage one festival in the eastern part of Nigeria, and another 100 people to dismantle it. So if that festival lasts for a week, then it will employ hundreds of people for that week. We are looking into areas where culture is not just about entertainment but a veritable economy. Creative industries, of which festivals are a part, create a local economy for the local people, which will help stem urban migration and help with the main objective of the government: to diversify the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[FOCUS on business]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[focus-on-business]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you adapt your programs to meet the specific needs of Nigeria?</h4><p>That is one of the critical things that helps us stand out. We recognized an opportunity to develop managers; not just in the theory of management but also the practice. Our entire structure is targeted towards developing managers who can put what they learn into practice. One of the key differentiating factors between us and other business schools is our focus on how to do business in Nigeria and now Africa. When we first began, our mission was to develop competent and socially responsible managers for Nigeria. In developing case studies, we wrote on businesses in Nigeria and carried out research on companies in Nigeria. However, since 2009, our mission has changed and we now have a broader focus, focusing not only on Nigeria but Africa as a whole.</p><h4>How important are your international connections with other private universities or institutions?</h4><p>They are still important, though probably less so than before. After the global financial crisis and the global recession, there were only two areas of growth: Africa and Asia. We started seeing a number of multinationals coming to Africa and wanting to expand their presence. Given our population, if a company seeks talent, Nigeria is a great place to find it. If companies are looking at top business schools, they will come to LBS. That meant our focus had to change. People graduating from this school were no longer staying in Nigeria, but working for companies that took them all over Africa. Until that time, IESE Business School was our principal partner because it was instrumental to our setup and also because we share the same philosophy. We began to look for additional partners to broaden our participants' outlook. Through these strategic alliances, we achieve research collaborations that broaden our faculty's field of research and enrich our students' learning experience.</p><h4>Have you seen a change in the way that people look at training for executive education and management?</h4><p>Because of the influx and increasing availability of technology, the greater majority of Africans and Nigerians now have access to learning that they may not have had previously. We see more of a boom in terms of massive open online courses (MOOCs). It means that business owners in Nigeria who previously had to save up to come to business school now have access to open online courses. There are various open courses out there and the quality differs; some of the top schools in business education now offer MOOCs. Now, there is broader access to education and I foresee a decoupling of management education. Before, to be a successful manager, it was necessary to do an MBA, but technology today is leapfrogging that. Technology is a disruptor in the education sector but business schools will not become extinct as there still remain other attributes, values, and attitudes that cannot be taught online.</p><h4>How can the government and private education institutions collaborate to create more awareness about the need for higher education?</h4><p>The first thing that we have to do is recognize the importance of developing talent. The portion of the federal budget devoted to education from the national budget over last 10 years averaged around 10.4%, with a 6.7% allocation this year. We have 180 million Nigerians, of which 110 million are young, and it is the duty of the state to provide education for these people. For companies, if we do not develop the youth, there is no one to recruit. Most critical is curriculum development: the curriculum needs to be updated in several schools because there is no regular review of the curriculum. We have 143 universities and 61 of those are private, so the greater proportion of universities in Nigeria are federal or state universities that are subsidized by the government. We need a more robust solution that makes room for collaboration. </p><p><em>This is an uncut, unedited interview, available only to our premium subscribers.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What legal and regulatory changes are we likely to see in Nigeria over the medium term?</h4><p>Governments at both the federal and the state levels have been grappling with reviving an economy that is in recession. The focus has, therefore, been on administrative changes that are likely to enhance revenue generation or encourage investment in local production of goods so as to reduce the pressure on the nation's foreign reserves. Tax rates have not changed but the federal government has taken to interpreting existing legislation more broadly. For example, the Central Bank has interpreted the law on stamp duty so as to claim the power to levy a tax of NGN50 on many banking transactions. Banks successfully challenged this in court but the decision is pending appeal with the Supreme Court. In the meantime, this tax is still being collected and has generated such revenue that the government will find it difficult to surrender this "power." Another example: the federal government has mooted the idea of a tax on telephone calls, SMS, and data services but enabling legislation is yet to be passed. The federal government has maintained its prohibition on the import of items that it feels can be produced locally. It has also gone further to prohibit imports of certain items through land borders in order to discourage smuggling. </p><h4>Which sectors would be subject to the most important changes?</h4><p>It is difficult to say that any one sector is more important than another. Infrastructure such as roads and power is an enabler of manufacturing, amongst other things. But that does not make education and health less important. The government's greater challenge has to do with implementing its programs. Many programs that look good on paper have failed to be completed. One exception, however, is the effort to increase local agricultural production. There has been a slow but steady increase in production over the last few years.</p><h4>How does Nigeria's legal system compare to those in the ECOWAS region?</h4><p>ECOWAS is a regional grouping of 15 West African countries established in 1975. The member countries operate different legal systems. The countries may be divided into Francophone and Anglophone countries. The Francophone countries operate the civil law system while the Anglophone countries, to which Nigeria belongs, operate the common law system. There are differences between common and civil legal tenets and these lie in the actual source of law in each system. The common law system depends largely on case law, i.e., interpreting customary practices and statutes, as a source of law, thereby allowing judges to proactively contribute to the development of the laws by giving interpretation that represents current commercial practices and realities. For consistency, courts abide by precedents set by higher courts examining the same issue with similar facts. In civil law systems, on the other hand, codes and statutes are designed to cover all eventualities and judges have the limited role of applying the law to the case in hand. In this system, past judgments are no more than loose guides.</p><p>Freedom of contract is extensive in common law countries; for example, very little or no provisions are implied in contracts by law; civil law countries on the other hand have model contracts with provisions based in the law. The decisions of judges have a binding effect in common law countries, even though such precedents may in some cases be appealed up to the highest court. However, in civil law countries, only the judicial decisions of administrative and constitutional courts are binding outside the original case. In most cases, therefore, the concept of precedent—past cases determining the outcome of future ones—is not used. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has LaserDerm Clinics Limited evolved since its establishment?</h4><p>LaserDerm Clinics has been in existence for a little over four years. I ran a similar cosmetic medical practice in the UK for a number of years and wanted to replicate something similar in Nigeria as it was lacking at the time. In partnership with a few investors, we opened our first clinic in Ikeja in April 2012 and slowly grew to our current position. The aesthetic sector is an innovative one, and we have had to invest in extremely sophisticated equipment and ensure the equipment is appropriate for black and ethnic skin and constantly replaced or upgraded. We left Ikeja and set up in a location in Victoria Island due to growing demand from our clients. We finally moved into our ultra-modern office in Kofo Abayomi Street, Victoria Island, in 2016. With the equipment, training, and skillset required, the business is a capital-intensive one.</p><h4>How would you describe the current level of medical training in Nigeria, especially in aesthetics?</h4><p>In the aesthetics field, training can be improved tremendously. The field is still a new and novel area of practice. There is obviously some training here; however, when it comes to aesthetic medicine it is close to nonexistent. Those of us in the industry are passionate about training. We understand that the training of our doctors is critical to the success of our practice. We offer various treatments that require unique and particular skills and constantly need to ensure that we adhere to the global standard. We engage in rigorous in-house training for all our doctors and send them to the UK and US annually for training. We also fly in specialists to conduct in-house training. We have over four medical doctors and while training is always an expensive venture, it is vital to us to maintain a particular standard that can be cross-referenced with any foreign practice in the world. This standard of quality and innovation is what the LaserDerm brand stands for.</p><h4>How would you describe the regulatory framework for this industry?</h4><p>The lack of regulatory frameworks in this industry is a problem globally and not just in Nigeria. Through advocacy we seek to engage the relevant authorities to introduce some form of regulation and framework so that a minimum standard is maintained. This has been challenging, and understandably so, as it is such a novel industry. It is only in the last couple of years that other countries have sought to tackle this lack of regulation and put in place rules about what treatments can be carried out and by whom. It is about guaranteeing patient rights and safety. Lasers, botulinum toxin injections, fillers, and so many other procedures can do permanent damage. People carrying out these procedures need the proper medical backgrounds in anatomy and physiology. Regulation has been a key word in the industry in Europe recently. In Nigeria, the industry is in its infancy and hopefully we can create the necessary regulations here in collaboration with the medical council. We have, however, operated within the standards required for the medical profession in Nigeria and have gone ahead to register with the Medical Council of Nigeria, which regulates the industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Nigeria is now officially in a recession. LaserDerm Clinics falls into a service category that is between a want and a need. Some of the conditions we treat here are more in the class of want and in a recession people tend to spend less on what they want and focus on their needs; having said that, we find ourselves in a unique position because there are not many people offering the same quality of services that our clinic provides. As a result, I see us riding out this recession comfortably. Hopefully in 2017 we will continue to forge ahead strongly. The future is bright, and the economy will pick up. It always does after a bad cycle. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the inspiration and purpose behind establishing the Olive Multi-Specialist Hospitals?</h4><p>When we established The Olive Multi-Specialist Hospitals a year ago, we were aware that the healthcare industry in Nigeria was still at an immature stage, where in an emergency situation gaining access to critical care is usually a challenge. Likewise, finding a good multi-specialty hospital that operates at international standards in the Lekki area of Lagos, is difficult. Therefore, we decided that we would create a standard multi-service hospital that would meet the local population needs. Most good hospitals focus on specialist care; however, we did a survey and found that affordability is an issue, but at the same time, most people want quality healthcare. Another problem is that patients sometimes experience delays in accessing specialist healthcare. This is a persistent problem because, most hospitals schedule the same specialists round the clock, and because physicians in many sub-specialty areas are in short supply. We realized that we had to bring specialists into the country to address the alarming brain drain that this country has experienced over the last decade. We have to attract talented physicians and surgeons to Nigeria; hence, our first partnership was with Platinum Hospital in India, which will be flying up to 10 surgeons here on two-year contracts. It is not just about buying and importing equipment but training and bringing in people who can use it. Our mission is to raise standards. For example, many hospitals in Nigeria still do not have basic anti-infection measures, and some still use boiling ring sterilization systems to disinfect equipment; likewise, most hospitals do not have electronic records. We want other hospitals to upgrade and take us as an example. We will do a lot of telemedicine to widen access to quality healthcare for our patients. In terms of the response from the public sector, state governments are waking up to what's going on and what needs to be done. They are interested in what we are doing and what they can learn from us to create integrated healthcare delivery systems. We are using the technology that is available, such as linking hospital records by iCloud so that doctors can have access to patient records, irrespective of location. Patients have a right to professional and transparent healthcare services. </p><h4>What role can hospitals play in pushing education about the importance of preventative healthcare? </h4><p>We need to do more preventive healthcare and move away from a reliance on just treatments. Here, we offer a risk questionnaire in which we ask about patients' medical history and when they last had a comprehensive critical check, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and so on. We then have coordinators who direct patients to where they need to go. So we not only engage   doctors but we promote the participation of other professionals such as case managers, rehab specialists, and dieticians. Why wait for persons at risk of heart attacks to fall critically ill, when we can identify such persons through risk management programs, and schedule for elective interventional cardiology procedures? We are trying to identify people who can be treated through preventive health care, as this saves complications, costs, and time for everyone in the long run. </p><h4>What will be your priorities over the next 12 months?</h4><p>As a country, Nigeria has not met its Millennium Development Goals, and we have to do better to reduce the high prevalence of infant mortality. We need to improve population health and community wellness and part of this can come from universal health coverage. Everyone must have some kind of insurance. People cannot afford to pay out of their pocket; for example, impoverished people spend up to 50% of their income on healthcare. This is unacceptable and more should be done about this, not just locally, but internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of the Nordica Fertility Centre?</h4><p>Nordica Fertility Centre was founded in 2003, and today we have four clinics: two in Lagos, one in Asaba, and one in Abuja. We provide high-end services in IVF, and we believe people will also benefit from good maternal and child healthcare; therefore, we are looking at how to go into that field. We want to have a proper mother and child hospital in Lagos and ultimately to extend that to other parts of Nigeria. With IVF, some 25% of pregnancies result in multiple births, which is a higher risk pregnancy, and, therefore, you need good facilities to take care of these mothers and babies. Also, there are quite a number of premature births, which require good facilities to give these babies a better chance of survival.</p><h4>What steps and strategy are you taking to make this mother &amp; child hospital a reality?</h4><p>We have started with the first phase, which is to acquire the land for the hospital. Now, we are looking at signing partnerships with hospitals or hospital groups from other parts of the world. This will bring high-quality standards from other countries into Nigeria. We need a partner that understands that the healthcare needs in Africa are different to other parts of the world. We do not want a partner that simply wants to transplant their operational procedures and apply them here. You have to understand the local people in order for your business to succeed. We want partners that are as willing to learn from us as we are from them. It needs to be a combination of international and local knowledge coming together.</p><h4>How has the Nigerian population welcomed artificial fertilization methods?</h4><p>It is getting better by the day. Everyone appreciates the fact that sometimes nature needs help, which is what we do. There is still some religious and cultural resistance; however, it is getting better. Nordica Fertility Centre has been at the forefront of educating people and we are also strong on CSR and giving back to the community. This has made us one of the major thought leaders in the sector. We have been active in educating both the public and medical professionals. We do a lot of medical education in every aspect of assisted reproduction. This field is not part of the mainstream medical education that doctors receive in Nigeria; hence, we have been at the forefront of trying to help the profession, as well as the public, understand how IVF works.</p><h4>How would you characterize the legal framework of healthcare and the fertility segment in particular?</h4><p>There is almost no legal framework in the fertility segment. The Nigerian National Assembly is trying to work out a few issues. When you are talking about fertility it is important to be cautious and not create a knee-jerk reaction leading to the passing of laws that will hinder much-needed development in the field further. It is an emotional topic and while we need to regulate we need to be professional and scientific about it. It is important for practitioners to be involved in this process too so we can come out with the best framework for the industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Our ambition is to have found a good partner so that we can achieve our plans for a hospital. We need a chain of hospitals to reduce mortality rates and improve the quality of care available and also help reverse the trend for medical tourism, today Nigerians spend about USD1 billion per year going abroad for medical treatment. In terms of medical quality, Nordica has ISO certification because we want to match the high standards that are present in other parts of the world. Nigerians should be assured that when we open our hospitals they will tally with international standards. We want to provide the same level of service that people can get in more developed parts of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you play in supporting the government's goal of diversification?</h4><p>You have to position your company in such a way to be able to withstand whatever shock it gets from the macroeconomic environment. If you say that you are only in processing and your processing is based on imports, then what if you do not have access to foreign exchange? You look at other sources and look inwards to how you can sustain your processing by substituting imports with what is available locally. You can also diversify in another form by looking downstream. In our specific case, you bring in wheat and mill raw material into flour. Then, the flour can be converted into pasta, noodles, biscuits, and confectionaries. Rather than being a producer of intermediate products you can go downstream into other industries. That will help develop an industry and manufacturing system that can withstand the shocks and challenges. </p><h4>Which crops hold the greatest potential for FMN for the next few years?</h4><p>We have chosen five Nigerian crops where we believe that Nigeria has a competitive advantage. Nigeria produces about 30-40 million metric tons of cassava annually, and we consume a good percentage of that locally. We are the biggest producers of high-quality cassava flour in Nigeria with a 5,000ha cassava farm located in Shao, Kwara state, which forms the nucleus of the supply chain to our processing plant. Our next investment could be to convert that cassava into starch. Looking at maize, we have the largest mechanized maize farm in the country, located in Niger state, and this is a 10,000ha farm. Each year, we cultivate 4,000-5,000ha of which 2,000-3,000ha is corn, the rest of the balance being soybean. The third crop is soya bean, which is useful in two ways; you extract soya bean oil and what is left is called soya bean cake, which is used in producing poultry feed. The fourth is palm oil and we have a 4,500ha palm oil estate in Edo State, which is producing crude palm oil. We have just acquired another 20,000ha of land from Edo State government to expand this estate. The last area is sugar, and we produce sugar cane on our farms to feed the sugar refinery. Today, the sugar production from within Nigeria is less than 5% of the country's needs and that is why the National Sugar Master Plan came into existence in 2012, with a provision for backward integration that by the year 2020, when Nigeria will be at least 70% self-sufficient in sugar production. Our own sugar estate started three years ago and will be fully developed over the next four years. Sugarcane in Nigeria requires significant expenditure on irrigation, land development, and other supporting infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the main concerns of the manufacturing industry in the country?</h4><p>The last time that the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria met with the Vice President we discussed issues such as multiple taxation We have many agencies and their functions tend to overlap; therefore, we want government to look into that. We also discussed the ECOWAS treaty and the European EPA. Some protection is required, even for the ECOWAS sub region where there are some items and industries that are already protected. The government should ensure that we do not just open our borders and allow cheap products into our country that can be manufactured here. We also discussed the issue of foreign exchange, which is the key issue of today. We discussed that we should prioritize and protect the manufacturing industries because many industries are closing down due to a lack of foreign exchange. What the government can do to promote exports is another issue that we discussed. At FMN we export Nigerian crops to Vietnam and offal pellets to Europe. </p><p><em>This is an uncut, unedited interview, available only to our premium subscribers.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Qatar's economic growth is projected to reach 3.4% in 2017. However, the IMF warns that ongoing public investments could overheat the economy in near term and the prospects of a further rise in US interest rates may “complicate“ efforts to bolster real economic growth. What are the main challenges the Qatari economy may face in 2017?</h4><p>In addition to spillovers from tightening monetary conditions in the US and other major economies, the rising global and regional uncertainties fueled by geopolitical and security concerns and recent political developments around the world are the most prominent challenges in 2017. These global uncertainties may continue to curb investors' appetites and put additional pressure on developmental policies in many countries, particularly MENA countries. However, I think Qatar's prudent monetary and fiscal policies enable the country to contain the repercussions of such conditions.</p><h4>As indicated by the country's non-oil growth indicators, Qatar's efforts to diversify its revenue sources away from a reliance on hydrocarbons are gaining pace. However, we have seen the trade surplus shrink during 2016, attributed to low oil and gas prices. How is the Government of Qatar working to broaden the economic base of exports to balance its trade and support economic diversification?</h4><p>Qatar's trade balance has been affected in the last couple of years due to fluctuations in energy prices and rising imports of raw materials used in our ongoing infrastructure projects. This trend, however, is also influenced by global issues. Fueled by poor economic performance and low levels of investment, global trade growth has been slowing since 2012 and trade balances in many countries around the world have deteriorated. These developments have not only challenged resource-exporting countries but also those with less reliance on raw exports although perhaps to a lesser extent. These developments do however underline the importance of Qatar's long-term vision of diversification, formulated before the down surge in energy markets. To assure the achievement of this diversification strategy, Qatar has been working hardly on developing a wide range of enablers and rationalizing its investment environment so as to promote investments in different types of services and manufacturing industries. Several business-related regulations were optimized to better address the interest of all stakeholders, and a considerable improvement in the capacity and quality of infrastructure has been achieved over the past years. Qatar now has well-designed ports with considerably high capacity; a new state-of-the-art airport; several competitive logistics areas that will start functioning and supporting a wide range of businesses in the near future; and many other initiatives. These new facilities will bring considerable improvements in efficiency and competitiveness to domestic industries. Qatar's economic diversification is benefiting from an improved business environment. Service activities have been strongly supporting our external balance with increasing volumes and values of exports. In just five years, services exports increased five-fold, from USD3 billion in 2011 to USD15 billion, amounting to about 16.3% of Qatar's total exports, compared to 3.9% in 2010. We believe that with our commitment to continue these business environment improvements, supported by further enhancement of our infrastructure and services, our exports basket will grow further in size and varieties, and further enhance the diversification position of Qatar. Qatar has also recently developed the single window project for investor services, which represents one of the most important initiatives designed to develop the business environment, boost the role of the private sector, and encourage domestic and foreign investments in sectors that add value to the national economy, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>Many of our interviewees have stressed the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to boost investment and increase the involvement of the private sector in the national economy. What initiatives will the Government of Qatar introduce to ease public-private cooperation in funding key national projects?</h4><p>The government of Qatar strongly believes in the importance of the private sector and the vital role it plays in our economy. While projects and regulatory reforms are intended to promote private investments in all sectors, there are a few activities that cannot be efficiently performed solely by either the government or the private sector, but rather require mutual cooperation from both sides through PPP arrangements. PPP arrangements are designed to build on the strengths of both sides to deliver efficient and competitive services. In this regard, we are working hard at developing a solid and efficient legal framework for PPP projects, which is widely recognized as a cornerstone of successful partnerships. A new PPP draft law is almost complete and the work on developing the necessary bylaws is progressing at a fast pace. Parallel to this, we are working with several line Ministries and stakeholders to identify the potential domain for PPP projects. As an initial phase, we have identified, together with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, a first batch of schools to be developed through PPP build and lease arrangements. A similar framework has been also considered for hospitals and health facilities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, to meet the increasing demands on health services. Several projects from other sectors shall be joining the list soon and possibly on a larger scale and employing different modes of PPP arrangements.</p><h4>Qatar's cabinet has approved a draft law that will allow foreign investors to provide up to 100% of the capital for a project in any sector, provided they have a Qatari services agent. How do you assess the value of this and other initiatives which the Government of Qatar is introducing to drive foreign investment?</h4><p>I think the new draft law came at the right time to help boost the pace of development of Qatar's economy. Consideration of regulatory reforms is a continuous process in order to accommodate developmental needs and the rise in potential opportunities for foreign investors. Qatar's government is committed to continuously improving the business environment and to ensuring that huge infrastructure capabilities are adequately utilized through wider participation from the domestic and foreign private sector. Foreign investment, in particular, doesn't only inject new capital and technology into the economy, hence driving economic growth, but it also strengthens the connection with international markets and enhances export opportunities.</p><h4>The Government of Qatar has repeatedly highlighted the role of SMEs in the economic development of the country as a model for future global companies and a catalyst for GDP growth. How is the State modernizing its legislations and initiatives to protect and develop such enterprises, and increase its contribution to the GDP?</h4><p>We strongly believe in the importance and potential of SMEs in supporting economic development and achieving more inclusive growth. The Ministry took several steps toward modernizing the regulatory framework to enhance the development of new and existing businesses. We have revised several rules and policies that are perceived as cumbersome and also took several measures to lower the costs of businesses including the rental costs. The upcoming logistic and economic areas will also provide considerable space for SMEs.</p><h4>Qatar expects to post a budget deficit of USD7.8 billion in 2017. What is your economic outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Given the healthy outlook for Qatar's long-term fiscal position, such a relatively small deficit should not be seen as a major source of concern. It is worth mentioning in this context however, that fiscal deficits arising from developmental expenditures should not be treated the same as those fueled by rising current expenditures, since the former is quite superior to the other because it enhances the country's medium and long term growth capacity. I think Qatar's fiscal position will be considerably relaxed in the medium term, once major developmental projects are finalized and the country starts to benefit from the potential growth of different activities. I am very confident that our economy is on the right track. Fundamental and emerging aspects on the domestic and external fronts suggest that Qatar economy will be in a better shape this year. With an improving global energy market outlook and Qatar's additional export capacity through the newly developed Barzan gas project, fiscal concerns will further relax, hence providing a better environment for economic growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the WTC project?</h4><p>We are finally at the completion stage of Phase I of the project—our luxury residential and commercial towers. Delays have been largely due to the uncertainty in the Nigerian market; access to FX has been somewhat challenging in the new economic environment and this has caused large infrastructure projects like ours to slow down. Nevertheless, we are almost there now. Interest has been positive; we have had a good response from the market to both our residential and commercial facilities and we are looking for the macroeconomics to normalize so we can take advantage of this. For the retail component, we are in the midst of discussions with some major players that are keen on joint venturing with us on Capital Mall, and we are confident a deal will come to fruition in the very near future. We remain optimistic here at the World Trade Center regardless of the setbacks that Nigeria has encountered.</p><h4>How has the devaluation affected the timeline of your projects? </h4><p>With real estate projects like ours, the majority of the construction material is imported; however, in order to import, a company needs consistent access to foreign exchange. Without this, there are bound to be delays. In addition, from the consumers' perspective, the end price of the real estate has become more expensive.</p><h4>What are the distinguishing features of Capital Mall?</h4><p>One of the major highlights is that we are bringing a different shopping experience to Nigeria. At present, for formal retail, the South African players largely dominate the industry; however, we are trying to diverge from this by bringing a more European shopping experience to the end user. Nigerians have many affinities with different parts of Europe and are able to identify with European brands. The challenge is that as these brands establish themselves here, they are doing so for the first time, and there are plenty of challenges that they face. </p><h4>How can investors navigate these challenging macroeconomic times when scouting for good investment opportunities? </h4><p>Given the economic climate, there are plenty of “distressed“ opportunities out there that may look excellent on paper. However, investors need to be smart about what they get involved in; they need to make sure that they partner with credible organizations with track records. There are a number of factors that are not in our control right now, such as the obvious FX issues as well as uncertainty in underlying policy. Therefore, investors should not rush into any investment but rather wait until there is more transparency so that they have a better understanding of where the economy is and where it is going. </p><h4>Why should international real estate developers consider Abuja?</h4><p>It is a demand and supply game. As a developer going to invest in Lagos there are a host of properties currently on the ground; we have already seen downward pressure on pricing and therefore returns on investment may not be as attractive. In Abuja we are building something that does not exist. Also, one must not forget that Abuja is on a serious growth trajectory and there are fundamentals that make investment attractive right now. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Churchgate is very much committed to the Nigerian growth story; we have been here for 49 years and we see ourselves here in the long-term. The last 18 months have been tough for us all; we have all learnt to become more resilient and focus on our core business. We are optimistic that the macroeconomics will turn in our favor and when they do, for Nigeria, the sky is the limit. With our population and with this emerging middle class, there will be plenty of opportunities for us as a reputable developer in Nigeria. We plan to get more involved in the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest challenges that you have to overcome to provide world-class aviation standards?</h4><p>The drop in oil has sparked a large diversification drive, which has resulted in the deregulation of the economy whereby the naira is allowed to find its own level. This has affected access to spare parts, which are not manufactured in Nigeria. It is a challenge and we are going through a transition; however, we will overcome these hurdles and will, soon enough, see massive investment flow into the country again. One benefit of the drop in oil prices, however, has been the drop in the price of aviation fuel. Two major airlines recently pulled out, United from the US and Iberia from Spain; however, we still have applications from companies that want to come to Nigeria because they see the long-term potential of the country. They understand that the current problems are temporary and things will stabilize.  </p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the development of the sector?</h4><p>The government is looking at expanding and growing the aviation sector in line with international standards and best practices. We want to become a regional aviation hub in order to take advantage of Nigeria's strategic location. Additionally, we want to build other facilities for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) so that the maintenance of heavy aircraft, the type we use for commercial operation, can be done in the country. We do all this outside Nigeria. Hence, if we have the requisite facilities to do it here, it will not only develop our own industry but also attract other players. The plan is to use a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The process has already begun and the provisions are in the 2016 annual government budget. </p><h4>What type of opportunities can international investors find in the Nigerian aviation sector?</h4><p>Nigeria is a large market and along with West and Central Africa constitutes almost half the population of Africa; roughly twice the population of the US. Nigeria offers one of the highest returns on investment at over 30%. It is a place that people should explore and invest; especially in aviation. Companies can dabble in MRO, move into the manufacturing of aircraft parts, or explore the abundant opportunities in airport development, catering services, and aviation training. The UN set up a Basic Aviation Training College in Nigeria in 1964 that recently obtained the status of Regional Center of Excellence from the International Civil Aviation Organization. We are working together to ensure that in the area of human capital development for aviation, we are able to do most things locally. </p><h4>What role does NCAA play in training within the country?</h4><p>The responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority is to regulate aviation safety, security, and economics. Under these ambits, we also have training. Specifically before you conduct any aviation training, you must be approved by the NCAA. It means that we must approve the curriculum, test and certify before we give a license. We have a major role to play when it comes to aviation. A key area required is ensuring that we attract and retain qualified and experienced manpower in sufficient numbers. We are guided by all the standards and recommended practices prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization. </p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2017?</h4><p>Our objective for this year is to do better than we did last year. 2016 has been quite difficult, but that is unsurprising given the transition the economy is undergoing with the unpegging of the naira. We still want to do better in terms of safety, and keep incidents and accidents to the barest of minimums. We want to sustain and build on the successes that we have attained and also attract more businesses in the area of aviation. Our target is to use aviation as a catalyst to propel the economy of Nigeria.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential for private involvement in airport renovations and ownership, and where do you see Nigeria's airports in the near future?</h4><p>There has been modest investment by government to develop the sector. In terms of airport terminal buildings, Nigeria had to source some funding through an import-export bank loan to build or rebuild terminals at four of our airports. Entrepreneurs will find that there is huge potential for investment, especially in the general aviation infrastructure, including terminal buildings, runways, communication and navigation equipment, and security systems. The entire sector is greenfield, waiting for suitable investors to come in. It is important for interested investors to act now because the doors will be closed once we have all of the investors that we can find.</p><h4>Airfares in Nigeria are high compared to other emerging markets. From a regulatory and policy perspective, how might airfares fall?</h4><p>The first and most important step is to create competition, which is the whole idea behind the national airline we are about to create. This way we can leverage all the bilateral and multilateral agreements between us and other nations that are bringing in their planes. Emirates flies to Nigeria 21 times per week, and British Airways has a similar number of flights. If we create an entity that has the capacity to leverage those 21 flights and offer better service, then that will force those airlines to bring down their fares. The second factor is that we seek to get the government to either fund or allow the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to find investors to refine jet fuel here to help bring down costs. Jet fuel accounts for about 40% of the operating costs of an airplane, and when its cost goes up, so do ticket prices. Furthermore, the more an airline does business with Nigeria and increases traffic on a certain route, the more passengers it has and the more that airline can afford to bring down the cost of tickets. </p><h4>What are your ambitions for the national airline and toward what time frame are you working?</h4><p>The time frame is uncertain because it is dependent on a number of factors, such as how quickly we are able to form partnerships and agree on terms and conditions for potential investors. The ambition is to create an airline through private participation that is able to take advantage of the vacuum that exists due to the absence of a national carrier. That national airline could become a source not only of revenue and pride, but also for developing the wider pool of aviators in Nigeria. When Nigeria Airways existed, nearly 80% of aviators here were developed by it. One of our ambitions is to see over time our new airline similarly contributing to building local skills capacity. We can look at the case study of Ethiopian Airlines, which is owned 100% by the government, but operates with no government interference in its management. That airline has now developed the capacity for engineering, flying, support services, and so forth. It has reached the point where it was viable to create its own maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) center, which is sustained by Ethiopian Airlines' operations. It then sells the excess capacity to other airlines to leverage them to come in and partner in the country. Our ambition is to create an airline that can bring Nigeria that same level of MRO business. If we have excess capacity to sell, Nigeria is well positioned to attract client airlines. Nigeria is a shorter distance for airlines to bring their aircraft for MRO compared to Ethiopia, Europe, or the US. Our goals in creating a national airline are to create more MRO business, more capacity, take advantage of routes and the voluntary air services agreement, bring in revenue, and fly our flag all over the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Richmond Marine &amp; Offshore Logistics Limited started in 2008. What have the company's main achievements been since then?</h4><p>After registration in 2008, Richmond Marine &amp; Offshore Logistics Limited commenced operations in January 2009 with the leasing of marine vessels to ExxonMobil. We have continued to work with ExxonMobil since then under a direct contract. For this contract, we source vessels from various owners we have partnerships and MoUs with. In 2011, we also acquired our own vessels. We are looking into expanding the company, acquiring more vessels, and moving into countries such as Ghana, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. However, we have a major challenge with the downturn in the oil and gas industry. As a result, companies such as ExxonMobil, Total, and Chevron are reducing the rate at which they take offshore marine vessels. New contracts are not coming out; IOCs are just recirculating existing contracts from the last two or three years. If the price of crude oil goes up again I expect the situation to improve. We have three vessels to our name and four other vessels that we manage for other owners. We provide security vessels and personnel and conduct security patrols to safeguard platforms and offshore installations for some IOCs. We also provide escort services for foreign vessels coming into Nigeria.</p><h4>How will the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) impact the oil and gas industry and your operations as a result?</h4><p>Everything is about funding, and we need more government support for this. Indigenous companies like us have to borrow from the banks at high interest rates. We have to take out loans to acquire vessels for particular projects with IOCs, which makes business difficult. The role of the banking industry is key for our sector and the government should work with the banks and encourage them to lower their rates. We would also appreciate the government's help in removing some Catch-22s; for example, we cannot get loans from the banks to acquire vessels without proof of a contract and we cannot get a contract with an IOC without having the vessel. Settling the repayment terms for the loan is another difficulty; when our client pays us, the bank takes its repayments almost immediately, making cash flow an issue. </p><h4>How would you describe the business environment and potential partnerships available in Nigeria for international investors?</h4><p>Right now, we seek international companies to come and partner with us in Nigeria because most of the time IOCs require state-of-the-art vessels for their operations. Due to our limited financial capabilities and banking issues, we find it difficult to meet these requirements. This is a lucrative industry, but as an local company we find it difficult to see the progress we want because it is a highly capital-intensive business. We have the Nigerian content, contracts, and local contacts and knowledge; hence, we can represent a foreign company here. We need them to bring their technical know-how and vessels here to work. At the moment, there are certain contracts that we do not bid for due to a lack of specific vessels. If we had partners with those vessels we could easily carry out the work under those contracts and not miss out.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017 for Richmond Marine &amp; Offshore Logistics?</h4><p>We seek to diversify away from the oil and gas industry and into agriculture. We are not going into farming, but want to add value to agricultural products grown by local farmers. We are looking at the cleaning, grading, and processing of grains. We also want to produce feed-meal for livestock. We recently went on a trip to China to acquire the machinery we need to get started with this enterprise. We need to seek some loans next. This investment will be based in Lagos State initially under a new company name. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, Fortune Global was named one of the 10 fastest-growing companies in Nigeria. What have been the main reasons behind the company's success?</h4><p>Fortune Global started as a freight-forwarder focusing on SME clients and grew to handle multinational clients in more organized sectors of business. In 2010, we launched ourselves into oil and gas logistics and port operations. That meant we started handling a larger portfolio and major accounts. We brought Fortune Global into the limelight as a business that provides solutions to major oil and gas companies. Today, we provide end-to-end logistics and global freight-forwarding services. We have redefined the way the supply chain is handled. We enhanced our processes and brought services up to speed. What contributed to our success was that we had a bigger portfolio in terms of brand, cash flow, and revenue. Our transparency and our depth of knowledge about international freight forwarding and logistics also contributed considerably to our success.</p><h4>Fortune Global has already expanded into the US and China, and is looking to open an office in Belgium. Why did you choose these markets and what is their relationship with Nigeria?</h4><p>First and foremost, Africa and Nigeria remain markets that are not tapped yet. Europe and America are saturated but nevertheless Europe and Africa and America and Africa have a trade relationship that is robust. Fortune Global has had a presence in the US since 2013, and now we are focusing on developing the business on the African coast and within Central and Sub-Saharan Africa. We are reopening our office in Ghana, where we were incorporated in 2006 and moved into Nigeria, where we focused on building our headquarters. In the US, we are based in Houston and we also have an office in China. Our business is all about strategy and our trade relationships with these countries. Rotterdam has the largest seaport in Europe and Antwerp has the second largest. We want to strategically position ourselves in Belgium in such a way that we can interface with the rest of the African countries we trade with. We want to be the partner of choice strategically located in Europe and interfacing with Africa, the US, China, and Nigeria.</p><h4>Fortune Global services its clients by road, air, and sea. Which business lines are reporting more revenue for the company at the moment and which segments are you focusing on?</h4><p>We carry out port operations, oil and gas logistics management, port agency services, port call vessel operations, and we manage crew. Our major revenue segment is oil and gas logistics, which includes crew management and marine support logistics. We also have a global forwarding business, which is growing and through which we are operating with multinationals such as Nestlé.</p><h4>How has the profile of your human resources evolved over time?</h4><p>Recently, we have been incorporating new people into our team. Most are from Europe with experience from countries such as Belgium and Australia. We are infusing our team with people who understand the business. Unfortunately, there are few Nigerian locals who understand the global logistics business; therefore, we are reliant on expatriates to bring in knowledge and experience. We want to be the first indigenous logistics company to go to the capital markets and raise money there. We have the vision to raise the bar and have people that believe in what we do.</p><h4>How could railway change the transport and logistics sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>We will need infrastructure to support the railway system, our links to it, and the loading-unloading process for the goods being carried. There should be a good rail transportation system; however, the government needs to bring the stakeholders together to properly plan where the inland container terminals and logistics support bases will be. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the importance of the transport sector to Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>The transport sector is the second-most important sector of the economy after oil and gas. This sector is the one that affects all sectors, including oil and gas. We are currently upgrading all modes of transport, including rail, roads, sea, and air. We have been working on the seaport at Onitsha, Baro, and Lokoja. The first two are ready and the third will be ready soon. We are talking with Chinese companies to see how we can capitalize on Nigeria's internal waterways and use them as a means of transport. In railways, we are in the process of developing a plan for laying 2,650km of new railways, investing USD20 billion over a period of four years. The construction of two deep-water ports is also underway in Lekki, near Lagos, and at Ibaka in Akwa Ibom River State. The Lekki deep-water port is still in an early phase but both these developments will be critical, particularly to handle trans-shipping. </p><h4>How can you expand the capacity utilization of the dry ports in Nigeria?</h4><p>Dry ports and extensions are key, and will provide stimulus to the economy. We want our dry ports to be close to where we construct our new railways, especially the Lagos-Kano railway. </p><h4>What role does Nigeria want to play within the West African Regional Rail integration?</h4><p>We are developing this integrated system because the amount of cargo and services that can be transported within the region is huge. It is an ECOWAS-driven project and will facilitate greater trade and development of solid minerals, finished goods, agriculture, and so on, boosting the economic development of the region. </p><h4>What is your assessment on the potential of Lagos as a transport hub within the ECOWAS?</h4><p>We need more airlines coming to Nigeria and the region. This is starting to change and more airlines are coming here, such as Alitalia, Air France, United, Delta, Turkish Airlines, and Lufthansa, among others. However, we still need more regional airlines to connect our over-20 airports. Promotion of inter-regional flights and transport routes is also key to this development. In the next five years we aim to have a range of regional flights. </p><h4>After South Africa, Nigeria's air travel sector is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa. How are you working to keep this privileged position?</h4><p>We have fixed the communications aspect of air travel, and everything concerning safety to ensure that we minimize the risk of all preventable accidents. We are also building more connections with airlines. For example, Turkish Airlines will begin flights to Port Harcourt, on top of its flights to Lagos and Abuja. There is huge volume of trade going on in Nigeria, and air travel will expand to cater to these growing needs and demands. The government has plans to concede the management of four airports to improve services and create higher standards. The four airports in question are Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt.</p><h4>What legacy would you like to leave after your term of office?</h4><p>For me, the most important project for the next four years is the railway project. This will change the country greatly and have a positive impact on the economic development of Nigeria. It is a NGN4 trillion project, which is completely unprecedented. The impact will be felt in all sectors of the economy and provide employment, contributing to Nigeria on both a macro and micro level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your AutoReg solution changed the situation for roads and traffic in Nigeria?</h4><p>We launched our AutoReg vehicle solutions in 2007, and this was the first time a system was established in Nigeria to deliver a set of government objectives for vehicle control. It meant we were able to fully capture government revenue through vehicle taxes using an accountable and transparent process. The system delivered a robust and credible service for vehicle owners. This kind of system allows informed decisions to be made in structural planning to make wider aims easier to achieve. Prior to our involvement, the best registration process was in Lagos, but even there it took between two weeks and infinity to get vehicle licenses renewed. We wanted to achieve a reasonable and sustainable turn-around time. What we achieved was a maximum turn-around time of five minutes. In Lagos alone, from 36 processing outlets we created almost 1,000 within one year, as well as an online portal. We have transparency as well as access to reliable information about vehicle owners. Everyone is now comfortable with this system and Lagos State now collects more than five times the volume of collection when it was being manually operated. We have since introduced AutoReg into 25 states in Nigeria. Having this vehicle license registration process makes it impossible for stolen vehicles to be transferred to new owners.</p><h4>What other solutions have you worked on in collaboration with the government to improve accountability, transparency, and security?</h4><p>One of our other software solutions is the Regulated Products Administration &amp; Management Solution, which was initially built for the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration &amp; Control (NAFDAC) System. The platform gives NAFDAC a platform for seamless approval of the sale of food, drugs, and other regulated products for sale in Nigeria. It used to take upward of nine months to get an approval, but now it can take less than a 90 days. This service was recently adjudged the best ICT solution by the Commonwealth Telecommunication Organisation (CTO).</p><h4>What solutions do you offer to the private sector?</h4><p>We are working in education with our P-SEAMS service offering. This is a tailored school management online solution that automates the administrative processes in a school with a unique feature that allows parents to monitor what is happening with their child's education. P-SEAMS also facilitates smart allocation of resources within a school. The Egole shopping e-commerce platform is another offering that is designed to address the critical challenges limiting the growth of SMEs, including the need for accountability and transparency in financial management. We initially designed SMELite in conjunction with a particular commercial bank that controls a major share of the banking market in Nigeria. Companies approach us for customized applications designed but our largest service is website hosting, design, development, and other such services under our Webpeople product. We have designed and developed over 2,000 websites along with hosting services over the past three to four years and we believe we are the largest provider of these services across West Africa. We design websites for as little as NGN15,000 including design, development, buying the domain name acquisition, and hosting for a year.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are positioning our systems, resources, and strategy to take advantage of 2017. The economy has come down and it is struggling to get back up again, but this is where we find opportunities. We have positioned our business so as not to be too affected by foreign exchange issues, materials and resources coming from abroad, and internal government policies. This means we can continue to expand. We are also hoping to strengthen our presence in economies outside Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[talk-directly-to-businesses]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of FinTrak Software in Nigeria?</h4><p>FinTrak Software started in 2006 as a consultancy firm. Our core business focus was technology and financial consulting services. Over the years we discovered that our technology arm was becoming too big to manage as a consultancy company. Therefore, in 2013 we formed FinTrak Software to take over the technology business. One of the factors that has distinguished us as a software company is our subject matter expertise in the solutions environment. A number of us in the executive management team have a diverse background spanning consulting, banking, internal and external auditing, and other financial services experience. We have hands-on experience of the relevant problem areas coupled with the technological know-how to deliver solutions that fit. This means our solutions talk directly to business. This is one critical edge FinTrak Software has as a company.</p><h4>How has the company's portfolio of solutions developed over the years?</h4><p>Our mission is to be the number-one global enterprise solutions provider. One of the problems that businesses face today is that they do not have a single solution that enables them to do all of their business. They end up buying different solutions to deal with different problem areas. This makes coordination of their overall IT systems a problem. Our objective is to provide enterprise solutions that clients can use to drive their business from A to Z. Our focus is on enterprise. As enterprise solution providers in the banking environment, we offer a complete banking system. This has various solution components that financial services industry players require from retail to corporate banking, credit processing, internet and mobile banking, and e-payment solutions. At the back-end of this there is data warehousing and business intelligence. This is massive in scope. Our structure is such that we have groups focused on the various business segments in a coordinated environment that ensures that everything sits well together. The beauty of this is we are able to meet the needs of any organization within our business scope. If companies are not seeking to change their core banking system then they can perhaps look just at the areas where they have problems. We can provide solutions specifically for those areas. Fintrak Software is also the leading player in Africa for financial reporting solutions based on international financial reporting standards (IFRS). We are the only local player in that domain. We have also taken this solution outside to other countries in Africa.</p><h4>Aside from banking, what other sectors do you want to target in the near future with your software solutions?</h4><p>We currently work a great deal with banks; however, we have certain solutions like our ERP Software solution that talk to every business. That solution has a Finance/Ledger System module that every business entity can use; it also covers all back-office activities including procurement, planning, processing, fleet management, fixed asset, equipment, and transport logistics management. It covers the full cycle of businesses, including human capital management. It talks to all industries from oil and gas companies to manufacturing and virtually every other sector of the economy. We have plans to come out with a scaled-down version of this solution for SMEs.</p><h4>What role can FinTrak Software play as a software developer to change the ICT environment and the lives of people in Nigeria as a result?</h4><p>One of the ways we use the internet to help businesses is with mobile solutions and these help reduce transaction processing time. Our enterprise resource management system is an ERP platform that enables a client's entire workforce to do various activities and, if required, to rely on that via their mobile devices. This helps to achieve a quick turnaround in transaction processing. We also have internet banking solutions so that customers can interact with their bank from anywhere in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Nigerian government intends to increase broadband penetration to 30% by 2018. What are the government's strategies to realize this goal?</h4><p>The government's business is not about using its own resources for the purpose of investment in infrastructure. All the government does is provide an enabling environment for private sector participation. We are in talks with local and foreign investors to let them know about the opportunities that exist. Many local and foreign entrepreneurs have already made some investments in the sector and further proposals are coming. Some want to use conventional broadband, such as placing fiber optics underground, while others are even bringing the novel idea of placing the fiber-optic cables on the electricity poles around the country. We are happy with the regulatory environment that has been created, which, combined with the huge population and stable government, illustrates to investors that Nigeria is the place to go. We are optimistic we will be able to meet our target of 30% penetration within the shortest possible time.</p><h4>You mentioned that the broadband penetration will reach rural areas. How will this impact the day-to-day life of rural communities?</h4><p>In moving broadband from one city to another, a certain amount of the rural areas in between will get connectivity as well. We have governmental institutions all over this country, and we want all of them to take advantage of the opportunities that ICT presents. Life in the rural areas can change considerably with access to ICT. They can be better educated, because they have access to virtual libraries and are able to communicate and create opportunities for new businesses. From my village, about 150km from Ibadan, around 800 vehicles come to the city daily to buy one thing or the other; however, if we have enough connectivity e-commerce will thrive and people will not have to make the daily journey to bigger cities.</p><h4>How can new technologies help the government in its quest to promote greater transparency and reduce corruption?</h4><p>Through the e-governance process, the government will be able to increase efficiency and fight corruption, making the economy robust in the sense that it decreases the need to carry cash. ICT also provides us with more options in terms of payment systems. Even in terms of salary e-payments, it is easier and more transparent and the likelihood of employees receiving what they should is increased. Within the banking sector, digitalization through ATM networks is speeding banking processes. E-banking is possible through smart phones and it is more efficient because people do not have to travel to a bank in order to make and receive payments. We see e-governance as a way of providing solutions to businesses, education, and the agricultural sector in particular, as well as mining and all aspects of governance.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of ICT and communications to diversify the economy and create economic growth?</h4><p>Nigeria for a long time has depended on oil and gas as a means to powering its economy. That became a burden because it prevented us from exploring other natural resources. More people are engaging in ICT over oil and gas or mining. This is purely due to the fact that investment in those resources can take generations to generate a ROI. In comparison, the ICT sector, firstly, is non-exploitative and is not an extractive industry, and, therefore, we do not need much investment when compared with other. Many countries that do not have natural resources rely on human resourcefulness instead. On the continent, countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, and South Africa use and rely on ICT to develop businesses and drive their economy. Even though we are a late starter, we believe that we are realizing the potential that ICT can hold in diversifying the Nigerian economy. We have started and believe it is something that will not stop. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures is the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment taking to reverse or minimize the effects of current industry challenges?</h4><p>One thing this administration has been able to do is ensure that it takes advantage of the synergies amongst the different ministries, departments, agencies, and parastatals. We see ourselves as united in tackling the challenges facing our manufacturing sector. In terms of fiscal and monetary policies, there are many discussions going on. We are aligning our fiscal and monetary policies for proper impact to be felt especially by the manufacturing sector. Efforts are also being made to tackle energy issues, credit access, and forex problems. Recently, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced the dedication of 60% of all available forex for the manufacturing sector in addition to the adoption of a flexible forex regime.</p><h4>What type of incentives does the ministry provide for international investors?</h4><p>Nigeria is open for business and our main focus is on improving the business climate by creating a friendly environment for doing business. It is in that vein that President Buhari approved the establishment of a Presidential Council on Ease of Doing Business tasked with the responsibility of removing all the bottlenecks that impede smooth business operations in the country. We have also signed numerous investment promotion and protection agreements with several countries to fast-track investment flow. There are also comprehensive packages of incentives and relief, which are sector specific. For instance, the sugar sector has incentives such as development of free feasibility studies, provision of improved seed cane, and long-term land lease of up to 99 years in addition to the provision allowing all investors to legally repatriate profits. We have several investor-attractive incentives such as the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) and pioneer status (tax holiday for pioneer companies ranging between three and five years), which are currently under review and have been some of the biggest incentives enjoyed by investors. The revised waivers and incentives scheme will be taken to the federal executive council for approval. In the area of access to land and acquisition, discussions are ongoing with various state governments to facilitate access to land.</p><h4>There are many large international industrial companies in the country. How can the ministry ensure that those investments translate into maximum benefits for Nigeria?</h4><p>The ministry is focused on the implementation of the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) and the Nigerian Enterprise Development Program (NEDEP). These are policies aimed at boosting industrialization and support for micro, small, and medium enterprises and ensuring that the benefits of all investments are fully tapped, especially the provision of jobs to our teeming youths and improved contribution to the GDP. This provides a platform for the implementation of the industrial, trade, and investment policies of the government, on the foundations of macroeconomic stability and fundamental improvements in the enabling environment for doing business in Nigeria.</p><h4>What should be done to empower and unleash the potential of girls and women in Nigeria and across Africa?</h4><p>Education is key here, and girls need to be educated. School enrolment represents the largest component in human capital investment. Education bestows on girls and women a disposition for lifelong socioeconomic skills. It is essential therefore that both governments and the private sector encourage and institute scholarships specially dedicated to promoting education for girls. Women make up over 60% of SME ownerships and have the highest rate of loan repayment. It is, however, ironic that this demographic faces the most daunting challenges in business in terms of access to land and finance. We need to create more opportunities that provide access to finance and markets for women. Businesses and industries should be encouraged to see the importance of employing women in the workplace and the advantages it brings to efficiency and business sustainability. We need to give women more opportunities and roles to play. We need to be challenged more and acknowledged for the great and exceptional work that we are doing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has changed for Saudia Private Aviation (SPA) over the last year?</h4><p>Diversification is one thing that has become a focus, just like in any other industry. Private aviation and the general aviation sector are still considered to be young industries in Saudi Arabia, and therefore a lot of development has taken place over the past five years. This is part of the life cycle of the industry and is needed to reach a more mature stage. Saudia Private Aviation (SPA) is the investment arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines in the private aviation sector. We feel our responsibility as the largest player in the market is to try and contribute more to the restructuring of the sector in the Kingdom. Our starting point was as part of the overall 2020 transformation vision of Saudi Arabian Airlines. Out of that we have developed our five-year strategic plan which basically revolves around the integrated private aviation business model. For us, “integrated" means four plus one, meaning five lines of business. The first arm is the charter business that we have been operating for over 30 years. We have 10 aircraft of our own, both Hawker and Falcon. We have expanded into aircraft management, which we were not involved in before. Collectively with our partner, PrivatAir Saudi Arabia, we have more than 14 aircraft under management, and SPA has more than 48 additional aircraft under management. Another arm is our ground handling business for private aircraft and we took this from scratch. We have adopted the industry's best practices and processes, and today this business is one of SPA's main revenue sources. We believe this is a good business line to test the market. We have double-digit market share growth, which shows the potential here. We are also considering expanding in the area of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO). We are doing some analysis on this and looking at strategic joint ventures for knowledge transfer in the MRO field. We are in negotiations with several highly rated international companies regarding this. The fifth revenue stream is Saudia ALBAYRAQ and we are proud of this. Saudia ALBAYRAQ is a new service that is part of our diversification strategy. It creates a new segment between private aircraft ownership and first class air travel. Saudia ALBAYRAQ is jointly operated by us and Saudi Arabian Airlines. It complements Saudi Arabian Airlines' new business model as it has shifted from having three classes, first, business, and economy, into a two-class airline. Saudia ALBAYRAQ supplements this with a first-class product. The service flies between Jeddah and Riyadh, which are two key cities that facilitate a lot of the Kingdom's economy. We started Saudia ALBAYRAQ in June 2016 and are noticing significant growth month-on-month. We provide 12 flights per day each way between Jeddah and Riyadh at three-hour intervals, starting at six o'clock in the morning. You can book seats through our website. We consider this route to be Phase I, and eventually we would like to fly to Dammam and possibly Dubai as well.</p><h4>What accounts for the significant growth SPA has seen in its ground handling business? What strategies are you using to encourage owners of private aircraft to use your ground handling services?</h4><p>The new airline Sky Prime Private Aviation is one of our customers. Our client list covers most of the major operators within Saudi Arabia, for example Saudi Aramco and many high-net-worth individuals who are owners of their own aircraft. In terms of strategy we segregate the market into three categories because different operators have different needs. So our market segments are local operators, international operators within the Middle East region, and international operators from outside the region. Our priority is to focus on the first two segments of local and regional operators. Our simple philosophy is to develop good processes and a good service and the customers will come. This is exactly what we have been doing. We have adopted state-of-the-art infrastructure in terms of ground handling systems and software. We have changed our equipment to the latest available. The average age of our ground handling equipment is six months. We are keen to invest in this business because we see its potential. Ground handling services are now one of our major revenue drivers. Additionally, the whole aviation industry is becoming much more mature and the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) has recently updated its regulations. With the new regulations they have to comply with standards that apply the same level and restrictions as for commercial airliners. The structure encourages private owners to go to a professional company, like SPA, which is qualified to do the job. We have been preparing ourselves for this change. We are one of the first companies with a system that allows owners to go online and review all the work that has been done on their aircraft along with a cost breakdown. SPA is considered to be a worldwide leader in implementing this type of system. This is part of our vision to elevate the aircraft management business within Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How does SPA fit into the overall aviation sector and the reforms in the National Transformation Plan?</h4><p>The whole essence of the 2030 Vision is basically about privatization to increase performance and efficiency in Saudi Arabia's government sectors. SPA and Saudi Arabian Airlines are just a reflection of this vision. A few years back we would have spoken in an entirely different tone, but now with the emphasis on privatization we have changed the way we think and behave, as well as our efficiency and diversification of revenue. Considering what we have seen before and after privatization and how the company transformed, we would definitely like to see all the other government entities and sectors go through the same transformation that SPA and some of the other subsidiaries of Saudi Arabian Airlines have been through. It has delivered good results to the customers, and it has improved the process and KPIs. At the end of the day, if you can manage your business in a commercial way there is a financial gain right away. To sum it up, Vision 2030 is more about efficiency and in order to achieve efficiency you need privatization. Saudi Arabian Airlines was one of the targeted entities for privatization. Therefore, SPA is one of the companies that has recently been through the privatization process with 30% of the business being sold to private investors. We have seen the change this has brought to the whole culture of the organization. We have been working on this transaction for the last couple of years and completed the process in July 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[much-momentum]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government intends to increase broadband penetration to 30% in 2018. What role does the NCC play in achieving this goal?</h4><p>The penetration rate today stands at 21%, and this figure comes from the ITU-UNESCO Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development on September 2016. We were pleasantly surprised because we thought the figure would hover around 14%. We have nine percentage points to go by 2018, and it looks increasingly likely we will reach that 30% target—if not surpass it—with recent 4G LTE services that have been, and will be, introduced into the sector. This is made possible by two things, the first being our careful deployment of available spectrum. Recently, we auctioned the 2.6GHz spectrum and, during that auction, MTN emerged as the preferred bidder with six slots totaling about 30MHz. We still have eight to sell. After that successful auction, we did a post-mortem to determine why other operators did not participate in the process. The stakeholders, and operators in particular, have made great suggestions. We have collated all observations and suggestions and will examine them and again embark on another auction for the remaining eight slots. We are not as concerned about money as about reaching our broadband penetration targets. Our intention is to ensure we achieve the 30% target by 2018. The second issue is infrastructure. If we do not have the infrastructure to roll out broadband services, the target will not be reached. We studied the fiber-optic map in the country to determine the access gaps that need filling. We do not make guesses but act on hard facts and information to ensure the gaps are plugged as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. If we can get the spectrum and infrastructure to the level they need to be and at the right pace, our 2018 target is achievable and the current momentum looks great.</p><h4>The government also wants to improve transparency and accountability in the country. What can the NCC do to facilitate that objective?</h4><p>ICTs are generally adopted and used in a country for specific purposes and goals, and among the most important of those aims is to guarantee transparency and accountability in governance. ICTs play an important role in this sense, more important perhaps than any other benefits from the adoption and use of ICT. Transparency and accountability hold people in power in check, keep them honest, and make citizens feel included in the government process. These are in the overall interests of any polity and society. It increases trust in politics, economics, corporations, and society and allows all citizens to feel a greater sense of belonging and security.</p><h4>The NCC received the European Awards for Best Practices in 2016. What are the factors behind that success?</h4><p>When we unveiled our eight-item agenda, we stated our commitment to regulatory excellence and operational efficiency. We have stuck to this commitment, and the award is proof that our efforts have been recognized and appreciated. It attests to the fact that we are on the right track in implementing our eight-fold agenda. This award will inspire us to do more to maintain the confidence of our citizens and to improve the quality of our services to positively impact Nigeria's socioeconomic development.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with other regulatory bodies in the ECOWAS region to grow the sector in West Africa?</h4><p>We are an important member of the African Telecommunications Union (ATU) and the West African Telecommunications Regulators Association (WATRA). The purpose of establishing ATU and WATRA was to ensure collaboration and exchange of ideas consistent with global best practices for the benefit of all member nations. We deal with, discuss, and interact over regulatory issues, learning from and helping each other develop the best regulatory frameworks for each member state in order to help us attain our short-, medium-, and long-term goals as well as deepen the adoption and use of ICT. It has been a beneficial experience for us all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to the history and background of Svengali Designs?</h4><p>Svengali was born over my intense passion for architecture and design. In hindsight, I think that I was meant to be in the design industry. After four years of practicing law, I resigned and started a small business trading in interior accessories. From there, I went into the manufacturing of wrought iron furniture in 1993. It was not popular at the time but, within a year, it blew up, became popular by demand, and I became an unexpected pioneer. From wrought iron, I moved to stainless steel balustrades and then wood-based furniture production. It was in the production of wood-based furniture that our creativity finally shone and since then we have not looked back. </p><h4>How has the profile of your clients evolved over time?</h4><p>Initially, when we first started, people were constantly surprised by our mettle. Our designs are bespoke and original. Over time, people gravitate toward Svengali because they identify with my eclectic and contemporary sense of style. It is like a homecoming of sorts. They understand what they want and trust that I have the capacity and ability to deliver on their expectations. Sometimes, they come in and want my personal input in their designs. They realize that there is an Anselm element involved, a certain je ne sais quoi that they covet. I never shy away from that. Such is the attraction for our brand; hands on and committed to customer satisfaction. Generally, our clientele has evolved from individuals seeking quirky furniture pieces to corporates desiring lifestyle experiences in their workplaces.</p><h4>How would you describe the competitive landscape of the furniture market in Nigeria?</h4><p>There is a slow general awakening going on. More people are travelling and coming back with various ideas on how they want their furniture to be or from a retail perspective a unique offering that is peculiar to them. Advanced courses on design are being taught in schools. Science and technology are taking over all that we do. It is getting more diverse with varying elements. Increasingly, with internet penetration at its highest people are constantly going online and seeking new style and concepts. So to stay ahead of the curve one has to constantly innovate and create new concepts.</p><h4>How much more room for growth would you say there is for the company in Nigeria?</h4><p>We are definitely ahead of our competition in Nigeria, but it would be foolhardy to think that we have arrived. There is always more room for growth. New concepts in art and design keep coming up. We have to constantly keep our finger on all the necessary pulses. We have to keep plowing on, being the pioneers that we are.</p><h4>What are your expansion and development plans for the near future?</h4><p>In line with the backward integration policies of the current government to encourage local production, we are in pole position to drive the policy and elevate our production capacity to fill the expected void in the market place. Also, the synergy we have created with our sister company Fahrenheit meant that as it embarks on its aggressive brand roll out Svengali shall be providing outfitting services for every property so it looks to be a busy period in our medium- to long-term calendar.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in the country for the manufacturing industry?</h4><p>Higher production costs resulting from worsening power outages, high cost of funding, insecurity, infrastructural deficiencies, foreign exchange crisis, and sourcing raw materials among others are some of the major challenges we are currently experiencing. The business environment is indeed a challenging one for the manufacturing industry at the moment. However, we are optimistic that some of these challenges will peter out as the new administration embarks on its diversification policies, which we hope will bring about a new critical thinking on the ease of doing business in the market place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you introduce us to Eta-Zuma's operations in Nigeria?</h4><p>The Eta-Zuma Group is a group of seven companies engaged in the business of solid mineral development, steel production, power generation, and exploration and mining. Nigeria has huge gaps in these sectors, which we see not only as challenges, but as opportunities. Eta-Zuma seeks to fill these gaps.</p><h4>One of President Buhari's main goals is to tackle the country's energy deficit. What role does Eta-Zuma play in supporting this objective?</h4><p>One of our flagship projects is the development of a 1,200MW coal-fired power plant, for which the first phase of 300MW is already reaching the first stage of financial closure. After that we can start construction, which will take 30 months. We are also developing a 400MW gas-fired power generation plant in the southeast. For this project we have obtained all the permits and licenses, and will soon sign the gas purchase agreement to provide gas for this project.</p><h4>In 1Q2016 Eta-Zuma signed a PPA with Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading for USD12 billion; can you elaborate on that agreement?</h4><p>The MoU involves the first phase of the project's 300MW, which is already at the advanced stage. We have signed a PPA and will conclude the financial close. The USD12 billion is for a 25-year purchase agreement, with a five-year provision for construction and 20 years for actual operations.</p><h4>The government is eager to diversify the economy and solid minerals offer one area for potential. What investments is Eta-Zuma making in this sector?</h4><p>We have invested in the exploration part of the business chain, which is critical for any mining. When starting the business we discovered that there was no equipment suitable for this purpose and invested heavily in equipment and created one of the best-equipped mobile exploration teams in the country, importing brand-new equipment such as drilling rigs and mobile operators and all the required geophysical equipment. At the moment we are exploring in Kogi State, we have also been in Sokoto State, and are exploring for gold in Zamfara State, where we have just acquired a gold mining lease. We also have another gold mining lease in Kogi State.</p><h4>How would you describe the current state of the steel industry?</h4><p>The steel industry is non-existent, which creates big opportunities. We have invested in the Steel Rolling Company, which was one of the previous government's assets, acquiring 100%. We are also involved in iron ore exploration so we could coproduce steel bars. The problem is that the process needs a great deal of power, and we lack power in Nigeria. The government could further support the sector by allowing only those companies that have invested in the sector to import steel. This would allow these companies to import and then sell that steel within the country and with the profits they generate from these activities they would be able to further invest in the development of the steel sector. We have the steel, the market, the people, and the raw materials; what we need is for the government to meet us half way.</p><h4>How many people does Eta-Zuma currently employ?</h4><p>At this time, we have less than 600 staff, because we employ many sub-contractors; however, we create jobs indirectly. Our vision is to harness the abundant human resources and mineral resources in Nigeria to power the country's economic growth. We outsource a great deal but empower SMEs so that we can concentrate on what we do best.</p><h4>How would you describe the current business climate for foreign investors?</h4><p>The current business climate in Nigeria is great. The only challenges are the infrastructure deficit and power generation. Any investor planning to come to Nigeria needs to understand that there are limitations in regards to infrastructure and their business model should contain some contingencies that address these shortcomings and allocate costs for providing a certain level of infrastructure that they need. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the company since 2008?</h4><p>Proforce was established in 2008 as a defense solutions provider. It has grown from strength to strength and we have continuously collaborated with the public sector as our main client. We have been able to export our services to other governments such as Rwanda, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Our vehicles are of international standard, and we have a wide range of armored vehicles. One of our strengths is our partnership with experts all over the world in Israel, South Africa, and the US. With all this knowledge we built our own facility in Nigeria to produce armored personnel carriers and other military-grade apparatus. We recently signed an MoU with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to start producing fighter jets, warships, drones, armored aerial vehicles, and mine-resistant ambush personnel carriers, too. We started with mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, which have a gross vehicle weight of 19 tons each. In the area of ammunitions, we partner with companies from South Africa to assemble those ones in Nigeria, too. President Muhammadu Buhari wants the military industry to take off immediately; hence, Proforce is partnering with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to push that forward.</p><h4>How would you describe the Proforce Defense manufacturing facilities?</h4><p>We have a facility where we build armored personnel carriers (APCs) in Ogun State, and we produce about 40 vehicles per month, or a total of around 480 vehicles a year. A second facility in Port Harcourt produces about 15 vehicles per month. We have another facility that we are putting together in Abuja and another in Katsina with which we are collaborating with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to produce about 20 vehicles per month.</p><h4>How do you train and retain your staff and foster innovation?</h4><p>We send some of our staff abroad for training. We have a challenge with human capital but all we need to do is continue to change hands until we get the right set of people. Expatriates should not be the solution because after having them for two years they typically want to leave. Also, if a company pays salaries in dollars, the cost compared to our Nigerian workforce is high. Instead, we prefer to train Nigerians well and bring down costs. In terms of R&amp;D, this is the backbone of the company. We have an R&amp;D unit and that is completely devoted to innovation. For example, we looked at new designs for APCs and continue to invest a certain percentage of our profits every year in R&amp;D.</p><h4>How does Proforce Defence contribute to the modernization of Nigeria's armed forces?</h4><p>We are a versatile company and have worked hard to include the armed forces of Nigeria in the majority of the things we do. We have regular interactions and incorporate a number of the things from their own practical experience. For example, the Nigerian armed forces are at risk of overheating due to the high temperatures in the north east; APCs from abroad sometimes cannot cope with the heat and run into problems with their tires. We have been able to incorporate solutions to these challenges into our own vehicles and come up with a truly Nigerian vehicle.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment for international investors looking to come to Nigeria?</h4><p>The business environment in Nigeria is encouraging. Sometimes what we see and read on the news is only one side of the coin. Most Nigerians understand that the news from this country is often bad news and the opportunities and advantages are never publicized. Nigeria is a secure country. Of course, there are some parts that are not safe; however, on the whole, it is the place to be because there are many opportunities in Nigeria. It is our job to make sure that security is not an issue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements for BASF West Africa Limited since opening in Nigeria in 2012?</h4><p>Our focus on Nigeria is due to the size of the country and the confidence we have in its future. We are involved in a wide range of industries spanning from agriculture, construction, appliances, shoes, hygiene, and beauty to construction and oil and gas. Being actively involved with these industries, BASF acts as an enabler for our customers to create value for the man on the street.</p><h4>In which of Nigeria's sectors can BASF West Africa create the most value?</h4><p>We have eight business units operating in Nigeria currently. However, looking at the specific needs of Nigeria, our focus is on developing a project for sustainable and affordable housing through our construction chemicals business unit. In addition, our agricultural and food nutrition business units can add value and offer solutions for food security within the country. We are engaged with various stakeholders to ensure we target the right industries, advocating advanced life-sustaining benefits to every individual.</p><h4>Which of BASF's products hold the most potential in terms of future demand from the Nigerian market?</h4><p>Infrastructure is perhaps the biggest but also most important area of development in Nigeria; anything that relates to construction, roads, and the renovation of existing buildings, bridges, and other structures is key for us. This is why our construction chemicals unit was the first to establish a footprint in Lagos by opening a manufacturing facility in 2016. The agricultural business unit is growing due to the need for food production and crop protection, and our performance materials unit works alongside the agricultural division to combat food spoilage caused by poor storage of perishables. The division's cold-chain solutions can preserve and keep fruits and vegetables fresh during the crucial period before they reach customers.</p><h4>What role can the company play in helping Nigeria reach the government's objective of diversifying the economy?</h4><p>BASF is involved in innumerable industries; our products may not be seen, but they are used in everyday life. For us, localizing is key and there are many ways to contribute. We have started by developing local teams within all the business units and from a business point of view to take the time to understand the local environment, dynamics, and diverse customer needs. We create opportunities and contribute to unlocking industries, with an understanding that we will need to be flexible and adapt our solutions as required.</p><h4>How can BASF achieve its strong sustainability objectives here in Nigeria?</h4><p>Sustainability is at the center of everything we do. This concept runs throughout our business units. We actively scout for projects by engaging with the local authorities, agencies, and NGOs, thereby working in partnership with all our stakeholders on the importance of sustainability. Over and above the economic and environmental dimension in sustainability, there is also a social element that is critical to us. Because we operate among communities, we create value not just for our customers, but also for the country itself.</p><h4>What is the significance of West Africa, and the Nigerian market in particular, for the overall strategy of the company worldwide?</h4><p>Nigeria is an important market for several reasons. We also know Nigeria has an impact not just on itself and its people, but also around it and its neighbors, as stated by Christine Lagarde. BASF will continue to invest in resources, its people, and our assets in Nigeria as we envisage helping to drive the Nigerian market to become fully captured both from an investor and consumer point of view.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Our goal is to continue on our path of growth regardless of the current turbulent conditions. With the right focus and our dedicated team leveraging its capabilities, 2017 will be even better than 2016. Like for our peers and customers, addressing the foreign exchange topic will remain a priority for us; however, our experience from 2016 showed that mastering this challenge can contribute to business development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Nigeria for the overall operations of the company on the continent and worldwide?</h4><p>Saipem has been working in Nigeria since the mid 1960s. It operates through Saipem Contracting (Nigeria) and Saipem (Nigeria) Ltd and has offices in Lagos, a fabrication yard in Rumuolumeni (Port Harcourt), logistics bases in Onne and Warri, and various other project sites (Tunu, Rumuji, and Lekki). Nigeria has always represented an important location for Saipem. In 2017 we will have been continuously present in the country for 50 years. The company promotes local content through long-term investments and by establishing partnerships with local companies, using local workers and procuring goods and services locally. Saipem Contracting Nigeria Limited has been an integral part of the country's oil and gas industry, but has something to offer in all areas of the energy sector. We have been involved in both onshore and offshore drilling, in the shallow and deepwater offshore business, and in the onshore sector with projects involving pipelines, power plants, fertilizers, and refineries. The company has a large footprint in Nigeria, with approximately 3,900 employees, 95% of whom are local, while our major investment is in Port Harcourt, where we have a 1 million sqm fabrication yard and base, one of the largest in West Africa.</p><h4>What is Saipem Contracting Nigeria Limited's current relationship with its clients?</h4><p>Saipem has worked for a number of different clients as Total, Shell, Eni, and Chevron. Among the most recently completed projects we can highlight the Otumara-Saghara-Escravos Pipeline project for Shell Petroleum Development Co, encompassing the engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of a network of pipelines in a swamp area to connect the client's flow stations in the Otumara, Saghara, and Escravos fields. There is also the project for the second train of the Afam Central Power Plant for the Rivers State government. Finally, the semi-submersible drilling rig Scarabeo 3 operated in Nigeria for Addax, concluding its scope of work toward the end of 2015.</p><h4>In 2015, Saipem entered into a joint venture with Dangote for West and Central Africa. What is the significance of this partnership for the future of Saipem in the continent?</h4><p>The Joint Venture saw the creation of a new company named Saipem Dangote E&amp;C, a significant new player in the Nigerian and Central/West African market, with high technical and financial capabilities. It aims to secure complex engineering and construction (E&amp;C) projects and ensure a realization capacity focused on efficiency in terms of costs, timing and flexibility in order to respond to different needs related to local content and to the specificities of individual projects and countries. To develop new business, the JV will benefit from Dangote's financial strength, expertise, and standing in the Sub—Saharan African market, where it has launched a significant oil and gas investment program, complemented by Saipem's unique capabilities in E&amp;C. We have a great deal of trust in this collaborative venture, which confirms our shared commitment to the Nigerian market and to sub-Saharan Africa more generally.</p><h4>What are your expectations and key projects for 2017?</h4><p>The entire industry has been suffering in the last few years with the current market situation and this applies particularly to Nigeria, where basically we have received no new projects. That said, some investments and projects are gradually starting to move. In the meantime, we are completing some very important projects such as the Egina UFR field for Total Upstream Nigeria Ltd. Activities are also underway on the EPCI contract for the subsea development of the Egina field. Furthermore, work continues on the Dangote Fertilizer project for Dangote Fertilizer Ltd on a new urea and ammonia facility, and on the Southern Swamp Associated Gas Solution project for Shell Petroleum Development Co for the construction of various compression facilities. Finally, we are completing the Northern Option project for Total Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd (TEPNG), which involves a pipeline connecting Rumuji to the Imo River. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At a time when many international companies want to enter the market, what does it mean for Energia to be a wholly indigenous E&amp;P company?</h4><p>This is a natural resource company and therefore we are dealing with nature and that is indigenous. The owners should participate in the country's natural endowment. We expect nothing less. </p><h4>Last year you mentioned plans to build a refinery (together with your partners) with a modular plan scalable to 30,000bpd in capacity. What is the status of this project?</h4><p>We have moved forward two steps. We scaled down to a 10,000bpd plant for a start. We have our first license to establish (LTE) from DPR, and we have signed a contract with an EPC contractor in Houston for Front End Engineering Design (F.E.E.D), after which we will go into the engineering work, fabrication, installation and then commissioning. We are also working on several agreements with potential offtakers and project managers. The refinery will be a completely separate entity as it is downstream and different from our upstream E&amp;P business, which means that we are adding further value in country. The upstream segment will be trading with the downstream company through an arms-length agreement. Our plan is to commence clearing the refinery site in 2016 to prepare for the utility facilities construction. This is while the Houston EPC contractor works on the fabrication of the main processing plant. We are targeting 1Q2019 for the plant's commissioning.</p><h4>Will the final products from the refinery be for the domestic market or for export?</h4><p>For now it is intended principally for the domestic market. We operate out of Delta State so we have a certain catchment area and it will not be a big refinery plant.</p><h4>What impact has poor global oil prices had on Energia Limited and how are you dealing with this challenge?</h4><p>It changed because rather than importing, the US started producing. OPEC used to take the heat, but on this occasion it said no, and all members want to maintain their market share. However, this situation creates a wider positive outlook because it is going to make the industry more innovative and efficient. For oil-dependent economies such as Nigeria, it is going to help us look inward.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to help companies face this tough economic situation?</h4><p>Before the price fell, the government sat on the Petroleum Industries Bill (PIB), but it is now clear that it has to deal with the reforms. But, it has also seen that it is not going to be easy within the present structure. Therefore, it is going to phase it in. This will provide the regulatory framework to give investors the support they need, such as what terms will guide their investments. The government still has a lot of challenges and only four years to turn things around and we are hoping this will happen.</p><h4>What is Energia Limited's role in terms of social and economic development of the country through CSR programs and employment initiatives?</h4><p>We give about 4% of our gross revenue to CSR and have a trust fund that we set up to manage this money, whose board meets on a quarterly basis. We have set up a community parliament where we meet to discuss issues. We have established a number of institutions, including a secondary school, and one of our communities is building a new housing estate. We pave roads, and we have created and funded a community security program as well.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our goal for 2016 is to remain successful because we believe we are one of the lowest cost producing companies in the country. We produce at USD18 per barrel. Even if the price of oil comes down to USD20 we will still be in business. This is our plan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Nigeria for the overall revenue and strategy of the company worldwide and in Africa?</h4><p>Weatherford has been in the country since 1975. Globally, Nigeria is seen quite strategically because when you look at Africa, Nigeria is usually the highest producer of barrels on a daily basis, although Angola overtook temporarily. With any global company, if you are going to operate globally you have to ensure that your presence in Nigeria is strong. You cannot be a strong participant in the global hydrocarbon economy unless you are in the biggest markets, which makes Weatherford Nigeria strategic to Weatherford International's operations. We enjoy all the support that comes with that in terms of equipment, assets, expertise, and training, and in turn we are justifying that assistance with our business activities in Nigeria.</p><h4>What are your investment and development plans in the country for the near future?</h4><p>We continue to expand our portfolio. In 2015, we brought in additional business units, drilling services, managed pressure drilling (MPD), and drilling tools. We did this in a period of downturn, proving that we are not just looking at the short term but also further into the future, which goes a long way to support the strategic positioning of Weatherford in Nigeria.</p><h4>What type of solutions can you offer to oil companies to help them become more efficient and reduce costs?</h4><p>There are some costs that cannot be controled; for example, security, which we have to provide for our personnel and assets. That is an issue that is beyond our control. We talk to government and advise where this can be optimized to bring down those costs, but unfortunately the events of May 2016 imply that we cannot let our guard down. For our clients, we look at supporting them in lowering their costs by bringing out technology that can do more for less. We also integrated our different business units so that when clients need multiple operations done by Weatherford we look at how we can reduce the amount of people needed to do the job and we are able to offer it at a better rate. This is one of the things that we do in this period of industry downturn that actually builds up our inter-unit business capacity to integrate our projects.</p><h4>What challenges and particularities with drilling does Nigeria face compared to other countries?</h4><p>What makes the difference in Nigeria is local knowledge. We share the best practices with our clients to help them optimize their drilling plans. Technology is available globally and one of the things that I would love to look at in the future is to support educational institutions to develop local research centers. There are peculiar local issues that we can work together on to come up with technological solutions that will also have global impact. Nigeria is an exporter of talent and we are in the position to tap into those talents. This industry has been available locally for the last 50 years or more so the best practices are there and you have well trained people. Around 95% of the Weatherford Nigeria's workforce is actually Nigerian, and that is something that is important and significant.</p><h4>How will the petroleum regulatory framework change the environment in this sector?</h4><p>It will have a significant impact given that businesses do not like uncertainty. Once that petroleum regulatory framework is closed and everyone has clarity on what the government expects of them, then people can sit down and evaluate their business model and how that affects them. They can then start projecting returns and based on that, investment will come. It is critical that the PIB is finalized, even if it is imperfect, imperfection is far less of a problem than uncertainty. We have had uncertainty in the regulatory environment for nearly a decade and in such an industry as ours, the lack of a framework is quite disruptive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In For The Long Haul]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[in-for-the-long-haul]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Everyone is talking about the low oil prices. How can investors like you take advantage of the low price environment?</h4><p>Just as the oil prices have gone down, so have the costs, at least the negotiated costs of services. What used to cost USD100,000 a day has gone down to about USD60,000 a day; therefore, you get more done for the same amount of money than you did say a year and a half ago when oil was USD110 a barrel. That means that you can put more wells in the field to get more oil out. Equally important is that the value of assets is lower, meaning this is the best time to buy assets if you have the capital. Prices are expected to rebound, so if you bought an asset six weeks ago, you have gained almost 20% value. The companies that will survive will know how to rationalize, cut costs, and become more efficient. </p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect that regulation to influence the future of the sector?</h4><p>If it is more successful, we will see a huge influx of capital investments in the industry. If the government establishes a more user friendly fiscal regime, then the IOCs and other investors will be eager to come in and take on new blocks, conduct new seismic studies, and discover more oil. If the government has a better approach than the one that was applied in the past, we are going to see a real turnaround in the influx of investments in the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>In terms of your production of crude oil and gas, how has it evolved since we talked last year?</h4><p>On the barrel equivalent we have more gas than oil. We have had a decline of production, which is why we are drilling additional wells to increase or at least plateau our production. We also have a new asset OML52, which we are going to start developing once we are able to come to an agreement for the operation. By the end of 2017, it will produce about 20,000bpd. But more important for us is the gas. We have more than 3tcf of gas and are looking more aggressively at LNG. The irony is that you actually have a healthy gas market along the West African corridor. Ghana's requirement is almost 3 million tons of LNG/annum and we have not even explored other countries along the West African corridor. Beyond that, the Indian market is aggressively building its infrastructure. It is talking about adding another 20 million tons of LNG into its system by 2020.</p><h4>How have your operations in Ghana evolved since you acquired the Central Tano offshore block in 2014?</h4><p>Oil and gas exploration has a long gestation period, particularly in the deep water. We are in the exploration phase still, and unfortunately 80% of our block is in the area under discussion in the Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana boundary dispute. We hope that is resolved soon so that we can push ahead with our exploration commitments.</p><h4>Do you see more women participating in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>In the schools you already see more women than men. We are seeing more and more women working for IOCs; however, within the indigenous companies there may be a couple of women, which is not as impressive as we would like.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are very bullish on what we are doing. Within the next three months, we will put together almost USD500 million in loans to develop our existing assets. We will probably be looking at close to a billion dollars in the next two years for growing the gas projects. In 2016, we think the oil price will stabilize and we feel things will definitely get better for the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the solid minerals sector contribution to the country's GDP and how do you expect it to evolve in the near future?</h4><p>The mining sector is not a new sector; it is as old as Nigeria itself. Nigeria used to be one of the most prominent exporters of tin, columbite, and coal in the early 1900s. In the late 1950s to early 1960s, when we discovered hydrocarbons, mining fell down the priority list. It moved from around 4% of GDP pre-oil to what now passes for about 0.33% of GDP. The challenge for the new administration is to revive the sector and boost its contribution to Nigeria's economic development. Import substitution is critical to Nigeria, and the president's vision will enable us to achieve the twin objectives of job creation and revenue generation.</p><h4>What strategies will you follow in the coming years to achieve import substitution in the mining sector?</h4><p>Planning is central. One of the first things I did as Minister was to put in place a road map for the development of the sector, which lays out the short-, medium- and long-term objectives for the next 25 years. Mining does not yield quick results or immediate benefits; it requires long-term investment and foresight. If you look at the standard Fraser Index of Mining, Nigeria features on the lower rung of the ladder as a mining destination; however, when you look at the geology of the country and the rock formation, it sits almost exactly on the same plane as Ghana, Burkina Faso, and the Ivory Coast, and Nigeria is bigger than all of those.</p><h4>What types of incentives are provided for solid mineral investors?</h4><p>In Nigeria, investors have a tax holiday for five years, allowing free importation of mining equipment, and 100% ownership of the mining operation; however, law enforcement is key. We are looking to ensure an autonomous regulatory agency that would be exclusively focused on managing the regulatory functions of the Ministry. We believe that there is a wide range of opportunities to incorporate informal mining into the economy, help these players create cooperatives, and give them access to low interest funding to improve their capacity to exploit what is on their ancestral land.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Nigeria as a destination for solid minerals investment? </h4><p>Our competitive advantage is first that Nigeria is pristine and almost greenfield in mining terms. There are a lot of opportunities for exploring these green fields. We want to move from being a mineral nation to a mining nation. Furthermore, Nigeria is a good destination for beneficiation and processing of proven reserves in bitumen, granite, marble, lead, and zinc just to mention a few. So, investors interested in setting up smelters, cutting and polishing factories and mineral processing plants have a lot to gain. We aim to replicate our success story in limestone processing and cement production. We are prepared to support companies that can help add value to our mineral resources instead of just exporting the raw material.</p><h4>You have been very involved in women's empowerment. What strategies should be followed to empower and unleash the potential of women in Africa?</h4><p>As someone who worked on the policies and the manifesto of the party before the election, we see women as a trigger for change. If you give women more advantages, the multiplier effect on communities is higher, because women by nature think beyond themselves. Women are more grounded, which is why when you look at our social investment program it is more directed at women. When I was governor, the bulk of the people that benefited from our social security program where we used to give NGN5,000 to elderly citizens, the bulk of them were women. Women were running our food banks in the streets and distributing the materials that we have, which we are replicating under our social program now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the NSE's new e-dividend management system and what does it mean for your future operations?</h4><p>The e-dividend management system facilitates the payment of dividends in an electronic format. Investors can get their dividends faster and hopefully if many people register on the system this will reduce the instances of unclaimed dividends. </p><h4>What is the strategy behind the NSE's decision to explore joint opportunities with the London Stock Exchange Group to accelerate dual listings? </h4><p>The London Stock Exchange views itself as an active listing platform for African corporates that are looking to access international funds because London is an international financial center. At the end of 2015, we started implementing our 2015-2019 Strategic Plan and we increased our geographical footprint from Nigeria to Africa. We decided to be a platform not only for the listing of Nigerian corporates, but also for Nigerian corporates operating outside Nigeria around the continent, as well as the many African international corporates operating in Nigeria. In order to do this, we felt it was beneficial to partner with an exchange that is well known and well regarded as an international listing platform. The NSE is the second-largest platform in Africa; therefore, given the linkages that are beginning to emerge on the continent from the African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA) perspective to the various sub-regional groupings, such as the West African Capital Markets Integration Council, we are positioning ourselves to be a trusted partner of domestic exchanges from an African perspective. In fact, this fungibility has allowed it to weather the forex storm we have seen because people can enter in Lagos and exit in London or vice versa. We have seen liquidity move across both markets based on what is happening in economies.</p><h4>What role does the NSE play in providing a positive environment for investors and what steps do you take to protect those investors?</h4><p>We play a role that spans the value chain, from promoting Nigeria as an investment destination to engaging with portfolio managers to talk about the details of the experience, such as how a company actually accesses the market to deploy financing. The NSE ensures the ease of doing business on our platform and that the experience you get is world-class. We do this by making sure we have strong regulations that create a level playing field and a transparent market. We have carried out a number of initiatives in this area to ensure corporates actually live up to their billing because people invest in a company to get positive returns. We have introduced a corporate governance rating system, which is now mandatory for companies on the main board.</p><h4>What are the advantages for an indigenous company to list on the NSE?</h4><p>There are many advantages for an indigenous company to list on the NSE, from capital raising through to the less thought about advantages such as branding. If a bank in Nigeria is not listed, people will think there is something wrong. We provide a platform to raise capital; more importantly, when a company lists on the NSE it has a credit rating, which allows it to get other types of financing at better rates. It is viewed as being a transparent and compliant entity because of the rigors of listing and the ongoing duties to report its financials and so forth. Another good reason is to pass control of the company from one generation to another.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We really must institutionalize the fight against corruption in a way that the bureaucracy supports the ease of doing business. In the short term we have trade imbalance issues. We have strong demand for forex and are not getting enough of it. We need to address this by increasing the supply of forex through borrowing forex, selling assets, doing swaps, or a combination of all three. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of FIRS in the last year?</h4><p>In the last year, we have reached 99% coverage in terms of administering taxes. Within this period we have been able to identify a large number of corporate organizations that were not on the tax roll. In 2015 alone, we added roughly 100,000 new taxpayer accounts. Many of these new taxpayers have a backlog of fines and interest. To address this and ease their burden of tax payment, we came up with a tax amnesty scheme in which we waived fines and interest for late returns and late tax payments for 2013, 2014, and 2015 for all taxpayers. The tax amnesty scheme will also provide companies with an opportunity to make installment payments for outstanding taxes after an initial payment of 25%. We have also signed an MoU with State Boards of Internal Revenue Service and have agreed to work together on joint audits, joint taxpayer education, and enlightenment programs, training, and data sharing. In addition, we have deployed the use of technology and this has increased the level of compliance and transparency. What we utilize presently is a technology that directly sweeps VAT from the aviation and power sectors into the federation account. We have also installed systems in all of the state governments, so that any federal tax that is due from any state government can be directly swept to the federation account. We have also reorganized FIRS to be more customer-oriented, and taxpayers have the opportunity to choose the location of where they file their returns. We have deployed communication campaigns on VAT in all the major Nigerian languages of Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, as well as Pidgin English on radio and television.</p><h4>You are the Chairman of the African Tax Administrations Forum. How can the collaboration between African Tax bodies impact taxation on the continent?</h4><p>The mandate of ATAF is first to promote taxation in Africa; it is there to build capacity among all the African tax administrators. Presently, it is made up of about 38 African countries; we also have council members and an elected chairman. At the last General Assembly Meeting, Nigeria was elected for the first time. Being the Executive Chairman of the FIRS, I was elected on behalf of my country. Collaboration is key to improving awareness.</p><h4>What role does FIRS play in the socioeconomic development of the country? </h4><p>Our main focus is on revenue generation. When it comes to current expenditure, Nigerians know that the present government has their best interest at heart. What we do is provide revenue, particularly non-oil revenue, to enable the government to fund its programs and provide the dividends of democracy. Nigeria is a federation. There is the Joint Tax Board (JTBan), an umbrella body for all the tax authorities in the country.  The FIRS Chairman is also the Chairman of JTB. FIRS worked with the State Boards on Internal Revenue, under the JTB, to add about 3.4 million new taxpayers to the individual taxpayers' roll for all states. These new taxpayers are for states. This JTB did it in under six months.</p><h4>What reforms will you implement in 2017?</h4><p>Our objective is to make taxation the financial bedrock of Nigeria such that we no longer rely on revenue from oil or other oil sources. Currently, we have been able to derive 70% of our revenue from non-oil resources and believe this will increase to 80% in 2017. In terms of our relationship with the taxpaying public, we intend to work so that they will accept us as a service-oriented organization that is mandated to fund the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the significance of your partnership with Chevron and Petrobras?</h4><p>This partnership is not only beneficial to the partners, but also to the country as a whole. Our current production capacity is 250,000bpd but our production averaged around 242,000bpd in 2016. Producing 250,000bpd is significant for the economy, as it has increased the government's revenue from oil sales. This current government has just presented an oil production estimate of 2.2 billion barrels for its 2017 budget. Petrobras has always been known to be a giant in deep water exploration and, at the time Agbami was to be developed, Famfa and Chevron needed such a partner. The outcome of this partnership was stellar performance in terms of production. On a larger scale, the local community has benefitted the most from this partnership since indigenous companies were allowed to bid for some segments of the project, thus building their capacities in these areas.</p><h4>What is the importance of the oil and gas sector in terms of job creation, and what role does Famfa Oil play in supporting the federal government local development strategy?</h4><p>The oil industry is a vital one in Nigeria. It has created opportunities for Nigerian entrepreneurs, which in turn serve as employers of labor to a great number of Nigerians. The industry alone creates over 65,000 direct jobs in Nigeria and more than 250,000 in non-direct employment. Famfa is a fully indigenous company with a 100% Nigerian workforce. Over the years it has built capacity in its workforce through both local and international training that has empowered them to jointly manage and operate a world-class floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) facility. Famfa and its Agbami partners support local content development by training and developing local manpower.</p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect this legislation to influence the future of the sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>The regulatory framework is expected to drive investment in the oil and gas value chain. It should promote the development of local content and create a conducive business environment for all stakeholders. The government must ensure it does that and not the opposite. We hope for the best fiscal policies when the legislation is eventually passed.</p><h4>As the role model that you are, what do you think should be done to empower and unleash the potential of girls and women in Nigeria?</h4><p>Research has shown that, contrary to age-old beliefs, the mental capability of a girl is in no way inferior to that of a boy. If exposed to the same instruction and care, they can both achieve similar feats. Girls should be allowed to dream and supported to achieve their goals. They should be encouraged to break frontiers and make a difference. They should be allowed to choose their professions freely and allowed to pursue a career to the very limits of their chosen field. I was once a victim, but the rest is history. In addition to these, the leadership potential of girls can be developed via the provision of adequate and impactful leadership training programs and boot camps, especially for those that are in highly discriminatory environments. Finally, women already in leadership positions can create forums for taking up younger and aspiring females and demonstrating to the upstarts how they have been able to navigate and succeed in their chosen field.</p><h4>In addition to being a businesswoman and designer, you are also a philanthropist. What nonprofit initiatives are you more passionate about?</h4><p>I was inspired to set up the Rose of Sharon Foundation in 2008 and our vision is to alleviate the plight of widows and orphans. We accomplish this through programs that give financial independence and educational opportunities to widows, their children, and orphans. Our desire is to reach out and touch as many widows and orphans as we can in order to make the world a better place for them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jagal Energy is the oil and gas solutions provider of Jagal and a prominent player in the Nigerian upstream sector. How are the low oil prices impacting your operations?</h4><p>Worldwide, low oil prices are challenging companies to think differently, change the way they do business and force them to look for innovative solutions. We need to understand how we can consolidate, partner, and synergize to do things more economically. For our energy division, we operate as contractors and we have a lot of joint ventures and strategic alliances. We experienced a decline in work and in future work on the table. Previously, we were bidding on numerous projects at the same time. Today, we have very few projects on the horizon. At Jagal Energy, we have wholly owned indigenous companies, like Nigerdock, and we also have partnerships like NigerStar7. </p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect this legislation to influence the future of the sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>The most important legislation for the sector has been the Nigerian Content Development Act. It has made sure that companies that have capacity in country are able to bid on domicile supply chain, procurement, engineering, and fabrication contracts. Therefore, The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) the government is developing has to be compatible with what Nigeria has to offer. Many companies have built up capacity across many different parts of the industry and they need to be utilized and put to work. There are many Nigerians who have high levels of competency, but we are losing them because of a lack of work. It is important that the government engage its partners in the IOCs and the local oil companies, as well as the private companies offering engineering services and supply chain, logistics, and offshore drilling support.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for Jagal Energy in 2016?</h4><p>This year is a survival year; a lot of companies are trying to manage the downturn. Our strategy is to push for work and see if we can partner with IOCs and the NNPC to unlock projects and work together to find solutions, because it would be a shame to have such an excellent capability in-country in our sector and lose it due to lack of communication or progress on projects.</p><h4>Can you talk about the evolution of the demand for Hello Products?</h4><p>Manufacturing across Nigeria has taken a hit from the foreign exchange issue. It has made access to raw materials a challenge and consequently this has had an impact on the ability to produce finished goods. Supply chain and time cycle for turning raw materials into finished goods is impacting a lot of manufacturers, and many of them have closed up shop because of that. Hello Products has been manufacturing for over 35 years. We have a range of products and most of our raw materials are locally sourced; however, we have some key ingredients that are only made in two or three places in the world. We are forced to import these raw materials. Aside from manufacturing, the cost of goods for the common Nigerian has also risen dramatically, and this is compounded by inflation and price instability. Nevertheless, we have a couple of new products in the pipeline. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Nigeria is taking the right and tough decisions; the government is not there to be popular. Nigeria is trying to address critical gaps in its economy. It is important to see Nigeria diversify its portfolio so that it is not reliant only on one industry. At Jagal, we engage in other forms of investment and revenue yielding business besides oil and gas. Jagal has made significant investments to ensure domestication of data in Nigeria. Rack Centre, a state-of-the art TIER III Certified data Centre offering vendor-neutral colocation services, has been operational since 2014. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but still suffers from refined fuel scarcity. What is the status of your refinery project at the Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ)?</h4><p>Our subsidiary, Dangote Oil Refining Company Ltd (DORC), is developing a 650,000bpd greenfield oil refinery, fertilizer, and petrochemical complex in the LFTZ. The complex, when fully operational, will eliminate Nigeria's reliance on imported petroleum and petrochemical products and add value to Nigeria's crude oil as the nation becomes an exporter of refined petroleum products. The refinery when completed will be the largest single train in the world. Existing refineries in the nation—a combined capacity of 445,000bpd—are not running efficiently, below 10% of installed capacity, because they are obsolete and poorly maintained. The non-functioning at full capacity of existing refineries made the nation dependent on imports of refined petroleum products with a negative impact on foreign exchange. We are on course to change the tide with the new refinery. The project will enable Nigeria to conserve and even earn foreign exchange through exports of refined product.</p><h4>What will be the impact of this investment on the Nigerian economy as a whole?</h4><p>The refinery will have a multiplier effect. It will ensure fuel sufficiency in Nigeria, thus keeping people and businesses moving. During the construction period, the project will provide jobs for about 35,000 people directly and indirectly, and about 1,500 permanent jobs and 15,000 indirect jobs in the community. The economy will gain in terms of significant skills transfers and technology acquisition opportunities. It will also spur activities in the financial services sector such as insurance and banking. In addition, supply of petrochemical feedstock—polypropylene and polyethylene—will create a new market for plastics and nylons, which are imported at the moment.</p><h4>The import of foodstuffs is an important issue. What are you future plants to develop diary plants in the country? </h4><p>We are making investments in an integrated rice production and processing business, which will meet 16% of Nigeria's rice needs. We have started production in some states like Jigawa through an out-grower program where we teach farmers modern ways of farming and also supply them with agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer. We have also embarked on a sugar backward integration project that will ensure self-sufficiency in sugar. We noticed that 98% of all dairy products consumed in the country are imported, which is why Dangote Group has planned to develop dairy plants and homegrown milk production to reduce imports. By 2020, it is estimated that the Nigerian population will grow to between 207 million and 210 million. If we do not make efforts to grow and process our own foods, God forbid, we will go hungry.</p><h4>What role does Dangote Group play to support the government's goal of diversifying the economy?</h4><p>We are making investments in agriculture and agri-processing, automobile assembly, petroleum processing, power generation, and more, which are all areas the government is looking at for diversification. These investments diversify the Nigerian economy and when fully completed will bring in foreign exchange. The Dangote rice project will generate a significant number of jobs and increase take-home pay for smallholder farmers, all the while diversifying Nigeria's economy and reducing the nation's food import bill. Through the Dangote rice outgrowers scheme, we partner with outgrowers (smallholder and contract rice farmers) to cultivate and grow rice paddy. Specifically, we will provide inputs, technical assistance, extension services, land preparation services, and equipment directly to farmers.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The business environment is tough. The economy is in recession but we have faith in the Nigerian economy and will continue to invest here. If Nigerians lose hope and pull out their investments, no external investor will be willing to come here. We have established a new business, Dangote Sinotruk West Africa Co. Ltd., as an assembly plant for heavy-duty trucks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can low oil prices boost the industry and the petroleum sector value chain?</h4><p>After enduring what has now become the longest downturn in the history of the international oil and gas sector, it is in fact quite difficult to find the positives attached to a sustained period of low crude oil prices that have served to damage the entire fabric of the industry and are clearly detrimental to the needs of the various stakeholders, producers, and consumers alike. If prices remain low and investment in new capacity is not made in time, then the supply that these consumers will need in the future—and in growing quantities, I might add—will be in question. Then, there is the problem of deflation, a direct consequence of sustained low crude prices. Perhaps the only area that has benefited from lower prices is that of oil companies and service firms that have had to find ways and means to continue their operations with much reduced capital at hand.</p><h4>How do you expect investment by oil companies in exploration and production to evolve in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Today, the picture is unfortunately shrouded in uncertainty. OPEC forecasts show that to meet the expected rise in global demand over the next quarter of a century, oil investments totaling around USD10 trillion will be required, in addition to a further USD6 trillion for gas. Since oil prices fell in the summer of 2014, huge pressure has been exerted on the industry as a whole, leading to widespread retrenchment by the oil majors, who have had to drastically reduce costs, bringing with it massive manpower layoffs and, of course, cutbacks in investment. In 2015, global oil upstream spending fell by 26% from the previous year, while in 2016 the figure stood at 22%. This combined represents an investment loss of more than USD300 billion. Nonetheless, OPEC is hopeful that our recent historic Declaration of Cooperation, signed with a group of non-OPEC producers, will help stabilize the market by reducing supplies and shrinking the stock overhang.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of the petroleum industry in terms of job generation in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa—and within OPEC—with over 183 million inhabitants. Its petroleum exports account for over 90% of the nation's total export revenues. Therefore, the importance of the oil and gas industry in terms of job generation is understandably huge—and will remain so. Looking at official figures from 2015, out of a total value of exports of USD45.4 billion, almost USD42 billion came from petroleum. And even though the government is committed to diversifying its economy in the years ahead, especially toward agriculture and the mining of other natural resources, President Buhari has publicly stated that oil and gas will continue to provide the source of funds necessary for laying a strong foundation for a new and more diversified economy. </p><h4>How does Nigeria benefit from being part of OPEC and how does the organization benefit from having Nigeria among its members?</h4><p>Over its more than 56 years of existence, OPEC has established great links with its member states, and Nigeria has proven to be no exception. The country has been active in all OPEC proceedings and policy actions since it joined in 1971 and is considered a valued and trusted member of the OPEC family. And just as OPEC profits from such loyal and committed members as Nigeria, then so does Nigeria benefit from being a member of one of the most important and relevant inter-governmental organizations on the world stage. Nigeria, and especially its oil sector, also benefits hugely from being able to send its personnel in varying disciplines to the OPEC Secretariat, where they can spend several years enriching their knowledge. This is another example of how OPEC and its member countries work together to improve ties and ultimately conditions in the global oil sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>For more than a decade, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was driven by an extraordinary combination of improved policies, stronger institutions, high commodity prices, and high capital inflows. The region has now entered a different phase, where commodity prices and capital flows are far less supportive. Emerging markets, which propelled global growth after the 2008 global financial crisis, have slowed; advanced economies are still recovering from the impact of that crisis; and financial markets remain volatile. Lower oil prices have sharply reduced Nigeria's export earnings and government revenues. Both are likely to remain at depressed levels, reducing the space for policy interventions to address Nigeria's social and infrastructure needs. Private-sector investment will also be affected. Investor confidence about the outlook has remained weak, and financing is likely to become more difficult and more costly for everyone. </p><p>With US interest rates expected to continue to rise, albeit slowly, the likelihood of capital outflows will increase, and exchange rate pressures could mount as investors re-assess their appetite for risk. More broadly, Sub-Saharan Africa is also facing spillovers from geopolitical factors, including the fight against Boko Haram. The threat of terrorism is very real and never far from our minds. Having been in Paris during the November attacks, I know firsthand the sorrow that so many Nigerians carry in their hearts. In this region, terrorism not only takes a human toll but it also makes public finances more fragile. How? By widening budget deficits. Revenues are lower, including from lower growth, and spending needs higher, including for security and for supporting those impacted by the violence. One immediate downside is higher financing needs that can crowd out other essential public spending.</p><p>Nigerians have created a large and diversified economy that has grown by about 7% a year over the last decade. This has been a remarkable achievement, a testament to Nigeria's immense potential. The outlook, however, has weakened. For a country with a rapidly increasing population, this means almost no real economic growth in per capita terms. On top of the slowdown, vulnerabilities have increased. The ability to manage shocks is restricted by low fiscal savings and reserves. And the weakening oil sector could stress balance sheets and put pressure on the banking system. Reduced confidence and lower capital spending also impact the non-oil corporate sector.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sector looks less resilient today than during the downturn of 2008-09. Companies that have increased their leverage and US-dollar debt in recent years may now come under pressure as they face rising interest rates and a stronger dollar. Nigeria also has a large regional footprint, and its fortunes affect that of its neighbors, especially through trade. For example, it is estimated that a 1% reduction in Nigeria's growth causes a 0.3% reduction in Benin's growth. So what can policymakers do? I see an immediate priority—a fundamental change in the way government operates. </p><p>What do I mean by that? The new reality of low oil prices and low oil revenues means that the fiscal challenge facing the government is no longer about how to divide the proceeds of Nigeria's oil wealth, but what needs to be done so that Nigeria can deliver to its people the public services they deserve—be it in education, health, or infrastructure. This means that hard decisions will need to be taken on revenue, expenditure, debt, and investment going forward. </p><p>My policy refrain is this: Act with resolve—by stepping up revenue mobilization. The first step is to broaden the tax base and reduce leakages by improving compliance and enhancing collection efficiency. At the same time, public finances can be bolstered further to meet the huge expenditure needs. For example, the current VAT rate is among the lowest in the world and well below the rates in other ECOWAS members—so some increase should be considered. </p><p>Build resilience—by making careful decisions on borrowing. Nigeria's debt is relatively low at about 12% of GDP. But it weighs heavily on the public purse. Already, about 35 kobo of every naira collected by the federal government is used to service outstanding public debt. Exercise restraint—by focusing on the quality and efficiency of every naira spent. This is critically important. As more people pay taxes there will, rightly, be increasing pressure to demonstrate that those tax payments are producing improvements in public service delivery. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The dreams of one-third of humanity have come together and the heart beat of 1.25 billion Indians and 1.25 billion Africans are in rhythm.</p><p>We are among the world's oldest civilizations. We are each a vibrant mosaic of languages, religions, and cultures. Our histories have crossed paths over the ages. Once united by geography, we are now linked by the Indian Ocean. The currents of the mighty ocean have nurtured the ties of kinship, commerce, and culture through the centuries.</p><p>Generations of Indians and Africans have traveled to each other's land in search of their destiny or by the force of circumstance, enriching one other and strengthening our ties. We have lived in the long shadow of colonialism and have fought for our liberty and dignity. We have struggled for opportunity, but also for justice, which African wisdom describes as the prime condition of humanity. We have spoken with one voice in the world and have formed a partnership for prosperity among ourselves. We have stood together under blue helmets to keep the peace. And, we have fought together against hunger and disease.<br>As we look to the future, there is something precious that unites us: our youth. Two-thirds of Indians and two-thirds of Africans are under the age of 35. And, if the future belongs to the youth, then this century is ours to shape.</p><p>We are all familiar with Africa's ancient achievements and its more recent strides are catching the word's attention. The continent is more settled and stable and nations are coming together to take responsibility for their development, peace, and security. African struggles and sacrifices are upholding democracy, combating extremism, and empowering women. Today, women constitute around 20% of the elected members of parliaments in Africa.</p><p>Africa's economic growth has gathered momentum and diversified its base. African initiatives are replacing old fault lines with new bridges of regional economic integration. We see many successful examples of economic reforms, infrastructural development, and sustainable use of resources, turning adrift economies into dynamic ones.</p><p>400,000 new businesses were registered in Africa in 2013, and mobile connectivity now reaches 95% of the population in many places. Africa is pushing mainstream global innovation in mobile banking with M-Pesa, in healthcare with MedAfrica, or agriculture with AgriManagr and Kilimo Salama. All are using mobile and digital technologies to transform their lives.</p><p>Primary school enrollment in Africa now exceeds 90%. Across its magnificent landscape, Africa is setting standards in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism as well as entertaining the world with its sports, art, and music.</p><p>Africa, like the rest of the developing world, has its development challenges and like others has its own security and stability concerns, especially regarding terrorism and extremism. But I have confidence in African leadership and the African people to rise to these challenges.</p><p>For the past six decades, our independent journeys have been in parallel. Now India's development priorities and Africa's vision for its future are aligned. In less than a decade, our trade has more than doubled to over USD70 billion, and India is now a major source of business investments in Africa. Today, 34 African countries enjoy duty-free access to the Indian market.</p><p>African resources are powering our industries and African prosperity offers a growing market for Indian products. India has committed USD7.4 billion in concessional credit and USD1.2 billion in grants since the first India-Africa Summit in 2008. It is creating 100 capacity building institutions and developing infrastructure, public transport, clean energy, irrigation, agriculture, and manufacturing capacity across Africa. In the last three years alone, nearly 25,000 young Africans have been trained and educated in India.</p><p>As the great Nigerian Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka insisted, “human entity remains the primary asset in overall development." Our approach is based on the same belief that the best partnership is one that develops human capital and institutions.</p><p>To add strength to our partnership, India will offer concessional credit of USD10 billion over the next five years. This will be in addition to our ongoing credit program. We will also offer a grant assistance of USD600 million, which will include an India-Africa Development Fund of USD100 million and an India-Africa Health Fund of USD10 million. It will also include 50,000 scholarships to study in India over the next five years. And, it will support the expansion of the Pan Africa E-Network and institutions of skills, training, and learning across Africa.</p><p>If this century is going to be one in which all humans have a life of opportunity, equality, and dignity, and the planet a place in which we stand in peace and live in balance with nature, then India and Africa must rise together. This is not a new journey, nor a new beginning, but a new promise of a great future for an ancient relationship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently spoke at the symposium “The best way to fund and sustain anti-corruption efforts in Nigeria." What are the main initiatives being taken by the government to tackle corruption in the country?</h4><p>War against corruption is one of the three focal areas we immediately identified during the campaign. The other two are securing the country and reviving the economy, particularly with respect to job creation. We have done our best to keep our promises. We have tackled insecurity head-on and the successes are evident. We also have all hands on deck to retune the economy and have no doubt that these efforts will yield positive results. In terms of our initiatives to fight corruption, there is the imperative of personal example. If we want to wage the war successfully, we must strive to be aboveboard ourselves. If we are corrupt personally, whatever rhetoric we talk about corruption will sound hollow. We strive to be as transparent as possible in our dealings. Again, we have ensured that every proven case of corruption is prosecuted, no matter who is involved. There are no sacred cows. Anyone who has questions to answer must answer them. Equally, in prosecuting a successful corruption war, the anti-graft agencies must have free hands. And that is what we have done. We do not remotely guide them in any way or breathe down their necks. Rather, we empower them to discharge their duties, and we maintain a critical distance. The anti-corruption war is crucial to us. There will be no let up. It is a promise we made, which we are fulfilling, and which we must fulfill to the letter.</p><h4>The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index places Nigeria in 169th place out of 189 countries. What is the federal government's strategy to rise to the top 100 before 2020?</h4><p>We ensure that we make doing business in Nigeria as easy as possible. Bureaucratic bottlenecks are being dismantled, red tape is being taken out of the way, and results are being achieved faster. If we compare Nigeria's standings in the Ease of Doing Business ranking a year ago with where we are today, the difference is clear. And things will get much better.</p><h4>What will be main strategies of the government to diversify the economy? What sectors are of highest priority?</h4><p>We are determined to diversify the Nigerian economy away from oil. Unfortunately, we have turned ourselves into a mono-product economy by depending on it alone, so when oil prices crashed in 2015, we also crashed along with it. But we have refused to stay down. We have identified viable alternatives for our economy. One is agriculture. We are blessed with vast tracts of arable land around the country and can grow all that we need to eat, attain food sufficiency, and begin to export. For instance, we spend about USD2 billion each year on importing rice. However, we can also grow rice in many parts of the country. The Central Bank of Nigeria has arranged funds for rice farmers, and in another year or two we may stop importing the product altogether. That will free up foreign exchange for other developmental projects. Farmers are also being helped to cultivate other products such as maize, sorghum, millet, and cassava, among many others. Another area of diversification is mine and steel development. Nigeria is blessed with rich mineral deposits, which have been fallow for decades. Now we are determined to tap into them for the benefit of our people. We are laying a foundation that will bring handsome revenues into the government's coffers in the years to come. We are also paying attention to manufacturing and will develop tourism. Indeed, every area that can shore up our income will be attended to. This does not mean we will abandon oil, however. God has blessed us with oil, but we will no longer depend on it solely, since we have so many other potential areas to grow in.</p><h4>What role does the government play in facilitating FDI in the country? How can you ensure that these investments translate into maximum benefits for Nigerians?</h4><p>We facilitate FDI through our programs and policies. Investors will not come into a climate ridden with corruption. We are fighting corruption to a standstill. They will also not come into an insecure environment, which is why the country must battle insecurity. We cannot manage a country until we have effectively secured it. We also are working on the ease of doing business, so that more FDI can come in. We also offer tax holidays and other kinds of incentives.</p><h4>What role does the National Economic Council (NEC) play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>The NEC articulates our economic policy and direction and keeps an eye on it. We had a troubled economy when we came in 2015; the foundation for recession had already been laid. But we are working sure-footedly to lay a new foundation for the Nigerian economy. We will get there.</p><h4>What legacy would this administration like to leave in the country?</h4><p>I want to leave a country where corruption is reduced to the barest minimum, if not completely eradicated. I want to bequeath a country that Nigerians are proud of: safe, secure, and prosperous. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities for the Central Bank and what legacy would you like to leave behind?</h4><p>Priorities are the same at every central bank in the world: to keep inflation low, the economy close to its potential GDP, and to avoid crises. Financial and real shocks consistently affect our economies in Latin America. Additionally, and due to peculiar historical reasons, Colombia is the only country in the world where the central bank is in charge of many cultural activities like libraries and museums. Paradoxically this protects our monetary policy role since the country loves what the central bank does in this area. Cultural activities could play an important role in the development of the country after our peace agreement.</p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching inflation targets whilst lowering interest rates to promote growth?</h4><p>Colombia is again a special country in this area. We did not suffer from hyperinflationary periods during the 1980s, like Peru, Brazil or Bolivia, but inflation was close to 25% for more than 20 years during the 1970s and 1980s. This very likely means that the reduction of inflation to 3% (our long run goal) was very costly and that people still remembers. This produces inflation inertia, and changes long run expectations even when shocks are transitory. Our strategy, then, like in any other central bank targeting inflation, is to float the exchange rate, use short-term interest rates to keep the economy growing in a stable manner, and to avoid bubbles, which is not an easy task. Some temporary shocks (food price and the exchange rate devaluations) have hit the economy recently, expectations have increased much less than observed inflation, but improving communication will be essential to explain to Colombians that shocks are transitory with inflation returning to acceptable levels.</p><h4>Is your macroeconomic outlook more positive for 2017?</h4><p>2017 will be better than 2016 but we still have to make great efforts to reduce inflation and to improve economic growth. Every projection says that inflation will be within the 2-4% range at the end of the year or, if not, during the first half of 2018. This is important since inflation was higher than our 2-4% range during the last two years. Economic growth was close to 2% during 2016, and will probably be higher in 2017. Oil prices increased, and the uncertainty produced by the tax reform (already approved) and peace negotiations (already signed) will not hit the economy this year. We also think that a peace dividend will bring economic benefits during the following years, mainly in areas like tourism, trade, rural development, and foreign investment. Industry and agriculture will benefit from the recent devaluation of the exchange rate. But growth rates close to 2% are not enough, and Colombia has to regain the growth rates of 4-4.5% reached over the last 15 years. We have to save more, something related to fiscal surpluses and the pension system, and we have to open a very closed economy. Tariff reforms are also needed. We also need to modernize agriculture.</p><h4>With changes in the US administration, what do you anticipate for the Colombia-US economic relationship going forward?</h4><p>There is a lot of uncertainty at the international level, and the recent news produced by the US President seem to have increased volatility. On the other hand, there are serious doubts about the impact of Trump's proposals. New roads will be built but government expenditure on roads will not increase GDP in an economy producing at its full potential. There are also doubts about the impact of trade restrictions. We all know that the impact of more protectionism is to reduce the exchange rate for imports and exports. On the other hand, there is this international debate about the causes of low manufacturing growth. If technology is the main reason then we will start to see some additional robots and engineers in Detroit. Results will also depend of the Fed's reaction to Trump's policies. I do not see a major impact on Colombia unless the world economy collapses.</p><h4>If there are cash flow issues, how well protected is Colombia compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Shocks are always an important reason to be worried in Colombia and Latin America, but I do not see significant imbalances at the moment. Colombia has always been ranked high when looking at our macroeconomic management. We have a flexible exchange rate and that eases the adjustment of the whole economy to shocks, and the deficit of the current account moved from 6.5% of GDP last year to less than 3.5%, which is still high. Foreigners own close to 35% of some parts of the domestic TES market, another reason to keep our economy in good shape, but I understand that the numbers are even higher in other neighboring countries. Many banks are involved in the construction of roads in the country and we just hope Odebrecht news does not affect road construction that much, though corrupt people should of course be punished. People tell you that banking standards are good, and we are trying to move slowly to Basel III. However, we have not yet reached that point.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[issam-abdulmohsen-almarzooq-kuwaiti-minister-oil-electricity-water]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What defines the strategy you intend to bring to these ministries?</h4><p>I envision bringing my private sector experience to this position, and the priority for me now is governance. In the oil sector, I feel confident, as there has been strong leadership in our industries. Over the past 35 years the oil sector has developed to an acceptable level of governance, performance, achievements, and leadership, so I intend to emulate this success into the electricity and water industry. Prior to my arrival, there was already a law to be presented to the parliament to establish the Electricity and Water Corporation as a vehicle to commercialize the power operations that are currently under the ministry. We believe these activities should be under a commercialized entity rather than a public service. This process of implementation should take around two to three years, and we will leverage the GCC's experience in incorporating these activities.</p><h4>An important step in this direction is the new power plant, Az-Zour North, that was constructed using the PPP model. Does the involvement of the private sector in this project represent more opportunities for the private sector to assist Kuwait in meeting its future energy needs?</h4><p>Part of the Kuwaiti vision for the future is to encourage the private sector to become the primary creator of jobs, and we need this social security for our people. By having an active and engaged public sector, we can absorb the excess manpower that the government has, which is hindering us from achieving the best services for the people. Creating more jobs in the private sector and encouraging people to work in this sector will ultimately build a more sustainable society for future generations. Our first and foremost priority for these PPP projects is to create social security. Secondly, we will be enhancing the diversification of income of our country and to moving away from a near-total reliance on oil revenues. The private sector should be a larger contributor to our GDP. We have already pinpointed the future projects, including the second, third and fourth phase of the Az-Zour project. The PPP model can be emulated in other governmental sectors like health and aviation. In the Ministry of Oil, however, we are bound by the constitution. We do not have any privatization except for gas stations. We are taking another look at the program that has been established for the privatization of the petrol stations, and we have another model that we will be adopting in the future for the remaining petrol stations. Other projects have not yet been specifically determined, but we do for example have plans for the petrochemical section of the Az-Zour refinery for which we are inviting the private sector to participate.</p><h4>What effects will the forthcoming implementation of new tariffs have on water and electricity? What price regimes may consumers and industries expect?</h4><p>Halfway through January, we had the first inaugural meeting of the Tariff Committee, after the parliament approved the law for increasing the tariff of electricity and water. The current tariffs do not even represent 1/20th of the actual cost of electricity and water. Our objective is not simply to increase our revenues, but rather to encourage people to conserve energy. Unless they have some sense of the reflection of their usage on their disposable income, there will be very limited motives to reduce consumption. A conventional light bulb in Kuwait costs 60 fulus, a LED or saving bulb around KWD1, which is around 20 times the price. A conventional light bulb uses seven times the amount of energy as a LED bulb. We want to increase awareness about conserving energy. The tariff committee consists of representatives from the Ministry of Electricity and Water, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Legal Bureau of Kuwait. We are combining all these entities because we want to have a balance between increasing the income with the effect of the raise on the inflation and increasing the prices of goods in the market.</p><h4>With the OPEC deal in December 2016, producing countries agreed to cut production across the board and for Kuwait this meant to reduce output with 130,000 bopd under the 3 million bopd target. How do you expect this to affect Kuwait?</h4><p>The main reason for the cuts was not to tie prices. I tend to agree with the former Saudi Minister of Oil, Zaki Yamani, when he said that there is a fair price for producers and consumers, which was 40 dollars at that time, and currently a bit above that. By cutting the oil production, we are hoping to come to a balance between supply and demand. When there is an excess of goods, not only do consumer prices go down, it also has an adverse effect on investments in the industry. Ultimately, the quality of the commodity will deteriorate because of a lack of investment, and the commodity itself could diminish, as the incentives to produce are gone. We noticed that when there was a flood of supply in the oil market, investments diminished. Investment decreased almost 60% in the past two years. This has repercussions for the oil industry. It affects future exploration and investments in maintenance. The reason behind the cuts was to bring a balance to the market, and the prices are ultimately a matter of supply and demand. OPEC's oil price-controlling power has diminished, as there are now many other players in the market. The US is now a net-exporter, especially because of the large amounts of shale oil it produces for sale at above USD60-70 USD per barrel. Also, global demand in the world is growing, which is taking the heat away from the suppliers. The production cuts are aimed at lowering the amount of oil in storage.</p><h4>How do you expect the commitments Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah made at the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to influence and govern your policies and projects?</h4><p>One aspect of our objectives for the oil and electricity sector is to care for the environment, and we never enter projects without putting the environment at the top of our list of priorities. We have set goals in KPC and we have set a goal of reaching 15% renewables by 2030. Thus far we have achieved 2-3%, so we are on the right path. MEW is dependent on fuel from the Oil Ministry, so we have to unify our goals to be coherent so that we move toward 2050 with our renewable options in place. When speaking with Dr. Adnan Shihab Eldin, the Director of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS), we discussed nuclear energy, and I was hoping to re-open this subject. The technology has become much safer and more efficient, and could be worth looking into, especially now that the UAE is constructing four nuclear plants, and Saudi is developing plans as well. Kuwait has a limited coastal area, which is needed for cooling and safety, but we will certainly consider our options.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>I committed to two key priorities when I took this position. My priority for the oil sector was to maintain the current drive and passion in the sector, and I have confidence in the people that are running this sector. The second priority is the conversion of MEW from a governmental institution to a regulator. We need to build cooperation to jointly oversee electricity and water, with the same structure and KPIs of the private sector. If we can achieve these two objectives in my first term, then I will have achieved my goal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your China Desk developed within your portfolio given the significant increase in Chinese investments in Malaysia?</h4><p>There has been a great increase in the number of companies and clients from China that have engaged us as their Malaysian counsel with respect to their investments in Malaysia. Our China desk team has a dedicated team of highly qualified, multilingual Malaysians enabling them to carry out effective communication and quality cross-border services. The familiarity of our legal advisors with Chinese social, political, and business culture has positioned the firm at the forefront of legal services for Chinese-speaking markets. Our China Desk team has also previously made trips to visit leading Chinese law firms and clients.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the effects the AEC will have on the provision of legal services, and will there be more convergence within the bloc?<br></h4><p>Although we are heading for better integration amongst other ASEAN members, there may still be difficulties in the convergence of legal services. Due to the different political, social, and economic landscapes as well as various judicial systems of each member state, it will be challenging to implement an overlap of legal services. This is why Azmi &amp; Associates is committed to providing thoroughly researched and excellent cross-border legal services for the benefit of our international clients. The high level of resources available at our firm enables us to undertake certain projects that lean resourced firms are not able to.</p><h4>Azmi &amp; Associates operates a desk on Islamic banking. Can you provide more details on your practice areas here?</h4><p>Our Islamic banking practice group prides itself as being the leader in Islamic financial services. We are able to provide sound advice on venture capital, debt or equity financing such as Bai' Bithaman Ajil Financing Facility, Istisna' project financing, Ijarah Al-Muntahiyah Bittamlik, Musharakah, and Mudharabah. Our knowledge and experience extends to both direct financing and private debt securities. Our capabilities are not limited to legal and advisory services; we also have significant expertise in the development of Islamic products and practices for numerous banks and financial organizations. We were recently named the Best Islamic Finance Law Firm 2016 at the Global Islamic Finance Award, which is testament to our success.</p><h4>Malaysia is currently ranked 23rd in the World Bank's global index on the ease of doing business. What should be done to keep moving up in the ranking, especially from a corporate law perspective?</h4><p>To improve our ranking, it is imperative to provide a more conducive regulatory environment to the starting and operation of businesses in Malaysia. From a corporate law perspective, it is essential that precise, quality legal services are provided to clients to realize their business goals. It is that very reason that Azmi &amp; Associates is meticulous with our uncompromised research and preparation to ensure our clients are well informed in their decision making. The implication of having the right legal services as well as solutions will improve ease of doing business of local firms and eventually improve the ranking in the World Bank's global index.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a rapidly growing, dynamic firm, we have set various goals and ambitions for the upcoming year. We are keen to further strengthen our position as a leading law firm in the nation and broaden our influence to be the preferred international legal service avenue. As part of our growth plans, we first expect to deepen the amount of our high-end premium work specifically on corporate, mergers &amp; acquisitions, and banking matters. Secondly, we aim to broaden our product offering to become a full-service law firm. We also seek to expand the size of the firm to symbolize our strength and earn the respect of society and business community. With the expected increase of investments and cross-border opportunities, Azmi &amp; Associates will continue to deliver the best possible legal services to clients and strive towards unprecedented levels of excellence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current distribution of events in the public and private domains?</h4><p>Previously around 80% of our business came from the government. However, corporate events have been slowly increasing since 2014. We win most of the government bids, and now the percentage has changed. Currently, government business caters to about 40% of all events and corporate business 60%. People often see PICC as a venue for official government events and might shy away from doing event at the center. However, our public center facility can be reserved by anyone on a first-come, first-served basis. As of 2015, 45% events done at PICC are business events from the MICE segment and 55% are from non-MICE. The rest are from entertainment events such as dinners, weddings, F&amp;B arrangements from travel &amp; tours, and so on. However, in terms of yield management, the MICE business segment gives a higher yield income of 80%. PICC believes that the MICE business will grow significantly in 2017 and beyond. Clients come to us to have their weddings as we have the biggest banquet capacity in Malaysia, and these can go up to 3,000 people at Perdana Ballroom and 1,500 people at Putra Hall. We have more than 20 super weddings a year now mainly from rich and famous Malaysian families.</p><h4>How have you advanced your plans to internationalize your client base?</h4><p>We anticipate doubling our international events. We actively take part in international trade shows and road shows organized by the Malaysia Convention &amp; Exhibition Bureau (MyCEB), Tourism Malaysia, and Perbadanan Putrajaya to tap into the international market. We select destinations that can give PICC and Putrajaya greater exposure. PICC works to convince event and meeting planners including professional event organizers, destination management consultants, and so on that PICC and Putrajaya are capable of hosting their events. We are specifically 3Cs: convention, conference, and congress based, and that makes us different from other venues. PICC can have a maximum of 500 booths over the three levels of the building and at one time we can have 15,000 people having their events, programs, and activities. We have a combination of large halls for convention and congress sessions and large number of smaller venues for breakout sessions. The center was the brainchild of former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir, who envisioned having this large venue in close proximity to the governmental center of Putrajaya. We also actively involved in international bidding since 2015 through International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).</p><h4>How does Putrajaya cater to the hospitality needs of large international conferences?</h4><p>There are more than 2,000 hotel rooms within a 30km radius of PICC and Putrajaya. In addition to that, with the new mandate on managing Putrajaya Shangri-La Hotel, a five-star hotel with 118 rooms, it gives us more opportunity to win business bidding in the future. Indeed, with our ambitious internationalization agenda, we intend to develop more hotels in Putrajaya. Hailed as the “Intelligent Garden City," Putrajaya is the futuristic administrative capital of the country. We can proudly say that Putrajaya is a symbol of Malaysia's dynamism and progress.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the years to come?</h4><p>Our key goal is to brand ourselves as a convention center for all events, and not just government-related ones. Linking to that, tapping into the global market of events is our second goal. Other than that, we remain focused on the type of events that we are competitive in and prepare our bids accordingly. Maintaining good rapport with other local convention centers is also important to make Malaysia a relevant destination for international events. We would also like to see more signature events and to keep up good relations with clients that already come on by annual basis. Maintaining PICC as a premier venue for MICE business events is our mission and objective to be achieved in the next five years. </p>]]></richbody0content>
