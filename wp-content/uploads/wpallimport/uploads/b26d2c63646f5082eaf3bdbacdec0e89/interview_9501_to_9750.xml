		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the opportunities for international investment in Turkey's energy sector?<br></h4><p>Turkey has been considered the most trustworthy country by investors for the past 10 years. With the energy sector becoming a significant factor in the expansion of the Turkish economy, domestic and foreign investor interest in this area is growing, which is a reflection of Turkey's political and economic stability. In 2011, $4.2 billion of FDI was contributed to the energy sector. This is the result of political stability and sustainable development in Turkey. I hope that the energy sector will be most popular sector again in 2013; since Turkey is developing, the growth of the energy sector is growing faster than Turkey itself.</p><h4>What impact will the planned nuclear power plants at Sinop and Akkuyu have on Turkey's economy over the long term?</h4><p>Nuclear energy is of utmost importance for Turkey in terms of ensuring energy security and reducing our dependence on energy imports. The nuclear power plants to be constructed in Akkuyu and Sinop are estimated to generate 80 billion kWh of electricity annually. In order to obtain the same amount of electricity from a natural gas plant, 16 billion cubic meters of gas would be needed annually, imported at a current cost of $7.2 billion. For the price of three years of these natural gas imports, a four-unit nuclear power plant could be established in Akkuyu. That's why it is important for Turkey to have nuclear plants. We aim to have three nuclear power plants functioning by 2023 and plan to generate 30% of total electricity demand from nuclear sources.</p><h4>What role will renewable energy play in Turkey's energy generation strategy?</h4><p>Turkey is rich in terms of renewable resources. In geothermal energy resources, for example, installed capacity rose from 20 MW in 2002 to 162 MW. Regarding wind energy, a rapid increase in terms of installed capacity—from 20 MW in 2002 to 2,337 MW—has taken place. In 2002, the installed capacity of hydroelectricity was 12,241 MW, a figure that has now reached 19,874 MW. For solar, license applications to the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) started being issued in June 2013. We aim to have installed capacity of 20,000 MW for wind, 3,000 MW for solar energy, 20,000 MW for hydroelectricity, and 600 MW for geothermal. By 2023, we aim to increase the portion of renewables in the energy mix to 30%.</p><h4>How would you characterize the potential for shale gas to play a major role in meeting Turkey's energy demand in coming years?</h4><p>We hope to find shale gas reserves large enough to help reduce Turkey's energy import dependency. The search for shale gas deposits has been focused on the southeastern province of Diyarbakır, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is drilling exploratory wells as part of a joint project with Shell. TPAO has stepped up its efforts in Central Anatolia and found traces of shale gas in the central provinces of Ankara, Kırşehir, and Konya. Efforts to find shale gas are necessary as Turkey's energy needs are growing. In this context, we intend to continue exploration and make use of these resources for the good of the economy.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to promote investments in coal power generation?</h4><p>Coal is one of the most important domestic resources for Turkey. The potential of domestic resources that can be used from lignite power in electricity generation is 120 billion kWh/year, and 44% of that potential has been evaluated. We developed a new model to produce power from coal, and investors in the project will have only six months to prove their commitment because Turkey does not have any time to lose. The country plans to reach about 18,000 MW of electricity generated using coal, and we will support serious investors for 30 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of BASF's role in Turkey?</h4><p>Looking from the perspective of how BASF became what it is today in the world, its development in Turkey has not been markedly different. The company was founded in 1865, in a different era when chemicals were being synthesized and when the understanding of chemistry was evolving rapidly. Starting out with dyes in the 19th century, BASF was a major driver at the forefront of chemical companies over the next 65 to 70 years, developing the basics of its industry. At that time, the goal was to build large chemical complexes and export products to the rest of the world. For a long time, BASF was a German company engaged mainly in global trade. We began trading in Turkey in 1880; it took another 90 years to establish a production site in the country, as part of a general move to shift production closer to target markets as logistics became a more important factor in our business. Today, we have expanded through organic growth and acquisitions in Turkey, and our strength is our capability to enter the value-added and downstream chemicals segment, which forms the second pillar of our strategy. We have completed this with a portfolio strategy that includes an array of investments as well as acquisitions. We recently entered a joint venture with INEOS for Styrolution; at the same time, we have become more involved with care, specialty, and construction chemicals. We have grown closer to our customers; a move we feel is beneficial to us as we also focus more on market-driven R&amp;D. By now, most molecules have already been developed; as such, there is an ever-receding prospect of finding or developing new, game-changing molecules. We must do more with the chemical tools we have at our disposal and combine them effectively. To achieve this, we need to be very familiar with the needs of our customers, both now and in the future. We gather experts from various disciplines and add new value. BASF more than tripled in size in Turkey in the space of the six years between 2005 and 2011, by applying this strategy. The year 2012 was one of consolidation for us, and we are now gearing up for the next period of growth. We apply two very different criteria to our investment decisions. The first is that we should only move closer to the market and customers when we can connect closely to a supply chain, which benefits from low transportation costs, and when we see a large enough market to supply from a new location, or at least within striking distance of one. However, for chemicals producers such as BASF, this involves building a major production site for anything from basic petrochemicals to intermediates. There are about 300 intermediate chemicals that form the basis of 90%-95% of the entire chemicals industry. We have six verbund—or integrated—production sites around the world, which is often highlighted as a strength for BASF. The decisive factors of investment are the availability of feedstock, energy costs, and transport and logistical considerations. If any one of these three factors is not right, the entire investment is then in dire straits, so to speak. In terms of the first factor—feedstock—we would naturally look toward the Middle East for feedstock, or North America, where the shale gas boom is leading to greater availability. The second factor, energy costs, is equally as important because the chemical industry naturally consumes massive amounts of energy. The third factor is logistics and the supply chain, and Turkey, with its fantastic geostrategic location, has access to Africa, Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Europe, by sea, land and air.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for a future BASF investment in Turkey?</h4><p>To undertake a large-scale investment in Turkey rather than elsewhere, we need an attractive investment case. In Turkey, the market itself has already grown to a substantial size and the government has already identified the chemicals industry as a key player in the economy. In addition, neighboring countries also have similar plans, bringing both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that more chemical operations have come to the market, offering new and complementary products that are not simply copied and pasted. The disadvantage here is when everyone heads in the same direction, especially when there are massive new capacities coming on stream at the same time. Chemical investments are carried out to operate for some 30-50 years. Therefore, we need to be absolutely sure that we have favorable conditions where we invest, not just for the investment period, but also for the period that will be affected by variable cost drivers, such as feedstock, energy, and transportation.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Turkish market for BASF?</h4><p>Turkey's significance is constantly growing. We are currently implementing a new strategy entitled “We Create Chemistry for a Sustainable Future," which was published late in 2011. As part of that strategy, for the first time we have been focusing on emerging markets. Turkey is the single most important emerging market neighboring Europe, from where we also manage the wider MENA region. Considering the entire group of 20 interesting, fast-growing countries, Turkey is the only one that has a combination of a large and growing population, is undertaking efforts to diversify its economy, and has the desire to boost value chains, especially in transportation and automotive assembly. Turkey was a net exporter in the automotive industry in 2012. Tier I, II, and III companies are entering Turkey, and this is a phenomenon we are observing very closely, because they are our customers. The automotive industry represents 10%-15% of BASF's sales, and we are sometimes asked why we expose ourselves to such a competitive industry demanding the lowest prices all the time. We can only satisfy customers when we constantly improve, innovate, and offer new solutions and move beyond a simple product, with prices that are subject to fluctuations even in recent years. Especially for oil prices, it has mainly been moving upward. Chemistry is an important enabler for the automotive industry. We are helping the automotive industry think in new ways by providing new solutions, and this helps keep our optimism alive. BASF truly believes that its products and solutions, as well as its ability to engage in this dialogue, render it a sound partner for the Turkish  automotive sector.</p><div class="quote">“We are helping the automotive industry think in new ways by providing new solutions."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was unique about SaSa's founding, and how has the company grown to become Europe's leading producer of polyester and polymers?</h4><p>SaSa was formed back in 1966 by a visionary Turkish gentleman in Adana, a region famous for cotton growing. He challenged the situation and decided he would produce synthetic fiber instead of natural fiber in the heart of a cotton-growing area. At that time, the region had no more than five or six tractors, and he decided to enter the petrochemicals industry and produce synthetic fiber. This was also a challenge in that the technology was so new that it was not available. There were only two companies, DuPont and ICI, and he was only 25. He also challenged his family since they produced cotton, which is not a high-tech industry; but he decided to enter the petrochemicals industry. He promised his family that it would work; he went to the UK and started negotiations with ICI. SaSa was the first licensee of ICI for production in Turkey. After that, SaSa grew rapidly until his death in 1996. He grew the company by 72 times in 30 years. We always focus on our strengths in Turkey, but we never define our business domain as Turkey—our vision was to be number one in Europe and be at least within the top five in the world.</p><h4>How have changing market trends over the past decade driven SaSa's strategy?</h4><p>Up until 2006, we operated with two product platforms: synthetic fibers and PET plastic for packaging. In 2006, due to increasing pressure and the rapid commoditization of packaging materials by Asian countries, we decided to spin off our packaging business. The intention was to step out of the commodity business and focus more on growing strategic business areas. That is what we did and along with that change we came up with a new business unit called special polymers and chemicals (SPC). Again, the intention was to diversify our business portfolio in a way that we could focus all of our resources on the growth platforms. We looked at the business domain where we operated, and examined the mega trends that were affecting the demand of our customers and clients. That is how we positioned all of our efforts.</p><h4>What is your approach to R&amp;D and innovation?</h4><p>My approach is to focus on useful innovation rather than R&amp;D. I don't want scientists using my laboratory to try and develop new molecules. I want proper technology, and that is what we will continue searching for. Our work is always based on the market and the people's needs. We start with that need and then begin brainstorming product ideas. We are looking for appropriate technology, not high technology. With where we are today, the best way to come up with the appropriate technology is through technology transfer—we have to be prepared to produce second-generation technology from the first wave. I don't have time to develop technology for the next five years, and I will never know if it will be the best in class—instead, I transfer the first-generation technology, spend another two years on it, and then develop the next generation. This is the route I follow, and I believe it should be our method until at least 2023.</p><h4>How has the uncertainty in the eurozone affected SaSa?</h4><p>Technology migrates according to the GDP of a country. If the GDP per capita is $3,000-$4,000, then the textile industry is perfect, but if it is $5,000-$10,000, the industry starts struggling and it could migrate to a different country. Our market share is not being lost; our clients are simply moving their production to different countries. In 2012, our exports to Europe came to $10 million less than the previous year, but those customers' products moved to Turkey. We did not lose our market share if we consider Turkey and Europe as part of the same market. This is what is happening in our industry, and I am not overly concerned about it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the privatization of Turkey's defense sector had in helping to build the country into a leading defense products exporter?</h4><p>The Turkish defense sector is composed of institutions that can be gathered under two main categories. Turkish Armed Forces Foundation (TAFF) companies are the first group, which are the dominant actors realizing almost 40% of annual turnover. The other group is the privately owned and managed companies. TAFF companies operate as main contractors in the aerospace, rocket and missile, guns and ammunition, and defense electronics sectors. On the other hand, in naval and land systems, private companies undertake the main contracts. A close environment for collaboration has been established between these groups and they are mostly the solution partners for each other in defense programs. A level below the main contractors, there are SME sub-contractors or suppliers, who we see as the most important and indispensable factor of industrial development. We aim to achieve a certain maturity level especially in terms of design and development skills in SMEs to strengthen the capacity and capabilities of these sub-contractors. Universities and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) also play crucial roles, especially in constituting the technological background of the industry. There has been a significant evolutionary progress from the demand side. The direct procurement mechanism turned into co-production models throughout the 1990s. Policies in support of local industry have shown their efforts today in the form of local production projects and indigenous system integration capabilities. We owe this progress to a well-defined and applied industrial strategy accompanied by special privileges granted to local industry and research bodies. The outcome can be summarized as over $4 billion in turnover, 54% local content in defense procurement, and $1.2 billion in exports. Targets for 2016 are almost double the turnover and exports of 2012. We are aiming for a 70% local content percentage.</p><h4>What role can Turkey's defense exports play in helping to ease the current account deficit?</h4><p>Taking the latest figures into consideration, Turkey's total export figures are rising, notwithstanding the economic recession that still affects many countries in the world. According to the numbers that were stated by the Defense and Aerospace Industry Exporters' Association (SSI), $1.2 billion in exports was realized by our defense and aerospace industry. As this represents only 1% of total exports, the figure might be considered small. However, we are proud to say that from 2011 to 2012, defense and aviation exports climbed 42%. This number can never be undervalued as it indicates one of the highest jumps among the sectors constituting total exports. When we have a closer look at our export figures, Ankara increased its exports the most—by 10.5%—to reach a total of $6.5 billion. Of this figure, $531 million was accounted for by the aerospace and defense sectors. While the average value per ton of Turkey's exports is $1,600, the same value for Ankara is $23,500. This is because most of our major defense industry manufacturers are in Ankara. Those manufacturers create job opportunities for the supply industry and SMEs. Defense industry manufacturing is based on a high level of capital and technology and, eventually, it will create a high level of value-added. As defense systems are composed of many complex sub-systems, they require the involvement of many professional sub-contractors. This is the reason why the defense industry was underlined as a strategic locomotive sector as part of Vision 2023. One more aspect to consider regarding the current account deficit is defense expenditure. Recently, local producers have taken a larger role in the provision of modern equipment for the Turkish Armed Forces. This figure was 45% in 2009, 52% in 2010, and, finally, 54% in 2011. We are capable of meeting more than half of our own needs through national industry. Through the offset programs that we are implementing,   companies have been undertaking offset commitments valued at billions of dollars. Those programs enable us to minimize the outflow of resources.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to promote the Turkish defense industry abroad?</h4><p>Turkish defense industry products have reached a level where they can compete with other products. We have thus started to work on deciding the necessary steps to be taken to promote our industry. The Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) prepared and published strategic plans for the 2007-2011 and 2012-2016 periods, covering not only institutional but also industrial strategies. We have developed close relations with other related governmental institutions and foreign counterparts to follow developments and coordinate our efforts. In order to realize this objective, we have already officially opened defense offices in three countries to begin with: the US, Saudi Arabia, and Brussels, Belgium, the home of NATO. Furthermore, we are working on opening more defense cooperation offices to directly coordinate our cooperation activities in different regions. Realizing the necessity to establish an organization to unite the companies in the sector, the SSI was established in 2011, with the full support and coordination of the Ministry of Economy and SSM. The SSI successfully organized a conference at the end of 2012, during which defense industry representatives and related governmental officials all came together to discuss and decide the necessary steps to promote the defense sector.</p><div class="quote">“We are proud to say that from 2011 to 2012, defense and aviation exports climbed 42%."</div><h4>Turkey now has plans for an increasing number of indigenously developed defense projects, including a jet fighter, a helicopter, and a tank. Why are these plans significant for the long-term development of Turkey's defense sector?</h4><p>The TX/FX program, involving fighter and training jets, is now at the conceptual design stage. The program focuses on utilizing domestic capabilities in the design and production of these products, which are planned to replace the Turkish Armed Forces' existing T-38 trainers and F-16 fighters from the 2020s. In terms of helicopter programs, we are aiming for the local design, development, and production of civil-certified light utility/training helicopters. Acquiring the complete know-how for tank design, development, system integration, production, testing, qualification, and modification is also a major part of the Altay main battle tank program. Every effort that has been made will come to light in the form of indigenous platforms that are equipped with locally developed sub-systems that primarily meet the Turkish Armed Forces' and our international allies' requirements.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of international partnerships, such as the F-35 joint-strike fighter (JSF), for Turkey's defense sector?</h4><p>Two international development projects have been carried out under SSM's responsibility for more than 10 years. One of them is the Airbus A400M and the other one is the JSF. The F-35 JSF is one of the programs in which we can underline the importance of international partnerships. Being a part and taking an active role in the JSF's international environment with allied countries around the world brings many advantages. Turkey became one of the program's partners beginning from the concept development phase (CDP) and found a chance to be involved in the management of the program. We are able to reach and share knowledge and information among other partners and actively manage Turkey's requirements. The JSF also opens the collaboration environment among partners. Turkey benefits from the opportunities of this environment. As the biggest international defense project, Turkish defense companies also benefit from a large spectrum of business opportunities, improve their capabilities to a sufficient level to serve the fifth-generation fighter's requirements, and are now taking their place as very important players in the global supply chain. International partnerships add great value to Turkey, both in terms of program management and industrial participation aspects.</p><h4>What role will Teknopark Istanbul play in promoting R&amp;D?</h4><p>Istanbul is one of the biggest cities in the world, with a population of 15 million. Recent data shows that with a GDP of about $133 billion, Istanbul's domestic income through its industrial and traditional services is higher than many EU countries, including Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, and Luxembourg. Also, it has a unique and exciting location and it has been chosen as the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) headquarters for more than 1,000 multinational companies to manage tens of neighboring countries' operations. Istanbul has 40-plus internationally acclaimed universities providing excellent technology-based training. In light of all these considerations, we can say that Istanbul is undoubtedly a city full of opportunities. This is why we are creating one of Europe's biggest and most eminent science parks here. However, Teknopark Istanbul is not solely a defense-industry focused science park; it also aims to bring an extensive industrial and technological defense industry, which is mainly located in Ankara right now, to Istanbul.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Küçükpazarlı grown from a small machinery parts manufacturer to the largest supplier of TAI in Turkey?</h4><p>In 1975, two young brothers started the business in a 40-sqm shop floor by building molds and dies. We had no money. It is a typical Turkish story, starting from zero and working by hand. We were just taking care of ourselves, but the business grew and after eight years we were able to buy our own building in the city center, so we moved from the shop floor. The shop moved to OSTİM in Ankara in 1983 and the business grew. We were able to make more money and we needed another facility. We found another division in this industrial area in 1994 just for sheet metal pressing purposes. We were working heavily in the construction industry. In the meantime, we were making some different industrial parts for the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (MKEK), the oldest Turkish company to make missiles and weapons. In 2004, the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) had a strategy to develop a stronger supplier network. There are big companies in the defense and aerospace industry, but they developed a strategy to improve the SMEs that are supporting these companies. In 2004, TAI came to our company and said it was going to outsource more, and asked if we were willing to do it. At that time, we said okay and started investing. We invested in new machines, and in 2005 we started our third division, aerospace. We took some of the young employees from our existing facilities and we started something new. Soon, we were able to show our capabilities, and today we are the largest supplier to TAI in Turkey. Right now, we are able to machine produce even large-sized parts. We are the first producer of the mainframes for the Airbus 380, for example. We worked hard for it, but it is also that the strategy of SSM was important, as well as the support of TAI.</p><h4>How did the shift into aerospace change your business?</h4><p>Normally, we are a company with good jobs, but being dedicated to aerospace was something different and we needed a new building. We stopped for one and a half years, and we were starting a new process, which meant difficult times. We were learning, making some mistakes, and correcting them, so it was a difficult stage. The opportunity was given for many companies, but I think Küçükpazarlı did something good; we made good decisions and acted on opportunities by taking some risks. It wasn't like we were running blindly; we calculated our risks and saw what we could do. It was not a common industry for us. We were doing things for the defense industry, but aerospace was different because the quality level was much higher. Our biggest success was bringing in the right team.</p><h4>What can some of the smaller SMEs learn from Küçükpazarlı?</h4><p>Normally, to get to a certain level of quality, you have to work hard for it. Of course, an expansion rate cannot be 100% every year. What Küçükpazarlı did was first to give importance to the job and take it seriously. We had no chance to make mistakes in this business. We invested everything that we earned, which means we took it very seriously. If you have the desire to do things right, there is a great chance to succeed; anyone can do it. It also takes patience, of course. You make some mistakes and it takes time. Not every day goes smoothly, so you have to be patient.</p><h4>What is the potential for Turkey to be a leader in the defense industry globally?</h4><p>Turkey is dynamic right now. For example, we see that the importance of Turkey in the East and in Southeastern countries is increasing. The Turkish army is one of the biggest and strongest armies in the world. We know that there are many countries that directly buy weapons from us if they know the Turkish army is using them. It is a big advantage, and it will be a great thing to become a leader.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) grown and developed since its establishment?<br></h4><p>TAI was established to build F-16 aircraft. At the time, we were owned as part of a joint venture with Lockheed Martin. That partnership was planned for 25 years, but both parties decided to renegotiate the terms. We did not have a common vision for the company, so we parted amicably and nationalized 100% of TAI in January 2005. During the 20-year period when we worked as a subcontractor of Lockheed Martin, TAI delivered many aircraft and helicopters. Since 2005, we have been making investments in engineering, which we had not done much of in the past. We had a new vision for the role of the company. In 2005, the value of the company was $60 million with about 2,000 employees, and our R&amp;D activities were negligible. Our revenue was about $75 million-$80 million, and the total backlog was about $1.5 billion-$2 billion. Today, we are preparing for an IPO, in which we expect to the company to be valued at between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. The company now has over 4,000 employees, 1,600 of them are engineers and 1,000 that specifically work on R&amp;D activities. Our revenue is $850 million and we are one of the largest defense and aerospace companies in the world. We export about $528 million, which is half of the entire defense and aerospace output of Turkey. The total backlog is over $20 billion. We are working with engineers on indigenous projects such as helicopters, aircraft, UAVs, and satellites.</p><h4>What are some of your main projects and accomplishments?</h4><p>TAI's diversified product and capability range grants a unique and unmatched position for TAI in the international marketplace. Fixed and rotary wing platforms on the one end and unmanned systems and modernization suites on the other, which provide a challenging and advantageous scope as well. The ANKA MALE Class UAV System, the T129 Attack/Tactical Reconnaissance Helicopter, and the C130 Avionics Modernization Suite are the three major offerings of TAI, which have the technical superiority and commercial competitiveness advantage in the international market. Worldwide recognition and demand for the subject products encourage TAI's international market development activities. On the other side, TAI's corporate image is being developed carefully to assist future business relations. International collaborations such as the JSF and A400M also help to enhance this image as living demonstrators of successful international partnerships. We have a multi-billion-dollar contract with Lockheed Martin for the F-35 program, and we are still building F-16s under a Lockheed license. With General Electric, we have a joint venture called Turkish Engine Industries (TEI). On the International Defense Companies list last year, we were ranked as the 83rd largest. We are very proud of this accomplishment, but our target is to be ranked 25th by 2023, when we aim to reach over $2.5 billion in revenues.</p><h4>Why is it important for Turkey to have its own brands in sectors such as defense, aerospace, and automotive?</h4><p>We are the 17th biggest economy in the world. The 2023 target is to reach $500 billion in exports, which is four times what we have today. Currently, the average value of 1 kilogram of Turkish exports, from airplanes to hazelnuts, is $1.40. In South Korea, the average is $3.40 and in Germany it is $4.10. Their export products have more value-added because they are exporting local products. Therefore, by 2023, we can either quadruple the amount we export, which is not possible because global consumption will not quadruple over that time, or we can increase the value-added of Turkish exports. In the aerospace sector, our average value per kilogram is $850, and for integrated products it is over $5,000 per kilogram.</p><h4>What are TAI's plans for the FX fighter program being carried out in partnership with Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI)?</h4><p>South Korea has its own fighter program, which is called KFX. We have our own FX program, which is in the conception phase. Currently, we are examining the feasibility of the project. Instead of developing fighters individually, we realized that Korea and Turkey can work together to build a strike fighter. With a shared workload, Korea and Turkey can enjoy increased benefits.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the past year for Turkey's capital markets?<br></h4><p>The past year was a real success. Maybe the most important development was the enactment of the new Capital Markets Law, which reconfigures the legal infrastructure of the capital markets. In terms of stock exchanges, the law suggests that the exchanges be established in the form of joint-stock companies. This clause enabled our exchange to complete its demutualization process. Furthermore, through the law, the IMKB and Istanbul Gold Exchange merged under Borsa Istanbul, and the shareholders of the Turkish Derivatives Exchange (TURKDEX) are expected to join this new bourse, exchanging their shares with those of the new company at a predetermined rate. It is one of the most prominent steps in the history of Turkey's capital markets in terms of horizontal integration. In addition, our attempts continue in the course of vertical integration through increasing the shares of Borsa Istanbul in Takasbank, the local clearing and custody institution. Our bourse is already the major shareholder of MKK (Turkish CSD). Regarding the performance of the market we can look at the developments in our main index, the BIST-100. During 2012, the index has appreciated by 52%, making us first among the members of World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Accordingly, as of December 31, 2012, our market cap has increased to its 2010 levels, namely around $310 billion, recovering the decreases in 2011. Our liquidity remained relatively strong given huge decreases in the global market place. As of December 2012, we were the eighth biggest exchange among emerging market exchanges in equity market turnover. Daily average turnover was $1.8 billion during 2012. On the other hand, we maintained our position as the fourth exchange in the world in debt instrument market turnover, with a daily average volume of around $14 billion. In terms of IPOs, we can say that we had a good performance as well as compared to other bourses given 26 new companies started to be traded in our markets. Furthermore, 240 new issuances of bonds were made by Turkish companies, corresponding to a value of about $24 billion. All of these figures suggest that we will positively differentiate ourselves from the major world markets despite the continuing impacts of the global financial crisis.</p><h4>How would you characterize the potential for Turkey to become an international financial center?</h4><p>The political stability and macroeconomic developments of the last decade have converted Turkey into a center of gravity both for the region and for global companies that want to reach it. What is most remarkable here is that we could achieve this through market-friendly policies and mainly by the attempts of the Turkish private sector. Today, when we talk about Turkey, we talk about a country that has the 16th largest economy in the world with a PPP-adjusted per capita income above $15,000, with exports over $150 billion. In terms of the banking sector, today the total asset size of the sector relative to GDP is nearly 100%. This is a good indicator that the overdomination of the government on national savings is already over. Even at the heaviest times of the financial crisis, we did not put a penny into the banking system, displaying the soundness of the sector. Those are just a few simple examples. With a growing population whose median age is below 30 years, Turkey has great potential to reach its goals for 2023, namely becoming one of the 10 biggest economies of the world with a PPP-adjusted GDP of $2 trillion and exports worth $500 billion. In terms of finance, Turkey and Istanbul have great potential as well. First of all, Istanbul has already been a financial hub, historically. During history, its geographical position as a transition point between Asia and Europe has always made it a center where financial transactions take place. Secondly, there is an example I usually give. If we look to the world map, there seems a great gap between Asia and Europe. There should be a center that fulfills the needs of this empty time zone and I strongly believe that Istanbul is a natural candidate to satisfy the needs of both regional as well as global actors in terms of financial transactions. The Turkish banking sector is already well established and strong. In the course of the capital markets, the strategic attempts we have taken since last year are to serve to the overall objective of turning Istanbul into an international financial center.</p><h4>Although Fitch upgraded Turkey's foreign-currency rating to investment grade in November 2012, there is uncertainty over whether S&amp;P will follow suit in 2013. How do you expect this to affect investment inflows over the coming year?</h4><p>With respect to ratings provided by credit rating agencies, the recent financial crisis has brought about some significant issues and I believe that issues such as heavily relying on historical data and not being able to capture structural changes within an economy also hold in the case of Turkey. Therefore, I strongly believe that Turkey should have already been within the investable country range. In fact, what is not seen yet by credit rating agencies is seen by the market. If you look to the spreads on sovereign debt, you might realize that the difference between the spread of Turkish government bonds and those of the US with 30 years of maturity decreased to 180 basis points in 1Q2013. This figure is an important indicator of the recognition of the strong macro fundamentals of Turkey by international investors. Despite these concerns, the role of credit rating agencies in attracting global capital cannot be disregarded. Therefore, any increase in ratings will positively affect the investment flow. We observed this in the Fitch case.</p><div class="quote">“We plan to increase our market cap to GDP ratio to around 80%."</div><h4>What are your medium-term goals for Borsa Istanbul?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2012, we determined a strategy composed of four main building blocks. The first main pillar was the demutualization of our stock exchange and achieving horizontal integration within the Turkish capital markets. These two goals were reached last year. We launched Borsa Istanbul as a joint-stock company that combines the IMKB, Istanbul Gold Exchange, and TURKDEX under one roof. The second component was to build up a strategic alliance. In addition, increasing the depth of our market is another important concern. First of all, our activities to increase IPOs are continuing. We had 409 companies listed on our equity market in early 2013. In 2012, we visited nearly 180 of the 1,000 biggest companies in Turkey. We introduced them to the opportunities provided by the capital markets, and according to a survey conducted by our team,  one-third of them are looking to go public by 2015. Additionally, one-third suggested that they will include an IPO into their agenda by 2018. This means that more than 120 companies are planning to join the capital markets by 2018. Furthermore, our visits to SMEs in Anatolia are ongoing. Through various summits we promote the capital markets and try to increase the awareness of institutionalization throughout Turkish companies. In the medium term, we plan to increase our market cap to GDP ratio levels to around 80%, in congruence with world averages. In January 2012, this ratio was 26%, and in 2013 it is 40%. We believe that we will be able to reach the projected levels. On the demand side, we want to develop an institutional investor base.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some brief information on Armsan's field of expertise?</h4><p>As Armsan Silah Sanayi ve Ticaret A.ï¬.,established in 2006 we have first started of by manufacturing smoothbore hunting and sporting shotguns. Following a steady growth, in 2012, we produced 3,500 shotguns per month, ranking the company number three in  Turkey's shotgun sector and number 12 in the overall defense sector. As a result of the increasing number of demands,  we started manufacturing defense and tactical shotguns which made us step into the Defense Industry. The success we achieved in the international tenders showed us that we were on the correct road, which led us to focus heavily on research and development. Following a steady and significant growth in research and development, we have started  manufacturing single shot non-lethal smooth grenade launchers that can be used both in police and military fields. Last but not the least, we took pleasure in succesfully developing  modular pump action shotguns which can be applied to the infantry rifles.  It is important to note that  the other top defense companies are all government companies. Our strength as Armsan is now our  brand, which will help us become a dominant player worldwide.</p><h4>To what extent is your growth driven by the international market?</h4><p>In 2012, 88% of our production was for export, but we are continually increasing our production capacity to meet the demands. Currently, we export to over 40 countries. Although exports are our core business, we surely don't want to ignore our domestic market, where we have loyal customers.  Nevertheless, the international market is giving us more lift for growth.  Our sector is  highly influenced by the racing of  external factors  therefore we choose to work at equilibrium.  In other words,  our strategy  is to table our business plans both international and in our domestic market without becoming too dependent on neither one.  The world is changing; while in the past we had been very dependent on the US market,  after the financial crisis  we acquired that  it was unwise to be dependent on one single market . They say “Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is an old-fashioned saying, but it is indeed the grim reality.  Having gone under this kind of an experience we have learned our lesson and   expanded into many international markets where  we now have  buyers and distributors.</p><h4>What have been the advantages and challenges of operating as a Turkish brand in international markets?</h4><p>The greatest challenge has been the price competition.  Turkey is not like China where labor is cheap, therefore our price increase is amplified  by the cost of labor.  Compared to some of the countries manufacturing similar weapons, our prices are higher. On the other hand, the “Made in Turkey" image has profoundly   improved over last 10 years, which carries  a very significant advantage for us.  While a decade ago, people weren't as impressed by something that was made in Turkey, now  it is a recognized sign for quality.  Armsan's biggest advantage is  incredible correlation of  price and quality.  Although, we are not cheap, we can manufacture  a gun for  one-third the price that is the same quality as one made in Europe.     This asset which we possess enables us  the greatest advantage in the market right now.  People do not compare Armsan with other Turkish brands, but with foreign brands which has always  been our ambition for growth; competing in foreign markets.</p><h4>What is the role of personal firearms within Turkey's defense export sector?</h4><p>In terms of numbers, the shotgun sector composes just a small portion in the defense sector;  speaking in numbers it covers  only $200 million out of $1.5 billion total in the sector.  Most export trade  in the sector is based on helicopters, tanks, or for example radar systems from government companies.  On the other hand, personal firearms sector has a far more  individualistic aspect compared to the other portion of the defense market  . While the rest of the defense sector doesn't have that many direct links to the end user,  shotguns have!</p><p>On the other hand, there some of our defense products are used in the military field where The “Made in Turkey" brand, plays a very important role in the military field too,.  Even in the US or Italy, the name Armsan means something for a hunter. Who would know that a certain tank was built Turkey? The militaries might know, but the market may not.</p><h4>What is the growth potential of the Turkish personal firearms industry in 2013?</h4><p>We expect the industry's value  to at least double in size. We anticipate that 2013 will be one of the most successful years. All of the companies ranging from the small arm producers to the larger players are doing great business right now, which reflects the exciting growth in the sector.</p><h4>What does that mean for Armsan's goals over the next few years?</h4><p>We  already are a major player in our local market , but we don't think that it is enough. Compared to other arms producers, we consider ourselves still a baby,  who is still improving.  Consequently, our goal is to pursue more international sales and become one of the significant players.  Maybe not right now,  but in 10 years we want to be one of the top-10 shotgun manufacturers in the world. There are already a number of very large groups in the market, and it is not easy for a Turkish company. It might be a dream for now, but hopefully it will come true; and we are working on it.</p><h4>How would you characterize the company's activity in 2013?</h4><p>We are diving deeper into the defense sector. Because of the brand of “Made in Turkey" and Armsan's reputation, we are starting to get involved with a number of important tenders all over the world. Some tenders have been  for police departments or militaries;  for example, we won a huge tender in Bangladesh for 5,000 pump action units.  We successfully manufactured  and delivered the order. We also won other tenders in Kosovo, Thailand, and Tunisia. These experiences have  given us an opportunities to get involved in the tactical side of the defense sector. We are also seeking other ways to modify our weapons to meet the specific needs of these clients. Although we do not offer a variety of products currently, we want to  launch new products for defense area which will have nothing related to hunting. We still consider ourselves a hunting company, but we eagerly want to branch out on defense line as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Turkey's significance to Rolls-Royce developed over time?<br></h4><p>Rolls-Royce has been involved in Turkey for many years, with most of our engagement performed remotely without the benefit of a local platform from which to operate. What has changed in recent years is the realization that the overall business case has grown so significantly across all of our business segments that it became important to coordinate our various activities in the country, through one integrated, coherent, long-term strategy. This in essence led us to set up the corporate office for Rolls-Royce in April 2012. As you are aware, Rolls-Royce is a global power systems company operating in multiple sectors: civil aerospace, with our primary customer being Turkish Airlines; Defense aerospace, principally through the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) and Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI); marine sector, providing propulsion and auxiliary systems both for vessels and naval military vessels, through SSM, shipyards, and fleet operators; energy sector, focusing on providing turbo-machinery for pumping oil and gas through pipelines and gas compression stations, as well as power generation for gas-fired power plants of up to 200 MW in capacity. Finally, we operate in the civil nuclear sector delivering reactor plant instrumentation and controls systems to reactor vendors as well as mechanical components for the nuclear island. Turkey is moving into the next phase of its impressive development in high-value engineering and manufacturing projects, which is precisely the segment Rolls-Royce is renowned for internationally. In essence, we believe there is very good alignment between Turkey's strategic industrial priorities and those of Rolls-Royce.</p><h4>What are the most important sectors for Rolls-Royce in Turkey?</h4><p>What is unique about Turkey is that each business segment described above presents great opportunities. The civil aerospace sector is significant because of the extraordinary fleet expansion of Turkish airlines into long-haul routes for which our engines have world-leading performance and fuel efficiency characteristics. Turkey's plans to develop its own indigenous aircraft in the defense sector provide collaborative opportunities in power systems and services solutions. When you consider the geo-strategic and economic significance of the southern energy corridor in Turkey, pipeline projects such as TANAP and the need for gas-power plants as an element of the country's long-term energy mix, then you see this segment has high relevance to our business as well. Nuclear is a stated strategic area for Turkey, and Rolls-Royce is intending to participate in both Akkuyu and Sinop projects, working through the respective reactor vendors. Finally, the naval ship construction programs in Turkey are of great importance. Our ability to deliver propulsion system solutions to our customers, especially in conjunction with MTU, which we recently acquired jointly with Daimler, provides strong prospects, as MTU is already well represented in Turkey.</p><h4>What can Rolls-Royce bring in relation to others in the defense sector?</h4><p>What differentiates us is our desire to engage in high-value engineering, manufacturing, and support activities in the long term, through partnerships with the Turkish defense industry. Our capabilities include power systems for helicopter, trainer aircraft, and fighter jet programs but also the design of propulsion systems for naval ships. Very few companies have the breadth of systems engineering and services capabilities that Rolls-Royce has across as many different platforms.</p><div class="quote">“Rolls-Royce is a global power systems company operating in multiple sectors."</div><h4>What are your top goals in Turkey over the medium term?</h4><p>Our goals are to position ourselves through a sound industrial strategy, which includes developing partnerships in Turkey's most significant programs in aerospace, marine, and energy (including nuclear). In doing so, making best use of our skills, our high-value engineering, and our manufacturing capabilities to the benefit of our local customers in these areas will be a priority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Sustainable development is growth that doesn't burden our children or grandchildren. We at the EBRD believe that the current economic crisis is an opportunity for us all to have a close look at the way we manage our resources and build our future. And we are already doing exactly that in Turkey.</p><p>Our understanding of the way resources power growth is changing. For years we believed that resource prices would not increase in real terms. And we assumed that the world around us could absorb our economies' waste products at little or no cost. But as the world's economy has expanded, we have been extracting and consuming resources ever more hungrily, even as climate change threatens to make some of them, such as water and food, scarcer. Commodity prices have risen sharply and in a much more volatile fashion than before.</p><p>Of course, as prices rise, so the incentives for efficiencies and innovation increase. Businesses realize that smart approaches to energy and resources will make them more competitive. And in Turkey we can already see that dynamic in action.</p><p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) invests in 34 countries across Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. Some of them are resource superpowers, sitting on huge natural resource stocks. Others are resource starved, heavily dependent on imports for their energy needs and may also be short of water and thus even more vulnerable to the impact of climate change.</p><p>The EBRD invests one-quarter of its annual business volume in projects that promote sustainable energy or, increasingly, the sustainable use of resources. As of now, we have invested over ‚¬11 billion in this field and our projects have reduced CO2 emissions by 50 million tons already.</p><p>Turkey is one country where our efforts are welcomed not only by the government, but also by the private sector. To date, we have invested more than ‚¬1.2 billion in sustainable energy in Turkey, almost half of our total portfolio in the country. EBRD-funded renewable energy generators already produce about 7,000 GWh annually, the equivalent of lighting all homes in a city of 4 million people—almost the size of Ankara.</p><p>The bank supports sustainable energy generation through investment in renewable energy, such as wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass, and high-efficiency, gas-fired plants, which are significantly less carbon-intensive than coal. This is achieved through direct investment in large wind farms and gas-fired projects and via credit lines tailored for medium-sized renewable energy generators.</p><p>The EBRD also has an extensive program for promoting energy efficiency, saving businesses money in the long run and making them more competitive. Credit lines for businesses and households support this, as do pioneering schemes in which clients pay for energy improvements from savings on their bills.</p><p>Other international organizations, most notably the EU and the Clean Technology Fund, are also working with the EBRD to strengthen Turkey's sustainable development and energy independence by providing grants that finance expertise.</p><p>At the same time, there are many other ways of championing sustainability. For example, we need to capture the commercial value of waste material when it is produced and boost reutilization and recycling. The EBRD has studied the issue together with the government of Turkey, and we see considerable opportunities here for both the public and private sectors. A lot of industrial waste can be converted into a valuable raw material. A recent EBRD loan to Befesa Silvermet for $49 million will help the company build a zinc recycling plant in Adana. There are more deals we are looking at that will help Turkish businesses turn waste into a resource.</p><p>Some say that efficiency, as in energy efficiency, water efficiency, or materials efficiency is not the most rousing of battle cries. I beg to differ. An economy that husbands its energy resources efficiently is an economy that is more competitive and better placed to face the challenges of tomorrow than one that doesn't.</p><p>In May 2013, the EBRD held its Annual Meeting and Business Forum in Istanbul under the slogan “Innovating for Growth." The more efficient use of the natural resources around us can be a powerful spur to change. The EBRD will continue to push for more innovation in this area. And we hope that the Sustainable Resource Initiative, which we launched in Turkey at the Annual Meeting, will bring real change to every country where we are active, from Morocco to Mongolia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Considering the Factors]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[considering-the-factors]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Turkey for Alamos Gold?</h4><p>Our expansion into Turkey in 2010 has been a significant step toward becoming a 500,000-ounce gold producer. Alamos Gold, through our wholly owned subsidiary of Kuzey Biga Madencilik in Turkey, is currently planning the construction and operation of two mines in the Çanakkale region. One of the planned mines referred to as the Kirazlı Gold Mine is located near the village of Kirazlı, and our second mine is Ağı Dağı, located near the village of Kızılelma. The nearest town is Can, about 20 kilometers from Ağı Dağı Gold Mine. The Kirazlı and Ağı Dağı Gold Mines will be located about 35 kilometers and 55 kilometers from Canakkale-Center, respectively. Based on the prefeasibility studies completed in June 2012, Alamos Gold has decided to proceed with the investment plans associated with the Kirazlı and Ağı Dağı Gold Mines, which are estimated to contain 1.5 million ounces of gold and about 5 million ounces of silver. The associated initial investment (CAPEX) is estimated to be approximately $424 million. We plan to maintain our brand name as one of the leading low cost producers throughout the currently planned mine life of about 10 years. With the addition of further reserves from our third property next to Ağı Dağı referred to as Camyurt, as well as the on-going drilling activities at Kirazlı and Ağı Dağı properties, a mine life of 15 years with higher gold and silver reserves will not be surprising.</p><h4>How would you characterize the opportunities for foreign investors entering Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey offers significant differentiators in the global and competitive investment environment. The top five positive differentiators are: a very stable political environment, vast human capital, a stable economy, a mature construction industry, and a solid banking system. Furthermore, the Turkish government in 2012 has established investment incentives that extend to foreign investors as well as to Turkish investors. The recent changes in the trade laws and regulations provide for the same benefits for foreign investors and Turkish firms. Within the sensitive geopolitical region, Turkey has demonstrated a very stable political report card during the last decade. This is an important factor for any foreign investor from a political risk point of view. In contrast to regions where human capital is lacking and/or not well developed, Turkey offers a very dynamic and young population where 50% are below the age of 30. The value of this human capital is further advanced with training and education through many local universities. Controlling capital cost escalations during the construction phase of the investment is one of the major concerns of the mining industry. Turkey's very mature construction industry, which is second to China, marginalizes one of the key risks for a mining investor. A stable economy is also a prerequisite in the search for risk-averse regions by an investor. Turkey's economy has weathered the global economic crisis with a “battle-tested," solid banking system. It is no wonder that there is great deal of excitement in the Turkish business environment associated with the goal of becoming the 10th largest economy by 2023. In order to assist in achieving this economic goal, the investment incentives that have been established in 2012 deserve a deeper analysis to recognize Turkey's positive place in the global competitive environment. I would also encourage potential foreign investors to look beyond the borders of Turkey to fully recognize the unique geopolitical potential of the country in the region, which encompasses the Middle East, Africa, and the Turkic republics.</p><h4>What should Turkey do to promote itself more aggressively to international investors?</h4><p>Turkey has significant differentiators within the global competitive investment environment. However, it is essential that these positive factors are more than regularly communicated to the investment communities, as well as target industry sectors such as mining. The government ministries and special agencies, such as the Investment Support and Promotion Agency (İSPAT) are doing a fantastic job in promoting Turkey in the international markets. I would suggest one of the target groups to be the financial communities associated with mining as well. It is important for the financial analysts that follow and invest in mining companies to be fully informed about the positive investment factors associated with Turkey, so that the perceived investment risks are be more aligned with reality. I also believe that foreign companies that have already invested in Turkey should spread the word as well. However, in addition to active promotion of Turkey in the financial markets, it is also essential to demonstrate success. Do not forget; success attracts success.</p><h4>What challenge does resource nationalism present for international mining companies in Turkey?</h4><p>Resource nationalism is a significant deterrent for foreign investors in the natural resource sector. However, Turkey is also showing a positive differentiator in this area by actively promoting FDI in the natural resource sectors such as mining, oil, and conventional and unconventional gas. Particularly mining is a risky investment, and it also is capital intensive. As the Istanbul Stock Exchange is expanded as planned, Turkey could become an alternate center for raising capital and investment in the natural resource sector. It is important to recognize that the national benefit from extractive industries is through royalties and taxes. Along the path to attract FDI, countries find themselves in the global competitive environment where these two financial factors play a key role in investment decisions. Therefore, in order to gain an advantage in this competitive investment environment, Turkey has developed investment incentives.</p><h4>How does Turkey rank among other mining investment destinations around the world?</h4><p>The Fraser Institute interviews close to 2,000 mining executives about their investments around the world, and then based on that questionnaire they ranked countries from an investment point of view. Turkey continuously climbs the ladder. In 2011—2012, we were 60th among 93 countries. Currently, we are 53rd among 96 jurisdictions, so our position has gone up slightly. What is more important to me is that Turkey is ranked as a more favorable investment location compared to the BRIC countries of, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Overall, I believe that Turkey's position in 2012 is a remarkable achievement, which will increase as the industry becomes more familiar with Turkey's differentiators.</p><h4>How does Kuzey Biga Madencilik incorporate social responsibility into its mining projects in Turkey?</h4><p>Obtaining a Social License to Operate (SLO) has always been an extremely important component of our investment plans. We strongly believe that our principles must align with the values of the local communities. In order to achieve this alignment, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 30 villages in the vicinity of our planned mines to fully understand their needs, challenges, fears of today, and dreams for the future. Developing social responsibility projects prior to an in-depth understanding of the communities needs for today and tomorrow could be off target. Additionally, our facility design will use advanced and proven technologies to protect the environment that is important for the livelihood of the communities. Furthermore, we will be constructing a reservoir that will provide clean drinking water to 30 villages as a part of our planned projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Baycan Law Office leverage its experience and reputation to provide the most innovative and expert advice for its clients?<br></h4><p>On the basis of our experience in the mining sector mainly and many years of legal practise in Turkey, we approach our clients as business partners. We evaluate their business plan and targets together based on their attitudes and mid- to long-term plans. We use all of our legal, financial, and networking skills to assist our clients in the most effective way. We have changed the old-school lawyer attitude, and we have an innovative approach to creating business solutions for our clients. Our law firm consists of lawyers and consultants who have expertise in mining law and administrative law, which constitute the basis of our operations in the mining sector. Within this scope, our firm is familiar with large- and small-scale mining firms, provides its experience to firms that intend to work in the mining area, shares its knowledge regarding the functioning of public institutions, and cooperates with ministries and general directorates for revisions to the Mining Law. As we have a power of disposition on regulations, our firm can therefore inspect the suitability of transactions prior to applications and, in this regard, we act as a preventive mechanism.</p><h4>What distinguishes Baycan Law Office among Turkish commercial law firms?</h4><p>Our sectorial experience that focuses on mining and energy is a distinguishing factor for Baycan Law Office. The legal and financial solutions we have found for our clients so far have become a good example and the best advertisement of our skills and experience. For this reason, Baycan Law Office has increased its reputation and developed a good name in the mining sector. Also, with the management and direction of our Officer Partner İsmail Biçer, all of our team members are ready to assist our clients at any time of day. Our main objective is to assist our clients and, as most of our clients are foreign companies, to make them feel that they have a good partner in Turkey who is always ready to assist.</p><h4>How does Turkey compare to other mining investment destinations globally?</h4><p>The Turkish government provides attractive incentives for every type of investment, and especially FDI. These are supportive regulations that have been enacted to draw the attention of foreign investors. In addition to that, in the mining sector, amendments to the regulations are all being made for one reason: to support a real, solid, and focused mining investor with financial capabilities. Our Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Taner Yıldız, is always ready to deal with the problems faced by investors and companies. In addition, Hamdi Yıldırım, General Manager of the General Directorate of Mining Affairs, is always ready to assist foreign investors. Current legislation and the attitude of bureaucrats and the administrative organs are friendly to investors.</p><h4>How would you characterize the growth of Turkey's gold mining sector over the past decade?</h4><p>The increase over the last 10 years is a good signal for the future. There are several mines in operation and there are other mines being developed, too. Today, market prices for gold might seem negative for the gold sector; however, if you examine gold prices over the last 30 years, it is possible that it will increase at any time. The Turkish mining sector is growing and we are happy to be part of it. In order to be successful, it is important to establish a business with the right people, the right partner, and the right resources to get ahead in the gold mining sector in Turkey.</p><h4>Turkey's gold mining sector has been dominated by international firms so far. Is this a trend that you expect to continue in the future?</h4><p>This is true to some extent; however, there are several leading Turkish gold mining companies that are very large and have the potential to dominate in the international scene, too. For this reason, it is hard to say that gold mining sector in Turkey is dominated by international firms; however, this statement might be true in quantitative terms when it comes to foreign investors. This could perhaps be due to the extensive experience needed in the gold mining sector and the long-term profits that are reaped. Beyond any doubt, Turkish investors will take into account the potential long-term profits and play a more efficient role in the sector. However, the lack of technical experience will necessitate the cooperation of Turkish and foreign firms.</p><h4>Which segments of Turkey's energy sector will present the greatest opportunities for investors in the coming years?</h4><p>Turkey has a growing energy demand. Because of that need today, and for the future, especially with Turkey's admirable goal of being the 10th largest economy by 2023, there are many opportunities for investors. Recently, the excitement created by the shale gas/shale oil “revolution" in America has generated interest in Turkey regarding her shale gas and shale oil potential. The media attention and the ratification of the new petroleum law coupled with the fact that Turkey is heavily reliant on the importation of oil and gas to meet its growing energy demands has created excitement within the government and the industry. The shale gas industry here in Turkey is really in its infancy stage. We do not know what the real shale gas/oil resource potential is. Therefore, there are great opportunities for the right investors who have the technical know-how and appetite to explore for a shale gas/oil resource. Additionally, Turkey has large lignite reserves. The government has placed an emphasis on utilizing these reserves for power generation to help meet her energy needs; which presents a good opportunity for investors.</p><h4>What is your prediction for Turkey's mining and energy sectors over the medium term?</h4><p>In the energy sector, Turkey has a large account deficit with a large percentage of that associated with petroleum and gas imports. Turkey's energy needs are increasing; and where there is a need, there is an opportunity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SSM wants Turkey's defense and aerospace sectors to contribute 5% to the country's exports by 2025. What needs to be done to achieve this goal?</h4><p>First, it is important to clarify that we are targeting $25 billion of exports for defense, aerospace, and homeland security products, which slightly broadens the scope beyond what is currently accounted for in the 2012 numbers. Still, significant growth in each of these three components will be required to reach our goal. In the defense component, we are expecting growth from the major platforms that are now moving into the early stages of production in Turkey. These are platforms like the Altay main battle tank, the MİLGEM combat ship, the Anka UAV, and the T129 ATAK helicopter. When these reach full-scale production, they will have significant export potential and I believe they will play a big part in reaching our target for the defense component. In the commercial aerospace component, I have strong belief that the Turkish aerospace sector will show significant growth in the coming years because we have an advantage when you compare quality and cost. Turkey's commercial aerospace sector meets all modern standards, but at one-third of the cost of the European and US sectors. In the homeland security component, we will be leveraging the strength of the Turkish market to produce more unique Turkish products for export. In the past, we only worked with the Turkish Armed Forces; now we also work with Turkish police and intelligence organizations. That means we can field-test some Turkish designs. Once they are field-proven, they will have export potential.</p><h4>Is Turkey aiming to diversify its defense export markets?</h4><p>As we continue to field new products, we will be able to bring those products to new markets. Naturally, we start with our immediate neighborhood and friends. Of course, this will extend over time to countries that are farther away. Today, we can talk about MENA, Central Asia, and South Asia as our main export markets, but maybe over the longer term we will be looking toward Latin America as well.</p><h4>What steps is the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) taking to promote innovation in the defense and aerospace sectors?</h4><p>Promoting innovation has been our major push over the last decade. Previously, our defense industry consisted mostly of licensed producers, but over the last decade we have invested very heavily in R&amp;D, engineering, and development activities. R&amp;D investments now approach $1 billion per year, and we are already seeing the results of that investment in Turkish equipment. This growth will continue, expanding into new technology and areas, but, of course, it will depend on the capacity of the country in science and technology. It is not only a question of developing the products, but developing the capabilities. In many sectors, innovation is still very limited. We are still essentially a manufacturing country rather than a design and innovation country. In the defense sector, we are trying to make that transition, but it is not entirely straightforward. The important thing is to manage the risks associated with designing your own products. When you are manufacturing a licensed product, you don't have a product risk to deal with—someone else developed the product to meet a market need. When we are developing Turkish products, we bear the full product risk alone. That makes it a challenging transition to develop both the equipment and the capability. The first phase of this process is product development. We are coming to the end of this phase now and we have been fairly successful. The risk in the product development phase is that you can invest without ever seeing an end result. In each segment where we have invested, we have been able to develop fielded products. That is very encouraging as we move into the next phase of this process. Overall, it has been a successful transition. We have been able to grow our engineering capacity in the defense industry, and now we have a significant engineering force to use moving forward into the next phase of projects. The next phase of projects will be in a few different areas. Aerospace will be a major focus. We will be developing a medium-category utility helicopter, funded by SSM and contracted to TAI. We will also be developing a more advanced jet engine UAV that can travel at higher altitudes with longer endurance (the current Anka UAV uses piston engines). We are also currently in the early conceptual design phase for a future Turkish fighter aircraft. In naval programs, we have a major frigate program for air defense. In regard to land systems, the plans mainly focus on putting the current products into production. With missiles, we may also have more activity, such as guided missiles and anti-tank or anti-ship missiles.</p><h4>What are Turkey's medium-term goals in space technology?</h4><p>Our main objective is to build our own satellites, which is why we are investing about $100 million in a space and satellite integration center on the TAI premises outside of Ankara. The center will be an assembly, integration, and testing facility for all types of satellites, both military and commercial. According to the “Satellite Roadmap" that we recently completed, we expect to build approximately one satellite per year for the foreseeable future. We also are investing in R&amp;D to build our capacity to produce the individual components that make up satellites. In the longer term, we are also aiming to develop satellite launch capability.</p><h4>How will Teknopark Istanbul enhance Turkey's defense and aerospace capabilities?</h4><p>Teknopark Istanbul will be a hub for defense, commercial aerospace, marine technologies, and industrial software. We want to tap into Istanbul's human resources. Most of the R&amp;D and engineering for the defense industry is located in Ankara. Ankara has two major universities and a number of good technical colleges, but there are more in Istanbul. For a graduate of an Istanbul university, it is a challenge to come to Ankara, so we want to bring the R&amp;D centers of these companies to Istanbul to access the human resources there. We also want to encourage the defense sector to interact more with other private sector industries, and Istanbul has a much richer private sector portfolio. Overall, we believe Teknopark Istanbul will be a major innovation source for Turkey. It will be opening in September 2013. The first phase of the Teknopark will include about 100 companies, but it will eventually grow to include 1,000 companies. The Teknopark has been heavily over-subscribed, and we are in the process of selecting the first 100 companies. Over the next 10 years, the park will grow to reach its full capacity.</p><h4>As Turkish defense technology becomes increasingly focused on high-tech design and innovation, how will you ensure that SMEs remain involved in the supply chain?</h4><p>SME involvement is a very important component of our activities. We actively support the involvement of SMEs in all of our defense programs through several initiatives. Any contract we sign with a prime contractor will include requirements for SME involvement, such as work-share thresholds. That has shown some results. For example, in OSTİM industrial zone on Ankara, the number of SMEs working in defense programs has risen from 10 to 100 over the last five years. For Turkey overall, the number is more than 1,000. As we continue this policy, more SMEs are moving from making simple parts to more complex manufacturing, sub-assembly, and even engineering some products. We have two objectives with this policy; the first is to use the dynamism of SMEs to bring cost savings, the second is for this defense investment to filter into other sectors of the Turkish economy. Right now, the defense sector is the largest investor in R&amp;D in Turkey. We hope that our investments through these SMEs will trickle into other sectors of the economy. Each of these 1,000 companies work in a wider range of sectors than just defense, and can apply what they learn in defense to the other sectors. All of them have developed their technological capacity, quality standards, and project management skills through working in a defense program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shell is one of the largest investors in Qatar, having invested $21 billion since 2006. How would you evaluate the significance of Qatar's operations for the Shell Group?</h4><p>Today, Shell Qatar represents over 10% of the Shell Group, whether you use reserves, financial, or production statistics. However, I think that the importance of Shell Qatar goes beyond numbers. Shell Qatar is a story of a partnership with one of the most progressive and forward-looking national oil companies in the Middle East, Qatar Petroleum. The story of Shell Qatar over the last decade is something we can now tell shareholders and partners to explain Shell's ability to take on arguably the most technologically complex plant in the world at Pearl GTL, and, over time, build it up and operate it efficiently. It is a demonstration of operational excellence, and I believe it has given us the wind in our sails and has affected the Group more than the numbers show.</p><h4>Pearl GTL is the largest plant of its type in the world. What operational challenges has this posed for you?</h4><p>Over the  course of construction, at its peak, we had over 52,000 people working on this project. One way to describe it is this: some two and a half Eiffel Towers were being erected on a monthly basis for a period of six to eight months, just in terms of the steel that was going into the ground at that time. There is a huge amount of complexity in the project too, by all measures. We tend to ramp up projects of this scale over time in a way that allows us to ensure safe and reliable production. There are 3,500 technologies used in this plant, and by and large they all started up first try. Operationally, we have also been able to move this project along at a reasonable speed. With the exception of some small maintenance issues, it has gone well. If I reflect back, I am extremely happy to be where we are today.</p><div class="quote">“We have been the largest spenders in the last five or six years among our peers in terms of R&amp;D."</div><h4>Shell Qatar recently announced two new corporate social responsibility (CSR) developments in association with Tafawoq. What are these concerning, and what other efforts is Shell making with regard to CSR in Qatar?</h4><p>With regard to Tafawoq, our project management center of excellence, it is an absolutely critical part of our commitment to Qatar, and it is in partnership with Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Hamad Bin Khalifa University. We are currently formalizing a home for Tafawoq in Hamad Bin Khalifa University, and in 2012 we signed an MoU to bring the university in on the project when Her Highness Sheikha Mozah joined us in Amsterdam. This is where she also met with our CEO, and on the back of that we have really been able to cement the role of the school. In 2012, we graduated around 95 participants, and in 2013 we expect to add around 150. It is part of Shell's global expertise in project management excellence, something that is known as the Shell Project Academy, which is ranked from a project capability perspective second only to NASA's program in project management. QP had the confidence to partner with us following the success of Pearl GTL. It is a core part of bringing our expertise to support the Qatar National Vision 2030. The vision really is the guiding light for our CSR operations. As the largest international investor in Qatar, we have a responsibility to support the state of Qatar and its ambitions. We employ over 310 Qatari staff as part of our organization, so we are getting more and more of a Qatari character. Tafawoq is just one aspect of our work though, and we are also very focused on technology, road safety, and sports and healthy lifestyle projects.</p><h4>How does this commitment to the community strengthen your relationship with Qatar?</h4><p>It is a two-way street. Partly, it allows us to understand what Qatar wants. If you are out there actively wanting to contribute to society you will be listening to what society wants and learning what you can do to help. As we do this, and because we do everything in partnership with Qatari institutions, we also learn how to grow as a business within the country, but also in a more regional sense we gain an understanding of what is happening on a broader scale. It helps us to align with the evolution of the countries in the region. It is a good way for our staff to take a step outside of Shell and understand what is happening, whether by mentoring or teaching students in university or through the road safety projects, and to see what Qatar is really about.</p><h4>To what extent is Shell contributing to the diversification of Qatar's downstream sector?</h4><p>One of our biggest contributions so far is our involvement in the next large petrochemical project named Al Karaana, which will be a major facility, containing the largest unit in the world for producing monoethylene glycol. We will also be producing linear alpha olefins and oxo alcohols from this project. It is a massive project, and QP is an 80% shareholder with Shell holding 20%. This contribution is really cementing this area of diversification for Qatar. Pearl GTL is a fully integrated project, but all of our products, gasoil, normal paraffins, naphtha, GTL kerosene, and base oils, are all products that a downstream project would normally produce. Between Pearl GTL and Al Karaana, it is fair to say that we are making a significant contribution to Qatar's downstream ambitions.</p><h4>Qatar is actively trying to become a worldwide center of research excellence, and you have committed $100 million in the form of your new research center in the Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park (QSTP). What made Shell decide to commit in such a way to Qatar's research ambitions?</h4><p>I think research and technology are in our DNA. We have been the largest spenders in the last five or six years among our peers in terms of R&amp;D. In 2012, we spent $1.3 billion on R&amp;D, by far outdoing our competitors. It is our fundamental belief in the importance of R&amp;D, in a place such as Qatar, which is so crucial for the Shell portfolio, and that led us to be convinced into opening a major research facility here. We were the first tenants in the QSTP, and we were there to anchor and support the Qatar Foundation in its endeavor. It is one thing to sign up and give money, and another to actively try to make it work. One of the things that I am personally proud of is something that is going to be a game-changer, not just for the state of Qatar, but for the world, and here I am referring specifically to our partnership with QP and the Imperial College. We have a significant commitment—$70 million—around studying carbonates and carbon capturing and sequestration. There are 30-40 PhDs employed now, and it is the largest R&amp;D program that includes academia, the private sector, and the government all in one. Labs have opened up in the Imperial College in London and are also being moved out here. A big part of our work force in the QSTP is Qatari.</p><h4>How do you deal with hiring skilled labor, and do you collaborate with universities?</h4><p>Good technical talent is in short supply, and everyone is eager to grab any new talent that comes. We have been lucky here, however, as the Qatari education system has been producing some excellent talent recently. We have managed to come from employing zero Qataris 10 years ago to 310 currently, so we have been able to find some very good staff on the market. Beyond that, we tap into the Shell expatriate network and into local non-nationals, too. We have established a reputation in the market for providing good training and support, so this is attractive for potential employees. There have been five Qatarization awards given so far, and we have won four of those. That reputation has gone into the market, and we received a lot of interest in general. The focus we continue to have for employees is in good development, challenging work, and a solid future in Shell Qatar.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans and strategies here in Qatar?</h4><p>For our existing assets, Pearl GTL and Qatargas 4, we are focused on operational excellence as we have invested a significant amount in the country. We need to ensure efficiency in order to pay back our investors. Looking forward, we are anchored to downstream developments with the Al Karaana Petrochemicals project, but there are also opportunities in upstream exploration, non-North Field areas, in Block D in what is known as the Pre-Khuff area. We have a 75% Shell-operated venture with 25% for CNPC, where we are currently exploring in horizons that are deeper than the Khuff horizons. We currently have a rig that is drilling there. We see growth in petrochemicals, in exploration, and, to be honest, we stand ready, with a workforce of 1,500 with all the capabilities and skills, to address any new ambitions that QP has. For us, it is about being the partner of choice for QP as it embarks on its next phase of growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-most-favored-relationship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Bilateral relations between Belgium and Turkey reach back to the founding years of the Kingdom of Belgium. Less than two months after Leopold I had been enthroned as the first King of the Belgians on 21 July, 1831, industrialists from Lií¨ge and Verviers petitioned the King to formalize relations between our young Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire, convinced as they were of the promising future of closer relations between the two countries on the brink of industrial development and modernization. The first step was the conclusion of the bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Commerce in 1838, followed in 1839 by the establishment of the Belgian Consulate in Istanbul. Business relations started to thrive. Maritime links between Antwerp and Istanbul from the 1850s onward strengthened commercial relations further. In 1862, a new bilateral Treaty on Commerce and Navigation entered into force, granting Belgium the status of most favored nation by the Empire and guaranteeing free and toll-exempted passage through the Straits to both Belgian cargo and ships under the Belgian flag. By the early 20th century, Belgian steel mills contributed to the construction of railways, and Belgian companies operated the first electricity and streetcar networks in Istanbul.</p><p>It is useful to dwell for a moment on this rich economic history between our countries, because it underscores the solid foundations that Belgium's diplomatic and economic presence in Turkey can build on today.</p><div class="quote">“My last visit to Turkey also enabled me to witness the strength of our relations beyond economy and trade."</div><p>In the 21st century, our bilateral economic relations started to prosper exponentially. Over the last 10 years, Belgian investment in Turkey has exceeded ‚¬5 billion and bilateral trade between Belgium and Turkey approached ‚¬8 billion in 2012. Belgium, benefiting from its central location and assets as a logistical and distribution hub, has become Turkey's sixth largest market in the EU.</p><p>The future looks promising, as it was in the early days. In October 2012, I had the immense privilege to lead a Belgian economic mission to Turkey. It was the largest mission Belgium organized that year and one of the largest ever. About 300 Belgian entrepreneurs representing nearly 200 companies participated. The mission focused on the construction, energy, and banking technology sectors, but other sectors such as logistics and environmental technologies were also represented. The synergies and complementarities that may be exploited between Belgian and Turkish ports again became evident. I was especially struck by the potential of cooperation between Belgian and Turkish companies in tertiary markets such as Africa and Central Asia, where our mutual experience and know-how can lead to genuine added value.</p><p>I was not surprised by the success of the mission. Situated on the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey has all it takes to be sure of long-term sustainable growth and is already on its way to becoming one of the 10 largest economies in the world. Steady economic reforms and a stable regulatory environment in combination with serious investment policies continue to provide reassuring guarantees for foreign investors. A business-friendly visa policy enabling Turkish guests in Belgium to acquire their visas in the shortest possible time has also contributed to a multiplication of business relations.</p><p>My last visit to Turkey also enabled me to witness the strength of our relations beyond economy and trade. During several meetings, President Gül, Prime Minister Erdoğan, Deputy Prime Minister Babacan, and Minister Çağlayan voiced their determination to continue reforms and align legislation with the EU acquis. Belgium has always been a staunch supporter of the Turkish-EU accession process and has consistently supported Turkey in meeting the political requirements and other criteria that will help both Turkey and the EU overcome obstacles and prepare for a new phase in their common history.</p><p>Economic, trade, and inter-state relations put aside, what has really allowed our countries to become closer are every-day human relations. People-to-people contact, such as university exchanges that bring more than 400 Turkish students and researchers to Belgium every year, or the yearly increasing number of Belgian visitors to Turkey's cultural and natural treasures, offer ample opportunities to get to know each other better. Most importantly, the significant number of citizens of Turkish descent in Belgium and the quality of their integration into Belgian society have not only contributed to Belgian wealth and prosperity over the years, but also to genuine understanding and the establishment of a mature bond of friendship. The commemoration in 2014 of the 50th anniversary of the 1964 bilateral agreement on the employment of Turkish workers in Belgium will be an appropriate occasion to highlight their valuable role.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[complementary-hubs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Airport Free Zone strengthen the Emirate as an international business hub?</h4><p>The free zone is an opportunity to connect organizations that are linked with aviation directly, and there are a number of obvious examples. Cargo has a direct correlation in terms of growth in passenger numbers because suitcases take a fraction of the available space in the cargo hold, and the rest is filled with commercial cargo, as well as dedicated freighters that fly cargo only. As this airport grows as a global hub, so does the cargo component, adding significant business value. The free zone has been deliberately created for businesses that connect freight from one place to many others.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi Airport passenger numbers have increased from 5 million to 16.5 million in a few years. What noticeable trends are emerging?</h4><p>The large number of dominant markets is a function of population, the expatriate profile, and Etihad Airways. In terms of the markets for us, number one is India, and interestingly number two is Germany, which came as a bit of a surprise. Etihad has a stake in Air Berlin, and that changed all of the dynamics in terms of the way in which Abu Dhabi is connected as a regional hub. We have a number of very popular routes to India, Germany, Thailand, the Philippines, and the UK. The catalyst in many respects is the economic and understandably strategic Vision 2030. Growth has also been driven heavily by Etihad, a company that has exhibited a stunning performance in recent years.</p><h4>What potential is there for the growth and development of Al Ain International Airport?</h4><p>Al Ain is the largest inland city in the UAE, Abu Dhabi being the largest Emirate, and we operate that airport with a number of very important strategic partners who have four airlines operating on a commercial basis. Al Ain is designed to be the aerospace cluster. At the moment, the primary businesses working with us there are government based—one is Strata, an aero-structure manufacturer. The growth of such businesses will be a significant contributing factor for Al Ain International Airport. In terms of the commercial side of it, it is fair to say that we would probably see more flights to Al Ain International Airport if Etihad had more aircraft. In summary, Al Ain International Airport is a key strategic asset, it serves the important community of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, and it will almost certainly grow commercially. However, it is unlikely that Al Ain will emerge as a major international hub.</p><div class="quote">“Emirates has been a game changer over the last 14 years."</div><h4>How do you compete in this competitive environment?</h4><p>Emirates has been a game changer over the last 14 years, and the company has almost redefined what big fleets and mainline airlines look like in this day and age and raised the bar in terms of quality. Etihad, while it is a younger and smaller airline, has arguably the same or perhaps a slightly superior quality on offer and its growth has been remarkable. As a result of that, airlines have strived for quality. For people in the discerning middle classes with disposable incomes, quality is always going to be a winning ticket. Emirates has enjoyed the benefit of using Dubai as a destination that has continued to evolve over the past 14 years. Now, people almost describe Dubai as one of the top-five cities in the world, which is not surprising. However, if Dubai is New York, Abu Dhabi is similar to Washington. This is the capital city and a different level of commerce comes with that. That has been one of the many factors that has stimulated remarkable growth here in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What role can ADAC play in attracting more tourists to Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>We are an airport-operating company that is focused on infrastructure. Obviously, the airlines decide where to fly, and for both Etihad and Emirates, a significant part of the business proposition is connectivity. Considering the broader Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, making the UAE a tourism destination is a key part of the plan. The work taking place at Saadiyat Island is a good example of a destination proposition for Abu Dhabi. Now, passengers flying from Frankfurt to Sydney and connecting via Abu Dhabi may choose a three-day stopover here because there is a leisure attraction. Stopover tourists can watch a Grand Prix, play golf on Saadiyat, or enjoy our beaches. However, in terms of the airport operator ADAC, it is how we implement and market the airport infrastructure—there would be no Saadiyat Island without access to global transport. This is all part of the wisdom of strategy 2030. It is all pieces of a puzzle that fit together, and there is a picture on the outside of the box to use as a reference.</p><h4>In the coming years, Dubai's airports will be some of the busiest in the world. What impact will that have on Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>It is difficult to say, but I believe that it's logical to believe that when an airport's capacity is restrained, there is often a trickle effect. Changes in capacity are in the pipeline, such as Al Maktoum International Airport, and we may see the trickle effect start to reverse. However, it comes down to which airlines are serving which airport, and which destinations those airlines are serving. To answer your question, we would almost need to make a map of the routes—Emirates versus Etihad—to identify the extremely popular routes and focus on that. At the same time, if we examine the niche strategy, the two airports are very different, and thus I do not believe that there is any evidence to suggest that Dubai's growth would damage us. I simply cannot imagine any downside that could come about.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[turkey-an-island-of-stability-confidence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A decade ago, when my party, the Justice and Development Party, better known by its Turkish acronym, AK Party, embarked on its journey to govern Turkey, it announced its democratization and development program. The key element of this program in relation to economic policies is a continuous and sustainable economic growth strategy. An integral part, among others, of our strategy has been attracting foreign investment, acknowledging its contribution to economic development. As we have not only included foreign investment in our economic program, we have also implemented effective reforms that have turned Turkey into an attractive destination for foreign investment. Moreover, we have reinforced our economic policies with political stability. In a politically and economically volatile region, Turkey has been an island of political stability and economic confidence.<br></p><p>This hindsight vindicates that our economic policies and reforms have yielded results. During our administration over the past decade, the Turkish economy has grown robustly with an average annual real GDP growth rate of 5%. In the meantime, Turkey attracted more than $120 billion of FDI. Our sound economic policies and reforms have also strengthened Turkey against economic shocks and crises. During the global financial crisis in 2009, many banks had to be bailed out by governments in the US and Europe, whereas not even a single bank required monetary or administrative support from the government in Turkey.</p><p>Again, while the recent sovereign debt crisis has engulfed many economies in Europe, Turkey's public finance indicators have been impressive; Turkey drastically reduced its gross public debt from 74% of GDP in 2002 to 36% in 2012. That is why, though belatedly, Turkey has recently been upgraded to investment grade by major credit rating agencies. Turkey has been the only economy that has been upgraded several notches since the onset of the 2009 global financial crisis. While the crises have caused many economies to struggle with increasing unemployment, Turkey created around 3.5 million new jobs between 2009 and 2012, whereas total employment in the EU-27 countries decreased by 1.5 million.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey has been the only economy that has been upgraded several notches since the onset of the 2009 global financial crisis."</div><p>While the above and many other figures have altogether been a test for our economic policies, the real test for them has been our people's trust in and approval of our policies. My party won the last three consecutive general elections with landslide victories, increasing its votes in every one of these elections. This approval by our people has encouraged us to implement more reforms and further improve Turkey's investment climate. As long as we have a political mandate from our people, we will continue to serve them through sound economic policies and reforms. As such, Turkey will continue to be a safe haven for global investors where they can find strong economic confidence backed by genuine political stability that is supported by the will of the people of Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Colombian Securities Exchange (BVC) contributed to the domestic economy over the past seven years?</h4><p>We are convinced that the capital markets and the stock exchange at the center of the capital markets have a very important role to play. They provide the right environment for companies to raise capital, be it through actual capital or funding in the bond market. They can also provide diversified investment alternatives to individual investors, both institutional investors and retail investors. Retail investors are very important, and we are tailoring the development of new products for all investors. We are convinced that a well functioning capital market will contribute to the competitiveness of the Colombian economy by reducing the cost of capital to Colombian corporations and making available not only liquidity, but also risk management instruments for Colombian corporations. What we have been doing over the last seven years is completing the infrastructure of the market, such as setting up clearing houses and central counterparties (CCP) and creating a derivatives market so companies can hedge their financial risks and promote retail distribution products like an electronic trading system (ETS) for investors. The Colombian Securities Exchange has promoted internet trading so that retail investors can access the market. We have promoted the creation of private equity funds in Colombia. We have a global outreach program to inform companies and make them aware of the benefits the capital markets have to offer.</p><h4>What are you doing to attract more local companies to list?</h4><p>We have an outreach program called Colombia Capital. It is an initiative in partnership with many other players that are interested in directing the capital markets such as the Association of Pension Funds, the Association of Entrepreneurs, the Chambers of Commerce, and many other groups that are interested in the capital markets. The idea of this initiative is to reach out to companies all over the country. Colombia has seven cities that are medium or large in size, and that have very large, consolidated corporate sectors. They have the size and the sophistication to be participants in the capital markets. They just need us to disseminate knowledge, let everybody know what the benefits are, what the costs are, what it entails to be an issuer in the market, what the corporate governance issues there are, what “reporting" means, and how much extra work it entails. I think that the financial crisis of 2008 —which I believe was not felt here in Colombia—was a good example of why you need to be diversified in your financing. What you are seeing here is that commercial paper funding or bank financing can shut down overnight. If you had planned to invest or grow over the next two years, then there is no working capital, not to mention long-term financing. Accessing the capital markets opens up financing alternatives.</p><div class="quote">“We are convinced that the capital markets and the stock exchange... have a very important role to play."</div><h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in the medium to long term?</h4><p>Colombia is in a very fortunate position; the country has been doing things very well both on the economic front and on the investment side over the past 10 years. That has created a very good investment environment and confidence. Given that we had very limited investment over many years, there is a gap to fill—particularly in regards to infrastructure. The plan for the next 10 years is very aggressive in terms of road infrastructure, ports, and airports. That is going to draw most of the investment in the country. Mining, oil, and gas have been attracting a lot of investment over the past few years.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Lebanon represent for Total's operations in the Middle East?</h4><p>First of all, Total has been present in the Middle East since 1924, and we, Total Liban, have been present in Lebanon since 1951. Despite the unstable situation and all the difficulties we faced during the war, we stayed, which made us the only major international company present in the marketing retail and business in the country. The offshore potential of the country creates interest for other international companies, but for Total it is just a continuation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese energy sector?</h4><p>The Lebanese energy sector could change a lot if the offshore exploration to be undertaken following the current licensing round proves successful. The upstream segment of the Total group aims at finding new petroleum reserves and increasing our production in a manner respectful of human safety and the environment. Total is also a deepwater pioneer; we successfully drilled the first experimental well under 1,714 meters of water in the Mediterranean Sea in 1982. Therefore, after being in Lebanon for so long, we sought qualification as a right holder operator in the offshore licensing round. I believe the government is working hard to create a comprehensive contractual, legal, and tax framework for petroleum exploration and production. For that, stability and transparency are key. You need to be sure that, in 20 years, you will still be able to produce and work in the country. There have been some promising discoveries in the Levant Basin in the Mediterranean Sea, but in any exploration project, risk exists. You may not find the resources or the economic potential you are looking for. Until you have drilled, nothing is guaranteed. An offshore exploration program requires excellent technical teams, recognized expertise in large-scale projects, and significant investments. We have a lot of expertise to give and share.</p><div class="quote">“Total has a leading position in the distribution of petroleum products in Lebanon."</div><h4>How would you assess the regulatory environment in the energy sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I think the government has been very active. The Petroleum Administration's selected members are highly professional and represent various fields of expertise. I am not surprised by this, as the Lebanese are very well known in the region as well as worldwide for their high qualifications and level of education. We also got the opportunity to participate in workshops with the government, where we shared our views on what would be attractive for international companies when deciding to invest in the country.</p><h4>What are the challenges the energy sector is facing?</h4><p>It is not unusual that an oil and gas company invests in challenging environments; oil and gas resources are often trapped in hostile environments like deserts, mountains, and in deep sea locations. Lebanon is a net importer of oil and gas, and, as such, is totally dependent on market trends and situations. So, if Lebanon can realize its dream to become an oil and gas producer, the country will surely boom while its economy and oil and gas industry will develop. This would spark new activities within the country.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Total in Lebanon, and for the energy sector?</h4><p>Total has a leading position in the distribution of petroleum products in Lebanon; we still aim at being in the lead while respecting the safety rules established by the Group and preserving the environment. Speaking of the Group in general, the aim is not only to accelerate our business growth, but also to progress in areas as fundamental to our activities as safety, diversity, talent management, logistics, communications, and innovation. In fact, corporate social responsibility is the foundation of Total's strategy and focuses on three major issues: meeting energy needs while tackling the challenges related to climate change and natural resources; managing and curtailing the impact of the Group's operations on people and the environment; and helping to drive local social and economic development. In this same spirit, Total launched with the Faculty of Engineering at St. Joseph University the first Master's in Oil and Gas in English. We are a long-term partner and the best example is our long presence in Lebanon, during good times and less fortunate ones!</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market for Xerox?</h4><p>The past year has been very special for Xerox Mexico given that we celebrated our 50th anniversary. This event was extremely important for us because Mexico is our oldest affiliate in Latin America and one of our oldest affiliates in the world. Mexico continues to be one of the most important markets for Xerox, as it is where we first began in the Latin American market, and we continue developing our services widely throughout the region. Overall, 2012 was not only important to us because we celebrated our anniversary, but also because we launched several initiatives related to this milestone. We are taking advantage of our 50 years of experience. Our track record of operations provides us with the experience, talent, and the different aspects that we need in order to replicate and develop in other Latin American markets. As a company, we have evolved tremendously, and since we are a technology-oriented organization we have always been at the forefront and kept up with the market's rapid pace. We have had significant technological launches in products and services, and this has helped us to evolve year after year, always looking for a way to reinvent ourselves from a quality perspective, yet maintain the ethical values that are at our core.</p><h4>In what ways is Xerox Mexico trying to evolve brand perception?</h4><p>One of our main initiatives is to build a different image for Xerox. We are proud of our reputation for service and technology, but one of the main ideas that customers have about Xerox is that we are primarily focused on equipment. This is particularly due to the photocopy machine, which the company invented a long time ago, and is naturally part of our legacy. However, Xerox has developed many other lines of business over the last few years, and we want to get the word out about what kind of solutions we can provide to the market and all of the other high-end technology we continue to develop. Three years ago we completed the acquisition of ACS, which has been renamed Xerox Services. This component of the company is completely integrated and offers customer care, information technology outsourcing (ITO), and business process outsourcing (BPO). We continue to expand our portfolio of solutions as we target bigger markets and invest in countries like Mexico. Xerox Mexico has offered the Mexican market end-to-end solutions for companies of all sizes, not just in document printing, but also in integrated approaches to document management, including development, distribution, storage, sharing, and reuse. While the printing market is still very relevant, we are developing more solutions aimed toward the flow of user information, serving both types of market demands. In our business model, the channel represents all that is end-user facing and coverage, which is why one of our main priorities is to continually develop business strategies and programs that provide training and tangible benefits to our business partners. With this, we expect to achieve engagement and loyalty toward our brand and to offer the best service to our end users. Xerox Partner Print Services (XPPS) is the next generation of solutions for Managed Print Services with the Xerox brand for the channel, sharing our global expertise and proven technology with the Mexican market through certified distributors. We also offer our clients an extensive array of communications and marketing services, which are implemented through our high-end technology and support of consultants. These services are intended to help our clients generate 360° communications with all of their users and customers, sharing the right message, at the right time, to the right market segment. Our processes enable us to create personalized content offering results and benefiting brand maintenance while reducing production costs. As an example in Mexico, the telecommunications and retail industries have experienced significant success using our communications and marketing services, reducing costs and time by 30% and 42%, respectively.</p><div class="quote">“Compared to the rest of the world, we believe we need to explore the level of maturity in different business lines."</div><h4>Today, the company makes half of its revenues from business processes. How significant will this area be in the future?</h4><p>Half of our revenue streams come from services. The technology stream remains very strong and we intend to maintain it as a driver in our business. However, the business services line is providing us with strong leverage. We are capable of offering end-to-end BPO solutions for small, medium, and large corporations for all back office needs. Some examples include invoicing, delivering, and storing accounting information and sharing it with customers. We provide support on how to improve productivity for current business processes, and we externalize these solutions to help keep our clients focused on their core business. The company's broad portfolio includes a wide array of both human resources solutions and accounting solutions. In ITO, we are able to provide the full outsourcing of data centers, including assets acquisition, IT experts, and numerous additional processes. We are investing substantially in the call center business and are evaluating how to make this business line grow within the Mexican market. We could say our sights are set on every potential market because we serve all industries, such as manufacturing, banking and finance, and telecommunications, and we are considering venturing into mining. There is no one-size solution for all, but we can offer customized solutions that are applicable toward any industry. At this time, we are focused on serving the needs of SMEs, where we have found a natural segment given the conditions that we have, not just as a country, but as a region that is growing quickly.</p><h4>How sophisticated is the Mexican market in terms of demand for back-office business processes?</h4><p>Mexico is a mature market compared to the rest of Latin America. Compared to the rest of the world, we believe we need to explore the level of maturity in different business lines. The market trend is pointing in this direction and the Mexican market demands these kinds of solutions, but we need to work with our customers to develop these support and consulting services. Customers know what they need, but Xerox needs to work with them to develop solutions. They need help identifying where and how to apply the solutions. We help them understand how they can be more productive by implementing innovative solutions.</p><h4>What are some of the innovations you have brought to the market recently?</h4><p>Currently, we are working aggressively toward communicating the solutions we offer to the market, all aimed at raising awareness. Many solutions are available worldwide, but the local market continues to lack many services. One of the critical key performance indicators is how to monitor the implementation of business solutions. On PowerPoint, every solution works, but when you start implementing and integrating critical processes, it's not the same. You need the infrastructure, experience, and talented people to do it right, and this is what we can offer. We have a strong presence in Mexico, and with over 4,000 employees we are capable of offering solutions that go from design to implementation. As we work with more companies, we also grow and learn, and since every customer is different, we learn from every experience we encounter. In the past, on the technology side, we launched something new every year; now we release new products every quarter. We developed a new, environmentally friendly way of printing, called “ColorQube." This technology uses solid ink, like a crayon, which can be used instead of toner. ColorQube is one of our biggest investments in the last five years, and we have a family of products that are 100% environmentally friendly, from the production of the cartridges, to the consumables, to the energy used. One of our advantages is that we have narrowed the space between black and white and color with these new developments, and we are very proud of that.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Dubai's Vision 2020 impact the logistics industry?</h4><p>Dubai's Vision 2020 aims to build on the economic and social progress of the city. Winning the World Expo 2020 bid, an integral part of the 2020 Vision, will have a tremendous impact on Dubai and the UAE's economy. Businesses of all sizes, from both the public and private sectors, will be involved in one form or the other fuelling growth across all major industries in the country, including logistics. We expect demand for international and domestic shipping to increase as the country prepares to host the World Expo. This will be an exciting time for FedEx and the logistics industry in Dubai. The economic impact after the World Expo takes place will reinforce Dubai's position as a key economic and trade hub, attracting more SMEs and large corporations to set up their businesses in the city, which in return will sustain the need for express shipping and logistic solutions.</p><h4>What is the significance of Dubai as a hub for FedEx?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the largest trade hubs in the world, and the largest re-export hub in the region. With its excellent infrastructure facilities, Dubai plays an important role for FedEx Express' operations in the Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and Africa region. The city's access to large regional and global markets, its open trade and investment policies, transparent global business practices, as well as its strong macroeconomic environment are some of the reasons that make the Emirate a preferred business destination. It is also why FedEx chose Dubai as its regional headquarters in 1989. Dubai invests in its world-class infrastructure, such as global air connectivity, and creating a friendly business climate with the establishment of free zones such as Dubai Airport Free Zone and Jebel Ali. Today, key sectors such as oil and gas, engineering goods, food, metals, luxury goods, automotive, and aviation are all major contributors to the growth of Dubai and its logistics sector. As a global aviation and logistics hub, Dubai plays an integral role in our global network. We fly 34 aircraft a week through our Dubai hub, connecting our region to global markets through our hubs in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is one of the largest trade hubs in the world, and the largest re-export hub in the region."</div><h4>What does FedEx do to attract and retain talent?</h4><p>At FedEx, we put a lot of effort in being an employer of choice to attract the right talent. The positive word-of-mouth from our team members and being recognized among the top three places to work in the UAE by the Great Place to Work institute for three consecutive years are major factors that help us attract talent. Our people are always at the heart of everything we do. FedEx's People-Service-Profit (P-S-P) philosophy is based on the belief that by taking care of our people, they in turn will deliver the impeccable service demanded by our customers, who will reward us with the profitability necessary to secure our future. We continuously recognize and reward team members that demonstrate exceptional performance by going above and beyond their set roles and responsibilities. Additionally, as part of our corporate culture and philosophy of putting people first, managers are encouraged to remain available, open, and transparent. This fosters an environment of two-way communication between the managers and their team members. We also heavily invest in training our team members and encouraging promotion from within. FedEx recently won the INSIGHTS Middle East award for the “Best Career and Skills Path," which is a testament to our people development initiatives.</p><h4>What are FedEx's policies to respond to the different demands of its customers?</h4><p>The Purple Promise, “Making every customer experience outstanding," defines our service quality. We deliver this promise across every customer touch point, including our couriers, websites, and customer service team. As much as the fundamentals of every shipping need is the same, which is moving goods from one place to another in the fastest and most reliable manner, the requirements of various industries do vary. We look at each business' requirement individually, and adapt our operations and technology to meet the different demands of each customer. FedEx also supports the growth of local SMEs with tailored solutions. For example, the Dubai-based confectionary, Chocodate, expanded their reach globally by using FedEx's customized shipping solutions, enabling them to gain access to over 35 international markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is unique about doing business in Mexico, and how does Petrolink deal with these challenges?</h4><p>First of all, I would say the contracting system required to work for PEMEX; it is very complex. Plus, there are many things to be taken into account, such as the fees and taxes that are rarely included in the budget of a company that has no experience in Mexico, as well as the different regulations such as environmental ones, which can be tighter than in Europe in regard to areas where drilling activity is not allowed. These aspects have an impact on the financial and operational side of the business. Second, I would say that PEMEX is really demanding in terms of the quality of the information that is taken into account to make decisions. We specialize in collecting and aggregating the data and information at the well-site—at the point of acquisition. That has been the key to getting our reputation with PEMEX. It is also unique because in Mexico, doing business is very personal, and it requires a lot of energy to build relationships. We make ourselves known at PEMEX by fostering relationships locally and visiting the different functional levels from the regulator units through senior management to project leaders, specialists, and field engineers at the user level.</p><h4>What products do you offer?</h4><p>In Mexico we provide much more than products. Our services are based on two key elements: first the technology platform that we generate ourselves through a robust international development team; and second the excelling engineering capabilities and data quality expertise provided through our own unique methodologies. The service lines demanded in Mexico can be divided in two. The first one is static data and information management, where we support exploration and production operations and take control of the data and the information as it is generated, which is basically technical and operational information related to projects and wells intervention. The second one is real-time drilling data, monitoring, and engineering services. In both cases, technology is very important. In terms of the real-time data provision, we are probably the main supporter of PEMEX initiatives to work with well-site information transfer standard markup language (WITSML), which is the industry standard for doing data transmission. We are probably the only provider using the 1.3.1 version. We are working very hard now to make ourselves more competitive and bring to Mexico in 2013 the 1.4.1 version for the very first time.</p><div class="quote">“We specialize in collecting and aggregating the data and information at the well-site—at the point of acquisition."</div><h4>How would the new governmental reforms change your business model?</h4><p>We are going to start serving other operators. It will depend on the Mexican rules as to what size operators they will attract. We have experience with small and major operators in the international arena. For example, Petrofac is already operating in the southern region. We are looking to serve them with our service, but by using a business model more related to products. However, PEMEX will always be the owner of the hydrocarbons, and therefore it will have to keep control. We are starting to think about new solutions and schemes where we can sell for third parties, but still create a benefit for PEMEX. The future is very positive for Petrolink right now. As an international company, we are very respectful of local decisions, and we are more interested on focusing ourselves on what will be the next scenario. The reality is that the industry is in need of a profound change—the whole hydrocarbons industry, not only the E&amp;P of oil and gas.</p><h4>Aside from the hydrocarbons reforms, what is Petrolink's strategy for growth over the medium term?</h4><p>We are developing a market strategy and specific products for the new players that will take advantage of our knowledge of how PEMEX likes to work. Also, we really believe in technology. It is one of the main points that we want to elevate in importance. We as a generator of technology are going to invest a lot of money here. We opened our development team in Mexico two years ago as a satellite of our main center in Indonesia, and we are thinking of expanding by hiring local people. That is our strategy to provide more technology, which is accessible and adapted to the environment of PEMEX.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the banks managed to contain the negative impact of the political situation in the region?</h4><p>The regional situation is not encouraging for investment or consumption. Lebanon is in the midst of the Middle East, and whatever is happening around us has an influence on the behavior of people in our country. The major challenge that we had to encounter, and we succeeded in doing so, was to maintain confidence in our banking sector, and our currency. That confidence has helped the country to once again preserve stability. We were negatively impacted in terms of the rate of growth, which is now running at around 2.5% per year, having fallen from 8%. Nevertheless, compared to other countries in the region, we are still doing well. Lebanon has undergone many difficulties in the past, but stability was preserved, and, therefore, we have developed more resilience. Of course there are risks, but the rewards in Lebanon are there to compensate for that risk. By letting the market forces determine the prices of assets in the country as well as interest rates, we have created a risk-reward profile that has prevailed, helping the country to proceed.</p><h4>Which segments of the economy benefit most from the Banque du Liban's stimulus package?</h4><p>Our main objective is to stimulate internal demand. Because of the prevailing situation in the Middle East, external demand has decreased. The central bank has a strong balance sheet, and it is therefore capable of implementing incentive programs to help the local economy develop. The stimulus package aimed at increasing growth by 2%, and was dedicated to housing, new projects, especially in SMEs, R&amp;D for energy substitution projects, the environment, and university studies. We will continue to monitor our markets, and whenever needed will come up with new financial stimulus packages. We are presently working on a stimulus project for startups, especially in the knowledge industry.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon today has developed its banking sector, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of sophistication."</div><h4>How can the Banque du Liban further stimulate the economy and control inflation?</h4><p>Through the management of liquidity we can control inflation. Our economic models determine the optimal liquidity needed to maintain a healthy economic growth. The excess liquidity is taken out of the market by the central bank to target an inflation rate below 4%.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of the banking sector in the first half of 2013, and what do you expect for the next six months?</h4><p>The banking sector in Lebanon is healthy. We were able to go through major crises in places where our banks were operating, such as Syria, Egypt, and Cyprus. The growth of deposits this year is more than 7%, and we believe that they will yield profits that are equal to, or better than, 2012. We are not expecting any negative news in the market, as we have already instituted the necessary provisions for the exposure of our banks regionally. Our banks are well capitalized, and the central bank stipulated a solvency ratio of 10% at the end of 2012, based on the Basel III resolution. This was achieved, and we have asked for a 12% solvency ratio by 2015, also based on Basel III. That will put our sector, in terms of capitalization, at a higher ratio than required by Basel III.</p><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of the curve on implementing Basel III?</h4><p>It means more confidence for the banking sector, and therefore more capital inflows. Lebanon is financed through its local markets, because our rating is low. Lebanon has a B rating due to its political and security risks. Therefore, the more funds that you can draw into the country, the more funds you have available to fuel the economy, and the more you can preserve acceptable levels of interest rates. Although Lebanon is rated B, it has interest rates that are equivalent to countries that are rated BBB.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to reduce the budget and trade deficits?</h4><p>The trade deficit is a historical fact with Lebanon. We cover that by remittances. The Lebanese work more beyond Lebanon than within it. They transfer assets to the country, and this has been Lebanon's history since its independence in 1945. The country does not really have sectors that can export and, even though we have discovered gas, we currently lack commodities to export. The Lebanese economy is relying on the human factor. The Lebanese who travel all over the world still have an attachment to their homeland, and they send their money here. This helps the country to find the necessary funding for its imports. This structure will be maintained, and we have to sustain confidence in the banks, because if that is lacking, people will not transfer money into the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the country's financial confidentiality?</h4><p>Lebanon has bank secrecy laws, but, as the world is changing, we also have other laws to ensure transparency and good governance in our sector. The bank secrecy law is maintained, but does not prevail in the case of money laundering. Currently, Parliament is discussing a law that would suspend bank secrecy in cases of tax evasion.</p><h4>What measures have been taken to tighten bank supervision following the Lebanese-Canadian Bank issue?</h4><p>What happened with the Lebanese-Canadian Bank has happened with banks outside Lebanon, too. It is essentially linked to the fact that the US considers that when you are using their currency, you also have to abide by their laws. This bank was accused by the US of the infringement of US laws, and there was a settlement of the case lately with the US government, whereby the bank paid a fine of $102 million, and the case was closed. Nevertheless, the Banque du Liban has taken measures to make sure that we have the proper legal structure to not experience such incidences again. The banking sector is very important for the Lebanese economy, and a problem at any bank in Lebanon could create economic or social crisis. The most important circular we issued is that the banks here have to respect the laws and sanctions of other countries when using the currency of these countries, or when dealing with the banks of these countries. The banks here are abiding by that. On the other side, the Special Investigation Commission (SIC), which is the body that fights money laundering, is doing the utmost to make sure that business is being done properly.</p><h4>What is the central bank doing to make sure Lebanon regains its status as the financial hub for the region?</h4><p>Lebanon today has developed its banking sector, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of sophistication. We have requested the banks to have new discipline in their work, and have encouraged them to improve their systems. You could say that Lebanon has a banking sector that is on an international level, and regionally attractive for business in the Arab world. We are currently working to develop our capital markets, and are heading toward a situation where the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) will become a private company. The regulators will be ensuring that there is good governance, no manipulation, and no insider trading. And we want to go further still by creating a financial center that would be off-system, where it is easy to open a business, and that would also be coupled with incubators that would allow Beirut to become an address for those keen on startups. This all takes time, but we are working hard. I am also the head of the Capital Markets Authority, the central bank, and SIC, the anti-money laundering body.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Lebanon in 2013 and in the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon is difficult to predict because of the political- and security-related volatility. Nevertheless, the track record of the country has shown that, despite these obstacles that have sometimes been tragic, resulting in war and assassinations, we have seen improvements in our GDP, and in the figures of the financial sector. Also, we have seen improvements in tourism and construction. I have confidence in the potential of the Lebanese, and the way they approach their business has taken into consideration the volatility and insecurity that we could potentially see. I believe that Lebanon will see continued growth that could either be moderate, as today, or much higher, given a better economic climate. Of course, we need to have a government that would invest greater effort into developing the nation's infrastructure.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> How did Gulf Business Machines (GBM) get its start in the Omani IT sector?</h4><p>GBM came into existence around 24 years ago as IBM's sole distributer in the GCC region, except for Saudi Arabia. In the early days, clients had IT tightly confined, with point solutions for accounting, inventory, and sales, and the IT department solely responsible for anything technology related. Today, it is very different. The consumerization of IT has meant that everyone in a company is both familiar with and dependent upon technology; clients demand solutions not products. We all have the experience of being able to simply download an app and use it immediately. In the business world things are slightly different; it is simply not possible for one vendor to have a solution and, more importantly, expertise in everything. Therefore, our clients are looking for a partner that can team up with multiple providers, design and integrate a complete solution to solve a business problem, and, importantly, stand by that solution once it is implemented. We depend upon IBM hardware because we believe it offers the best value for money in terms of performance and reliability. Reliability is extremely important, and we pride ourselves on having the best hardware service and maintenance business in the region. From a networking, security, and communications perspective, we have partnerships with Cisco, Juniper, F5, and other specialty vendors. We have seen the criticality of network-related solutions, particularly those involving security-related activities, increase in Oman, resulting in significant growth in our networking business. Recently, we focused heavily on our internal processes to improve quality and add value at each step. I am personally very focused on trying to add value with every interaction. If you are merely reselling someone else's solution without adding some quantifiable value to it you become unnecessary, and clients could simply order from the web. We are starting to see a slight shift in the market. Previously, price was the only determinant in choosing a system integrator; now, clients are appreciating that service quality, and the ability to deliver to business service level agreements, are just as important, if not more important, than price alone.</p><h4>What role do IT service providers play in the development of Oman's emerging IT sector?</h4><p>Today, it is easy to obtain technology; you simply do some research on the web and, with a few clicks, buy the latest software, hardware, or whatever appliance you desire. The difficulty comes with finding the skills to operate, and to integrate. This is really the challenge clients face today; finding the skills to keep pace with an increasing rate of change in technology. This problem can be seen in increasing spending on IT and data centers, filled to capacity with great technology, but no way to use it because the skill level is not there. This challenge becomes even more apparent with open-source software. Around the world, the public and private sectors clearly realize the benefits of open-source software; little to no licensing costs, protection from being held hostage by a vendor, the ability to attract talent to the organization, and so on. There is a wide range of extremely powerful open-source programs ready for use, but the problem is that they are neither coordinated, nor integrated, and as they get upgraded, sometimes on a weekly basis, it is extremely difficult to maintain and use them. I am a big believer in open-source software, but if you do not have the skills and experience to integrate and maintain the systems, you will find yourself in trouble. The current push toward big data solutions is a great example of this. A big data solution needs at least seven independent open-source components all working together in a tightly coupled bundle just to get started, and today there is no single standard for putting all these pieces together consistently and, more importantly, as yet, there is no one single distribution method that has emerged as a standard. I am sure this will change with time, but today this is the reality. You need someone with the right skill set and level of experience to build and continually maintain a workable solution for you, unless of course you are a Facebook or Google with 50 Stanford PhDs on staff.</p><div class="quote">“Public and private businesses are building new data centers, new offices, and all are required to be future proof."</div><h4>What economic trends are providing the biggest opportunities for GBM?</h4><p>The construction boom is a huge boost to our business because both public and private businesses are building new data centers, new offices, and all are required to be future proof from a technology perspective. In that respect, we design solutions with upgradability in mind. Establishing the network and communications infrastructure is the first step. Next comes the computer infrastructure and application architecture, and this is a very interesting area for me, as we are seeing a change from computer-centric to data-centric design. It is important to realize that the very nature of IT is changing, from the consumerization of IT, through to the increasing velocity, variety, and volume of data in our world, which is driving an upheaval in the way we think of IT, and what we expect from our IT departments. Even apparently simple constructs like data centers are being challenged, and you only have to look at how Google, Apple, and Amazon design their data centers now to see this—they are built to be ecologically sound, allow for expansion, and have highly secure, cloud-based infrastructure. The last thing you want to do is design a new data center based on outdated 1990s design philosophies.</p><h4>Will the issue of data integrity grow in importance over the coming years, in your opinion?</h4><p>Absolutely. I believe that people, at some level, realize that they are using free applications and understand that they are handing their data over to companies. People do not mind doing this because they have an expectation that their data is secure. If a company betrays your trust and does not have your data stored securely, then it will lose its clientele quickly. Do not underestimate the importance of this. Most organizations have rigorous backup and protection mechanisms in place for their own data, but tend to overlook customer-generated data, often relegating it to cheap, unreliable, low-cost commodity storage. This is a recipe for disaster.</p><h4>What do you make of government efforts to promote advances in the IT sector?</h4><p>The government has made great advances. My personal bias is toward big data. If you are doing research into complex topics like diabetes, the role of the government in health care becomes a key determinant of the data you can use. The government, in its wisdom, is encouraging people to come here and develop world-class applications by opening up its data to attract researchers. In some ways, data protection limits research opportunities in other countries, and this is particularly true when we are talking about genetic predisposition to disease. Patient medical histories are not readily available, so if you are doing research into a particular condition it is not easy to get access to what you need. Here, the government recognizes the value of data and its importance for research. This would be fantastic for the country. The government has information that the right people could use for the betterment of society, even beyond medical research.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There are currently 113 free trade zones (FTZs) in Colombia. What has incentivized this rapid increase?</h4><p>FTZs offer great benefits such as reduced taxes and logistical advantages. The first FTZs started in the main urban areas in the center of the country, in Bogotá, Cali, and Medellí­n. Now, there are more FTZs along the coast near the major ports, which reduces export and logistics costs dramatically. In the FTZs along the Pacific coast of Colombia, the major export market is Asia, obviously, whereas those along the Atlantic coast are mainly involved in trade with the EU and the US. That is why most FTZs are now based in or around Barranquilla, Santa Marta, and Cartagena. Most FTZs are along the Atlantic coast, especially the biggest.</p><h4>La Cayena FTZ is mainly used by construction materials companies. What advantages does La Cayena offer?</h4><p>It is meant to attract large industrial companies. There are only 40 or so lots in 1.5 million sqm, so it is designed for large industries. All public services are geared to this. Our slogan is “From industrials for industrials;" it is not geared so much to commercial companies. The workforce around Barranquilla is very good. La Cayena's infrastructure is very different from other FTZs. It is very modern, and it is built with the best materials, which reduces monthly maintenance costs. Logistics costs are also minimal as it is right by the port. Also, we buy energy in packages, both electricity and gas, which further reduces power costs in La Cayena FTZ. We buy gas directly from the producers. Our overall costs are quite low compared to other FTZs, and that is what differentiates us from the others.</p><div class="quote">“One advantage is that FTZs expand the production base of the economy."</div><h4>What advantages do FTZs provide for the overall Colombian economy and also for Barranquilla in particular?</h4><p>One advantage is that FTZs expand the production base of the economy. Instead of becoming highly centralized in the large cities, the industrial base moves to these coastal areas and cities, drawing labor, industry, and capital out to new regions. It thereby contributes to the spread of jobs and wealth in the country and also creates a skilled workforce, while also providing social and economic benefits to local areas where the FTZs are located. Industries and companies also benefit from cheaper labor and material costs in places like Barranquilla compared to Medellí­n, Cali, or Bogotá. It has social, demographic, and economic benefits for the country, both for the people and for businesses. Barranquilla in particular is a great base for various businesses, geographically speaking. You can export goods to Central America, Texas, or Florida within two days. Brazilian and various Asian companies also like to relocate to Colombia for this reason, and also to take advantage of exporting without being subject to taxes, thanks to Colombia's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US.</p><h4>How many companies are currently located in La Cayena?</h4><p>We have 16 companies from Colombia and abroad, mainly from Venezuela, Spain, and Mexico. We are currently at 50% capacity. One Spanish construction company produces goods here using local raw materials and then exports them to Romania, for example. We are also open to other types of companies besides just the large construction firms, but generally each FTZ focuses on a specific industry and specific export market, so the other firms would also be more or less construction industry oriented, because they are the ones that would most benefit from being in this La Cayena.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of FTZs in Colombia, and for La Cayena in particular?</h4><p>We need to increase the area of FTZs in Colombia in general, and La Cayena in particular, because there is more demand than supply. We need to expand. In a normal week, we have from six to 12 companies interested in locating here. We should expand to 2 million sqm, and maybe even more.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you believe are the strengths of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>Mexico has a very stable and positive government administration that has inherited a solid fiscal position. The government has been responsible with spending, and it is now occupying an enviable position when compared to the standards of many countries with stable government expenditures and revenues. There are a variety of Mexican states that have financial difficulties, but overall Mexico is fiscally sound. Inflation is trending in the right direction and the country can be proud of its accomplishments. This will help in the long run with interest rates as inflation continues to be the focus of the Banco de México. The government is also working to introduce additional reforms, which could certainly help the growth of the economy. Mexico should grow in the 3%-4% range in 2012, and the opportunity for Mexico to grow at a 5%-6% range is within the country's reach. The government's current combination of a strong fiscal situation and very sound inflation control has led to the growth of internal demand. The base and competitiveness of the Mexican economy is continuing to be strong relative to the competitive forces that may be found in Asia, which are increasing the cost of manufacturing there. We are also seeing an increase of manufacturing in Mexico. Work is coming back onshore again.</p><h4>What has been your incoming strategy in the dynamic Mexican market?</h4><p>Our main strategy has been to fine-tune our value propositions for our customers. We know that there are many banks in the Mexican market, and customers—whether they are large, medium, or small—have many choices. Our clientele can choose banks, products, and services at a varied price and level, and our strategy has been to refine what we offer. We want to fine-tune our segmentation and find the best package of products with the right channels and prices so that we can serve the customers with the right access points. Increasingly in banking, it is important for banks to be pro-active and anticipate the needs of customers with regard to age, socioeconomic level, and status in life. Each life stage has a different requirement, and it is important for us to be able to anticipate the needs of our customers. The best example of where things are changing for customers is on the channel side. Even Mexico, which used to be known as a bricks-and-mortar type of market where people went to the branches to pay bills, cash checks, withdraw money, or make deposits, is becoming increasingly similar to many other countries in Scandinavia or Europe. There is a lot of penetration in terms of the use of online and mobile banking. Considering that Mexico has 115 million inhabitants and 40 million people online, more people are using the web to research and understand banking products and services. There are approximately 20 million online banking customers across the sector in Mexico, making it a very fast growing segment—some banks registered double-digit growth. The banks have increased the presence of ATMs significantly so that people don't have to go to branches. We recently signed an agreement with a third-party company called OXXO, which allows us to use their 12,000 stores to make payments and pay credit card bills.</p><div class="quote">“Our main strategy has been to fine-tune our value propositions for our customers."</div><h4>What was the strategy behind the move to acquire Crédito Familiar? Will you make further acquisitions?</h4><p>Crédito Familiar is designed for us to be able to service the D segment of the socioeconomic scale in Mexico. Scotiabank has generally been associated with the A, B, and C markets because of the products and credit that we offer. With Crédito Familiar, we have launched operations in a whole new market segment, which offers a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to provide lending, which can be in smaller amounts that are used to buy basic goods. It is a market that we don't know very well in Mexico, but we are very familiar with its equivalent in Central and South America and the Caribbean, where we have an extremely well-developed consumer banking segment. This is something we are bringing to Mexico and we expect it to grow rapidly. We expect to also graduate approximately 10% of our customers out of Crédito Familiar to the main bank on an annual basis. There is a great opportunity for us there, and much that we can build. As a result, we can penetrate a new segment of the economy and that is also a largely unbanked group, so it is a great opportunity to attract customers as they become more prosperous and their household incomes grow.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the factors that render credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?</h4><p>When it established its 2030 Vision, Abu Dhabi produced a clear strategy with transparent targets and a road map of where the Emirate is heading. It is an Emirate that is working in the best interests of its people, in line with the vision of our leaders. The results of this plan on Abu Dhabi's progress are undeniable, and notable achievements are made every year, with more yet to come. Abu Dhabi's strategy has enabled it to earn a high level of trust with investors globally. Moving forward steadily, the Emirate is witnessing constant economic growth. Our leaders are committed to achieving the goals set out by the 2030 vision, and we are all working together to ensure that we have all the requirements to move forward with this plan. Abu Dhabi's economy forms a significant portion of the UAE's GDP. The Emirate is focused on strengthening its different sectors, and on diversifying its sources of income. All initiatives that are implemented by different organizations and authorities are meant to aid it in achieving this goal.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the growth of the industrial sector and what has been the contribution of ZonesCorp?</h4><p>Since its inception almost nine years ago in 2004, ZonesCorp has been through several phases. We have developed three cities in Abu Dhabi and two other cities in Al Ain. We have made great achievements over the years. In addition to being ranked as one of the top-five government entities, we have targeted many of the gaps relating to the industrial sector market and enhanced the ease of doing business for this field. Previously, the process of applying to obtain a plot of land could take up to one year, and we reduced the time to just 50 days in 2012. In the past two years, we have registered notable growth in our land leasing activities, which had a positive impact on the growth of Abu Dhabi's industrial sector. We have also cleared our land bank. I am proud to say that ZonesCorp has the largest industrial zone in the UAE, with the highest standards of infrastructure, systems, and a very transparent approach. In the 2030 strategy, one of the key pillars is the industrial sector—whether upstream, midstream, or downstream. The industrial sector is one component of the bigger package that Abu Dhabi's government is working on, ranging from education to health and finance. All of these components are combined to achieve a larger goal; we are a small, but significant part of the larger picture.</p><div class="quote">“We have developed three cities in Abu Dhabi and two other cities in Al Ain."</div><h4>What areas do you see as being ripe for foreign investment?</h4><p>The government of Abu Dhabi has published its strategy for industry, and there are key elements global and local investors should consider. There are opportunities in the oil and gas, petrochemicals, metals, steel, aluminum, and construction sectors. These already exist and can be built upon. In terms of industry, when you choose Abu Dhabi, the aim is not limited to the local market—it is also exporting toward India, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Many Indian investors come to Abu Dhabi to target the local market and the region, but their main aim is Europe. The UAE has signed MoUs with many other nations to facilitate trade flows and business set ups. Investors see the UAE and Abu Dhabi as a base for their way forward into the international markets. They see the infrastructure, services, support, and guidance provided as an asset to their growth plans and strategies.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for ZonesCorp to engage with higher education institutions to foster entrepreneurial behavior within Emirati nationals?</h4><p>We will do whatever is needed to spread awareness. We have to educate our future generation on the importance of industry. Every large and developed country that is a leader in the industrial sector is built based on SMEs—Germany, Italy, and France, to name a few. Our people—the young future of the Emirate—need to emulate this. The most important factor is to foster confidence so that, once an investment is made in an SME, we are capable of taking it forward.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the financial environment for industrial projects, and what can be done to improve the situation?</h4><p>The UAE's banking and financial sector show very healthy rates of growth. It would be great if the financial and industrial sectors can enhance partnership efforts to promote growth for Abu Dhabi's economy. In the industrial sector, projects generally represent a long-term investment. It is important that the methodology for allocating industrial funds by banks is not the same as the one used for commercial activities. Industrial projects may be categorized as high-risk investments, but a proper mechanism has to be created for them by banks, and the right people that understand the industrial side must be involved in the process. There need to be proper mechanisms for an SME to apply for a loan and demonstrate what is required with a solid feasibility study. This is crucial for banks, and to maintain transparency. It also enhances the ease of doing business, and the efficiency of planning for industrial projects.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Director of the Middle East Department, how would you assess Lebanon's role in the region?</h4><p>Lebanon is a particularly interesting country. And, despite its relatively small size within the region, it boasts a rich social fabric that is reflected in the way the economy functions. Many compromises are made and deals struck to ensure that each segment of the country and its communities enjoy economic benefits. Indeed, this has enabled the country to weather many of the crises it went through to date. When considering where the country is truly making an impact regionally, the financial sector and banking industry immediately present themselves. The banking industry is active across the region; in Syria, Iraq, including the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and Turkey. The industry is performing so well that some would argue that it is keeping the country afloat. It is the receptacle of the billions of dollars remitted by Lebanese citizens living abroad. These, in many cases, extremely successful individuals, retain a very strong bond to their country. The flow of money returning is absorbed by the banking system, which is a crucial and pivotal instrument of the economy, and, by extension, the country at large. In that sense, and despite shortcomings and some criticism, both within the country and abroad, the banking sector stands out and allows Lebanon to shine throughout its region. Then there is the human factor. The Lebanese people are educated, intelligent, multilingual, and extremely entrepreneurial. And, while resident the world over, they are particularly active in this region. Lebanese people, for example, are strongly represented in the GCC region, and are a dynamic and widespread force within those thriving economies. Thus, through the banking industry and on the strength of its human resources, Lebanon remains extremely influential. However, these activities often remain below the radar, and integrated into the economic fabric of regional countries, despite being both constructive and significant. Lebanese banks are widely established, reading the political economy of the region, taking considerate risks, and betting on the stability of locations that at face value suggest instability, volatility, and considerable risk. With this approach they have demonstrated that beyond the façade of fundamental instability lies considerable opportunity to be tapped into. In fact, wherever a Lebanese business is to be found, one can identify an opportunity to be had. This is what happened with Lebanese entrepreneurs in Africa, the first to invest there to satisfy their natural appetite for high-risk, high-reward ventures. The banking sector is important, as indeed are other service industries. Meanwhile, the Lebanese dominate the media industry in the Arab world—as well as management consultancy, legal services, and accounting.</p><h4>Youth unemployment is high at 34%. How would you assess Lebanon's labor market, and what steps must be taken to promote the creation of quality jobs and increase employment levels?</h4><p>I think the flipside of this whole issue is that Lebanese people do extremely well when they venture abroad. The domestic economy is rather limited in scale, and, unfortunately, many highly educated citizens face the reality of unemployment. Some simply pack their bags and leave in search of better prospects abroad. The local economy suffers from a large number of hurdles, some deriving from the institutional setup itself. It is very difficult to make decisions and implement them swiftly and efficiently, which naturally impedes growth. If you consider the case of public transportation, water, electricity, and telecommunications, and while one can see slow progress, there is a huge untapped potential that is slowing down the country's competitiveness, and harming its potential edge over competing countries. Indeed, given a more effective institutional framework, the country would be an incredible success story—as it was in the 1950s and 1960s—in a climate of stability. The major obstacle today is politics, both domestic and regional, which makes for a tough playing field, where it remains hard to adopt a clear long- or medium-term view.</p><h4>Aside from the banking and real estate sectors, what areas have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Focusing on what is available today, and without talking about as yet untapped opportunities, the potential for energy generation is huge. In this context, water is an important national resource that remains largely neglected. A glance at Lebanon's geography reveals mountains and valleys of incredible potential for energy generation. One would think that for the  strategic construction of a system of dams, for one, would generate sufficient energy for both domestic and regional consumption. It would make of Lebanon a net exporter of energy. Imagine what Lebanon would look like if it is transformed from an energy-starved country to a net provider. Unfortunately, that is not happening due to institutional and political impediments and the practicalities of electricity distribution. In addition, and overall, if Lebanon is to become an attractive business hub for high-end companies, it requires energy that is both reliable and cheap. It would need a fully functioning telecoms industry, a modern transport network, and a dependable institutional framework conducive to long-term business planning. Yet, despite these shortfalls, many companies are already established here, and the economy is registering modest growth, albeit still far short of its true potential. A study conducted into the potential economic outcome of Lebanon establishing solid institutional foundations revealed a growth potential of around 4%. This means that in a good year, the figure could rise to 7%.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese citizens living abroad play a tremendously dually constructive and stabilizing role when it comes to their country."</div><h4>What is being done to attract investment to areas other than Beirut?</h4><p>If you look at the economic fabric of Lebanon, you note that a very large chunk comprises micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises. With this in mind, the World Bank has recently approved a project specifically targeting the development of such enterprises. The micro- and small-scale enterprises, in particular, play a key role in developing remote areas and enabling entrepreneurs to develop their own businesses and create economic momentum. By doing so, we are pushing back poverty and creating employment within the businesses individuals are working to establish. When considering SMEs, financing is a primary constraint, and so by working with the banking sector, including the Central Bank, and certain other intermediaries we have been helping small entrepreneurs obtain the urgent financing long unavailable to them. At the same time, we are working at building their capacity to put together viable business plans that represent attractive propositions for the banking sector to finance. In so doing, we not only provide financing opportunities but, also, and perhaps of equal importance, instill the confidence that drives the entrepreneurial spirit. We provide incentives such as partial risk  guarantees by working with the Kafalat SAL, an institution that helps filter and increase the funds that the banking sector is prepared to commit to this investment mechanism.</p><h4>How is the World Bank reacting to the Syrian crisis?</h4><p>Recently, we worked with Jordan in helping alleviate some of the stress caused by the huge influx of Syrian refugees into its territory. Yet our focus was not on the refugees themselves, but on the host communities. The Jordanian and Lebanese people have been extremely generous in welcoming these refugees. The governments, too, kept their borders open, and, in doing so, are abiding by international law and humanitarian values. This does not mean, however, that Jordan or Lebanon should be left alone to bear the brunt of this responsibility. Indeed, the international community itself, including the World Bank, is part of the solution. In Jordan, we have recently approved a $150 million facility geared at cushioning the economy against the impact of the Syrian crisis. We are working with the municipalities and local governments, too, where refugees actually settle, so as to relieve the additional stress placed on the delivery of basic services such as water, sanitation, education, and health. We are in advanced discussions regarding similar schemes with the government of Lebanon, and we started out with an economic and social impact and needs assessment that would give a clearer view of the intensity of the situation. We hope that the international community will join the Bank in helping Lebanon contain the negative impact of the Syrian crisis, and allow the country to build resilience and maintain its stability. We are keenly aware that Lebanon remains extremely vulnerable to a real and present danger, and we'll stand firm in helping the country.</p><h4>What is the dimension of the Lebanese expatriates' contribution to the local economy?</h4><p>Basically, Lebanese citizens living abroad play a tremendously dually constructive and stabilizing role when it comes to their country. In fact, it might be said that these individuals are essentially keeping the country afloat. The millions of Lebanese living abroad send back billions of dollars a year. They are mostly channeled through the banking sector, but also serve to boost the real estate sector, for instance. When Lebanon issues bonds and taps the  international debt market, one notes that the bulk of interest comes from the Lebanese themselves. This reveals a marked faith in their country even among those who have been abroad for generations, and a link that helps to finance the country, which is rather unique.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-long-view]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With recent gas finds in Tanzania, what is the ideal pace and form of growth that the country should adopt?</h4><p>Projects of this magnitude must be conducted at an effective pace. Both this country and its adjacent neighbors have made huge gas discoveries, and those discoveries need to be appraised by additional drilling and well testing. Information gained during that process could also potentially be used to find gas in other areas. That is the first step. These gas discoveries are in very deep water, so the appraisal activities associated with them are quite challenging. We must carefully prepare for them and assimilate information from the original discoveries as well as obtain additional seismic data. BG is looking to drill more exploration and appraisal wells here in 2013, and we may take the decision to do more in 2014. Once we have that information, we need to feed it into the engineering setup in terms of pre-feed work and then carry out further detailed engineering and design work. While we do that, we have to make sure that the commercial structure is appropriate and that our market projections for the product that we wish to sell, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG), are stable and in high demand across the world as the price of the product and overall cost of the infrastructure will determine the final way forward. That process in itself, as we envisage today, is going to take at least four years. There is absolutely nothing that we can do, or should do, to speed up the process. If you try to push progress along too quickly, errors can be made in design or market and cost projections, meaning that the investment may not be a fruitful one. We are guests here, and our advice to our hosts proceed cautiously to ensure that an investment of this magnitude is conducted in an appropriate fashion for all concerned.</p><h4>What considerations will need to be made at the investment stage?</h4><p>Once we get to the investment decision stage, which we are attempting to achieve in collaboration with Statoil and ExxonMobil, which discovered gas in Block 2, the construction of an LNG plant or plants on a site with all the related upstream infrastructure will also take another four to five years. The benefits of deepwater gas to Tanzania will not show themselves in terms of substantial revenue until the next decade. To go any faster would be not utilizing this country's resources effectively. Because of the parameters set by a billion-dollar investment, the project cannot be approached in an abstract way. A project like this, with all its technological challenges, needs time. Some of the gas discoveries in very deep water use technology that has only recently granted us access to it. This means that Tanzania has time to develop its infrastructure, legislative framework, and regulatory bodies, as well as get its people prepared, from a capacity perspective, to participate in this venture. I believe that the Minister of Energy and Minerals is heading in the right direction in terms of scholarships and how many people are being trained. I have been on the ground since January 2013, and my proudest moment will be when, in late June to early July, we hire three young Tanzanians as part of our graduate program; and they will be the first of many. We also provide scholarships and funding. There is nothing more important than bringing people into your space and having them learn on the ground. I do believe that the biggest challenge of it being a successful project for Tanzania is that it involves everyone, including the people, the government, and guests like ourselves, to work collaboratively to develop strengths from primary school through to high school and university. If we do that, the country will be in a better position to benefit from its resources. Building an energy plant and drilling in 2,500 meters of water is tough, but getting a country to produce outstanding engineers over a long period of time who will stay within the country to contribute effectively is a much more challenging task.</p><div class="quote">“I do believe that the biggest challenge of it being a successful project for Tanzania is that it involves everyone."</div><h4>What partnerships are you developing in the country?</h4><p>We are partnered with Ophir Energy in Blocks 1, 3, and 4, while Statoil and ExxonMobil are in Block 2. What we have is a collaboration in principle to hopefully partner with Statoil and ExxonMobil. We are working well together. We are of course also partners with Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and for all intents and purposes the government and people of Tanzania.</p><h4>How do you foresee the demand for LNG developing?</h4><p>BG Group's belief is that the demand for gas in the next decade will outstrip supply, and there are several reasons for that. First is the demand projection in the Far East and elsewhere, and second is the ability of today's LNG ships to exploit markets all over the world. Even with a dampening of demand in China in recent times, we still see a lot of opportunities. This means that prices will be extremely robust. From Tanzania's perspective, under the terms of the production-sharing agreements (PSAs), investment risk is with the contractor; we provide all the upfront investment capital. Obviously, we are using the resources of Tanzania so we have to frame our work in a way that will be beneficial to the country. However, given how the deals are structured, Tanzanians will still get an appropriate share even in times of lower prices. It is very important that a resource belonging to a country is exploited in the most appropriate fashion. When we go to the TPDC, we go with robust information to show why LNG is still the best utilization of deep-water gas in terms of return per molecule of gas. In regard to the East African region, there is also a lot of gas in Mozambique. I do not see this as a problem; in fact, I believe many synergies could be developed in terms of expertise and other forms of collaboration. As we develop capacity here, we have to ensure that that capacity is not sucked elsewhere. In that respect, the right institutional arrangements have to be made in order to encourage people to stay in the country.</p><h4>What benefits will having a gas industry bring to the country?</h4><p>A gas industry, which of course is part of the overall energy industry, brings cutting-edge technology to a country. In terms of the depth that rigs have to drill to, as well as the seismic information we have on the seabed, it is amazing. There are literally grand canyons under water offshore of Tanzania that we have mapped. With that expertise comes technological advances. If that is managed carefully, it can have a knock-on effect on the economy if people are employed properly. The country itself begins thinking about its engineering capacities and the universities start to think about what they have to do to drive the industry and be a part of it—it starts a thought process on whether we need more engineers, scholarships, or laboratories, for example. Such intellectual discussions do not just simply happen. Discussion brings about change and it is important for development.</p><h4>How do you feel about the Tanzanian business environment and what challenges exist?</h4><p>With respect to the energy industry, it is slightly immature because it is relatively new. I believe that, even when gold prices were high, the maximum revenue from Tanzania's extractive industries per annum was circa $500 million per year. The potential benefits of a deepwater gas development will dwarf that. Secondly, the investment for deepwater gas developments can range into billions and billions of dollars. Preparing for the impact this will have on the economy is challenging in terms of the influx of goods and the utilization of foreign exchange and how to avoid hyperinflation. From a government perspective, these things need to be thought through. Service companies also need to be ready. The issue of permits should be considered as well; you don't want to bring people in with huge investments only to have them faced with obstacles.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the importance of sport, tourism, and education as a part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, and the placement of Aspire Zone within that context?</h4><p>The wise leadership of Qatar foresees the long-term benefits of investing in a diversified manner, while making its people the most important asset. The Qatar National Vision 2030 pits human, social, economic, and environmental development against uncontrolled growth and addresses major challenges facing Qatar. Sport has the ability to empower individuals. It can be used to encourage people of all ages to become more physically active, provide opportunities for recreation and personal development, build self-esteem, and foster positive social connection with peers. This aspect of sport as a tool for development is central to the Qatar Nation Vision 2030, as sport will realize all four of the development pillars for Qatar. The Aspire Zone Foundation (AZF), since its inception in 2003 as the Sports City project, is committed to carrying Qatar into a true knowledge-based society by offering the country an empowered and healthy population by 2030. Our inherently embedded role in this framework of modernity is significant. Our visions and goals are aligned with the country's leadership, as it places emphasis on the use of sport as a tool of social, economic, human, and environmental development. Indeed, Aspire Zone hosts a diverse range of community-centric events all year round that are designed to use sport as a vehicle for change. Some of these programs and initiatives include Aspire ACTIVE, Aspire Football Dreams, and Step into Health. Furthermore, Qatar is now home to over 175 nationalities. AZF harnesses the universal popularity of sport as a social connector and brings people and communities together.</p><h4>How important is the legacy of the Asian Games in preparations for future international sports events?</h4><p>The Asian Games 2006 signaled Qatar's arrival on the global sports stage. Over 10,500 athletes from 45 countries around the globe gathered to take part. The opening ceremony alone, held at Khalifa International Stadium, welcomed 50,000 spectators. In addition, the 15-day event drew a television audience of 1.5 billion viewers. This country has a long and proven track record of hosting world-class sport events. From the cycling Tour of Qatar, to annual tennis championships, to Golf masters, Qatar sees a bevy of sport activities all year round. Today, Qatar is synonymous with such global brands as FC Barcelona, FIFA World Cup 2022, Paris Saint-Germain, Al Kass International Cup, the prestigious ASPIRE4SPORT, Doha GOAL Forum events, and more. As curators, hosts, and organizers, we at AZF are experiencing some of our busiest years in recent memory as we gear up to further capture the imagination of the sporting world. Because of AZF's critical role in Qatar's sporting map, we will not simply be the home of one the 12 stadiums for the FIFA World Cup 2022, but we will also watch eagerly as an entire generation of some of our Aspire Academy graduates take to the field and play against the world's best.</p><div class="quote">“The wise leadership of Qatar foresees the long-term benefits of investing in a diversified manner."</div><h4>What synergies are created when combining sports, medicine, research, and education under one roof?</h4><p>Having originally been established in 2003 as a Sports City project, AZF has evolved, and today works to develop sports champions, promote healthy lifestyles, and galvanize the sports economy of today—and of the future—through a network of member organizations: Aspire Academy, Aspetar, and Aspire Logistics. Our Academy is the long road between identifying raw talent and turning the possessors of those innate abilities into great men and women, whose stories will reverberate throughout the world. Aspetar is the region's first specialized orthopedic and sports medicine hospital, providing cutting-edge solutions and medical treatments to athletes and sportspersons. The state-of-the-art facility also boasts a FIFA-accredited medical center of excellence. Aspire Logistics, our third and latest member-organization, manages the precinct's world-class sporting venues, as well as providing venue and event management services for different sectors. It also explores partnership opportunities around the world to introduce tools and solutions that contribute and strengthening the global sports industry. Together, they contribute to the sporting culture in Qatar and beyond. Whether it's training athletes who do not shrink in the face of adversity, pioneering research offering industry-leading solutions, or management of one of the region's foremost iconic buildings, Aspire Zone Foundation is, and has been, leading the way in innovation and perfection.</p><h4>What is Aspire Zone's role in attracting tourism to Qatar?</h4><p>As a testament to AZF's pivotal role in spurring Qatar's tourism, the premier Sports City was voted the world's leading sports tourism development project at the World Travel Awards 2012. In that award cycle alone, AZF hosted the opening, final, and a number of key matches of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. It also served as the main venue for the 2011 Pan-Arab Games, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the region. Additionally, the zone regularly plays host to some of the sporting world's most significant events, and frequently attracts hundreds of delegates and industry leaders from around the world. AZF is located on a 25-hectare sporting complex in the heart of Doha, and boasts features unique to the entire region. From Aspire Dome, credited as the world's largest indoor multipurpose dome, to Aspire Park, recognized as one of the most inspiring parks in the Gulf region, Aspire Zone is an ultimate haven for enthusiasts of sports and an active lifestyle. Of course, AZF has been so successful because Qatar is the economic superstar of the GCC, as well as an authentic bearer of the Middle East's rich culture. Any stay in Doha is filled with new experiences to be shared with friends and prospects from across the five continents. Consequently, Qatar has become an international hub for conferences and exhibitions and, over the past few years, has played host to an array of world-class events, including the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 18, and the World Innovation Summit for Education. AZF is also home to two five-star luxury hotels; Grand Heritage Doha Hotel and Spa and the Torch Doha Hotel. Alongside an array of world-class facilities designed to entice and excite visitors, each hotel boasts its own unique, signature style.</p><h4>What have been some of the major achievements of AZF?</h4><p>Qatar's pioneering national vision charts a clear journey in which the sports sector is a shining example of the world-class ambition that the country has for nurturing talent—not just in the development of future athletes, but also in all walks of life. AZF is at the forefront of this vision, providing the youth in both Qatar and the GCC with the tools to unlock their potential. AZF's success is built upon the core value within sports: teamwork. Through the combination of the strengths and expertise of its member organizations, AZF produces world-class sporting events that are well rounded, seamless in their operations, and inspirational to the region's youth. Despite its state of infancy—barely a decade in existence—Aspire Zone has carved an unsurpassed reputation for sports in a region previously only known for sports engagement from the sidelines. From the 2006 Asian Games and the 2011 Arab Games to the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics, Aspire Zone has brought unparalleled attention to the GCC, and served as the gateway to a new era of sports popularity. Alongside these achievements, Aspire Zone proves time and again that it is the ultimate sports destination and it provides the perfect setting to combine sport and leisure. Furthermore, Aspetar provides state-of-the art facilities and highly trained medical staff, while Aspire Academy's Aspire ACTIVE program offers unique recreational physical activity and fitness exercise programs for the whole family. The first of numerous sports venues in Qatar's master plan for the coming decade, Aspire Zone has set the standards that will influence the Middle East's first FIFA World Cup.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the outlook for Turkey's retail fuel market?</h4><p>The retail fuel market in Turkey shows a very interesting combination of strong regulations and rapidly evolving conditions combined with strong competition. It is one of the most regulated and competitive markets, which has, in my view, no equivalent. There is a saying that “the past doesn't speak for the future," and it is true for this market in a very positive way. The past was sometimes very hectic, but the future looks bright. Turkey proved to be able to overcome tough circumstances, quickly recover, and grow stronger. This is what creates long-term confidence in the future of this market. I am not betting that it will have no ups and downs over the next 10-15 years, but I do believe that whatever happens, the people have the capacity to overcome bad times and continue working for tomorrow. There are no second thoughts about “what could have been"—people take a very pragmatic approach about where they are and where they want to be in the future, and they make it happen.</p><h4>How has Turkey's significance to Total evolved over the time that you have been in this market?</h4><p>Regarding the retail and lubricants business that I am in charge of, we have been in this market for the past 20 years and we see it as a successful journey. We have reached a market share of about 6% in the retail business and 11% for lubricants, which makes us the fifth largest player in the market. The Turkish fuel market itself is booming in comparison to Western Europe. Turkey is both a dynamic and sophisticated market, eager to consume. There is a sustainable growth perspective since the number of cars per inhabitant is five times lower than the rest of Western Europe and half of what we see in Russia. With plenty of room to grow, the Turkish retail market is demonstrating huge potential. Total Oil Turkey wants to be part of it, and will further invest in line with this perspective. We want to be one of the reference retail players by 2018. In the recent past, we concentrated on our core retail business by selling our bottled LPG business two years ago, and then engaged in a resolute growth strategy in the retail sector. For our retail business, Turkey is a strategic place to be. Naturally, it is key because of its vibrant and sophisticated market, located between Europe, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and North Africa. Turkey is also a key cultural reference. Many of the people we work with elsewhere refer to our presence in Turkey as a major asset. Other group subsidiaries are also present in the chemicals industry or petrochemical segment, as well as for international transportation.</p><div class="quote">“We have been in this market for the past 20 years and we see it as a successful journey."</div><h4>How does Total adapt its business model to different markets around the world?</h4><p>The key word about our business model in retail is adaptation. Listening is the first core behavior we list in what we call the “Total Attitude." We first listen to the market, the stakeholders, and the communities we live in. Our corporate social responsibility program has a focus on children's education about road safety and our support for the Ancient City of Smyrna archeological project shows what we mean. Another core behavior is boldness. This tells a lot about the way Total Oil Turkey wants to behave. We don't compromise on our international standards, especially when it comes to safety; however, when it comes to the market, we listen and learn from our customers. As a result, the way we manage the business in Turkey is not the copy paste of what we do elsewhere, but fits to this market. For example, in our retail business the Turkish market is very specific in the way that the vast majority of stations are owned by dealers, which is unusual. We adapted to it and the relationship we developed with our dealers has become a key asset in our view.</p><h4>How does Turkey compare to other markets in terms of innovation?</h4><p>Customer sophistication makes it very interesting in terms of retail business. Turkey has a huge competitive edge in innovation. Customers are young and interested in the future. As a result, Total Oil Turkey fights to be one of the most innovative Total subsidiaries. As an example, our actions on social media make us one of the most active Total downstream subsidiaries, which is welcomed by our Turkish customers. Another example is the new image at our filling stations, which we began to implement in March 2012. One of the pilot sites for a worldwide project was created in Istanbul. Immediately after the project was approved at the group level, Turkey took the lead in terms of the rebranding program with 75 new look realizations by the end of 2012. Now when the company wants to learn how the “new look" is perceived by customers, they come to Turkey. Things go faster here than anywhere else, and the business environment is supportive. The Turkish contractor we worked with for the project has been selected to implement the “new look" stations in many other Total markets around the world. Everyone throughout this process in Turkey, from the dealers to the contractors and customers, has been receptive to innovation, and that is one of Turkey's strengths.</p><h4>One of Total's goals in Turkey is to own 15% of the stations in your network. Why is this an important part of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Competition is tough in Turkey and we expect it to remain so or become even tougher. Still, we have ambitious targets. We want to increase from 430 to 500 stations and grow our sales by 50% between 2011 and 2018. This means we are not happy solely with putting flags on the map—we want larger stations that can handle more volume. The dealers own most of the stations in this market. The general rule for a dealership contract is that it encompasses a five-year duration. Since we invest heavily in this market, we are looking for a longer presence on the sites, in compliance with all market rules. Ownership is one way to do it, and our aim is to achieve this long-term presence in at least 15% of our sites. This does not mean we want to operate all of these stations: the dealership model remains for us the reference model either through traditional relationship or on sites we own. Naturally, we also plan to grow in lubricants from our current 11% in the same way. In summary, what we want is to be recognized by more customers for the quality of our products and services; one thing we keep in mind in order to achieve it is that we are not here to “educate" the customer—we're here to serve his or her needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The $10 billion Ruwais Refinery Expansion (RRE) will be the largest in the region. How important is a site of this size to energy security in the UAE?</h4><p>The project was planned and developed to serve three main objectives. The first objective is to meet the expected growth in local demand, especially in gasoline, and also to provide feedstock for the planned downstream petrochemicals industry, mainly by increasing the production of naphtha. The second objective is to maintain the presence of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in the international market for refined products. As the country grows, local demand rises, and this reduces the export quantities of refined products. Once the project is commissioned, ADNOC's presence in the international market for refined products will be retained as export quantities increase. The third objective is to integrate the refining industry with the petrochemicals industry. This is extremely important because both the refinery and the petrochemicals businesses have been expanding, and ADNOC decided that this should be done in an integrated manner to optimize costs. Thus, the RRE and Borouge 3 were designed in an integrated manner from the start. We will be exporting propylene and importing hydrogen and this will reduce capital expenditure and operating costs for both companies.</p><h4>How will the project contribute to the government's target of being petrol self-sufficient by the end of 2013?</h4><p>After we commission the project, we will be self-sufficient in gasoline and will also have extra capacity for the next 10 years. Having said that, there are also other initiatives taking place in Abu Dhabi, such as promoting compressed natural gas (CNG) as a transportation fuel, especially for the public sector. The aim is to reduce our reliance on oil and gasoline, mainly from an environmental perspective as CNG is cleaner.</p><div class="quote">“We always benchmark ourselves with other refineries, mainly with Singapore or Rotterdam."</div><h4>What other plans does Takreer have in the short to medium term to expand its downstream operations?</h4><p>All of our plans for the refining industry have been fulfilled. Now, we're consolidating and making sure that our investments are providing the right results. The last project that Takreer awarded was the Carbon Black &amp; Delayed Coker Project, a heavy oil conversion project. It is in the detailed engineering stage and construction will start soon. The project will convert all of the heavy oil generated by both refineries, as well as the new refinery, into lighter products and specialty products such as carbon black, which will be used by Borouge, and calcined coke, which will be used by local aluminum firms such as EMAL. That project will ensure that the two plants become full-conversion refineries, and it will bring our refinery to a high level of capacity and complexity, which means we will have highly profitable operations once the project is commissioned.</p><h4>Given fluctuating crude prices, what are the challenges for companies such as Takreer to enforce cost-control measures while also ensuring state-of-the-art technology is available?</h4><p>Cost-control measures are extremely important in terms of ensuring that we have an efficient operation. We always benchmark ourselves with other refineries, mainly with Singapore or Rotterdam. We avail of Solomon Associates, which is a well-known benchmark agency for the refining industry. We use best practices and the findings of benchmark studies to make sure that our costs are managed properly. However, we recognize that there are always fluctuations in crude and product prices, and that any sharp increases or decreases can affect our margins positively or negatively. This could annul the cost-control measures adopted by companies. Therefore, we thoroughly study how we're going to apply any cost control measure. We never cut corners on safety and maintenance, which are crucial for us. These are things that we will never compromise.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges companies like Takreer face in today's rapidly changing market?</h4><p>In the wake of the global financial crisis, all of the refineries are facing difficulties, especially old and less-complex refineries, many of which are running below capacity or closing down. We've taken actions with our new projects that will increase our capacity and complexity to ensure that our margins are always at least positive. Another challenge is cyber security, and many companies are working to secure first their operations followed by other systems such as finance and human resources.</p><h4>How does growth in the northern Emirates contribute to the increase in local demand, and what increases have you seen in the international market?</h4><p>For us, the northern Emirates were always in ADNOC's forecast planning. The growth there is also being taken into consideration. We are building a terminal for ADNOC Distribution at Hamriya Free Zone to cater to the growth there. It will distribute our products directly in Sharjah and the northern Emirates. With this new terminal, we can ship refined products in bulk from Ruwais Refinery and unload and distribute them to customers. It is logistically much easier this way. Regarding the international market, growth is mostly seen in the East—mainly China and India, as well as the Middle East to a certain extent. However, demand for refined products has declined in the US, Europe, and Japan due to the financial crisis that hit those markets.</p><h4>The US has increased its refining capacity, reducing its reliance on Nigerian and Algerian oil. What effect do you think growing US oil production will have on the UAE?</h4><p>This is in regard to shale oil and gas mainly, which indirectly affects the refining business. Shale oil is produced through a very intensive process of hydraulic fracturing known as fracking, which separates the oil from the shale rocks. This is mostly taking place in the US and will affect heavy oil producers. However, we believe the demand in energy will continue to increase, despite the economic slowdown. Oil prices are still above $100 a barrel. Shale oil will boom, but it will reach a peak soon, before probably being abandoned. Fracking requires a lot of water and the treatment of this water is also an issue. Shale gas provides a cheap source for the petrochemical industry. It will affect the petrochemicals industry that uses naphtha, a refined product, as feedstock. This can adversely affect the refining industry if the US allows producers to export shale gas abroad.</p><h4>The UAE government has declared 2013 the Year of Emiratization. What is Takreer doing to explore employment opportunities for the national workforce?</h4><p>We're in line with this strategy and support it 100%. Our main need is for engineers and technicians. In engineering, we depend on ADNOC Petroleum Institute and local universities, and it's an area where we always see a shortage. We are also working to attract those with secondary education and develop them into technicians, mechanics, electricians, and operators. We have a genuine need for these workers in this industry. ADNOC's target to achieve 75% Emiratization by 2017 is challenging, but we have confidence that we will achieve it. Currently, we have realized 35%.</p><h4>How challenging is it to recruit talented international staff, considering the high level of competition in this industry throughout the region?</h4><p>It is a challenge, and this was proven when we started the recruitment process for our new refinery. There are big expansion projects taking place simultaneously in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman. We are doing our best to attract high-caliber employees. The UAE, being an attractive and safe destination for many, is supporting our recruitment of foreign manpower. We also realize the importance of offering attractive employment packages.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mayagüez evolved since it was established in 1937?</h4><p>We started in the sugar production segment; however, 10 years ago, we decided to shift business activities and look to expand our business line in the energy sector. In 2006, we set up an ethanol plant that today produces up to 250,000 liters of ethanol per day. Annually, we can produce 80 million liters. In this context, we are a very innovative company that recycles vinasse and re-circulates it into the system rather than dumping it on the land, which might contaminate the soil and water reserves underground. In addition, our storage and delivery system is regulated by the National Fire Protections Association (NFPA) and ASTM International standards and ensures efficiency and reliability in our operations. Today, in Colombia, the mix of ethanol with gasoline is 8%. In addition to ethanol, in 2010, we set up a cogeneration plant that has an installed capacity of 37 MW per hour per day. We sell around 19.5 MW per hour to the grid, and the remaining is consumed internally.</p><h4>This is a company that has achieved sustainable growth through renewable energy production. What is the potential for investment in the biofuels sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The sector holds huge potential, because there are only five sugar-based production companies, but there is capacity to construct five to seven more. The thing is there is no clear indication on what can happen with the price of ethanol, and that is the reason why some companies have halted projects in the sector. Additionally, many sugar production plants prefer to export sugar rather than devote their product to manufacture ethanol. For example, the Cauca Valley has the potential to produce 200 MW of electricity from bagasse, and several players in the industry are working together to achieve such a capacity. Mayagüez is one of the largest producers of energy in the region, but many other companies have boosted investment in the industry. We will see important events in the near future.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is among the top-three sugar producers in Latin America."</div><h4>How would you assess the state of development of the sugar industry in Colombia?</h4><p>There are around 13 operating mills in Colombia and thousands of stakeholders involved in this particular segment of the industry. For example, out of the 230,000 sugar-cultivated hectares in the Cauca Valley, only 25% is from the sugar mills, whereas the remaining 75% comes from non-related producers. Colombia is among the top-three sugar producers in Latin America, and today the country devotes 320,000 tons of sugar to the production of ethanol. Currently, 42% of the sugar we produce is devoted to the domestic consumption market, 23% goes to exports, whereas the remaining 35% is for ethanol production</p><h4>What are some other of the strategic plans for Mayagüez?</h4><p>We decided to expand operations into two or three countries in the region, and our financial projections foresee an investment capacity of up to $150 million. In this context, the future of the ethanol industry will be very much related to fibers, and although the technology developed is still very expensive, we are currently looking into future options to start producing ethanol from fibers. Finally, we will invest in more storage and distribution facilities, machinery, and new technologies, which currently represent 47% of our investment portfolio.</p><h4>The company recently changed its image. What was the strategy behind this?</h4><p>The move was envisaged to strengthen our position in the market and make sure that the market saw our shift toward energy production business activities. The logo and colors chosen are aimed at showing the market that we are a serious and solid company, and that we have high levels of environmental responsibility, which play a very important role in our activity. I always say that one can be profitable and respect the environment at the same time. For example, we currently use less than half the amount of water we did in terms of irrigation 10 years ago. In terms of social responsibility, we are highly committed in terms of educational programs; we have had our own school since 1954 with over 1,000 students, which has nationally certified programs. We make annual investments of around $2 million, and we plan to construct a new education facility in the Pradera community with a kindergarten,  a public library, a school, and public facilities.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the past year for Turkey's capital markets?</h4><p>The past year was a real success. Maybe the most important development was the enactment of the new Capital Markets Law, which reconfigures the legal infrastructure of the capital markets. In terms of stock exchanges, the law suggests that the exchanges be established in the form of joint-stock companies. This clause enabled our exchange to complete its demutualization process. Furthermore, through the law, the IMKB and Istanbul Gold Exchange merged under Borsa Istanbul, and the shareholders of the Turkish Derivatives Exchange (TURKDEX) are expected to join this new bourse, exchanging their shares with those of the new company at a predetermined rate. It is one of the most prominent steps in the history of Turkey's capital markets in terms of horizontal integration. In addition, our attempts continue in the course of vertical integration through increasing the shares of Borsa Istanbul in Takasbank, the local clearing and custody institution. Our bourse is already the major shareholder of MKK (Turkish CSD). Regarding the performance of the market we can look at the developments in our main index, the BIST-100. During 2012, the index has appreciated by 52%, making us first among the members of World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Accordingly, as of December 31, 2012, our market cap has increased to its 2010 levels, namely around $310 billion, recovering the decreases in 2011. Our liquidity remained relatively strong given huge decreases in the global market place. As of December 2012, we were the eighth biggest exchange among emerging market exchanges in equity market turnover. Daily average turnover was $1.8 billion during 2012. On the other hand, we maintained our position as the fourth exchange in the world in debt instrument market turnover, with a daily average volume of around $14 billion. In terms of IPOs, we can say that we had a good performance as well as compared to other bourses given 26 new companies started to be traded in our markets. Furthermore, 240 new issuances of bonds were made by Turkish companies, corresponding to a value of about $24 billion. All of these figures suggest that we will positively differentiate ourselves from the major world markets despite the continuing impacts of the global financial crisis.</p><h4>How would you characterize the potential for Turkey to become an international financial center?</h4><p>The political stability and macroeconomic developments of the last decade have converted Turkey into a center of gravity both for the region and for global companies that want to reach it. What is most remarkable here is that we could achieve this through market-friendly policies and mainly by the attempts of the Turkish private sector. Today, when we talk about Turkey, we talk about a country that has the 16th largest economy in the world with a PPP-adjusted per capita income above $15,000, with exports over $150 billion. In terms of the banking sector, today the total asset size of the sector relative to GDP is nearly 100%. This is a good indicator that the overdomination of the government on national savings is already over. Even at the heaviest times of the financial crisis, we did not put a penny into the banking system, displaying the soundness of the sector. Those are just a few simple examples. With a growing population whose median age is below 30 years, Turkey has great potential to reach its goals for 2023, namely becoming one of the 10 biggest economies of the world with a PPP-adjusted GDP of $2 trillion and exports worth $500 billion. In terms of finance, Turkey and Istanbul have great potential as well. First of all, Istanbul has already been a financial hub, historically. During history, its geographical position as a transition point between Asia and Europe has always made it a center where financial transactions take place. Secondly, there is an example I usually give. If we look to the world map, there seems a great gap between Asia and Europe. There should be a center that fulfills the needs of this empty time zone and I strongly believe that Istanbul is a natural candidate to satisfy the needs of both regional as well as global actors in terms of financial transactions. The Turkish banking sector is already well established and strong. In the course of the capital markets, the strategic attempts we have taken since last year are to serve to the overall objective of turning Istanbul into an international financial center.</p><div class="quote">“More than 120 companies are planning to join the capital markets by 2018."</div><h4>Although Fitch upgraded Turkey's foreign-currency rating to investment grade in November 2012, there is uncertainty over whether S&amp;P will follow suit in 2013. How do you expect this to affect investment inflows over the coming year?</h4><p>With respect to ratings provided by credit rating agencies, the recent financial crisis has brought about some significant issues and I believe that issues such as heavily relying on historical data and not being able to capture structural changes within an economy also hold in the case of Turkey. Therefore, I strongly believe that Turkey should have already been within the investable country range. In fact, what is not seen yet by credit rating agencies is seen by the market. If you look to the spreads on sovereign debt, you might realize that the difference between the spread of Turkish government bonds and those of the US with 30 years of maturity decreased to 180 basis points in 1Q2013. This figure is an important indicator of the recognition of the strong macro fundamentals of Turkey by international investors. Despite these concerns, the role of credit rating agencies in attracting global capital cannot be disregarded. Therefore, any increase in ratings will positively affect the investment flow. We observed this in the Fitch case.</p><h4>What are your medium-term goals for Borsa Istanbul?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2012, we determined a strategy composed of four main building blocks. The first main pillar was the demutualization of our stock exchange and achieving horizontal integration within the Turkish capital markets. These two goals were reached last year. We launched Borsa Istanbul as a joint-stock company that combines the IMKB, Istanbul Gold Exchange, and TURKDEX under one roof. The second component was to build up a strategic alliance. In addition, increasing the depth of our market is another important concern. First of all, our activities to increase IPOs are continuing. We had 409 companies listed on our equity market in early 2013. In 2012, we visited nearly 180 of the 1,000 biggest companies in Turkey. We introduced them to the opportunities provided by the capital markets, and according to a survey conducted by our team,  one-third of them are looking to go public by 2015. Additionally, one-third suggested that they will include an IPO into their agenda by 2018. This means that more than 120 companies are planning to join the capital markets by 2018. Furthermore, our visits to SMEs in Anatolia are ongoing. Through various summits we promote the capital markets and try to increase the awareness of institutionalization throughout Turkish companies. In the medium term, we plan to increase our market cap to GDP ratio levels to around 80%, in congruence with world averages. In January 2012, this ratio was 26%, and in 2013 it is 40%. We believe that we will be able to reach the projected levels. On the demand side, we want to develop an institutional investor base.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the background story of Azucarera Valdez?</h4><p>We are the oldest sugar mill in Ecuador, with 129 years of history behind us. We have wide experience and a strong tradition within the sugar production and commercialization industry. Some 21 years ago, Mr. Noboa took control of the shares of the company, and, in 1996-1997, Nobis Group took over as a parent company. Currently, Azucarera Valdez represents 30% of the country's overall sugar production, whereas the remaining 70% is controlled by five different sugar holdings, two of which are as large as we are. Therefore, we can say that 90% of the sugar production in Ecuador is controlled by three big holdings. We have a production plant with grinding capacity for 11,000 tons of sugar per day. Azucarera Valdez is the most reputable and innovative brand in the industry; we are a company with a presence across Ecuador, and our strength is based on individual consumers and their preference for our sugar. Innovation, for us, means diversification of products; currently, we have brown and white sugar, light brown and light white sugar, and we are conducting market research to launch other types of sugar, like flavored sugar and sugar with vitamins. We have also been launching new packaging modules in order to reach different consumer ends in the market. However, we have to keep in mind that this is an industry based on production costs, and the main aim of producers is efficiency and productivity. Azucarera Valdez has always been a pioneer when innovating in these fields. In terms of employees, some 3,000 people work here during the busiest time of the year.</p><h4>What market trends have you observed lately?</h4><p>The market tends to demand more natural and healthy products, like Stevia. We would like to stress that sugar is a very healthy product that sometimes is misunderstood by consumers, who think it contributes to developing diabetes and weight gain, but this is only in cases of excessive consumption. For that reason, we work on educating consumers of the benefits of sugar, and, at the same time, we launch products into the market that can meet consumers' demands. Stevia is set to play a greater role in the market in the near future; it is healthier and more intense in terms of flavor. We see some interesting market opportunities in this field, and we have already made some investments to determine the practicality of developing a small Stevia production plant in Ecuador, along with some crop fields.</p><div class="quote">“Right now, we are the most productive company in Ecuador's sugar industry."</div><h4>What is your expected volume of production for 2013?</h4><p>We believe we will finish the year with 3.5 million bags of sugar, which represents 4% growth when compared to 2012. To put these figures in context, Ecuador currently produces 11 million bags of sugar a year.</p><h4>What role do exports play in your business activity?</h4><p>Traditionally, Ecuador has not been a sugar exporter and it produces to meet the demands of the domestic market. However, we do supply sugar for the so-called “American Quota," a quota that the US allows to import, though it is a small amount in order not to damage its domestic sugar industry.</p><h4>What are the company's future strategies?</h4><p>We think we have some interesting growth opportunities as the population and their per capita sugar consumption increases. Ecuador has been growing in this context, and we think we can grab an interesting portion of this growth. We have to keep in mind the increased production and export figures in the sugar industry, making it very tough in terms of competitiveness. For example, Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala are very important exporters within the regional sugar industry. In addition, the region sets up prices domestically, and that does not make us competitive at the international level. Overall, our main aim is to grow in related segments, especially the alcohol one, which needs significant amounts of sugar. For that reason, we will have to invest on several fronts: agricultural borders, crops, equipment, logistics, and so on.</p><h4>How do you see the company in 10 years' time?</h4><p>Right now, we are the most productive company in Ecuador's sugar industry. I hope that in 10 years we will also be the most efficient one. We can do this by reducing production costs and increasing the pride of not only our employees, but also the consumers of our products. For that reason, we need to invest in innovation, technology, diversification, and the training of our employees. I also hope that, in this period of time, the alcohol generation segment will become as relevant as the sugar one. The future growth of the company will be based on these elements.</p><h4>What roles does Azucarera Valdez play in the group's overall operations?</h4><p>Sugar production and electricity generation are the two main business areas of the group, and they are both linked to the sugar cane plantations. Currently, we have an installed capacity of 36 MW with biomass; we consume around 30%-35% of it, and we sell the remainder to the market. Alcohol production is also becoming very important for the group; we have to differentiate between ethylic alcohol, which is used for the beverage industry, and anhydrous alcohol, which is very useful for other sectors like art, painting, perfumes, and biodiesel. We also export some of this latter type of alcohol to other markets, like Colombia and Europe.</p><h4>What are some of the most relevant projects you develop in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>We have always believed that our social responsibility has to do with making our farmers partakers of our growth and development, while providing them with the social, business, and financial tools to improve their situation and that of their families. For example, we talk about training families in order to make them productive units. By doing this, you can really make an impact on society. Apart from that, we also have a school for the children of our workers, complete with its own hospital and medical facilities.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Italy stands as the second trade partner of Lebanon, and first within Europe. What is your outlook for trade between both nations in 2013, and which sectors of trade have more potential for future development?</h4><p>Overall, Lebanese trade has been growing steadily. Given the well-known slowdown in international trade and the turmoil close to its borders with Syria, this is a remarkable trend. Forecasts for 2013 mark a further increase. Bilateral trade with Italy is also increasing; in 2012, Italian exports to Lebanon amounted to ‚¬1.28 billion, while in the first quarter of 2013 bilateral trade grew by 4.3%. Italy is the first European exporter to the Lebanese market, and the Italian presence is set to remain firmly rooted in all sectors ranging from investment goods to consumer products. We can count on a high degree of openness in the market and on triangular transactions in quality products with Middle East countries. Italian goods can also rely on an extensive network of agents and franchisees, especially in food industries, clothing, and footwear. Nevertheless, I believe that there are still many ways to explore and exploit the Lebanese market for Italian machinery, food, furniture, fittings, luxury cars, and leisure boats. Our excellence is well known in Lebanon. Italian institutions actively accompany our businesses to grab different opportunities; the Commercial Desk of the Italian Embassy together with the Italian Trade Promotion Agency (ICE) promote a variety of activities to reinforce the positive image of Italian brands among Lebanese consumers and to maintain Italy's position as first European exporter. In 2012, the Joint Italian-Lebanese Business Council was established as a flexible tool to gather Lebanese and Italian businessmen interested in expanding their activities within national markets and together in third countries. Our ties are getting stronger and stronger due to a number of common initiatives that are mutually profitable. We are currently working to have an important number of Italian companies going to Lebanon to explore new business opportunities in particular to infrastructure building. We are also planning a country presentation of Lebanon to Italian businessmen in Milan in 2014 and a road show of Italian companies that will meet potential Lebanese partners.</p><h4>What are Lebanon's advantages as a destination for FDI?</h4><p>First, Lebanon is an open market economy based on the free exchange of goods and services. Second, it offers privileged access to Middle East markets and the Gulf area. Lebanon harbors a dynamic and well-established community of entrepreneurs and bankers, not to mention that it represents a “hub" for financial activities. Given these remarkable assets, the Lebanese market is seen as a huge opportunity for foreign companies and investors including Italian ones. Hence, despite recent difficulties in the regional political framework, Italian companies keep a strong interest in exploring business opportunities in sectors such as the production of electricity, renewable energies, offshore oil, gas fields, and infrastructure.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon is an open market economy based on the free exchange of goods and services."</div><h4>What opportunities are there in the maritime sector for both business and tourism purposes?</h4><p>For many centuries, Italy and Lebanon have been trading along the Mediterranean coast. The coast of Lebanon and our peninsula have witnessed impressive movements of people, goods, and knowledge that have fuelled prosperity in the Mediterranean region. In particular, Lebanon has attracted goods coming from all over the Middle East, while Italy has traditionally re-directed the flows of products up to northern Europe and toward the rest of the Mediterranean basin. Today, Italy and Lebanon are still in a position to promote this virtuous circle of wealth and progress. Lebanon remains at a crossroad for three continents as well as a main tourist destination. It offers great opportunities in the field of maritime infrastructure. We are looking at the expansion of the ports of Beirut, Tripoli, Jounieh, and Saida, as well as at the renovation of the marinas, which offer very interesting prospects. I am sure that a political improvement in the regional environment will surely favor the implementation of these projects, by mobilizing the necessary funds and by re-launching trade and tourism in the region.</p><h4>The Italian Cultural Institute in Beirut is an instance of how Italy and Lebanon enjoy rich cultural relations. What particular cultural bilateral projects are planned for the near future?</h4><p>Cultural cooperation has always been a must in our relationship. I am deeply convinced of the importance of joint initiatives as they provide invaluable opportunities to strengthen the dialogue between our two peoples. We are linked by shared values. As a vehicle of mutual knowledge and mutual understanding, cultural exchanges provide a solid and long-lasting foundation for civil society to grow and for democratic institutions within the larger framework of the Mediterranean region. Moreover, the Italian Cultural Institute in Beirut is engaged in tackling the widespread interest in the Italian language in Lebanese society. Language is a privileged key, providing direct access to culture, and based on that understanding we offer and support Italian language courses in different locations throughout the country. The Italian Cultural Institute also works in close contact with Lebanese educational authorities in order to support the teaching of Italian as second language in public schools. The Italian Cultural Institute's activities carry on with the cooperation of distinguished figures in Lebanon's cultural life, and encompass all kinds of art, such as the Al Bustan Festival and the Liban Jazz Festival.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[back-to-the-roots]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The year 2014 will mark 10 years since the establishment of Aspire Academy. How would you assess the success of the first decade?</h4><p>I think that reaching the 10-year milestone gives us a good opportunity to look back over the preceding years and assess whether or not the academy is living up to Qatar's expectations. I think it has done an amazing job in laying down foundations. It is a young organization. I have worked in an organization that had 110 years of history, so I know that it takes a long time to build a legacy. When you consider the fact that we now have eight players who have played for the first national team of Qatar and 75% of the Qatar Olympic national team is made up of Aspire graduates or players, and that 100% of the under-21 team is made up of Aspire players, you can see that they are reaching the level of the country's senior squads. Mutaz Essa Barshim, who also came from Aspire, won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in the high jump. Aspire Academy has laid great foundations and will have reached its goals within the next decade.</p><h4>How is the Academy serving as a vehicle for Qatar to achieve the goals set in the National Sports Strategy?</h4><p>It is serving as a vehicle in many ways, I believe. One of the pillars of Vision 2030 is human development and we are working hard on this. Through sport, Aspire is trying to produce successful individuals who can speak on behalf of Qatar in the global community. I think Qatar can be proud of Aspire in terms of development, not only on the human side, but also in terms of infrastructure, organization, financial commitments, and investment. When you look around the world you see that individual countries have their own niches and flagship projects. I think we can proudly say that Aspire is a flagship project for Qatar. If you ask people around the world, they will tell you that they have not seen a place like Aspire before. The most important thing, however, is the human element. The energy of the coaches, sports scientists, nutritionists, and athletes that you see on an average morning really brings life to the academy.</p><div class="quote">“One of the pillars of Vision 2030 is human development and we are working hard on this."</div><h4>What role does Aspire Academy play in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup?</h4><p>It has a role of responsibility and pride. It has a big responsibility because the country is now looking to a tangible goal and people are asking how can we develop a team that will succeed at the World Cup. The reality is that a lot of those players are going to be coming from the Aspire Academy. It is also a chance for us to shine and represent the country. Many things need to happen for this to be a success, and it does not only involve Aspire, but also the Federation, the clubs, and the families of the players. It really is a wonderful opportunity to work together toward a magnificent goal.</p><h4>Is Aspire only involved in training athletes or is it also getting involved in sports management?</h4><p>It could be, further on down the road. In partnership with some other entities such as the Olympic Committee or the Supreme Committee of 2022, there might be a desire to develop career paths for the athletes way beyond their athletic or sports careers and into sports management, marketing, or sports science. I always believe, however, that you first excel at what you were mandated to do and then you can build upon that.</p><h4>You have programs called Aspire Active and Aspire Football Dreams. What are there exactly?</h4><p>Aspire Active is another obligation and mandate that Aspire has. It is not all about elite athletes. In keeping with the 2030 Vision and the pillar of human development and healthy lifestyles, Aspire aims to encourage people in Qatar to consider exercise a part of their daily lives. Aspire Active is a community program that will provide over a million hours of exercise programs and classes this year. It is probably the most-recognized and best-equipped program in the region. Once again, it is nice that Aspire is not only for a select group, but is also open to society through programs like this. Aspire Football Dreams, which I think is one the most impressive projects in the world of football, is built around the idea that Qatar is committed to helping other countries develop their sporting talent. The program aids countries that do not have the same resources as Qatar. Aspire goes to 15 countries around the world and gives children the opportunity to one day become football players. Every year we consider around 700,000 children. They are from underprivileged areas of poorly developed countries in Africa and Central America. The best 20 kids are selected and brought to an academy in Senegal and stay with us from age 13 to 18. They then become professionals in a Belgium-based club that we manage, and then they can return to their countries as professional adult football players. Most are already playing for their national teams.</p><h4>What other community efforts is Aspire Academy involved in?</h4><p>The main one is Aspire Active, but we are also about to launch a program to fight malaria in Africa. We have a strong relationship with the government of Qatar and we assist other countries when the government requires our help. In general, we do this through sport activities as this is our area of expertise.</p><h4>Having such a specialized academy, one has to hire extremely qualified staff. Where do you generally find your staff?</h4><p>If we want to be the very best, we need to have the very best. Wherever we find the expertise, skill sets, and passion, we will go there. The potential candidate must believe in what we are doing and believe that they are taking part in something special. We hire people from all over the world, including Europe, the UK, Australia, Latin America, and the US.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the education sector in Qatar?</h4><p>It is another pillar of Qatar's future development. Our commitment to the athletes is that they will get as good an education at Aspire as they would in any other school in Qatar. We are very proud that many of our students are attending universities not only here in Qatar but also abroad, such as in the UK and the US. We are going through the international accreditation process now. If we manage to get this, we will be one of the few schools in Doha that could make this claim. It would be a school that respects Islamic values and traditions, but also looks for opportunities for athletes elsewhere. Approximately 65%-70% of our students go on to university after completing their studies at Aspire.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for Aspire Academy?</h4><p>To be as dedicated and passionate as we can and to not become complacent with regard to what the authorities are expecting of us. We will continue to develop cutting-edge methodologies in training and sports science, and to develop programs that look after the boys even after they finish school. We want to be able to say in five years that, “that boy was an Aspire boy."</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is quickly becoming one of the world's top business destinations. What are the factors that lend credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is in the process of transforming itself through an ambitious economic vision that aims to achieve sustainable growth through economic diversification away from a heavy reliance on the oil sector. On the other hand, thanks to its position as a major oil producer, Abu Dhabi possesses the necessary financial resources that are needed to help in achieving its goal of building a vibrant and expanding non-oil sector. The healthy and competitive business environment in Abu Dhabi has encouraged domestic and foreign investment. The Emirate is considered an attractive market for international business due to its strong economy and encouraging investment laws. The investment climate in Abu Dhabi is becoming more conducive for local and foreign investors to set up businesses and to enter into joint ventures, as the Emirate has made significant headway in the past five years in developing the role of the private sector. Given Abu Dhabi's environment and the continuous efforts to develop viable and sustainable non-oil sectors, opportunities for investors exist almost everywhere, with the clean energy and tourism sectors occupying a prominent destination for investment. When it comes to attracting business, favorable tax laws are among Abu Dhabi's key competitive advantages. The UAE government levies no corporate or income tax and, at 1.7% of GDP, tax payment rates are among the lowest in the world. For many foreign investors, low taxation policies are a major incentive in deciding where to establish a business, and the government of Abu Dhabi is committed to maintaining a low taxation regime and retaining its competitive edge. Abu Dhabi has invested heavily in developing infrastructure that has underpinned the Emirate's growth over the past 30 years. Power and water utilities have grown to serve an expanding residential and commercial market. Modern transport and communications links have facilitated trade and business with regional and global partners. The municipality of Abu Dhabi is currently engaged in executing infrastructure projects worth AED19 billion, or $5.2 billion, and has spent more than AED20 billion on major road works and bridges over the past three years.</p><h4>How does the Abu Dhabi Council for Economic Development (ADCED) encourage cooperation and engagement between the public and private sector?</h4><p>ADCED is a government advisory agency that provides a platform for the government and private sectors to work together to achieve economic diversification and sustainable growth. The Council was established in 2006 with a specific mandate to act as an interface with the private sector, consulting its representatives across its activities on issues of economic policy and trying to incorporate the interests of the sector into government policy. ADCED deals and coordinates with a wide range of entities from the government and the private sector. It works closely with the regulatory bodies of different sectors and economic activities to ensure that laws and regulations are up to date and capable of enhancing the growing sophistication of the national and local economy and its integration within the world economy. ADCED coordinates with public and private stakeholders to support different non-oil sectors and activities. ADCED is actively involved in joint projects and initiatives with the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council, the Directorate of Municipal Affairs, and major real estate developers from the private sector to enhance stability and growth in the local and national real estate sector. ADCED also coordinates actively with Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and other stakeholders from the private sector to expand the tourism sector and to transform the Emirate into a regional and global tourist destination. ADCED partners with the Department of Economic Development and Abu Dhabi Chamber in many projects that aim at improving the local business environment. ADCED works closely with the Western Region Development Council (WRDC) and other regional entities to ensure that the benefits of economic development are spread to the remotest part of the Emirate through enhancing the attractiveness of the regions for investment.</p><div class="quote">“ADCED is a government advisory agency that provides a platform for the government and private sectors to work together."</div><h4>What role can PPPs play in the development of Abu Dhabi's economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi, with its significant infrastructure development, is an environment that is well suited to the PPP model. Partnerships have ranged from arms-length outsourcing to stronger cooperation between parties. The Abu Dhabi government is using the PPP structures in the infrastructure, power, water, health, and education sectors including the development of the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi (ICAD) Special Economic Zone. In the health sector, Abu Dhabi has outsourced the management of six of its 12 hospitals to private sector operators. As part of its strategic initiative to improve education at Abu Dhabi government schools, the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) has engaged with the private sector since 2006. It is certain that the PPP model is gaining ground in the economic development of Abu Dhabi and has started to cover wider business activities, especially with the increasing role of the private sector.</p><h4>What more can be done to develop SMEs in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>The simple answer to this question is to facilitate financing to SMEs. Similar to other markets, access to finance for projects and initiatives represents the most formidable obstacle facing the expansion of SMEs based in Abu Dhabi. Given this difficulty in securing credit, SMEs often rely on informal sources of capital, such as borrowing from relatives or personal savings. Besides difficulties in obtaining credit, SMEs in Abu Dhabi face other obstacles, such as getting access to public procurement contracts. The lack of data on SME activity in Abu Dhabi is another challenge that makes it difficult for the government, as well as the private sector, to better understand the make-up of the local SME sector. In 2010, ADCED initiated a study into the challenges and obstacles facing national SMEs. The study found that, despite the support and encouragement from the government, SMEs struggled to obtain financing from commercial banks in Abu Dhabi. As a result, the SME share of bank lending in the UAE as a whole is significantly below the MENA average. This represents a major restriction on the ability of Abu Dhabi entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses. The study suggested a loan guarantee scheme with the government that encourages banks and financial institutions to be pro-active in supporting local SMEs and to extend a larger share of their credits to these enterprises.</p><h4>What opportunities do you currently see in Abu Dhabi's industrial sector?</h4><p>With a consistent flow of investment into the manufacturing sector and the development of several mega infrastructure projects, such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), Abu Dhabi is rapidly transforming into an industry-oriented economy driven by a long-term strategy and a clear vision to diversify the economy away from hydrocarbon resources. Many new industrial zones with world-class infrastructure and supporting facilities are being developed under the Higher Corporation for Specialized Economic Zones (ZonesCorp) and Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) to attract industrial investment and stimulate economic growth. Opportunities within the industrial sector are increasing with the effort to create a favorable investment climate and streamline the industrial licensing process through the introduction of a single window system known as One-Stop Shop (OSS). As part of the Emirate's efforts to take industrial development to remote areas including the Western Region, Abu Dhabi is working on the development of new specialized industrial zones and industrial infrastructure in the Western Region. The new industrial cities in the Western Region include Ruwais industrial city and Madinat Zayed industrial city.</p><h4>In which non-oil sectors are you seeing increased activity?</h4><p>High-end tourism is currently witnessing unprecedented growth and looks set to grow at higher rates in the coming few years, as Abu Dhabi is taking major steps to transform into a regional and international tourist destination. The financial services sector also has exciting opportunities for financial business, with Abu Dhabi's aim to be an international financial hub. The announcement at the end of April 2013 by the Abu Dhabi government on the creation of the Abu Dhabi World Financial Market—a new financial free zone located on Al Maryah Island—is a major step toward transforming the Emirate into a global and regional financial center. The clean energy sector also has huge potential for growth as Abu Dhabi is seeking to become an international center in the field of renewable energy and limiting carbon dioxide emissions. With a high rate of population growth, the health and education sectors are seeing strong growth and the government is seeking an active role for private investments in the development of these two sectors.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business developed and evolved?</h4><p>I am the Co-founder and CEO of Gulf Energy, which today is a leading service provider in Oman, employing around 750 people. Prior to 2005, the contribution of local players in the services industry for oil and gas was only 3% or 4%, and today that figure is around 25%. We started in 2005 and took up this challenge, bringing strong leadership to the services sector. Oilfield services is a sophisticated sector and requires know-how, expertise, and technology in order to have the ability to compete and deliver high-end service quality to customers. This is especially the case in Oman, where the production of oil and gas is very challenging given the complex reservoir geology and environment. Our main focus remains to ensure that we are technically successful; we have learned that if you are technically successful, clients will demand your services more and commercial feasibility becomes more realistic.</p><h4>How did the idea for Gulf Energy come about?</h4><p>Capitalizing on the 10 years experience that I had from working in the oil industry, it was the time to think of doing something to contribute to localize some of the services in the oilfield services sector. The Ministry of Oil and Gas has made the support of local industry a priority. Hence, we leveraged this support and came up with state-of-the-art services through Gulf Energy. Today, Gulf Energy is a house of many sophisticated technologies and provides its services to all operators in Oman. In line with increasing the in-country value (ICV), we have embarked on the manufacture of oilfield products and we currently manufacture different products ranging from oilfield chemicals to well completion equipment. Our company has managed to take the lead and compete with major companies and win a larger and larger market share in Oman. Recently, Gulf Energy expanded its operations to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.</p><h4>How did you build your reputation to compete with the oil majors?</h4><p>When we started in 2005 we started as a backup contractor to Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker. We have managed to convince our customers with our superior performance and thanks to Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), which allowed us, without a track record, to take on small contracts to demonstrate our capabilities. However, that did not last long, and we immediately proved ourselves and started winning bids and more market share, and this has positioned Gulf Energy as one of the leading service providers in Oman. The span of our services covers reservoir evaluation, cementing, stimulation, drilling and workover, and completion services.</p><div class="quote">“We were awarded a new contract for fracking and this made our company the first indigenous fracking company in the Middle East."</div><h4>How much of your portfolio is with the largest oil companies?</h4><p>PDO controls about 80% or 90% of all the oil production in Oman, so it is the oil major with the highest volume. Occidental is also a major part of that, and today there are newcomers such as Daleel Petroleum and CC Energy, to which we are currently delivering services.</p><h4>What challenges are you presented with working in Oman's geography?</h4><p>Clients see it as a challenge; we see it as an opportunity. The challenges in Oman are present across the country. The geology of Oman is very complicated, as you can see from the topography. Today, we produce oil at 300 meters and at 5,700 meters. There is heavy oil, as heavy as 12 API and volatile oil with an API as high as 42, and there is gas, sour gas, sweet gas, and very hard formations. All this gives us opportunities, whether it is in the north or south. The south has heavy oil; when the oil becomes less mobile, the recovery factor drops. Right now, we are involved in many aspects to improve the productivity of the oil, whether it is through steam injection, where we have technologies to allow the client to evaluate the steam, increase the quality of the steam, or operations in the steam well. PDO is also using polymer flooding in order to displace and increase the viscosity of the water so it can push more oil through. Such processes require a lot of technologies before, during, and after the polymer injections. Our company hosts many technologies and products in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and improved oil recovery (IOR).</p><h4>How much of your work is with gas?</h4><p>We provide many services during the drilling of gas wells and also during the post production of such wells. The services include well construction related services, stimulation, and well completion services. The challenges in gas are different from those in oil. Because most gas is found in very tight reservoirs, such reservoirs will need to be fracked in order to produce efficiently. We were awarded a new contract for fracking and this made our company the first indigenous fracking company in the Middle East, and we are due to commence operations in 4Q2013.</p><h4>What potential is there for Oman to export its technological know-how?</h4><p>We already doing that, and currently have operating contracts in Yemen and Iraq. We recently opened offices in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and are in the process of bidding in those two countries.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Gulf Energy?</h4><p>The plan for Gulf Energy over the next five years is expansion. However, first of all we need to anchor our operations in the region and invest in technology. There are many niche markets here that require specialized technology to be brought into the region. We are expanding outside of the country. At the same time, we are raising our presence in Oman through technology and service quality.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the bilateral relations between Qatar and India?</h4><p>I believe that Qatar is one of India's closest friends in the Gulf region. The enlightenment, openness, and respect for diversity shown by the leaders of Qatar has contributed greatly to Qatar's rapid socio-economic development, and made it a model for the region as a whole. Our relations with Qatar are part of our historical, cultural, and civilizational links with the Gulf region. This is a region of vital importance to us. It is home to 5 million Indians, and an important source of our energy requirements.</p><h4>To what extent do Indian citizens living in Qatar contribute to the Indian economy?</h4><p>Indians constitute the largest expatriate community in Qatar, numbering over 400,000. The Indian community in Qatar has earned a reputation for hard work, diligence, and great enterprise. The hard work of Indian citizens living and working in Qatar is contributing to our mutual prosperity. Their annual remittances of over $700 million to India are an invaluable contribution not only to their families in India, but also to society at large. The government is undertaking measures to facilitate this process. Our financing requirements for the infrastructure sector alone are estimated at $500 billion in the next five years.</p><div class="quote">“Indians constitute the largest expatriate community in Qatar, numbering over 400,000."</div><h4>What is your outlook for growth in the Indian economy and what role can Qatar play in India's economic trajectory?</h4><p>The Indian economy rests on strong fundamentals. Since 2005, we have averaged 9% GDP growth per year. Our development efforts have been positively impacting our large agriculture sector, which has registered growth of over 4%. The resurgence of our rural economy and a more inclusive and balanced model of growth will, I am sure, create wealth for our people and get rid of ignorance and disease from the ancient land of India. The present international economic and financial situation has clouded some of the prospects of growth in the near term. I am, however, confident that the long-term outlook for our economy remains strong and robust. Our inherent strengths, the large size of our markets, the diversified industrial base we possess, and the strong and dynamic private sector will eventually allow us to return to a 9% growth trajectory. The current global financial crisis presents, in many ways, a rare window of opportunity for India and Qatar. The investment requirements of a large emerging economy like India and the large financial surpluses of an energy rich economy like that of Qatar can be married together to create a win-win situation for both our countries. Indian companies are also increasingly looking to invest in Qatar in such sectors as energy, construction, finance, and information technology.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Turkey's progress toward reaching its Vision 2023 goal of 50 million arrivals in Turkey?</h4><p>With the development that Turkey has undergone in the last 10 years, our country has become one of the stars of international tourism. This isn't just good news for us at the Ministry—it is also something that motivates and inspires the entire sector. The biggest goal in our 2023 Tourism Strategy is to reach 50 million visitors and attain tourism revenues of $50 billion a year. The requisite potential and infrastructure is already in place for us to realize that objective. As long as we use this potential well, I believe there will be no obstacles in our path. However, I believe that we don't even need to aim for 2023, and we can reach these figures even sooner. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism is a civil ministry that has intimate ties with investors, representatives, and businesses throughout the sector. If we maintain these strong ties, we can reach our goals sooner. Our united aim is to improve and exalt our country's image in the fields of culture and tourism.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to promote a wider variety of tourism?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the world's dominant economic sectors. Because we live in a place with a rich history, geography, and culture, we are one of the principal countries in this sector. Our rapid rise in the tourism sector has focused a lot of attention on our country. This isn't just true of the tourism field, but also in politics, economics, and foreign policy. Considering the international arena, there's an ongoing economic and political shift on the world stage. Within this shift, Turkey is becoming a source of inspiration for other countries. As things are, it's not enough to simply develop our tourism industry and renew and reorganize our strategies. That's why I've stated that what we have to do is protect our well-earned accomplishments and reinvent tourism. In this way, I believe that we will create a chain reaction of rapid development in tourism, the economy, foreign policy, education, and health. This interconnected development will also help create a more diversified tourism sector.</p><div class="quote">“Tourism revenue is a very important issue for countries that have realized the value of the sector."</div><h4>How would you characterize the significance of tourism revenues for Turkey's economy?</h4><p>Tourism revenue is a very important issue for countries that have realized the value of the sector. As you know, tourism isn't just sun, sand, and sea. It's something that incorporates all aspects of a society, a sector in which the smallest stone or even a single individual can contribute added value. This inclusiveness also makes tourism indispensable for our economy. Tourism is a valuable source of hard currency. We are working hard to develop and diversify the sector with this in mind. Today, new methods are employed in the calculation of tourism revenue. We now have results that are more comprehensive and real. Tourism has advanced beyond being just a means for increasing our national income or improving economic standards; it's now become a strategic sector for our future.</p><h4>What steps is Turkey taking to balance economic growth with the protection of its resources?</h4><p>Turkey is full of cultural, historical, and natural riches, and our aim is to protect and pass these treasures down as a national inheritance for future generations. We don't want to think of cultural tourism as merely a consumer sector. To think of cultural tourism as a consumer good would be detrimental to our efforts to foster the identity of us being a nation of culture and would also be detrimental to the inherent dynamics of the tourism sector overall. The promotion of our culture has a major impact on our tourism sector. The human diplomacy that tourism also encapsulates strengthens our standing as a cultural state. Our main aim is to strengthen and expand our image internationally. By attaching the necessary importance and value to our culture, which arouses admiration throughout the world, we will increase its share in the development of the sector and, as a result, our overall economy. We are also working to attract producers to our country through such policies as refunding VAT, for example.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relationship between Zayed University (ZU) and its sister universities the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) and the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU)?</h4><p>The federal system of higher education in the UAE consists of two universities: the UAEU in Al Ain and ZU (campuses in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai) as well as the HCTs, a group of 20 colleges that focus on technical education and are located across the UAE. The federal system enrolls approximately two-thirds of all UAE nationals who study at higher education institutions in the country. The three federal institutions work together on a variety of matters essential to the continuous improvement of the higher education system as it strives to serve local and federal priorities and needs. The Higher Education Coordination Council, composed of the two Chancellors and the President of the three institutions, is the coordinating body for this work. Examples of the cooperation are the setting of admissions policy and entrance standards into each institution, oversight for new programs of study, and joint educational projects such as the implementation of mobile learning devices. The institutions also work together with the Ministry of Presidential Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on the enrolment-based Formula Funding Model that determines the annual federal funding for each institution.</p><h4>How has higher education evolved in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>At its founding in 1998, ZU opened campuses in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. At that time there were very few higher education institutions in Abu Dhabi. Beyond HCT male and female campuses, UAE nationals from Abu Dhabi mainly travelled to Al Ain to study at UAEU. In recent years there has been a major expansion of higher education offerings in Abu Dhabi, including high-profile institutions such as New York University-Abu Dhabi, Paris Sorbonne, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, INSEAD, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research (KUSTAR), and ZU, as well as Abu Dhabi University and Al Hosn University. ZU was created as a federal university for female Emirati students, perhaps the first such federal university in the Middle East. Emirati male students were admitted in 2008. Now, the opening of the new ZU campus at Khalifa City, with the capacity for more than 6,000 undergraduate students, has created new opportunities for UAE nationals to undertake university study in Abu Dhabi. At a growth rate of about 20% per year, ZU is the fastest growing university in the Gulf region.</p><div class="quote">“A vibrant, world-class higher education sector will empower UAE nationals to be educated."</div><h4>What role is higher education playing Vision 2030?</h4><p>Higher education plays a critical role in Vision 2030 in three ways. First, Vision 2030 sets an ambitious target to transform the Abu Dhabi economy away from hydrocarbon dependence to a more broadly based and diversified knowledge-based economy and society. Higher education will be critical in preparing UAE nationals to become the knowledge workers essential for this diversified economy. Second, higher education institutions, including ZU, will play a critical role as part of the innovation system providing research and creative ideas in support of the newly diversified economic sectors. For the Abu Dhabi economy to be internationally competitive it must have a strong local innovation system with research centers in universities and business incubators linked to universities. Third, the expanded higher education sector will increasingly employ UAE nationals as faculty and researchers. Over time more and more UAE nationals will earn doctoral degrees that will prepare them for careers in the higher education system.</p><h4>How is higher education used to empower the population?</h4><p>A vibrant, world-class higher education sector will empower UAE nationals to be educated and ready for the increasing number of jobs that will emerge in the diversified knowledge-based economy. Because ZU is internationally accredited, its graduates enter the workforce ready to assume productive working lives. ZU is the only government university in the MENA region that is internationally accredited, giving its graduates both an advantage and a responsibility to take their place in the workforce and contribute to the ongoing economic and social development of the country.</p><h4>How does ZU partner with other institutions and organizations?</h4><p>At ZU we create international partnerships to ensure that we have the highest quality programs and faculty to deliver programs and services that meet the international best practices and standards expected by the leaders of the UAE. We do not believe in signing MoUs for the sake of collecting a string of trophies that subsequently achieve little. ZU takes seriously any partnership it forms and works actively with its partners for the mutual benefit of each and most importantly for the benefit of ZU students and the nation. ZU has a range of active partnerships with local governments and authorities, such as Dubai Municipality and Abu Dhabi Education Council, local businesses, such as Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, international businesses, such as Apple and SAP, local universities, such as KUSTAR, and international universities, such as the Australian National University, St. Andrews University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Thunderbird School of Global Management.</p><h4>What are the challenges in recruiting talented faculty?</h4><p>For academic faculty the market is global. Higher education is now a global industry and the best, most talented faculty can choose to work anywhere in the world. Therefore, ZU faces competition from major universities in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East for talent. However, the UAE is a popular place to live and work. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai are attractive places offering many of the benefits of modern, large city living with good infrastructure, housing, health care, and excellent schools, all in a safe and wholesome environment; these are essential factors in attracting and retaining top talent to serve the nation. A major challenge ZU faces in continuing to build its faculty and educational programs is the need to build a cadre of UAE national faculty. Currently, UAE nationals with talent, including ZU graduates, normally travel to study in North America, Europe, or Australia in order to obtain a PhD. This is often difficult, particularly for females. However, it is very important that UAE nationals embrace the challenges of obtaining a PhD so that they may become the next generation of highly qualified faculty, whether at ZU or elsewhere in the UAE. UAE national faculty will become role models for the subsequent generations of young UAE nationals.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing with enrollment?</h4><p>ZU's undergraduate student population of more than 8,500 students, on its two campuses, is 98.5% UAE national. The remaining international students come from 26 different countries. International students greatly enrich the cultural and language experiences of UAE students and are highly motivated to learn Arabic while obtaining a world-class education. Additionally, international students, once graduated, become ambassadors for the UAE in their home countries, thereby spreading the status of the UAE worldwide. Currently, the male population of students is less than 20% of the total population, but ZU has only been offering opportunities to male UAE nationals for four years. We expect the number of male students studying at ZU to grow to approximately 30% of total enrollment over the next five years.</p><h4>How has the curriculum adapted to the demands of the economy?</h4><p>ZU has a very clear process for adding new majors and specializations. Every proposed new major or specialization is first subjected to an employment opportunities and student interest analysis. New programs must be linked directly to the workforce needs of the country in terms of economic diversification, social needs, and community development requirements. In addition, as an internationally accredited university, ZU must conform to demanding curriculum standards that are continuously tested against international standards and best practices. ZU is currently undertaking a major planning exercise looking to expand program offerings, particularly in areas related to the sustainability of energy and resources in the science and engineering fields.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Turkey's progress toward achieving its Vision 2023 goals for the economy?</h4><p>Turkey is progressively approaching its Vision 2023 goals for the economy. Turkey aims to be one of the top 10 economies in the world by 2023 with an economy of $2 trillion, exports of $500 billion, and GDP per capita of $25,000. We have more than a decade ahead of us to achieve these targets. Our economic performance over the last decade is a testament to our future goals. Over the past decade, the Turkish economy has more than tripled in size, reaching $786 billion as of 2012, while GDP per capita soared to $10,000, up from $3,500. Similarly, Turkey's exports more than quadrupled, exceeding $150 billion by the end of 2012. If all of this was achieved in a decade, then Turkey can achieve more than that over the next decade.</p><h4>Fitch upgraded Turkey's sovereign credit rating to investment grade in late 2012. How do you expect this to impact foreign investment inflows in 2013?</h4><p>Fitch's upgrade is a clear indicator of the increasing confidence in the Turkish economy. Confidence is essential to any kind of investment, be it domestic or foreign. In a time of economic and financial crises, confidence has gained even more importance. As such, Turkey is offering a safe haven for foreign investors in many areas. Foreign investors had been increasing their investments in Turkey long before Fitch upgraded the country. Fitch's upgrade is just a vindication of what has been going on in the Turkish economy.</p><div class="quote">“Fitch's upgrade is a clear indicator of the increasing confidence in the Turkish economy."</div><h4>How has the continued uncertainty in the eurozone affected foreign investment inflows, and what steps is ISPAT taking to attract FDI from a more diverse range of sources?</h4><p>In the face of uncertainty in the eurozone, we have been diversifying the sources of FDI inflows to Turkey. We have developed specific strategies to attract FDI from Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and India, as well as from the Gulf countries and the US. Our efforts have yielded results; we have managed to attract large-scale investments from diverse sources, such as Aditya Birla and Polyplex from India, Sumitomo Rubber Industries and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi from Japan, and 3M from the US. Gulf countries have also been increasing their investments in Turkey. They have recently invested in areas such as energy, finance, real estate, retail, and many other sectors.</p><h4>How would you assess Istanbul's potential to become an international financial center, and what steps is the government taking to promote foreign investment in the field?</h4><p>Considering its geostrategic location, vibrant local economy, skilled labor force, and technological infrastructure, Istanbul is a perfect candidate to be an international financial center. Today, many multinational companies are already using Istanbul as a hub to manage their operations in the region. They have been relocating their regional headquarters to Istanbul, from where they manage dozens of countries. Moreover, today, more than half of foreign companies established in Turkey are in Istanbul. In regard to promoting foreign investment in the finance sector, the government has already taken the necessary actions to boost foreign investment in the area. With a strong regulatory environment, Turkey's financial sector has been the most attractive sector in terms of FDI over the past decade, attracting around $40 billion between 2002 and 2012.</p><h4>What are ISPAT's FDI goals for 2013, and what is your strategy to achieve them?</h4><p>Turkey's economic potential suggests that FDI inflows correspond to 3%-4% of its economy. That is an annual figure of between $20 billion and $30 billion. Our goal is to realize Turkey's economic potential and make it one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy in 2013?</h4><p>After robust economic growth in 2010 and 2011, the Turkish economy rebalanced in 2012. Despite the ongoing economic risks in the eurozone, the Turkish economy will grow by around 4% in 2013. If the eurozone can weather down the potential risks, then Turkey will even grow faster than expectations.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-welcome]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Constructora Valero sought to position itself since it was established over two decades ago?</h4><p>We started operations 24 years ago, and back then we were just a family-run company that was developing construction work for friends. Over the next five years, we started growing, and little by little we entered the real estate business and handled small projects. We have always been a family-run business. During the economic recession that affected Ecuador in the early 2000s, we started working with the Municipality of Guayaquil, one of the most reliable public administrations in the country. From that moment on, we started handling key projects for the development of the city as well as re-urbanization and planning works in suburban areas of Guayaquil. Slowly, we also entered the real estate market in the city, and we have already constructed over 100 hectares of residential area. The construction sector has seen incredible growth over the last seven years due mainly to the adoption of a stable currency and the wider availability of financing from banking institutions at low interest rates. For example, in 2000, the interest rate for the construction sector stood at 22%, whereas today it is around 9.8%. In addition, the government has brought much desired political stability and a long-term vision, investing large amounts of capital in construction projects across the country as it benefited from the high oil prices. Today, the company operates in two main segments: public infrastructure works and our own real estate projects.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects you are currently involved in?</h4><p>Right now, we handle four different real estate projects: Castilla, Compostela, Cumbres del Sol, and Bosques de los Ceibos. Additionally, we are working on the Holiday Inn Hotel near Guayaquil Airport, as well as Guayaquil's new prison building for 3,500 inmates. However, these are just some examples of our wide project portfolio.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador offers plenty of opportunities for investors, and there is a wide availability of financial resources."</div><h4>Who are the main clients of the company?</h4><p>Traditionally, we have targeted the middle to upper class; however, over the years, and thanks to our widening portfolio of projects, we are also increasing our range of clients. For example, in 2013 we will construct over 1,200 housing units for middle- to lower-income families. We build for all stratum of society including the government, municipalities, and private companies. The only segment we have not entered yet is maritime infrastructure, and we do not have plans to do so in the future, for we believe that it requires specialized staff, equipment, and machinery. In addition to all this, 80% of our customers work with the Social Security Institution when acquiring a housing unit.</p><h4>What is the company's business strategy to further expand its activities?</h4><p>I would say that we are between the top five and top 10 in the market; however, the first three companies are one step ahead of the rest. It is difficult to reach such a level; nevertheless, we believe that by developing projects with value and high standards, as we have been doing, we will be able to keep growing.</p><h4>What are the expected levels of investment for 2013?</h4><p>We believe we annually contract projects worth around $50 million.</p><h4>What environmentally friendly practices has the company adopted lately?</h4><p>This is an issue that has gained relevance in recent years, and since we are also concerned about protecting the environment, we hired a specialist to train all our professionals. Such measures have strengthened our practices and commitment to protect the environment and apply better health and safety measures as well.</p><h4>What is the size of your operations at the moment?</h4><p>We have 1,800 workers in addition to 55 professional engineers and architects.</p><h4>What measures should be taken to further develop the sector?</h4><p>I think it is very important to set a clearer field of action between the public and the private sectors, as well as strengthen ties between both. I believe we can all learn from each other and make the construction sector a stronger industry in Ecuador. I think that the government is aware of that, and it is taking steps toward that. Additionally, further measures are needed to increase the housing offering for middle- to lower-income communities in society, especially for units whose price range stands between $15,000 and $20,000. Also, I think we must reduce bureaucratic burdens for these and other such projects, because these burdens increase construction costs.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Ecuadorean construction sector offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>Ecuador offers plenty of opportunities for investors, and there is a wide availability of financial resources. For example, we issued debt not long ago to raise capital, and we reached very optimum levels of capital. Ecuador has positively changed its image abroad and the government has played a key role in this process. Today, the rules of the game and fair competition are stronger than in the past. These steps have also contributed to strengthening business and legal security for investors.</p><h4>Does the company have any plans to expand its activities to other geographic areas?</h4><p>At the moment, we are working in five different cantons of Ecuador, and we are about to start a real estate project in Costa Rica—a large building in the La Sabana area. Also, we are part of a group of Ecuadorean investors developing a project in Cartagena, Colombia.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-few-simple-steps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the flow of FDI in 2013?</h4><p>The main mandate of the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL) is to encourage investment and attract foreign capital to Lebanon. In the last few years, the turmoil happening in the MENA region has had its toll on the image of the region as a viable destination for investment, and since Lebanon is well known as the region's business hub, we were indirectly affected. From an investor's point of view, regional opportunities and access are more important than local access, and it is the regional picture that matters the most. If the region is unstable, then investing in a country as a means to reach out to the wider market becomes precarious. Since 2011, the Middle East has been passing through challenges with the various revolutions in places like Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Syria. In 2012, the conflict in Syria began to escalate and it directly affected the economy in Lebanon. Syria is a neighboring country and our land exports and transit depend on it for us to reach our traditional markets. This resulted in an economic slowdown in some sectors; however, UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2013 and the Arab Investment and Export Guarantee Corporation recently released FDI figures for 2012 that highlighted that, despite the current political and security conditions, FDI inflows to Lebanon reached $3.79 billion. This is a 8.5% increase from 2011, making Lebanon one of the largest recipients of FDI in the region, ranking third after the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, Lebanon's positive growth was enhanced by foreign acquisitions in the insurance industry and in services related to real estate. New gas discoveries in Lebanese waters along the northern maritime boundary with Cyprus and Syria offer prospects for the country to attract FDI in oil exploration.</p><h4>Who is currently investing in Lebanon?</h4><p>To understand who is investing in Lebanon, we need to look first at what makes the country an attractive business destination. The country relies on many competitive advantages, among which are its liberal market, strategic geographic location, cosmopolitan lifestyle, the availability of skilled labor, and the soundness of the banking sector, among others. These advantages contribute to attracting investment from three main categories: local investors and expatriates, Arab investors, and international investors. As it is quite well known, Lebanon has a wide diaspora, with many success stories across the globe. Recently, we have started witnessing the re-location of some of their businesses to Lebanon after they were affected in their host countries by the financial crisis and the political situation in some of the Arab countries they are in. The second category as mentioned includes Arab investors, especially from the Gulf area. Lebanon depends heavily on this category of investors. The third category represents international companies that choose Lebanon as a hub for their operations in the Middle East. Investments established by this category of investors are witnessing a current slowdown due to the regional instability, although they highly believe in the potential of the Lebanese market and this is reflected by the number of enquiries we are receiving from potential investors on a monthly basis. Lebanon's main foreign investors come from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, France, and the UK.</p><h4>What figures are you expecting in terms of FDI?</h4><p>Investments that pass through IDAL to benefit from financial incentives and our one-stop-shop services do not represent all of the investments in the country. This is because there are some eligibility criteria, such as the size of investment and number of jobs created, which are taken into consideration. Consequently, in terms of the overall size of investments, and according to the UNCTAD, we reached $3.79 billion in 2012, up 8.5% on the previous year. As such, we are among the few countries that registered an increase in FDI during 2012.</p><div class="quote">“We have a good number of foreign investors who entered the Lebanese market recently."</div><h4>What new international companies have recently entered Lebanon?</h4><p>We have a good number of foreign investors who entered the Lebanese market recently, among them of which is Majid Al Futtaim from the UAE, one of the biggest real estate and retail companies, and Arwan, in the pharmaceutical industry.</p><h4>What are Lebanon's advantages as a destination for FDI?</h4><p>There are four main advantages: accessibility to regional markets (consisting of 300 million consumers) enhanced by a great number of bilateral agreements; accessibility to human resources—qualified workers can be hired in Lebanon at a very competitive price compared to other areas in the region; accessibility to resources and raw materials—Lebanon is situated in an area that is rich in raw materials; and accessibility to finance—due to a very sophisticated banking and services sector that surpasses our boundaries as we have around 112 branches of Lebanese banks outside Lebanon, targeting the diaspora all over the world as well as Gulf and EU citizens. The deposits in the banking sector are three times the GDP of Lebanon. All of these pillars constitute a well regulated, investor-friendly environment.</p><h4>How do you assess the process for a foreign investor coming to Lebanon compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>One of our main pillars for attracting investment is our economy, liberal market, and a helpful regulatory environment; for example, it will take you only 37 procedures and around nine days to start your business in Lebanon.</p><h4>What are the most attractive sectors for foreign investors at the moment?</h4><p>Over the past year, tourism has been the most attractive sector. If you look at the projects that are passing through IDAL, around 54% of them fall under tourism. The tourism sector holds promising investment opportunities such as in health care, since Lebanon boasts a highly skilled workforce in that area and attractive infrastructure comprised of 35 doctors and 31 hospital beds per 10,000 people. Another sub-sector of tourism is conferences and exhibitions. Although it is witnessing a slowdown due to the geopolitical situation, this sub-sector holds great potential. Another area is the agro-industrial sector, which exhibits a growth of 15% a year on average. A large amount of investments have been channeled into this sector in recent years. A further one is ICT, which is very promising, especially in the field of service outsourcing for the international market. Lebanese ICT companies have good links with international companies and many have become success stories. Skilled and multilingual human resources are fundamental in this sector. We have 3,000 engineers graduating from universities yearly. The hiring cost of these engineers is very competitive relative to other areas. The yearly salary of an engineer is around $50,000 compared to Germany, where it reaches around $150,000. This boosts Lebanon as a hub for EU and US companies that are seeking to outsource their services related to mainframes, programming, and e-commerce. We have some promising sub-sectors in the industrial sector as well, such as high-tech pharmaceuticals. In pharmaceuticals, we produce only 9% of our local demand, and export around 91%. It is a promising sector to invest in.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Lebanon's economy in the medium term?</h4><p>Despite the unstable situation in the region, I believe that the Lebanese economy has shown very strong resilience, which has enabled it to face a lot of challenges. The private sector is very active; networking between Lebanese people with people in other countries is also very dynamic. I think that this resilience has helped us a lot in achieving a positive economic growth of 2% or 3%, and will serve as a pillar to prosperity and success in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How unique would you characterize the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>We need to have products that are dedicated to the Ecuadorean market and the greater Andean region. For example, in the truck tire market we developed products based on the terrain, streets, and geography of the region. For tires that are produced for Cuenca, which is at 2,600 meters altitude, or even Quito, trucks are carrying imports and exports that are delivered through Guayaquil. This means that transportation companies need to be able to handle travel at 3,000 meters to sea level in about 300 kilometers. Comparing that to the flat terrain of the Midwest US—where trucks travel for 1,000 kilometers without even a curve in the road—it is completely different from what we need to do in Ecuador. Even in the Colombian market, the surroundings are so different from other parts of the world that we need to produce specialized compounds for our tires. Our main advantage is that we have a centralized team that knows our geography very well.</p><h4>What are some of the innovations that you have brought in recently?</h4><p>In 2009, we were the first plant in the Andean region to produce radial truck tires, an activity that was launched in Cuenca. In 2012, we brought in tread products, which we call Contitread. In today's business, truck tires can serve multiple lives by re-treading them and applying new designs. This work allows tires to be used a second, third, or even a fourth time and radically reduces the impact on the environment and the cost for transportation companies. A transportation firm only needs to buy the tire once, and Continental can renew it at one of its three retreading plants in Ecuador. We are constantly developing new products that are launched on the local market and produced at our plant. Our branch of the company is responsible for a territory ranging from Venezuela down to Chile, and the Cuenca plant is entirely dedicated to that region. Thus, we deliver products to six different countries. That is a great strategic advantage. Compared to some of our competitors, we maintain a plant in the region that is working for the surrounding area. In other words, we are in the market for the market, which is one strategic objective for Continental at a worldwide level. Today, we are also investing heavily in local sales teams to improve our proximity to the customer and to better understand the needs of the local market.</p><div class="quote">“I believe we should focus our work in Ecuador on improving the relationship with customers."</div><h4>Who are your main clients in the region?</h4><p>The tire business is split into two main categories. On one side we have original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which are companies such as General Motors, Mazda, and Hyundai, which have operations here in the country. We also have the after-market business. On the OEM side, we serve all local assemblers in Ecuador and supply to Colombia, where we are also supplying General Motors and starting up business with Renault. On the after-market side, we serve customers in all our countries with products from bicycle tires to motorcycle, car, light truck, truck, and industrial tires.</p><h4>How has Continental Tire Andina's financial performance evolved over the past two years?</h4><p>We are working to improve our financial performance. Over the last year, we have grown significantly compared to our 2008 sales figure—we saw a sales increase of more than 300% in the Andean region. In addition, the company has witnessed a significant volume increase based on a $50 million investment made in the last four to five years. We have plans to invest an additional $50 million over the next few years. In 2013, we are expecting to invest between $6 million and $8 million, depending on market development. The worldwide crisis is also affecting this region, but not as much as others; nevertheless, economic growth is not as fast as it has been in the past. I do foresee good prospects for the Andean region to grow more than the average in the coming years.</p><h4>How will investments in infrastructure influence operations and business directly?</h4><p>We are leading in high-performance truck and passenger tires, which means that the better the road conditions are, the more our customers get out of their tires. The longer and better the roads are, the longer our tires are going to last. Thus, infrastructure improvements are a significant advantage for transportation companies. I fully support what the government is doing in that direction, and I highly appreciate it as this will also help accelerate the economy and our business. The longer our products last, the less our impact on the environment will be, and we see that as an asset. From a worldwide perspective, Continental is a very strong brand, being one of the top two companies in Europe. As Continental, we see four trends for the future, with three of them reflected in the Ecuadorean tire market. One is that people will tend to drive more safely, which is why we also invest in infrastructure. We also see a trend to improve the automotive industry's effect on the environment. We are heavily working on diminishing our environmental impact. A third trend we are observing is the demand for increased mobility. That means that we need to be able to provide the automotive industry with affordable parts so that everyone can be more mobile, be it on the public transportation system or individually.</p><h4>Do you have any major projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>We have major plans to invest in our existing plant in Cuenca and we just opened a retreading plant in Cuenca as well in mid-2013. That is what we do with our investments; invest in the Ecuadorean market. We do still see large potential we can leverage within our existing facilities, so we do not see the necessity to invest in a new tire plant in the region. Additionally, worldwide volumes are affected by the global crisis. As a group, Continental recently established new plants in the US, Russia, and China. However, I believe we should focus our work in Ecuador on improving the relationship with customers and deliver a better service to them. Then we will have more possibilities to expand our business and production in Cuenca.</p><h4>How is the county's economy growing, and what do you foresee?</h4><p>I do see significant potential for Ecuador as it continues to grow faster than the worldwide average. It is very impressive how fast the country is growing, and I do see very good prospects over the next year. There are significant investment programs that have been published or announced, and that will help Ecuador increase at a rate above the worldwide average in the coming years. We are in constant discussions with the government. I see huge potential to increase as long as the country maintains constant and rapid growth, which Ecuador has done over the past decade. In 2009, Ecuador was one of the few countries in the world that saw an increase in GDP.</p><h4>How many people work here for Continental Tire Andina?</h4><p>At our biggest location—the plant in Cuenca—we have close to 1,200 people working for us. Here in Quito, we have close to 100 employees, a figure that is rapidly growing. In terms of the people working for Continental's distribution net, we have 600-800 people. Thus, as a group the company employs over 2,000 people. In addition, the distribution network also includes independent companies working together with us to promote our other brands such as Erco tires, with more than 5,000 people working on that product alone.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the milestones for Middle East Airlines (MEA) over recent years?</h4><p>When the Board of Directors took office in early 1998, it set for itself goals that can be summed up as building an airline that would be a source of pride for passengers, for the Lebanese, and for MEA employees. After 15 years, we were able to achieve these goals by implementing a restructuring plan, reviewing the network, and increasing the level of service. Despite the challenging political and security crises that Lebanon witnessed in the past years, MEA was able to achieve positive financial results for 12 consecutive years. Today, MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world and preserves the highest safety standards, thus earning the loyalty of its passengers.</p><h4>In 2012, MEA officially joined the SkyTeam Alliance. What has been the impact?</h4><p>MEA, Lebanon's national carrier, flies to 33 international destinations in Europe, the Middle East, and West Africa. Joining SkyTeam Alliance in 2012 provided MEA passengers access to an extensive global network with 1,000 destinations, plus higher frequencies and more connectivity than ever before.</p><div class="quote">“MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world. The average life of the company's aircraft is less than four years."</div><h4>You recently mentioned the possibility of starting a low-cost airline. What is the potential for this segment?</h4><p>The MEA Board of Directors has already reviewed a study about implementing this; however, the decision has been postponed until there is more stability in Lebanon and the region. The Middle East area is passing through an unstable period. However, running a low-cost airline means providing a lower level of service. For example, on our Airbus A320 there are 126 seats in our current configuration, but a low-cost airline will fit 180 seats in the same space. This will save people money, but it will offer less comfort and a lower level of service on board.</p><h4>You recently signed an agreement with Airbus to upgrade your planes. How would you assess your fleet?</h4><p>MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world. The average life of the company's aircraft is less than four years. The MEA Board of Directors decided not to keep any aircraft more than 12 years old, so we are constantly renewing our fleet. This is done partly through expansion and partly by replacement. In 2012, MEA signed a firm contract for 10 A320/321 neo family aircraft, an aircraft offering fuel burn savings and reliability as well as a modern and comfortable cabin. However, MEA will announce its engine choice at a later date.</p><h4>What are your most significant routes today, and are you planning to increase the number of routes and frequency?</h4><p>All destinations are significant to MEA. In Europe, Paris is the most popular destination, and MEA has four flights per day to Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), but we fly to most European cities on a daily basis. In the Gulf we have 36 flights per week to Saudi Arabia, and up to five flights a day. MEA is not a long-haul operator; it covers Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Gulf area. We also have operations from four points in Iraq: Baghdad, Erbil, Najaf, and Basra. In July 2013, MEA launched its Yerevan route, and the airline looks forward to launching flights to Sudan as of November 2013.</p><h4>In terms of passenger numbers for 2013, what are you expecting?</h4><p>We are expecting 2.3 million passengers. Additionally, we anticipate around 6.2 million passengers through Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut, a 5% increase compared to 2012 figures.</p><h4>How would you assess air transport in Lebanon?</h4><p>Lebanon has an open skies policy. However, MEA does not have free access to all other markets, even though our market is open to all other airline companies, meaning that the competition is not fair. For example, Emirates and flydubai have five flights per day from Dubai to Beirut. We wanted to increase the frequency of MEA flights from two to three per day to Dubai; however, the UAE officials replied that there were no additional slots available. Secondly, we do not have effective anti-trust rules and competition laws in Lebanon. For example, if an airline decides to implement a discount policy to undercut the competition (price dumping), you can do nothing about it. At the same time, air transport in Lebanon has a lot of positive aspects. The political situation is not helping us regain stability. The countries of the GCC have urged their citizens to avoid traveling to Lebanon or staying in the country as “a safety precaution," and this has affected the number of Gulf, Middle Eastern, as well as the European tourists, so MEA is losing many of its business-class passengers. An increase in the number of passengers in reality means an increase in the number of economy-class passengers. Overall, we have seen a decrease in yield; it has dropped some 25% in economy class in the past four years due to the competition. Despite all of these circumstances, we are still making a profit. We have to restore stability, and then it will be very easy to regain the trust of the tourist market.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the pilot training center?</h4><p>This is my dream, and it will be completed by end of 2014. MEA Regional Training Center is not only a commercial project, but an act of faith in Lebanon's future and Beirut's pioneering role, which will be restored in 2015 when the project is done.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of MEA?</h4><p>At MEA, our purpose is to surpass this difficult period, make a profit, and continue investing in human resources and assets, because whenever you reach stability you will have the solid infrastructure that will allow you to progress immediately.</p><p>Correction: The interview above replaces a previous version released on July 26, 2013.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Total in the Qatari market?</h4><p>Total entered Qatar in 1936, as a shareholder of the Turkish Petroleum corporation (TPAO) at that time. We participated in the discovery of the Dukhan Field. When looking at modern history, Total supported the development of the petrochemical industry in the 1970s, and of the LNG industry in the 1990s. We were indeed a key partner in Qatargas 1 in 1995. Around that same time, we discovered the offshore oil field of Al Khalij, which we have been producing from for 25 years, and which we will be doing for a further 25 years, as we have signed the renewal of our license. Early in the 2000s, we were involved in the Qatargas 2 project, which represents a huge expansion of the LNG capacity of the country, and also the Dolphin Energy project, which was designed to export gas from the North Field to the UAE. Last, but not least, we support the development of the refining industry as a partner of Laffan Refinery 1, and we are now signed on for the Laffan Refinery 2 project as of March 2013. We also have a 25% market share in lubricant distribution. Thus, we are present across the value chain, from offshore operations to distribution.</p><h4>What do your operations here in Qatar represent in terms of Total's global operations?</h4><p>Total in Qatar is clearly among the top 10 affiliates of the group.</p><div class="quote">“Total is keen to seize the various opportunities of development that exist in Qatar."</div><h4>What does your French background bring to Qatar as a foreign oil company?</h4><p>Total is one of the top five companies in the world, with cutting-edge technology and a worldwide outreach in more than 130 countries. We are a very international company in the sense that most of our staff members are not French. What we have in common with our partners and competitors is probably more important than our differences. Still, there are some differences that are interesting, like the way we see the world.  In terms of marketing, it certainly brings us a good understanding of the European market, and this is important for Qatargas. Also, perhaps the way we do business is a bit different. Then, obviously, there is a special relationship between France and Qatar, and, in particular, between Total itself and Qatar, given that we have been here continuously for 77 years. And together we have forged a remarkable history. We were the first international oil company to help Qatar develop the North Field, the first to join Qatargas, the first to enter the petrochemical industry, a driving force behind Dolphin, and our discovery of Al Khalij was the first big find in 30 years.</p><h4>What role does Total play as Qatar tries to diversify its downstream products into petrochemicals?</h4><p>Total is the number one foreign refining and petrochemical company in this country. We are helping Qatar Petroleum (QP) to continue to diversify its downstream activities; both in refining with Laffan Refineries and in petrochemicals with the mixed-feed cracker project. But our support is not only in downstream. To give you an example, we have just signed a deal with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI), which will invest in Total E&amp;P Congo. This is another way to support the country's economic diversification.</p><h4>In 2009, Total opened a research center in the Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP). What role is Total playing in helping Qatar become a center for research excellence?</h4><p>We have around 20 researchers in that lab, and it is focused mainly on hydrocarbons and petrochemicals. We bring in experts from several headquarters. For example, the group's expert in geochemistry is now in Qatar, and this is useful not only for Qatar, but also for our group. What we like about QSTP is the fact that we can work with companies from different sectors. For instance, we just signed an agreement with QP and Q Analytica, a small start-up, to apply their technology developed for medical purpose to the oil and gas sector. This is a good illustration of what Qatar wants to achieve: cross fertilization between top class companies.</p><h4>How do you deal with issues related to human capital?</h4><p>With regard to Qatarization, we are working to develop the skills of Qataris. The population of the country is small, and Qataris are ambitious. To be competitive in the world, they need the best education possible. Based on that analysis, a few years ago we encouraged people from the French business school, HEC—the number one school for executive MBAs in the world—to set up in Qatar. It did so, and is now running an executive MBA program here. There are 40 executives attending this course, from all the big companies, and half of them are Qatari. It has been extremely successful, and without us it would not have been possible. That is an example of how we are helping.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Qatari energy sector as a whole, and also for Total's position in the sector?</h4><p>Qatar has done extremely well in developing its gas potential. It is clear that we are entering now into a new phase for the sector. Exploration has a role to play, and, in terms of oil, the redevelopment of maturing fields is a key issue for QP. In terms of gas, the optimization of the marketing portfolio is important, in order to figure out how to extract more value from this area. The internationalization of QP is also crucial. For the downstream sector, clearly there are a lot of projects that need to be completed. Total is involved in all those challenges; in exploration and in mature field redevelopment as we are supporting QP in the redevelopment of the Bul Hanine field by performing studies. We are also continuously proposing ideas to Qatargas to optimize its marketing portfolio. In downstream, we are the main partner of QP in the Laffan Refinery project.</p><h4>What are your medium-term strategies and visions for Total Qatar?</h4><p>Total is keen to seize the various opportunities of development that exist in Qatar. But, as a citizen of this country, we feel the duty to contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030 and to the development of society and culture. It is not easy but we must find ways to help, such as what we did with the education initiatives. Another example is sport. We have been the sponsor of the Qatar Tennis Federation for 10 years and, looking at how the annual competition has come along from when we started up to now, with Serena Williams becoming champion again here in Qatar, it makes us very proud.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are you doing now to increase the use of technology in Tanzania?</h4><p>As a government, if you need to improve technology, you need certain fundamental elements in place before you can pursue any new strategies. The most important of these is infrastructure. Without proper infrastructure, you cannot do it. Concerning this, we have invested $200 million to build the ICT backbone. So far, we have built 7,560 kilometers of national ICT infrastructure, which has been connected by three submarine cables. Our neighboring countries, Rwanda, Malawi, and Zambia, are also using the national ICT backbone. So far, seven companies in Tanzania are using the network, and these are AirTel, Zantel, Tigo Tanzania, Vodacom, TTCL, Infinity Africa, and Simbanet. Also, companies from overseas are taking advantage of the ICT backbone, such as MTL Rwanda, U-COM of Burundi, MTL Malawi, and MTL and Airtel of Zambia. In terms of infrastructure, we also signed a new contract with a Chinese company in May 2013 for the building of a data center. You can have the infrastructure, but without a data center you cannot see the meaning of the national ICT backbone—it represents a backup of all the information you have on your national network. The contract is for $100 million and the center will be built in Dar es Salaam. If the ICT backbone is a highway, then we also need feeder roads, and this is what we are working on, especially in rural areas. You can have the backbone, but you must be able to connect to people, otherwise it is a waste. At the same time, there is a joint venture between the government and the private sector in a PPP framework to build a metro fiber-optic network in Dar es Salaam with the involvement of Airtel, Tigo, and Zantel. We are building 90 kilometers in the city. We will also build in Dodoma, Arusha, and Mwanza. You can have all that infrastructure ready, but without clear policies you cannot achieve a lot. In 2003, the ICT Policy and the Communications Policy were finalized. We also have the Science and Technology Policy from 1986, and we have been updating this. We are reviewing all ICT policy, because since 2003 a lot of developments have come to the sector. There were no big cybercrime issues and the ICT backbone was not complete either, so it was a very different time. We are now trying to make sure the new policy is appropriate for the unique challenges we currently face. Also, the sector has grown a lot. In 2000, we had 150,000 subscribers, while today we have around 26.7 million subscribers. So, on one side you can say that we have come a long way, but equally you can say that a lot more needs to be done, especially with regard to security issues. This is a big concern for us. We are now preparing a cyber-security act, data-protection act, and an e-commerce act, and these three components will comprise the policy.</p><h4>How do you perceive Tanzania's progress in terms of technological implementation compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>First of all, I think that in addition to the things I have mentioned, it is also necessary to make sure people know how to apply the technology. We want to see the people of Tanzania view ICT as a tool and an enabler for social development in the country. We have a special program for innovators. In Dar es Salaam we have an ICT incubator called Teknohama Business Incubator, and we have good people working on projects to make the most of ICT as a tool for development. When we compare ourselves with other countries, we want to be able to see Tanzania as a hub for ICT. We have a unique location compared to surrounding countries. Rwanda and Burundi do not have ports and do not have places to install submarine cables. The first thing we did in phase one was to connect with the surrounding countries, and this has been very successful. We want to turn Tanzania into a hub, and we want our neighbors to use us as their ICT hub. Take Kenya for example. In terms of ICT infrastructure it maybe has 2,700 kilometers of fiber optics, but these are just laid between the main cities. In Tanzania we have put the cable in every region, and the government has ensured this. Uganda has only one line coming from Nairobi and connecting to Kampala and Entebbe. This is around 2,500 kilometers in length, but it is not functioning well. In Rwanda, it is working well, but that is a tiny country. I think we have done a good job in comparison, and we expect to one day be a hub for the region.</p><div class="quote">“We want to see the people of Tanzania view ICT as a tool and an enabler for social development in the country."</div><h4>What role will scientific education play in Tanzania's future growth?</h4><p>In our government's Vision 2025, one of the pillars is science and technology. Without investing in this, you cannot move forward with innovation. Good education is the fundamental principle of innovation. From 2010, we decided to invest heavily in science and technology, and in that year alone invested TZS30 billion. During that time, we completed the Nelson Mandela Institute of Science and Technology, which is dedicated to post-graduate study. We spent around TZS51 billion to build this, and it is located in Arusha. We did this because we knew that if you do not prepare your young scientists, you will not go anywhere. In 2012 alone, the government sponsored 295 students for Master's and PhD programs. Also, before going into innovation you need a result from R&amp;D. This is why we decided to invest a lot in the infrastructure of our research institutes, such as the agriculture institute in Dodoma. We have others in Zanzibar and Arusha and other areas. As a government, we try our best to make sure that everything is going well, from the strategic, security, infrastructure, and human resource development points of view.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is the Securities &amp; Commodities Authority (SCA) employing to attract foreign investors to the exchanges?</h4><p>Cross-border investment into the UAE stock exchanges is based on trusting that the exchanges are properly regulated, protected from market abuse, and capital is allowed to flow freely. Gaining investor trust takes years, especially when a significant amount of money is in the balance and this is a pre-requirement, even before the expectation of reaping stock market profits materializes. While stock market performances are left to investors' expectations of listed companies' profitability, the SCA has been working to provide a level playing field in line with international best practices. In this sense, the SCA has been active in reviewing several elements that can enhance market functioning: delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement has been introduced for improved safety of execution, eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) was introduced to enhance the transparency of disclosure, a new funds regime was introduced to enhance and encourage investment recipients that would lead to an improved institutional investment presence in the Emirati capital markets, along with market maker, short selling, and securities lending and borrowing regulations to improve market depth. All these new regulations constitute a regulatory framework that is welcoming for foreign investors, who mainly look for opportunities, which the local capital markets have, and the safety of their investments, which is satisfied through a full regulatory framework. The successful passing and implementation of all these regulations, coupled with the relentless efforts of the SCA and its strategic partners, led to the recent upgrade to “Emerging Market" status by the MSCI index, which will also lead to the greater attraction of foreign investors to the local exchanges.</p><h4>What can the SCA do to ensure the UAE's exchanges are more reflective of the national economy?</h4><p>As the UAE diversifies its economy away from hydrocarbon-based industries, those expanding sectors should gradually produce companies eligible for listing. In other words, the macro trend in the UAE is favoring a gradual expansion in the mix of listings. In the short term, however, achieving a better representation of the national economy output in stock market composition remains an issue of market microstructure: market depth and liquidity, settlement methods, data disclosure, and transparency. On this subject, the SCA has been active to ensure that the regulations are in place to facilitate and, where appropriate, enforce good market functioning. Even during the past years of a global decrease in trading volumes, the SCA has kept a long-term perspective and successfully implemented key regulations.</p><div class="quote">“The SCA has worked on a package of regulations since the crisis to remove hindrances to volume growth."</div><h4>How did the SCA manage to succeed in overcoming the attrition of trading volume in the UAE?</h4><p>The downtrend in trading volume has been present across global markets, and the UAE is no exception. The SCA has worked on a package of regulations since the crisis to remove hindrances to volume growth. The bulk of such regulations has been issued in 2012 and has the objective to facilitate trading between market participants, allowing brokers to apply for a market-making license, which entails a series of privileges aimed at resulting in tighter bid-ask spreads as well as better market depth. Another approach has been to focus on attracting institutional investors, which internationally provide a substantial percentage of trading volume, while in the UAE institutional investors are on the ascendency trend.</p><h4>How is the SCA currently working to boost the local securities markets?</h4><p>The SCA has diligently overseen the UAE's capital markets via the use of best international practices. One of the key methods to boost the local securities markets has been the SCA's adherence to global best practices in order to protect investors and improve the efficiency of the UAE's capital markets through the development of the necessary supervisory regulations. Secondly, the SCA's close relations with the industry, investors, and stakeholders has allowed for the quick identification, resolution, and issuance of regulatory requirements. As a regulator, SCA has approved and guided 133 entities and companies to list on both the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) as well as supervise and oversee a substantial increase and subsequent consolidation of a significant number of brokerage houses. Other key milestones include the SCA's contribution to the improvement of the educational awareness of both institutional and retail investors including on-going training workshops that have been conducted by the SCA on a regular basis discussing the implementation of SCA codes and laws to market participants. The SCA has also played an important role in assisting market participants in setting-up as well as advising on corporate governance, including the direct oversight and development of structural and technical governance issues related to internal audit committees, compensation committees, and internal governance.</p><h4>Sukuk sales are rapidly increasing in popularity in the UAE. How does the SCA regulate Islamic bonds? And what steps are being taken to safe guard against a quick self off?</h4><p>SCA currently has regulations that cover the listing of Islamic bonds and sukuks. These are contained in Decision No. (93/r) of 2005 concerning the listing of Islamic bonds and Decision No. (94/r) of 2005 concerning the listing of debt securities. These regulations require that all issues of Islamic bonds offered through public subscription are first authorized by the SCA, and such securities are approved by a sharia committee approved by the SCA, and that they comply with the requirements of the Central Bank before listing on any of the licensed stock exchanges. The SCA is currently working on expanding and developing these regulations to cover all stages from issuance through listing, trading, clearing, and settlement and continuing listing requirements. This will ensure the support of an efficient trading infrastructure that is key for the development of both the primary and secondary markets for sukuks in the UAE. The SCA is committed to providing a supportive and conducive regulatory environment that supports innovation and growth in the Islamic capital markets in the UAE, while ensuring the interests of both issuers and investors are protected. The new regulations will be built on several key propositions that will provide an impetus for a sustainable sukuk market in the UAE. These include the continuous availability of liquidity through the participation of a broad and diverse range of investors—both retail and institutional—as well as other key market participants such as market makers and ensuring that appropriate governance and investor protection measures are in place to protect the interests of issuers and investors alike, paying due attention to the very important elements of disclosure and transparency. These measures will ensure the maintenance of an orderly, efficient, and transparent market that will withstand changing market conditions. The new regulations will be developed through an exercise of benchmarking against the best international practices, which ensure that the UAE's sukuk markets will be sufficiently attractive to global players.</p><h4>In recent times there has been speculation about the merger of the DFM and the ADX. Is there anything new on this issue, and what are your comments as the supervisory body for this merger?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, everybody wants to see, as soon as possible, a unified UAE market, which reflects the second biggest market in the region. For our part, we are ready and capable of dealing with the situation. If the two markets are merged into one it will have many advantages, although the SCA has not seen any negative aspects in the current situation of having two markets. On the contrary, the current market situation has ignited positive competition between the two markets to give out the best services to investors. Generally, the SCA welcomes and supports the merger decision. There are technical, administrative, and logistical preparations to be made first before the merger is completed, and we are ready for whatever decision that may be made in this regard.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you conserve Tanzania's natural and cultural resources while enlarging the tourism sector?</h4><p>Over the past year, while visiting many establishments in the areas where tourism is thriving, I have noted that conservation is key. For example, people such as Paul Tudor Jones, who has maintained an amazing part of the Serengeti for years, are working to support the cause. The kind of conservation work that he has done and the type of wildlife present in that area are very different from what can been seen in various areas of the national park. There are other examples of investors interested in this area who are promoting tourism and conservation. In those areas, the grass is green and the wildlife is plentiful and diverse. To me, private investors do very well in terms of conservation. They provide facilities for the area and use their own money to protect it. In the case of Paul Tudor Jones, he is subject to a quota for the amount of wildlife he can hunt, whether it's lions, elephants, or zebras—but he never hunts. He is one of the best and an excellent example of the kind of investor we appreciate. I believe that it is important to have people who invest in tourism while simultaneously helping to conserve it. Paul Tudor Jones has his own client base of tourists, with a number of them celebrities that invest and promote tourism. They inject funds toward policing the areas with anti-poaching measures, thereby helping the government to promote preservation of the flora and fauna.</p><h4>What would be your ideal relationship with foreign investors?</h4><p>In the past, the business community believed that the government was its enemy. We are aggressively working to reverse that perception. My philosophy is very simple—the government cannot do business, and especially in a delicate sector like tourism. There are plenty of people with the resources to lead the industry, and the government's role should be to ensure that the appropriate laws and regulations are in place. Even with those laws and regulations, the government should not dictate. Instead, the involvement and participation of the private sector is necessary, because once those laws are passed, the private sector is the one that has to live with them—not the government. The government is simply implementing the laws. In terms of making the atmosphere in the industry conducive to doing business, the involvement of private actors is crucial. As long as investors lack confidence in the institutions, they will not invest. That is why the business community in the tourism industry cannot be composed of government players. Since I have been in my current position, this has been my main focus. For example, I conduct regular meetings with members of the private sector. I meet with the Tourism Confederation of Tanzania every quarter, and I am working to make the tourism industry easier to participate in. I am facing a situation where people explain that even though they wanted to go through the processes of constructing a branded hotel, for whatever reason, it did not work. Instead, they often go to Rwanda and claim that permission was granted in two days, and in Kenya perhaps only three. These entrepreneurs are installing infrastructure and building hotels, something that could support generations. This is what I and a number of others are seeking to improve upon. Tourists expect a certain level of quality when they arrive in Tanzania and the infrastructure needs to be there.</p><div class="quote">“Tourism is an important sector and a huge contributor to Tanzania's Vision 2025 goal."</div><h4>How will the tourism industry contribute to Tanzania's Development 2025 Vision?</h4><p>I believe that if there is a particular sector that can contribute immensely to the Tanzanian goal of attaining the status of a middle-income country, it is definitely tourism. This is the sector that has been the leading foreign exchange generator in this country for years. However, tourism also makes a substantial contribution to the GDP of the country, and only recently has mining overtaken it. My belief is that if we can attract good players—and I am confident that we can—Tanzania can absolutely overcome obstacles blocks and lead the way for the opening up of the country. The tourists coming contribute to the economy, but the domino effect is the benefits other small businesses get from that activity. In order to expand the sector, we must re-focus our efforts. Our tourism has focused very much on wildlife, but we also have beautiful beaches. However, there is very little awareness of Tanzania's beaches. People know about the Caribbean islands and Mexico, and beach tourism generates fantastic tourism revenue. Kenya and Mombasa, for example, have hotels and resorts that are associated with beach tourism. The issue now is that the tourists who come to Tanzania see it as a place to go on safari for one or two days and then leave. Yes, tourism is an important sector and a huge contributor to Tanzania's Vision 2025 goal, but the potential is what makes the industry so attractive and interesting. There is enormous room for growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the university, and how does it fit into the wider Anahuac University network?<br></h4><p>At the time of Anahuac University's inception, education in Mexico offered huge opportunities for the private sector because the public education system was below standard. In 1954, we established a private K-12 school called Instituto Cumbres, with the goal of helping the country educate its future leaders. We devoted all of our efforts—money we collected with the support of a huge fundraising division—and gathered entrepreneurs, scientists, and education experts to start the school. We wanted to start a college in 1955, but we didn't have enough students, funding, or land. It wasn't until 1964 that we had the chance to purchase a piece of land that is now called Interlomas. With the help of donations from foundations and individuals, we began building a provisional university, which attracted people with a common idea to form a new generation of leaders. In 2014, it will mark our 50-year anniversary, which we are actively preparing for. Since 1983, this campus has rested upon 24 hectares. At the Mexico Norte campus, we have an additional 20 hectares. Our thought process was that Mexico is so huge that it is necessary to operate at two different locations. We have also expanded the number of high schools and K-12 schools across the city. In Mexico City, we operate 52 schools and two colleges.</p><h4>How are local universities attempting to connect higher education to the country's industrial development needs?</h4><p>We were very fortunate because our main benefactors and their children are alumni; we have a close connection to people in business, industry, and health care. Our tradition at Anuhuac has long been based on medicine; we fundraise with people in the healthcare sector, and we have developed a close friendship with many medical professionals. In addition, the school selects a handful of the main business people in Mexico to comment on how we should be teaching our students. We offer eight different degrees in business and economics. Another important department is tourism, for which we offer programs in tourism administration and gastronomy. We maintain the vision that many of our friends, benefactors, and main business partners work in the field of tourism. The university also has a vision to shape great entrepreneurs and business people through degrees in fields such as economics, international business, marketing, and business administration.</p><h4>How has the increasingly competitive and dynamic market changed the education sector?</h4><p>The competition has become very tough. Anuhuac  University was initially successful because there was a large amount of wealthy families that could afford to pay private tuition at the time of our establishment. Most of the private universities in the 1970s and 1980s were doing well; more people were willing to pay for the private education that we could offer. Every institution grew significantly during that time. During the crisis between 1987 and 1995, we experienced some problems. After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed, the high-income segment of the population started to dissipate. With the treaty, we began to see more balance in the economy of Mexico, and the social gaps were closing. Gradually, fewer people were able to afford private school tuition. At the same time, public education had a lot of room for improvement, and the government began to open technical universities. We followed suit, and over a period of seven years we enrolled approximately 15,000 students. One reason why the private education sector experienced tougher competition is because of the costs associated with ensuring quality, building facilities, attracting high-degree teachers, and paying the appropriate salaries. Although there is huge competition in Mexico, it is beneficial because each school is forced to aim for the best and introduce more options, new degrees, and different ways of educating young people.</p><div class="quote">“Although there is huge competition in Mexico, it is beneficial because each school is forced to aim for the best."</div>]]></richbody0content>

What will be the initial strategy in order to support this?<br></h4><p>The main objective of this administration is to make Mexico the leading country in tourism through the recognition that tourism is the lever and key factor in the economic development of the country. We will do this by diversifying our tourism products with the end target of developing new markets. We will pick up the momentum in those areas, take advantage of touristic resources, and offer our support to those that are more competitive at the national and international levels. In Mexico, it should be noted that tourism is respected. By preserving our natural, cultural, and social environment, we are making attempts to avoid the negative impacts tourism can cause.<br></p><h4>Tourism represents about 13% of the country's GDP. What are the important points of Mexico as a center of regional tourism?</h4><p>Tourism in Mexico is one of the most powerful engines of development. We have a great variety of attractions such as beaches, colonial cities, natural scenery, cultural diversity, and ancient history that make Mexico unique. We also have high-quality infrastructure and touristic services, and, above all else, our extraordinarily warm human resources. Travelers will see Mexico as a warm country that always receives tourists with open arms. It is a place that, thanks to its diversity, variety, and offerings, satisfies the demands and necessities of its visitors with high-quality touristic products.</p><h4>Would you say that there is still an existing misconception about the security situation in Mexico?</h4><p>As part of the competitive agenda, we know that public security is an essential component for tourism to flourish. President Peña Nieto has instructed us to present an integrated security program for tourists. We are working with the Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB) to generate schemes for public security in touristic destinations, which have their own dynamics, because there is a constant flow of people that some spaces cannot necessarily accommodate. Thus, we need to devise specific and preventive strategies. We are working closely with the Sub-Secretary of Prevention at SEGOB so that the Program of National Social Prevention of Violence and Delinquency aligns with the development and incorporation of our strategies once implemented in tourism places. Ideally, we want to achieve preventative schemes that will work in touristic destinations so that we will not have security problems. One example is the campaign that we conducted alongside several agencies during the Easter break in 2013, which produced   magnificent results. We are also generating security protocols for specific touristic destinations and working closely with the states and municipalities to collaborate on specific protocols that respond to public safety issues. Through this teamwork, we are working to ensure that all tourist destinations have similar protocols of action and that the police are working together to enforce our decisions.</p><div class="quote">“Tourism is one of the principal engines of economic, regional, communal, and national development."</div><p>Furthermore, we are seeking ways to implement a better public information scheme that is also appropriate for tourists, in addition to public security. We have to establish public traffic rules in all of Mexico's most popular destinations, and ensure that our public servants can speak the languages of the tourists. We are also working with emergency responders on how to pay specific attention to tourists and ensuring the proximity of police, hospitals, and any other services that tourists might need. This component of security is integral to what we are developing in the Secretariat with the help of states and municipalities, but also with international specialists and the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which is working extensively with the integrated security concept. Security perceptions differ among tourists at different destinations, and we tailor our programs according to the feedback we receive in various locations rather than the general security concerns in Mexico. As a country, we are seeking to communicate and be perceived as an effective responder when there are incidents, thereby approaching international standards.</p><h4>In what ways would you like to see the tourism offering become more diversified in Mexico?</h4><p>The diversification of our offering is an opportunity that Mexico has to attract market niches that have not yet been seen in our country. It is about going beyond the specialization of some touristic destinations and creating synergies among the distinct sectors. In this way, we can meet expectations and supply the demands of distinct segments of “sun and beach" tourists. However, in the last couple of years, there has been a new wave of new activities in the areas of cultural tourism, MICE, eco-tourism, and adventure tourism, to name a few. As we continue to finalize our diversification of tourism offerings, we are bringing variety and attracting visitors from emerging markets such as South America, Europe, and Asia, which represent great potential for Mexico, without neglecting the fixed markets of Canada and the US.</p><h4>What are the principal challenges that need to be addressed so that Mexico can optimize its potential as a tourism center?</h4><p>One of the principal challenges is changing the image of Mexico in the eyes of the world. We need to create a more positive image. Another challenge for the current administration is the innovation and diversification of tourism products in order to compete internationally. We need to provide more tools, carry out more programs and policies, and support organizations and companies as they become more competitive. We are also aiming to boost new tourist destinations without neglecting the already-consolidated ones, amplify what they offer, and increase the country's infrastructure in order to convert it into a world-class destination. In addition, we are working to design tourism offerings that are adequate for our visitors through strategic planning combined with public and private management. To attract investments into the sector, we are creating confidence among companies and making tourism a source of welfare for the community.</p><h4>What is your prediction for 2013?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the principal engines of economic, regional, communal, and national development. It is a sector that represents opportunities for the Mexican youth and women and represents prosperity for the country. The sector can also function as a powerful instrument that generates opportunities and fights poverty, which is something the current administration is working on intensely. We seek to make our destinations more competitive and transform our offering to meet the parameters of sustainability and high quality. This will be our new objective in 2013. We will also work on a crosscutting agenda in the government, aiming to build the conditions for competitiveness and serve as facilitators for the private sector. It is necessary to modernize and move the tourism industry toward breaking inertia. With that, we will succeed in making our tourism industry the most competitive in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your incoming strategy to support the government's ambitious tourism efforts?<br></h4><p>Tourism activity is strategic for the entire country, and I would like to remind people that Miguel Ángel Manzera, when taking possession of his new position as governor of Mexico City in December 2012, was the first authority to state that he would make the development of the tourism sector one of his main strategic ambitions. A month later, we had already formalized such ambitious plans with a sector agreement. I was asked to put together the best team of professionals to accomplish the government's goals. One of our main priorities is to reduce the bureaucratic process and any legal hurdles, as well as to make sure we all are in the same boat. Mexico City is the most visited tourism destination in the country with 12.3 million tourists per year, and 19% of them are foreigners. In this context, 35% of the foreign tourists come, mainly, from the US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain, the UK, France, Italy, and Germany. At the same time, we have seen a sharp increase in the number of Russian tourists coming to Mexico City. Overall, foreign tourists spend $4 billion, and the Mexican population benefits from such activity with around Ps57 billion. However, Quintana Roo is the leading destination in the country in terms of foreign visitors. Today, tourism represents 8% of the city's GDP, and generates around 1 million jobs. Some other interesting facts are that the city has 605 hotels that currently offer 49,400 beds, and the average occupancy rate stands at 65%, a little over the national average (58%). In this context, most of our visitors come to the city during the week, for they are here for business purposes. For that reason, we need to increase the overall number of visitors during the weekends by promoting our historical sites, monuments, and gastronomy. According to Forbes, we are the fourth gastronomic destination worldwide, and we are the second city in the world in terms of the largest network of museums, only behind London. At the same time, we feel the need to integrate the tourism products Mexico City offers. These are our main short-term goals, and I believe that in the near future, we will also benefit from better bilateral relations with the US and Canada. In this context, we plan to implement a very ambitious marketing and PR campaign at both the national and international level to make sure that everybody knows about how much the country has changed. I would also like to praise the great work the authorities have carried out by making key areas of the city available for tourism purposes, which has enabled authorities to restore areas of the city and change their image. This entire strategy will contribute to consolidate the position of Mexico City as the gateway to the entire country. We believe we can attract larger numbers of foreign tourists, especially from Russia and China, and that will help us to bring up the overall number of visitors to over 12.5 million per year.</p><h4>What do you think is the best strategy to improve security perceptions in Mexico City among the international community?</h4><p>Security is a national and international priority, and Mexico City enjoys high levels of security, as proven by recent trends of Mexican people moving to the big city. In addition, we have an extensive network of security people and CCTV professionals working 24/7. The crime rate in Mexico affects nine in 100,000 people, and that is rather low as compared to many metropolitan areas. However, the security stigma and international image is over-exaggerated because of many media reports, among other things. For that reason, we invite people to come here and find out for themselves.</p><h4>What is the potential behind the MICE tourism segment for Mexico and how can that contribute to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>We have five multi-function conference centers, two of them at the highest international level. Over the last few years, we have become a more relevant MICE destination, jumping into the international rankings to the top 30. We have experienced an important growth in the number of such events held in the city. Our mission now is to diversify this product from a cultural and social point of view in order to become more competitive.</p><div class="quote">“Security is a national and international priority."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the background of the Mexican Institute of Public Accountants (IMCP)?<br></h4><p>IMCP is a national federation that was founded in 1923. It is composed of 60 professional associations that bring together more than 20,000 Mexican accountants. We are an institution that focuses on providing the best services to its associates and affiliates, while making sure that the guild is driven by higher quality accounting standards. In 1977, we achieved the title of a national federation, and for over 20 years we have developed educational programs with national certificates issued by our institution. In 1998, we were the sole institution in Mexico to be able to certify professional accountants. We achieved the implementation of a unique national exam for those who want to become accountants. For over 30 years, we have been behind the implementation of a regulatory body for the accounting profession. In such a global world, the IMCP is an active and recognized member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFA), and we have established and maintained ties with the main authorities and institutions, both at the national and international level. We have to keep in mind that we are an unaffiliated institution; we don't belong to any of the Mexican political parties.</p><h4>What are the main services that you provide to your members today?</h4><p>We are an eminently social organism that seeks as its main purpose to meet the professional and human needs of its members, and we work for the guild's recognition while maintaining the highest professional and ethical standards. We aim at unifying the process at the national level, especially regulations, and we work to promote the implementation of federal accounting laws. For example, we handled a report on the application of the new tax reform. We are also a consulting body that provides advice to its members, and work as well as a promotional institution to raise awareness of our profession and the regulatory body that affects our guild.</p><h4>How is IMCP contributing to developing new regulatory and ethical frameworks?</h4><p>From our institution, we believe that the current tax framework in Mexico is outdated and needs an urgent national reform. In this regard, the IMCP has 10 different vice-presidencies. A vice-presidency is composed of several sub-committees that include some of the most recognized professionals in the guild. They develop an in-depth report on a potential new tax regulatory framework for the country, which we have already handed to the authorities. At the same time, we promoted the implementation of a new and common accounting process for all of Mexico's states and municipalities, which we were doing before their accounting notes while working independently from each other. That will definitely bring more financial harmonization to the country.</p><h4>How has the IMCP's work impacted other Mexican institutions?</h4><p>Our work speaks of our commitment and contribution to the development of Mexican society. We believe that by implementing the highest international and ethical standards in the development of our profession, as well as spreading our experience across the country, we positively contribute to the development of many spheres within Mexican society. In addition, we keep in mind the several educational programs we implement nationwide, as well as the certification of national accounting practices in Mexico and the counseling services we provide to companies.</p><h4>What do you think Mexico needs to do to optimize its potential for growth in the future?</h4><p>From a macroeconomic perspective, Mexico is a very stable country and is among the very few countries in the world that has a healthy financial status. Mexico's economy is very strong and solid. However, I believe that Mexico needs to push forward with several key reforms. For example, tax reform, energy reform, and a second round of labor reform. Such reforms are key for our country, and I am convinced that with these reforms,  Mexico will have a very important economic boom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[trust-amidst-risks]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the principal findings of the 16th Annual Global CEO Survey?<br></h4><p>The results of PwC's 16th Annual Global CEO Survey indicate that at the global level, the short-term scenario is not pleasing for CEOs; however, the results for the medium term are a bit better. The CEOs of companies based in countries and regions facing a less-than-favorable business environment are those who reported the lowest percentages of trust, as in the case of the EU, where only 22% of CEOs acknowledged feeling confident, and also from the US, with only 30% of CEOs in that condition. Furthermore, this year's optimism has not created contagious excitement among the CEOs of China (40%) and Brazil (44%), two countries that in the last few years have experienced growth rates above the world average. In the survey, the most noticeable deviation were the opinions of CEOs from Russia, India, and Mexico, since 66% of Russians, 63% of Indians, and 62% of Mexicans said that they were very confident in meeting their objectives within their business in the short term. The optimism and confidence of our CEOs manifested in the Global CEO Survey, in its fourth year in Mexico, and it is not the first time that trust is almost equal in the short term (62%) than in the medium term (61%), yet it is really something that had not been registered before. High levels of confidence from our CEOs should not be a surprise to anyone, since they are consistent with the general tone of expectation surrounding the Mexican economy.</p><h4>What is Mexico doing right?</h4><p>If you ask this question to the authorities of the Secretary of Finance or the Banco de México, they will most likely answer by focusing on highlighting the virtues of fiscal and monetary discipline, which has ensured the country's macroeconomic stability and secured the wellbeing of the national banking and financial system. In the last two years, the Mexican economy has sailed with favorable winds. The decelerated economy and exports of China—our main competitor—are creating spaces that are opening larger opportunities for Mexican products, and not only in NAFTA markets, but throughout the American continent, Europe, and Africa. But beyond global, regional, and national levels of macroeconomics, the Mexican situation has other favorable elements, such as having one of the strongest, orderly political transitions and a new correlation of power in legislative positions.</p><h4>What factors have helped to build the trust exhibited by international firms that choose to locate regional head offices here in Mexico?</h4><p>The trust is based on export activities and direct investment to operate in diverse, regional markets. For example, the companies in the automobile sector, like Nissan and General Motors, the Mexican platforms of which export hundreds of thousands of vehicles every year to more than 100 countries, have far exceeded the slowing NAFTA markets. Some global Mexican companies, such as Bimbo, Gruma, and others, also have a presence in dozens of countries throughout five continents. For companies of this magnitude, as tested, solid business models, the slow growth of the Mexican economy, the stagnation of nations in the eurozone, and the slowing US market will always mean bad news and can be alarming, yet it is not a reason to become disappointed and give up on growth objectives.</p><h4>As part of the Survey, 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with the CEOs of large domestic companies and multinationals with operations in Mexico. What were the outcomes of these interviews?</h4><p>Some were skeptical in regards to the new Mexican “boom," and they warned us about the risk our country is facing as a result of its overexposure to international financial markets and getting caught in a trap. Others see that the Mexico brand is exaggerated; that the macroeconomic fundamentals of our country seem very good now, but not because they have really improved, but because the fundamentals of the rest of the world have fallen. The new PRI government recognizes the qualities needed to govern this country such as ability, resourcefulness, pragmatism, political skills, and determination, but it's also concerned about history. Our CEOs perceive that this situation is one of the best our country has showed in a long time and it would be unforgivable to waste it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Mexico's role as a gateway for the biotech industry been developing?<br></h4><p>Mexico is very well positioned to be a gateway, especially in the pharmaceutical arena, for three reasons. First of all is market value; we are the second largest market in Latin America. Mexico is the number one manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in Latin America and a huge exporter. Mexico is also a great center for R&amp;D investments, especially in terms of development. Second is innovation; Mexico is a part of the growth of biotech. The pharmaceuticals industry is growing by 3% annually and biotech is growing by around 25%. The reason for this explosive growth is the heavy investment in R&amp;D, coupled with the discovery of the human genome, which are leading investigations toward very targeted therapies. If we know the underlying causes and pathways of diseases by understanding how the genome may trigger them, we can target them better. The previous ways of treating diseases won't disappear, but they will be complemented by biotech. The third reason that Mexico is leading the way is through regulations. We have one of the best regulatory systems in the region, which has just been implemented in the last 18 months.</p><h4>How is certification helping to develop the industry?</h4><p>Mexico has been very active in making sure that we leverage our Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) certification with other PAHO countries to establish recognition or equivalence agreements. Today, Mexico has equivalence agreements with five agencies: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA),  and the Swiss, Canadian, and Australian agencies. This means that pharmaceutical companies that want to introduce a new medication in Mexico will benefit from an expedited review if any of our partner agencies have approved the drug already. Instead of waiting 21 months for the product to be on the market, it will take just 90 days. This is a hugely positive development, supporting innovation, technology, and access.</p><h4>How much of a barrier to growth do access issues remain?</h4><p>Access means ensuring that the product is available to the majority of the population. In Mexico, this involves a three-step process, and the first part is regulatory. COFEPRIS evaluates whether a drug is safe and effective before proceeding to step two. Then, the product needs to get into the National Basic Formulary. The third step is getting into the public health institutions' Basic Formulary. I believe that Mexico has sped up this process over the past two years, especially in the regulatory step. There are opportunities for improvement in steps two and three of the process and the reasons are at least two-fold. One is that there is a lot of cost containment in institutions. Their vision on innovation is cost, and we need to shift the mindset away from the cost of the product to the cost of the disease in the long run. For example, the cost of a patient in the hospital, who has cancer and is in the ICU with doctors, nurses, and physicians, is much higher than treating the patient with an innovative treatment. Another reason access is limited is the duplication associated with the processes. In the National Basic Formulary, if a product is approved, it is listed. This does not mean that institutions will start purchasing the product; before this, the same listing process has to be repeated in every institution, which is a duplication of efforts and a delay in access. We need to look at examples worldwide, such as in the EU or the US, where once a product is listed in the National Basic Formulary, you have access to public health institutions. This does not mean that the institutions are going to buy the product, as this depends on their budgets, but the product is listed in their Basic Formulary. The Mexican system can be improved. Considering our ranking in the OECD in terms of innovation reaching the patient, Mexico's position is very low. It simply takes too long. The timeline for everything happening during step two and three could take three or four years if the company is lucky.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently celebrated your 30-year history of operations in Mexico. How has the journey been?<br></h4><p>The company was created on the basis of three pillars: patient care, medical research, and medical education. We believe all three pillars are critical for patient care. Most of our physicians are researchers and teachers. Médica Sur is one of  the top institutions in Mexico, including government hospitals, in terms of medical research. The first oncology center was created by Médica Sur in 1993, with the view that patients would be treated for all aspects associated with oncology, such as psychology and nutrition. That program is recognized internationally. Another example of differentiation is in the area of neurosurgery. We have a gamma knife, which is a medical device that will destroy a tumor in the head without performing surgery. It works via radiation and is a very unique system. In preventive medicine, we have 30% to 40% more tests than any other private hospital in Mexico, for about the same price or less than other private hospitals charge. Médica Sur was formed with the belief that people should have access to the best physicians, medicines, and equipment at a fair price.</p><h4>How has the private healthcare industry evolved and to what extent have those gaps that existed in the industry been closed?</h4><p>The private hospitals in Mexico fulfill the need for patients looking for high-quality patient care. Most of them are covered by state social security. Typically, if you have social security, you still go into the private healthcare system, because waiting times are shorter. Also, as far as the availability of equipment and treatment go, the government has a number of very nice centers, but most of them are concentrated in the big cities, so depending on where you live, you may not have access. The other factor is the evolution of insurance schemes for medical insurance coverage. Today, coverage reaches about 6% of the population. We are talking about major medical coverage and expenses, so that is close to 6 million people. There is still room for improvement.</p><h4>How competitive is Mexico as a destination for medical tourism and what kind of innovations has Médica Sur brought to the market in that respect?</h4><p>I think we are just starting to tap the opportunity. The opportunity lies in having Mexico as a possibility for reimbursement from Medicare. Eventually, if social security in the US accepts Mexican hospitals, that will be a huge opportunity. Right now, there is a good market, although it has been challenged by security issues, especially along the border. I think that will improve in the next few years. We will continue to focus our efforts on the quality of patient care. We are very serious about quality. Right now, we are in the process of recertification with the local certification agency. In terms of certification for medical tourism, we will be working with the Joint Commission International from the US over the next few months.</p><h4>How well evolved is the medical industry's regulatory environment in Mexico today?</h4><p>In the case of medical tourism, the local government has been very supportive in terms of creating relationships and connecting the dots between the US and Mexico. In fact, we were invited by the Secretariat of Health to an event in Chicago to establish connections with insurance companies and develop them. It is also supporting the development of websites and internet activities and participating in events in the US to promote the use of Mexico City as a location. In the regulatory environment, the law changed in regard to the certification of hospitals. It changed in 2011 to be more in line with US requirements. The requirements are tighter. It is tough for hospitals to comply with the regulations, but we believe they are heading in the right direction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mexico's football infrastructure developed in recent years?<br></h4><p>Mexico has extraordinary facilities in terms of football, and every year we have lots of interest from national clubs to build new stadiums. Right now, we have state-of-the-art stadiums in Guadalajara and Torreón, Tijuana is coming along with a new stadium, Monterrey has already started to build its own facility, and some other clubs made some key investments in 2011 due to the FIFA U-17 World Cup. In fact, we are in a phase of facility renovation and have built new infrastructure in Puebla in preparation for the CONCACAF U-20 World Cup Qualifiers, which Mexico hosted in February 2013. One of the main targets of the MX League and MX Ascenso, the main two leagues in our country, is to unify criteria and facilities among teams taking part in these championships, including press rooms, dressing rooms, facilities for the fans, benches, and so on. Obviously, this program is driving investment and the development of Mexican football. To be able to host any large sporting event, you must have infrastructure in terms of venues, logistics, and operations.</p><h4>How optimistic are you about Mexico's chances of hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>Today, being in the run up to host a World Cup is very tough—competition among very large economic powers is hard. Nowadays, a 10-year-old stadium is considered old by FIFA, and investment in infrastructure such as stadiums, roads, accommodation, training facilities, and security is guided by very high standards. However, Mexico is highly committed to the global football family. Right now, we are in the process of analyzing the viability and future chances of hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p><h4>What are the main steps that need to be overcome in order for Mexico to become successful in its bid?</h4><p>Infrastructure is the key element in any bid; if you don't have high-standard facilities to comply with FIFA's guidelines, you do not have a chance. Additionally, government economic and infrastructure support is also required. A partnership in terms of the organization with the federal and state governments needs to be arranged in order to be able to provide high-quality services for the football family and other visitors.</p><h4>What sort of partnerships have you been developing to build sponsorship support for Mexican football?</h4><p>We have five major commercial partners: Adidas, Banamex, Coca-Cola, Maseca, and Movistar. With their economic support, we have been able to develop many nationwide programs, such as a youth program to improve the facilities of the FMF, a high-performance center, and youth dormitories both for men and women. In the past, we used to work with an outsourcing company to develop our marketing and commercial strategies. However, nine years ago we started up an in-house marketing department that has enabled us to work closer with our partners. Overall, in the last few years we have become closer to football fans. Nevertheless, there is a lot to be done.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the football industry in 2013?</h4><p>Together with Brazil, we were the only countries in the world that have taken part in all of the international football competitions in 2012, including men's and women's football, beach football, and futsal. The current year will be filled with lots of activity for Mexico. We have FIFA qualifiers against the US, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, and Jamaica, and we will attend both the FIFA Confederations Cup and the CONCACAF Gold Cup. We will host the CONCACAF U-20 Men's competition, and we will have international qualifiers for youth national teams abroad. We are also organizing the second edition of the Mexico Nations Cup, which is an U-15 invitation tournament. There is no doubt that Mexico will go to all these international events with the right mentality to try to win, for we have proven to ourselves and to the world that Mexico can do it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have had a long and successful career in a number of industries. How did you end up in the aviation business?</h4><p>I wanted to do something new that had a solid future. There were no local airlines in Mexico with jet engines and wide-bodied airplanes, so I began to study airlines all over the world from Europe to the US. They were all completely different. Some airlines were crowded, had old planes, bad maintenance, served poor quality food if any, and treated people badly. Those kinds of flights are cheap, yet my idea was to offer high quality at a low price. I wanted the best airplanes with the best service and the best pilots. Starting up any business has many challenges, and launching a new airline is an even more difficult process. We began to examine costs, including each airport's individual taxes. If a new airline begins operations at an airport with eight or nine flights, you pay expenses on all of them. These costs are higher if the airport is new or underserved, as the costs then increase. Additional costs are not usually included in the ticket price, but I wanted everything to be included and clear. I told my colleagues I was going to avoid intermediaries and allow the customers greater flexibility to go online by themselves, buy a ticket, and then change the ticket according to their needs at no further expense if necessary. This strategy began to work and all of a sudden we were doing well. The market discovered us and we discovered a new segment of the market that was not into air travel before. We later added a customer loyalty program for miles traveled based on a cash back bonus rather than the traditional model, as we realized that was more appealing to customers. Also, we provided a separate toilet for ladies in the cabin, which has been very successful. Our planes are spacious and provide plenty of legroom. If the passenger in front of you reclines, then you do not get disturbed.</p><h4>What has been the strategy behind providing a quality product while adopting a low-cost, low-fare business model?</h4><p>First, we bought new planes to lessen  our maintenance costs. However, we developed our own maintenance center in Toluca City, which can service a wide variety of planes from Boeing to small warplanes, too. We are now working to team up with Lufthansa as a partner in this maintenance hub. I admire Lufthansa in the way it maintains its aircraft, and I think this venture would be very interesting for us. The business is doing well, and today we are servicing planes from Argentina, the US, and some Central American countries. We are happy with our progress as the business has grown as large as the airline itself. It is a good fit, and it saves us money in the long run. We have also recently selected a new airplane for short distance flight—the Sukhoi Superjet-100. It is a combination of European technologies that is originally a Russian airplane and a wide body with a capacity for 100 passengers. Its engines are made in France and the US, and all its technical and navigation instruments are from the US and Europe. The interior decoration was designed by Pininfarina in Italy. The performance is fantastic. Its engines consume nearly 15% less fuel and it lowers carbon emissions into the atmosphere by 80%, which is very good news. It creates less noise and can fly into any airport. We are going to use it for short flights from Mexico City to Querétaro, Acapulco, Puebla, and other nearby routes.</p><h4>How do you intend to expand on the successful introduction of international routes at the end of 2012?</h4><p>After comparing several routes, we decided to fly to Orange County in the US. Besides local demand, it is only 40 minutes from Los Angeles. It is also 50 minutes to Disneyland and five minutes to Costa Mesa, which has the largest mall in the US and is a place where Mexicans and passengers from other Latin American countries love to shop. I think we will be well received there. Our Las Vegas route is popular on weekends for many people from Mexico. We also run flights to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. We are not going to go to Europe for a couple of years, but Canada is in our plans.</p><h4>The year 2011 was described as a break out year for Interjet. What characterized the success?</h4><p>We have to be very careful with timing, and it requires vision to know when to make the right moves. That is why we chose that year to expand our frontiers and go international. That was before Mexicana had serious problems and collapsed into a legal, labor, and financial impasse. However, in support of the needs of our local market, and with the authorization of our civil aviation authorities, we have been serving passengers on some of its routes. At some point, Mexicana will have to be handed back to private investors to attempt once again to make a successful comeback, but it will take some time recover customer confidence and fly as many passengers as we do. That is why we are trying to consolidate our position in the local market as much as possible. I do not worry about being the biggest. For us, quality is far more important. This has always been the core goal of our strategy.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Interjet? Where would you like to see the company in five years?</h4><p>It has been a hard job to start up. In less than five years, we could make Interjet one of the best airlines in Mexico. First, we have to make it a reality in our own country before we can compete with others internationally. The main problem has been communications in Mexico because the topography of the country is very complex. Nevertheless, it can be done. Italy succeeded in building tunnels and bridges, and something similar needs to be done here, too. Air travel is free of most security concerns, and the country now needs more airports and much better road and transport infrastructure and services. Through airports you can get where you are going faster and more safely. This is one way aviation has proven to assist in the development of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell me about how the sophistication of connectivity between the wider region and Mexico has been improving?</h4><p>Connectivity is improving little by little, especially in land transportation. There are new technologies, such as multi-modal systems, that are now available in Mexico. I believe that connectivity is heading in the right direction, and although we still need to improve, we are doing very well in that respect. In terms of maritime transportation, we are strong on the offshore side. Regarding container shipping, we are working on a new project that should be launched in 2013. This project will allow cargo to move between Mexican ports, which we feel is very important if we are to reap the benefits of the larger sized vessels. This will make the transportation of containers and general cargo much easier. The new government is very interested in this project, and we are truly looking forward to completing it. The project is commissioned by TMM, and we are working with several ports on the Pacific Ocean. If we are successful, the project will move to the Gulf of Mexico as well. We are aiming to take advantage of the long distances between the north and south of Mexico. Currently, the movement of cargo is carried out by trucks, and we believe it would be much more advantageous to move cargo via maritime routes instead. We are planning to combine the road and railroad transportation with our maritime services to provide a more efficient service and boost revenues.</p><h4>What benefits can you offer customers by providing maritime transportation services as opposed to road transportation?</h4><p>Maritime transportation incurs lower costs compared to trucks. We are moving more cargo at a lower price, but we do need to focus more attention on the ports in order to be competitive. Our main focus is on pricing in terms of the international market. If you look at European ports, they offer special prices in order to be more efficient versus land cargo transportation. We have to work hard to persuade clients to switch to maritime transportation when possible, and once they learn the benefits of this service, we are certain they will stay with us. We have been researching services all over the world, and customers are following this trend. The cost for repairing and making new roads is very high, while the maintenance of water routes is free. There is also an advantage on the environmental side, because the contamination involved with the use of maritime vessels is much lower than using trucks.</p><h4>If proposed energy reforms are implemented, do you foresee significant opportunities for GRUPO TMM?</h4><p>Everyone in Mexico would benefit from such a situation. In our case, there would be an excellent opportunity to participate in business lines that are currently controlled by PEMEX. We feel that if these options are opened up to the private sector, the quality of services will improve drastically. Of course, prices will also fall, and we see many advantages there. We hope that the new reforms President Peña Nieto is promoting become a reality as soon as possible so that we can reap the benefits. The past reforms were not bad, but they were incomplete. Something additional needs to be done in order to truly boost the industry.</p><div class="quote">“We are moving more cargo at a lower price, but we need to focus more attention on the ports."</div><h4>What are the main challenges facing the evolution of the industry?</h4><p>On the chemicals side, the main challenge is the infrastructure of the industry, which always requires more efficient transportation to reduce costs. We are facing competition from China, which is producing in Mexico. There is a lot of pressure on us to be more efficient. On the tanker side, the competition we face is PEMEX itself. The company has decided to buy its own ships, and there is only a small gap for the market to fill. We believe that PEMEX has not conducted a proper study of the benefits associated with owning its own ships, as opposed to using those of private-sector companies, because we feel that we work much more efficiently and can offer lower costs for these types of vessels. On the offshore side, the main problem is for PEMEX to acquire the rigs or platforms for production, and that will require more vessels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the efficiency and sophistication of the northeast railroad developed since you established your presence here?</h4><p>We have come a long way. Before it was privatized, the Mexican railway network moved approximately 19% of all cargo. In the 15 years that we have been in Mexico, the rail industry is now moving around 25% of the country's freight. This can only be done by making the service and operations of the railroad more efficient. We have been able to do that by investing in infrastructure. We have invested a great deal of money into getting the most modern locomotive fleet in Mexico. We have been adding more cars and adding new systems that help us control our trains and administer our freight, cargo, and business sectors.</p><h4>To what extent are you continuing to invest in upgrading your terminals?</h4><p>We have not only upgraded our terminals, but we have built new terminals and bought existing ones, such as in Puerta México near Toluca. We bought it three years ago as well as Inter-Puerto in San Luis. We built Salinas Victoria in Monterrey, and we are ready to invest in our terminal in Nuevo Laredo, which is called Estación Sánchez. We are in the process of acquiring a piece of land to build a new yard in Lázaro Cárdenas. This has completed what we call the “International Terminal Corridors," which runs from Lázaro Cárdenas all the way to Kansas City; connecting these terminals with the existing ones in Houston and Kansas City.</p><h4>You have significantly increased your customer base. What factors have led to this?</h4><p>I would like to think that because we are becoming more efficient, we are better. But also, the market is growing in different aspects. We have also established a security system that places us above our competitors and other means of transportation. That has also helped us in gaining other customers. We have an equation that gives us a security rate of 99.98%. This means that we have had only 0.02% in security incidents along our network. We would like to have zero, but 0.02% is still a small amount.</p><h4>Would a high-speed freight rail network improve efficiency of the industry?</h4><p>The equipment that we have can go at higher speeds than we are doing right now, but the speeds are determined by the authorities—the Secretariat of Communications and Transport—according to the area, the course, the topography, and the conditions of the track. There are areas where we can go 90 km/h and there are areas with 40 km/h, all the way down to 10 km/h. What we have been doing by improving our network and track is trying to get larger high-speed areas so we can increase our velocity average. When you increase the velocity average, you increase your efficiency and security. Velocity average is the most important factor. This is key for any railroad and for any means of transportation, but for railroads especially. In Mexico, there are many mountains; we have shorter distances and smaller volumes. So, we are trying to be more efficient, but there will be a limit.</p><h4>What steps remain to be taken to improve the efficiency of freight transport in and out of the country?</h4><p>I think the infrastructure is growing and we are investing, but the private sector and the authorities need to better coordinate in order to determine what the right infrastructure in each network is. This should not be a political decision. People must talk to us; we are  available and we know the exact needs of the sector. The second important point is to support not only the physical infrastructure, but also the regulatory infrastructure. We need to have a regulatory system that allows the railroad to be more efficient in many ways. There are different authorities involved in checking the trains, which need to be made more efficient.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ICA recently stated that annual infrastructure spending in Mexico may rise over 50% to $70 billion in the coming years. What changes do you expect to see in the short term?</h4><p>There are a few changes at the national level that will positively impact the sector, including the public-private-partnership (PPP) law, which creates a more efficient framework for private investment in infrastructure projects and a potential new reform in the energy sector that could also incentivize foreigners to come to Mexico for investment in this sector. In that respect, there are many opportunities for infrastructure development, including in the energy sector. It is for those reasons also that I believe infrastructure investments may increase up to $70 billion.</p><h4>In your opinion, how important will PPP activities be to Mexico's infrastructure growth?</h4><p>PPP investments will be key. There is a lot of investment capital out there, as well as plenty of players that understand the business perfectly, and they are willing to put their money to work in Mexico. It is just a matter of setting the rules. With Mexico's demographics, the need for infrastructure, and the country's competitive environment, PPPs will play a key role. In this regard, I believe we are headed in the right direction.</p><h4>In 2012, investors showed an increased confidence in ICA and your stock price went up by 43%. What factors contributed to this?</h4><p>The key for us has been to be more transparent with the financial markets. We have been able to change our approach to our investors, making management more accessible. The last seven years have been the most intense investment phase since the company was established 65 years ago. We have been investing heavily in roads, airports, water projects, and other infrastructure. Overall, I would say that investors better understand our long-term strategy, and they feel much more comfortable in this environment. In addition, we have strengthened our value drivers over the past six months. For example, investors didn't think that our housing unit was profitable as a stand-alone, and we recently partnered with one of the most important housing developers in Mexico, acquiring 23% of its shares. For ICA, the key elements in our strategy are efficiently deploying our technical capacities, transparency, and generating shareholder value, and these elements positively impact on investor trust and confidence.</p><div class="quote">“The key for us has been to be more transparent with the financial markets."</div><h4>What was the strategy behind selling most of your affordable housing assets?</h4><p>ICA sold most of its affordable housing developments and land reserves in exchange for 23% of the shares of a new company that has a clear track record and is likely to go public in the coming years. This business strategy clearly made sense because we didn't have a large enough market presence on our own in the Mexican housing market.  We are happy about how everything turned out, because the new company is regarded as one of the most successful enterprises in the industry.</p><h4>You recently bought a 51% stake in a Peruvian mining services company. What does this say about the company's interest in joint ventures in Latin America? What opportunities do you foresee for the company in the mining sector?</h4><p>We are a company focused on providing infrastructure solutions and our services are exportable. We have a clear international expansion strategy. We are very active in Panama; we have started operations in Colombia and Costa Rica; and we have been in Peru for a while now focused mainly on the home-building segment. We aim to increase our participation in providing construction services for mining projects abroad, because that is a natural extension of our company's skill set to a new sector. Construction services for the mining industry holds important growth potential for our company at the regional level. Overall, we expect to expand our international profile in the coming years, and we are already targeting countries such as the US, where we have already developed some projects. It is all part of a larger phase within the company, which aims to diversify the scope of ICA's activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico's market now in terms of the wider Cheminova Group?<br></h4><p>For our group, Mexico is one of the most important countries. The group is divided into regions, and we are considered a part of the Latin American region. Mexico is not only important in sales, but also in terms of profitability and cash generation. Brazil and Argentina are huge markets, and they are above Mexico in terms of sales. The Mexican company's importance to Cheminova is mainly in profitability and cash generation. Here in Mexico, we only tend to the local market and do not export. We mainly sell to distributors, which make up about 98% of our sales.</p><h4>How expansive is your agrochemical products portfolio and what kind of demand is there?</h4><p>We are strong in two different segments: insecticides and herbicides. We have several generic products and also some specialties, as well. In the case of insecticides, Cheminova owns a number of proprietary products, which are produced mainly in Denmark. We import them, formulate them here, and then sell them in the Mexican market. We have, for example, one compound that we own exclusively, called gamma-cyhalothrin, which is a powerful insecticide. Cheminova has no competitor in that area as it is a difficult product to manufacture. We are developing the business mainly with mixtures of different proprietary products and specialty formulations that are difficult for our competitors to copy. Another segment of the market is fungicides, although we offer only one product at present. Fortunately, that product is also unique. We are developing it for use in different markets, such as  for cotton and banana growers. It seems that it has a very good fit there, and we expect that in the next few years it will represent an important part of our business.</p><h4>What kind of environmental sustainability practices do you have in place?</h4><p>Through the Mexican Association of the Phytosanitary Industry (AMIFAC) we participate in responsibility programs. Also, in terms of social responsibility, we train people on the use of our products and how to properly dispose of our containers. In the past, you could find a lot of used containers in the soil polluting the environment. Now, our sales team is in charge of giving a five- to 10-minute speech on how to manage the containers. Cheminova also has a program with one partner to donate equipment to growers to protect themselves while spraying liquid products. We donate around 100 to 150 pieces of equipment every year.</p><div class="quote">“In our current registration program, we have at least 18 products that will give us access to new markets."</div><h4>How are you planning to meet growth targets over the next few years?</h4><p>It is a question of registering new products. In our current registration program, we have at least 18 products that will give us access to new markets that we are not currently participating in. Also, we are developing mixtures. We are selling some of them now, but they are not mature yet. When they reach maturity, it will help us grow. Additionally, we are planning to increase our share in our corn distributors. We have around 150 distributors at the moment, and from those distributors around 40%—50% represent 80% of our total sales. We want to grow more with them. We can do that by offering rebates, support, and price programs according to their success. That is something that we are doing now, and we are planning to continue doing in the following years.</p><h4>Are you worried about new competition from abroad?</h4><p>We have new competitors. Some companies have begun to buy from Chinese sources, so the competition is heating up. Some Indian and Chinese companies are also planning on establishing their commercial operations here in Mexico. They do not only want to sell to the Mexican companies, but also to distributors. However, they compete only on price. They do not offer any services, so I am not afraid of the competition. However, I am afraid of illegal or unethical competition. The market is for everyone, and everybody has to fight for their share of the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the government's plan to build more low-income houses affect the industry and your business?<br></h4><p>At first, we were skeptical of its plan because it was not explained very well. The government said we had two years to adapt to the new project. We have a lot of land available, but most of that land will be developed by us. We will be able to finish everything we have started, even if it is far away. We are changing the way we do things a little bit. The government does not tell us to build a type of home—we choose whatever we want. If you want subsidies, you have to do what the government wants, and do it within the price range that it specifies. We are not focusing on subsidies anymore because the only thing that is limited in the housing business is the amount of money that goes for subsidies. What has changed is that investors used to want growth. Now, they want us to generate free cash flow. You have to be very careful of how many projects you open and how much land you buy. You have to be concerned about free cash flow because that is an issue. Right now, we are looking into the possibility of opening a real estate investment trust (REIT) or selling the seven shopping centers and five strip malls we have.</p><h4>How popular have REITs become, and where do the main investment opportunities lie?</h4><p>Right now, it is a booming market. It was unthinkable three to five years ago. The government changed the tax laws making it possible to open REITs. We started building vertical homes many years ago. It was a challenge back then because people wanted the possibility to expand their homes at a later date. For many years, we would add an extension to the back part of the home and on top. That is how we worked for many years, until the authorities said we should start going vertical. It is a cultural thing. Some years ago, we started the development of 4,600 single homes and another developer started building vertical three-story homes. The other development was for 300 homes. We finished 4,600 units before it finished its 300. Now, things have changed and everybody is constructing taller buildings; people are getting used to that. In places like Mexico City, where there are a lot of people, it is not a problem; however, if you go somewhere like Chihuahua and you build a vertical project of three homes, one on top of the other, nobody would buy it. Also, the laws have to be changed in the municipalities. It is not as easy as it seems, because we still have the federal government, the state government, and the municipal governments, and in some cases we have to deal with all three from different political parties. There needs to be more cohesion across the board. Sometimes, it takes months or years for somebody to agree on the federal changes. You have to be careful where you buy your land. We used to buy a lot of ejidos. After the revolution, the large haciendas were split up into ejidos, and they were given to the people. The laws changed and since 1994, people have been allowed to sell their ejidos. It might be a plot of land with 100 owners. We have bought around 35 ejidos and each one has its own story. Close to 65% of the land suitable for housing in Mexico is ejido land. There is a huge potential with edijos; however, the complexities for these acquisitions are massive.</p><h4>How has Consorcio ARA remained strong in the face of a volatile local housing market?</h4><p>We have our own machinery and are self-sufficient. We are vertically integrated, which is good and not so good. It is very good when you have a lot of work in one place. When you are running out of land or when you cannot get the permit fast enough, it is not good. There are projects where if you were not vertically integrated, you could not do them. We have been the most conservative company out of the housing companies in the stock market. We have very little debt. Another thing that we did in 2012 was generate free cash flow, but we had positive free cash flow; even though it was not much—only about Ps660 million. We are the only company in the sector that gives dividends.</p><div class="quote">“We are the only company in the sector that gives dividends."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[room-somewhere]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated the establishment of JL Consulting?<br></h4><p>Consulting has been working in hotelier consulting since 2009. When I was working in Mexico City as the general director of a company, I managed nine hotels. Eventually, there was a point when I decided I wanted to open my own company. So, hotel consulting was born and we started with six departments. The “mystery shopper" is one of the departments. What will happen is a client will ask us to be a mystery shopper. We then go to their hotel and evaluate it with more than 1,200 quality standards. We measure the times, the temperatures, the employees, and the sounds; basically, we measure everything. Our mystery shopper department is working really well, and JL Consulting has many clients that are requesting our services monthly. The other department is consulting, which is like health care for hotels. We analyze the hotels and recommend to the owners what, when, and how to do things. We also have a training department for hotel staff. Our company trains staff in a special way for our clients. It is not the usual training scheme where you have 70 people in a ballroom—our company really focuses on one-on-one training with the staff. We also provide sales, representations, PR, and marketing for hotels. The last department that we have, and possibly the most important one, is operations. We operate boutique hotels of 25-100 rooms in size. Basically, we manage everything and report to the owners every month. JL Consulting has been receiving numerous requests from many new clients. However, we are very picky as to which hotels we choose to manage, because one of the key aspects of the operations department is that I am the director of every single hotel for at least two years. For me to guarantee success in every hotel, I am on site every single day managing the hotel. That is the only way I can convince the client that we will be successful.</p><h4>What opportunities would you say exist at the moment for local property developers?</h4><p>Boutique hotels present a huge opportunity for developers. There are 1 million sqm in Mexico for rent or sale at the moment. There is a lot of money in Mexico, and people who want to invest, but they don't know where to start. We decided to open up a development company exclusively for boutique hotels. What our company does in ML Desarrollos Hoteleros is to buy a building or a lot. We then find money and the people who want to invest in us. We have created a product in regard to the neighborhood, the people, and the clients. We launch the product and give the project a management team. The opportunities are enormous, and this is why we decided to go into the development business.</p><h4>How strong is the market in terms of access to finance?</h4><p>The market is very strong. When I talk to clients and discuss our numbers, such as our 85% occupancy rates at an average of $235, it is a done deal. That is why we have many clients who want to invest in us. Now, my problem is that our company needs more products. I need more hotels and I need more hands. The response has been really surprising. When you produce these numbers for the owners, they want to invest with you again, and they want to invite other people.</p><h4>JL Consulting is currently building a hotel in Colonia Condesa. What are your broader expansion plans for 2013?</h4><p>We are planning to open one hotel every 12 months. In December 2012, we planned to open a hotel in Condesa. JL Consulting is working at this very moment on finding new products and new buildings to open in 2014. I think we have a lot of room for development in Mexico City. We are looking into Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana as other possible destinations. We want to go to Cancún, Tulum, and Los Cabos as well. Outside of Mexico, we would like to open a hotel in Central America or South America instead of going to the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did CEMEX grow to become the global leader in cement production that it is today?</h4><p>We have to go back to 1906 to a town called Hidalgo, in Nuevo León, where we built our first local cement production plant. During the first 80 years of CEMEX's history, the company was mostly active in the local market, and it expanded activities across the country. In 1985, when Lorenzo Zambrano took over as CEO of the company, CEMEX started focusing on cement production and it implemented a very aggressive business strategy to achieve growth. At the end of the 1980s, the company went from being a local producer to the leading company in terms of production in the entire country after acquiring Cementos Anáhuac and Cementos Tolteca. By that time, CEMEX had also started operating in the southern markets of the US. This completely changed the profile of the company for the better. Between 1991 and 1995, CEMEX started its real international expansion. In 1992 we acquired business activities in Spain, which represented our first steps in the European market. We also entered Central and South American markets such as Venezuela, where we acquired Vencemos, Panama, where we acquired Bayano, and some other Caribbean operations including the Dominican Republic. Around that time, CEMEX also entered the Asian market through the Philippines, where we acquired two companies. In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of two events in the mid-1990s that consolidated our operations worldwide: the acquisition of Balcones, a cement plant in the US, and the acquisition of Colombia's Cementos Diamante and Samper. After these acquisitions, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In the following years up until the early 2000s, the company kept focusing on expanding its activities in foreign markets, especially in Central and South America. We consolidated our activities in Asia, and we also entered the Egyptian market. In 2005, CEMEX doubled its size with the acquisition of British RMC, adding mainly 15 European markets to its portfolio. After that, in 2007, CEMEX acquired Rinker, which significantly expanded our activities in the US. In the last stage of our long journey, the company also diversified its product portfolio, adding concrete and aggregate production to its cement activity. Today, CEMEX is a global company that holds a leading position in the cement, concrete, and aggregate production and commercialization industries. We have direct operations in over 50 countries, and other commercial ties with more than 100 countries. CEMEX currently employs 44,000 people.</p><h4>What role does Mexico continue to play in CEMEX's extensive global operations?</h4><p>It still remains a very important part of our business activity. During the first six months of 2012, Mexico represented 23% of our overall sales activity. Mexico is the largest country we operate in. Mexico, the US, Northern Europe, and South America are the main areas of activity for CEMEX at the moment. Mexico is also an important base of operations to supply materials to neighboring countries such as Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, as well as Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and even the US.</p><h4>What role has the construction materials sector played in widening Mexico's base as an industrial hub?</h4><p>The construction materials sector currently represents around 5% of Mexico's GDP. Investment in infrastructure in Mexico, which is still deficient, has played a vital role in the economic and social development of the country, and it has also attracted many foreign investors. Therefore, the construction materials sector has contributed to leveraging industrial production capacities in the country, generating job opportunities for the local population and industrializing the production of housing. However, the country still lags behind in both infrastructure and housing development.</p><div class="quote">“In 2007, CEMEX acquired Rinker, which significantly expanded our activities in the US."</div><h4>What are the main infrastructure projects CEMEX is currently involved in, and what kind of trends have you observed in terms of project demand?</h4><p>There are three main projects CEMEX has been working on, including the development and professionalization of our distribution network, as well as the development of new products that facilitate the construction process. Therefore, we have evolved into a company providing full and integral construction solutions. We have professionalized our network, especially the retail stores, via marketing, operations, and management technique training. The other main project had to do with the special emphasis we put on developing infrastructure projects through providing integral solutions to our clients. For example, in 2012 we completed over 7.8 million sqm of road paving in Mexico, and we are trying to export this business model to other countries as well. Finally, we complemented these activities with the development of housing projects. We aim to introduce more industrialized techniques into the construction of housing. In addition, we have also focused on diversifying our product portfolio in order to provide our customers with more detailed and appropriate products for their needs. CEMEX has R&amp;D centers in Mexico and Switzerland that constantly work to develop more efficient products from an energy and environmental point of view.</p><h4>How will the new kiln at the cement plant in Puebla assist your operations?</h4><p>At the moment, we are halfway through this investment project, and I believe it will contribute to expanding the company's business activity, for it will produce 10,000 tons of clinker a day. We expect to have it finished within 16 to 18 months, and the new kiln will increase the total production capacity of the Tepeac plant in Puebla to 7.4 million metric tons of cement per year. Its development also depends on the evolution of the market.</p><h4>How important is it for the company to have sustainable practices in place?</h4><p>Sustainability is a key issue for CEMEX, and we have always committed ourselves to having the best international standards, such as ISO 14000, when it comes to environmentally friendly practices. We constantly look for ways to reduce our CO2 emissions across the production chain through, for example, the use of alternative fuels. In fact, around 25% of CEMEX's energy consumption comes from alternative fuels, and we aim to increase this figure to up to 35% by 2015. Our Eurus project, a 250-MW wind farm, supplies approximately 25% of our Mexican plants' annual electricity needs. In other words, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 23% for each ton of cement. These are just some examples of our sustainable practices. We have also reduced lost-time injury rates from 7% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2011. We have cut CO2 emissions per cement ton and we aim to increase the use of alternative raw materials up to 12% by 2015.</p><h4>What are the main growth strategies of the company at the global level?</h4><p>The company will maintain its focus on developing and expanding its business in its three main areas of activity: cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregate. CEMEX will keep its market-oriented focus, while trying to develop mechanisms that strengthen the position of our clients. In the next couple of years, we expect to experience organic growth while taking advantage of the potential opportunities the market might offer. In addition, we will continue promoting the development of infrastructure projects not only in Mexico, but at the international level too. Finally, CEMEX is committed to continue implementing a value-before-volume business strategy worldwide, as well as environmentally friendly practices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your strategy for success?<br></h4><p>Our main priority is to do a variety of small projects with an impeccable degree of perfection. We are not a very big company, but we put an immense amount of effort into all that we do. In our latest initiative, the Arco Sur project for ICA, we are bringing in cranes from Liebherr that are capable of carrying 1,200 tons. We have added an additional three cranes of 1,200 tons, two 500-ton cranes, and one 700-ton crane. The company is improving its operations, because we have to supply five or six beams per night over a time span of five hours. It is vital that no crane fails at any moment. We are the only company in Mexico that has invested in the latest models. We have been accident free since the beginning because our people are very well trained, and we have been patient to carry out projects the right way every time.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind Cargo Crane Mexico's new company structure?</h4><p>Currently, we are aware of the fact that sectors and divisions of businesses are changing throughout the world. We saw that the development of solar energy had been delayed, and Mexico doesn't fully understand the concept of green energy. We went to Germany, where we have built a relationship with a leading solar energy company called Sen. It provides engineering and knowledge for the building of solar power plants and buildings for a public purpose. Our intention is to break into the necessary sectors in Mexico, especially industry and real estate, where changes are being made in electricity and thermal energy. We want to sell the quality associated with German products, and we have projects with Corona, Coca-Cola, and ICA in a variety of plants and structures that are leaning toward green energy solutions. Progress is fairly slow, but we are motivating companies to changes their use of energy.</p><h4>What trends have you seen in demand for your services?</h4><p>The trends are positive. Foreign companies appreciate serious companies, and as a Mexican group we are very serious. We want to do everything right, and we are never out to deceive people; we do business with good people, and foreign companies realize that. They would like to work with us, and we are looking forward to joining forces also. In the end, we are selling trust and confidence, and we have a very good opportunity to succeed with this approach in the coming years.</p><div class="quote">“We want to do everything right, and we are never out to deceive people."</div><h4>With more money being injected into the country, what would you say are some of the challenges Mexico faces as it strives to achieve its full potential?</h4><p>I believe that Mexico is very difficult to understand at times. Every six years, the country changes drastically with the new government. However, I believe that the next six years will bring about change like never before, and it will be for the best. President Calderón has done an excellent job in regard to the economy, and I expect President Peña Nieto to contribute to that trend and take advantage of this work. Worldwide, Mexico has a very good growth position, and the new Secretary of Infrastructure has very good knowledge about building the country. There is a lot of work ahead, but the point is to choose quality. We can all agree that the focus has to be on the right infrastructure with great quality.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in the coming year?</h4><p>Our intention is to expand our workforce of good people, because it is our main problem. It is not easy to find the right people for our team. In the crane division we have a number of talented individuals, and I believe we are prepared and in very good shape. We are poised to be the perfect company in that line of business. However, in our other divisions we need to invest in good people. We have to bring in people from Spain, Germany, and other parts of Europe to build the good mentality we are seeking. We have the opportunity to train good people, but at the level of directors, it is very complicated to find the right talent. There are few who are willing to take that level of responsibility, and many who outright avoid it—we want to invest in good engineers who can be leaders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story of Coconal?<br></h4><p>This is a company with 62 years of history behind it. Throughout this period, we have developed our business activities in Mexico by building substantial infrastructure projects including roads, bridges, dams, and airports. There are seven companies within the Coconal Group. In addition to Coconal, which is the construction company, we have three special purpose vehicles (SPVs). One of them manages road-infrastructure concessions of between 20 and 40 years, one operates and maintains these concessions, and the final one deals with the transport of materials and machinery. The last element of the group is Compañí­a Contratista Nacional, Coconal's holding company. The company can trace its origins to Compañí­a Contratista Nacional's establishment in 1950. Coconal has come a long way over the years. Today, we have about 3,500 employees and our turnover is approximately $400 million per year. Also, we operate and maintain 1,000 kilometers of highway, 550 kilometers of which we built. Along the roads for which we are responsible for operations and maintenance, we are installing security cameras every 3 kilometers. We have also installed emergency telephones for drivers. On weekdays, some 4,000 vehicles per day use our roads under concession, while on weekends the figure goes up to 12,000 vehicles per day.</p><h4>How are your operations balanced between construction and management?</h4><p>Construction is our main business activity today, with around 70% of our activity in the construction of public infrastructure projects. The remaining 30% are road concessions. We are presently the second most important company in terms of the overall number of road concessions.</p><h4>What are some of the most important projects the company has carried out in the last five years?</h4><p>The Toluca-Valle de Bravo Road, which is 70 kilometers long and had a budget of Ps3 billion, is one of the most complex and significant projects we have developed, because it is located in a protected natural area. In addition to that, the construction of the access road to the Manzanillo thermoelectric plant was also very important. It was about seven kilometers in length, and we finished the project in seven months. Finally, we are currently developing the 42-kilometer “Laguna beltway," an 18-month-long project with a budget of more than Ps2 billion.</p><div class="quote">“We operate and maintain 1,000 kilometers of highway, 550 kilometers of which we built."</div><h4>Since 70% of your business activity relates to public infrastructure projects, how do you anticipate the new public-private-partnership (PPP) law will affect the industry?</h4><p>In Mexico, there are three types of contracting: public, where there is a very extensive regulatory framework; the concessions regime, which is well-structured; and the PPP model, which was vague before the introduction of the new law. The new PPP law, which is modeled on the PPP structure of the UK, is attractive for the sector because it gives solidity to private investments. In addition, public infrastructure projects will continue growing as the price of oil rises. In terms of road concessions, Mexico is at the limit; the country has 9,000 kilometers of toll roads, and I think we are one of the countries with the highest number of toll roads in the world. In this regard, the new PPP law will give fresh air to a very mature market. However, the impact on the sector is yet to be seen, especially because it still needs to be fully developed. The issue of PPP is in fact a very complex matter, and up until this point it has to a large extent clashed with the national regulatory framework.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the further sophistication of infrastructure within Mexico?</h4><p>I think the economic capacity of the country will depend on the price of oil and, above all, on future fiscal reforms that would enable the government to collect more taxation revenue. Additionally, the full implementation of the PPP regulatory framework and an upgrade of the out-of-date laws regulating the infrastructure segment are much needed. Finally, security is another challenge Mexico faces. However, I would also like to point out that the country has huge capacity and potential for growth; for example, there are about 250,000 kilometers of unpaved roads.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your operations, and what trends have you seen in the demand for crane and transportation provisioning?<br></h4><p>We started operations 20 years ago, and I started the company myself after graduating from university. At first, we rented cranes locally in city areas, then we moved to central Mexico and increased our crane capacity. The fleet grew. As we grew, we expanded into energy and different infrastructure markets. In addition to renting, we also started selling and distributing construction equipment. Our clients are mainly in the energy sector, and they include Siemens, GE Mitsui, Iberdrola, Abengoa, and Mitsubishi. We have seen a lot of developments all over Mexico, especially in the south in the energy sector. The energy industry there is growing very fast, with wind turbines being located in Ventosa. We also participate in building and servicing thermo-electrical plants, especially in northern Mexico, the Yucatán peninsula, and around the Gulf of Mexico. We also have a branch in Guadalajara that sees a lot of business in Western Mexico, especially in Manzanillo and Lázaro Cárdenas. The energy reforms by the government are a very welcome development and I think they will be a positive stimulus for the energy sector.</p><h4>How do you attract new clients?</h4><p>We've been in the market for 20 years and work on contracts with a lot of our main clients, so we have a program mapped out and they rely on us. The program covers this year and the coming years, and about 60% to 70% of our fleet is committed to those clients already. Now, we are seeking to expand our fleet so as to attract new customers. We achieve this through personal contacts on job sites. We visit customers in Mexico City, where we have a small office. Our representatives have many contacts within large companies, and we travel a lot to visit customers and clients. Overall, there are only three or four crane companies in Mexico that are reliable, and Auriga is at that level. When there is a project, they call us for a quote and for engineering consultation the same as they do with the other big and dependable companies.</p><h4>What is your growth and expansion plan for the coming few years?</h4><p>We have a branch in Villahermosa. We are expecting changes to the energy laws, and Villahermosa in southern Mexico is rich in oil. We want to have a better market share there—we have been there eight years. I see opportunities for heavy equipment there. Auriga has a center in Villahermosa to supply bigger cranes, trucks, and other equipment so we can support our customers and help them do their jobs. Things are always getting bigger and faster, and for that you need bigger and better equipment. We have had strong and continuous growth, and not a year has passed where we haven't grown. My ultimate goal is to keep the company going for a hundred years and leave the company to my sons and grandchildren. That is a big challenge because 80% of companies in Mexico, or indeed worldwide, don't last beyond 10 years.</p><div class="quote">“Things are always getting bigger and faster, and for that you need bigger and better equipment."</div><h4>What reforms would you like to see implemented, besides the energy reforms you mentioned earlier?</h4><p>The energy reforms are the most important for our sector, obviously. A new education reform was also approved recently, but that will have a mid- to long-term effect, although the fact that it's been approved is very positive. We are also very behind in terms of tax reform. A lot of cities and municipalities have taken in a lot of money recently, but they haven't managed their funds well. That's unfortunate. Not all states and municipalities are playing their part equally, and they're spending irresponsibly. In Mexico there are more than 40,000 municipalities, 60%-70% of which are on the poverty line. There has to be tax reform. Only 20% of Mexicans pay the right amount of taxes. The other 80% do business illegally to one degree or another. The government is missing out on billions and billions of pesos in tax revenue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How large a role does cross-border passenger transport play in the business?</h4><p>The international segment represents 14% of the business. We are actually the only company in Mexico that provides  transportation services within Mexico, the US, and cross border. That is related to how we receive permits from the Department of Homeland Security in the US. We have full insurance in the US for all of our units, and comply with both US and Mexican regulations.</p><h4>How has passenger transportation evolved in Mexico in recent years?</h4><p>Our business is very cyclical throughout the year. During the winter holidays, the summer vacation season, and then during spring break, we see peaks in our passenger segment. Our personnel segment is actually nearly counter cyclical to the passenger segment. The drivers for market performance have traditionally been Mexico's growing demographics and improving economic performance, both of which have been performing rather well over recent years—more so after the 2008-2009 crisis. As the economy improves, more people move around. We also have to consider that there is no real alternative to bus transportation in Mexico. There is no significant passenger rail system. There are only two railways for touristic purposes, one in Guadalajara and one in Chihuahua, while the rest are freight rail systems. As a result, it is only possible to move by car or by plane. However, only 3% of the population have access to air transport. So, when you look at the demographics, we service 97% of the population. Over 2012, we moved more than 20 million people in the passenger segment and another 35 million people in the personal sector. That demographic has been increasing in size, so you would think that the bus industry would be growing; however, unfortunately it has not.</p><h4>What strategies have you implemented to deal with cost challenges?</h4><p>We have had an increased focus on cost consciousness. Before we ran as four different bus companies, and now we run as one. We have pegged those businesses together and improved margins by roughly three-four percentage points. We have also been very successful in our “Route Rationalization Strategy." That means we have reduced empty kilometers, improved passenger load, and reduced the number of buses needed to service each route. Overall, we have managed to reduce our fleet size by some 200 units while servicing the same market. This translates into better performance and profitability. Our competitors, which are mainly co-ops, are not able to mimic this strategy and reduce kilometers or runs because of their multiple owners. Despite higher operating costs, mostly as a result of increasing diesel prices, we have had a better price environment. Within our cost structure, diesel is the most significant factor, aside from labor, and diesel costs have increased around 65%-70% over the last four years. Being able to transfer that is not easy. We have been increasing prices during the holiday seasons every single year to recoup the industry's cost inflation. With good strategies, we have successfully been able to transfer this cost.</p><div class="quote">“Over 2012, we moved more than 20 million people per year in the passenger segment."</div><h4>How intense is the competition in the local market?</h4><p>It is fierce because bus transportation is slightly regionalized. We have a commanding market share in the northeast, but we have no presence in the south of Mexico. We have a significant market share on all the routes that we operate, which comes as a result of our good service. There are, however, three other large bus transportation companies that mostly follow the co-op model on a different scale, so their business models are very different from ours. Nevertheless, we do compete in several markets, though more so in the center of Mexico, where a large portion of the population resides. In several cities we even operate out of the same bus terminal, which makes competition even harder.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technological advances have you implemented to improve productivity?</h4><p>In Colombia and Latin America, we find many pests and diseases. Therefore, we need to conduct specialized research on our needs here in this region. We have been developing some new tools and knowledge to understand the behavior of these diseases and find out what the causes are so we can have crops that are not affected by this problem. In Colombia, we have developed a new palm that is a hybrid between the American Palm and the African Palm. From this new hybrid we can obtain a new oil that we call “high oleic palm oil," which is different from the regular oil in food and non-food industrial applications. We have reached 50,000-planted hectares of this species of oil palm.</p><h4>What is Colombia's annual production of palm oil?</h4><p>In spring of 2013, we will be going above the 1 million-ton mark per year. This is going to be the first time the country will reach this number, so it is a great achievement for the sector.</p><h4>What is Fedepalma's role in regional economic development?</h4><p>Since land is a big issue for many different reasons, for example the social impact on rural workers, smallholders, and medium-sized producers, we have been developing a model where an entrepreneur has a piece of land and an extraction mill. This larger company then helps smallholders by putting them together in what we call “strategic alliances" to produce palm oil. Through this model, we have been able to significantly increase the amount of fruit being produced without direct investments from entrepreneurs. They do it indirectly through these producers and this also helps enhance social relationships in the region because everybody feels part of the business, and not like a big company came in and bought everything. We try to make everyone participate. We call this “inclusive business." At the moment, we have about 80,000 hectares under this type of model out of the 450,000 hectares that we have in the country. There are over 100 of these smallholding alliances, and through these we improve our social impact and social perception in the communities. They are also supporting the development of the oil palm industry in Colombia. Instead of having large plantations owned by only one company, this is a way to have a larger, nuclear estate not belonging to only one company. It involves small- and medium- sized producers. In the late 1990s, 70% of the fruit that we processed in the mills was from owned plantations and 30% from other suppliers. Today, it is the opposite.</p><div class="quote">“We have about 50% of local sales going to bio-diesel and 50% to the food industry."</div><h4>What percentage of the palm oil goes into the food industry, and what percentage goes into the bio-fuel sector?</h4><p>Today, with the development of the palm biodiesel program in Colombia, we have about 50% of local sales going to bio-diesel and 50% to the food industry. We sell to the local market about 85% out of total production and export 15%. Europe has been our major export market for almost 20 years. Also, some Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Chile, have been important to us. Now, the US is demanding more palm oil for the food industry and hopefully soon for biodiesel as well.</p><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become an exporter of energy in the short to medium term?</h4><p>The oil palm is a miraculous plant. It transforms solar energy in a very efficient way into energy in the form of oil. It is very productive when compared to other oilseeds. It is 10 times more productive than soy beans, for example. For many years, we were only looking at the food industry and the soap and detergent industries. Now, we are looking more into many different oleochemical areas. We have six biodiesel plants in the country producing close to 500,000 tons a year. Now, I see many companies looking for fresh opportunities to manufacture feedstock for the detergent industry and other industries.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been H.E.C's major milestones over the past two years?</h4><p>It is a little tricky to specify milestones in just a few words. The real estate business is exotic and in perpetual movement, bridging the past to the present and to the future. However, besides high-tech project developments, H.E.C has embarked on a joint venture with the private banking sector to create a real estate fund portfolio, which will be advantageous for other investors to join the real estate sector from a return-on-investment perspective. In Lebanon, whoever has the necessary funds, as well as the right architects and contractors, can start off in the building business. The fund we are working on setting up is managed by one of the top banks in Lebanon. It will offer a portfolio of various funds for people who are interested in diversification. With this venture, we are trying to control the market, to a certain extent, and avoid the situation similar to the one seen in Dubai, where the private sector and the government have all been engaged in the building process and it turns out to be chaos. Actually, there is a committee for the real estate developers, and most of the major companies acting in Lebanon, including H.E.C, have joined. We hope that through it we will be able to work out some fundamental regulations for the real estate sector. Of our other business achievements, we have expanded the manufacturing facilities of two H.E.C subsidiaries, one factory for H.E.C. Wood and another for H.E.C Aluminum. We have equipped them with new machinery, brought in new architects, a larger workforce, and have even undertaken joint ventures with other architects and interior designers.</p><h4>What impact has all of this had on your business?</h4><p>Aside from the benefits of the fund portfolio, that expansion will push us further to have better architectural designs and engineering standards. Locally, Lebanon cannot compete with the world's manufacturing market, as our costs are too high to sustain due to the lack of government support. We, however, can supply a great deal of good quality, added-value products and specialized customizations. This is our added value. Most of us travel a lot, so we are always searching for the latest innovations in manufacturing machines, for example. We are not doing mass production. We import our materials from Germany and Italy, and we are looking into Spain now. We were investigating Turkey, but because of the recent unrest, it is now not a possibility.</p><div class="quote">“The real estate business is exotic and in perpetual movement, bridging the past to the present and to the future."</div><h4>As a long-standing expert in the real estate field, how do you perceive it performing in Lebanon? What are the trends in the long run?</h4><p>It is witnessing tight times and a slowdown recently because of the troubles in Syria, which have tremendously affected its progress, not to mention the worldwide economic crisis. The major problem has been Syria, as most of our business goes there and comes back. There are also restrictions in the banking sector, which means we cannot bring in Syrian money. That has greatly influenced our purchasing power. Despite this, we have two ongoing projects: one at Nabay, near Rabieh, and another at Mansourieh. The Nabay development we have dubbed “Greenville." It is about 200 to 300 apartments, consisting of close to 20 to 30 buildings in one area, with security networks, management, and everything involved. We are also working on a deal with Cablevision cable providers to supply satellite TV and internet access to residents, but this is not closed yet. We are still carrying on our negotiations, and expect to reach an agreement sometime in 2016.</p><h4>Which buyer segment does H.E.C target its projects at?</h4><p>They are aimed at middle-income earners, a market currently doing well. We are developing apartments ranging from 80 sqm to 170 sqm; this is the demand now. The Nabay project was supposed to be at Roumieh, but due to municipality issues, we moved it to Nabay. In this project, we are working on kids' playgrounds and common areas. There will be a 300-400 sqm area that residents can book and use for social activities. There are small apartments as well, so it will be necessary to use these spaces for big family dinners. The second project development at Mansourieh we called “Rosewood." Construction has already started, and we will have 59 apartments, of areas 100 sqm to 240 sqm. This residence is the perfect area and it is working for us. We are also good at aiding the financing of homes. We are now offering facilities with only a 10% down payment, up to 90% financing over 30 years, and a fixed interest rate of 2.5%. This is a first for Lebanon, as it is usually around 6.5%.</p><h4>How do you assess the building permits situation in Lebanon?</h4><p>It is a nightmare. The government is too busy playing the role of a “government" that it has forgotten to facilitate people's occupations, whatever business they are involved in. Usually and unfortunately, in Lebanon the more you get to know influential people, the easier you get your work done and not have to deal with the ridiculous and exhausting bureaucracy. This is how it is, and you have to work around these problems. Greenville was supposed to be at Roumieh, but the mayor stopped the project for a very poor reason; one corner of the entire project exceeded a certain height limit. Normally, across the world, a $42 million project like the supposed Roumieh would not be blocked for something that trivial. I had to refund clients' money and apologize, and the mayor did not care about our situation. His main alibi, he has claimed, is that he wants to keep the area green, but where the irony lies in all that, H.E.C Green is the main sponsor of Lebanon Green Again. I assisted in planting more than 2 million square meters of trees, so for me, it is an outrageous excuse.</p><h4>How is the prefabricated house segment of the business developing?</h4><p>It is developing well. We started H.E.C HOMES last year, and sold our first project to Ricky's restaurant in Faraya. It is not just us engaged in this now. Many are doing a good job, offering high-quality prefabricated projects. In our case, because we can offer a variety of services due to our many business interests, we are in a better position in this market. Ricky's is our main project, a 650-sqm restaurant that has worked out really well. We are now moving toward chalets. The benefits here are that you can have a new house in less than five months, instead of the usual two to three years in Lebanon. You save 60% on energy, and they are eco-friendly and green. We mainly import these from Finland, Russia, Canada, and the US.</p><h4>What have been the latest advancements that you have accomplished?</h4><p>Last year was somewhat stagnant because we had had lots of problems, as with the internet service in the country. We cannot do many things, and our communications infrastructure is extremely inadequate. We cannot proceed with any new technologies related to the internet and applied to the construction business because of this, and all major developments are in this area. Now we are trying to focus on eco-friendly solutions, instead. We are introducing these standards into many of our new projects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Ducati Brand?</h4><p>This year, we have acquired the Ducati dealership, collaborating and partnering with Ducati CEO/Partner in Lebanon, Gilbert Khoury, a mechanical engineer and graduate of MIT. He also works with Michelin tires, so this is a good business for us. In the next three years, we will target three or four sub-dealers in Lebanon. It is a completely different business for us, and moving from the construction to the automotive sector has been interesting.</p><h4>Are you considering getting into new markets?</h4><p>We are looking into Erbil in Iraq, as well as Georgia. We are studying these markets, but our Georgian operations are a bit more advanced. It is mainly linked to our kitchen manufacturing operations and the Ducati dealership. We are looking into creating franchises there.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Shell's involvement in Oman developed?</h4><p>Shell's involvement in Oman goes back to 1937, when the initial contract was agreed. The form of the partnership between Shell and Oman has changed over the years, but from about 1980 onwards it has a joint venture with the government of Oman in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), and since 1999 with Oman LNG, when the first LNG was produced.  Shell represents 34% of the PDO venture and 30% of the Oman LNG venture. We also have Shell Oman Marketing, which was floated on the Muscat Securities Market in 1997, with 49% of the shares owned by Shell and the rest owned by Omani investors. The Shell Development Oman office was set up in 2001 for the purpose of formalizing Shell's in-country governance and support presence. I sit on the boards of PDO, Oman LNG, and its sister company Qalhat LNG. I also chair the board of Shell Oman Marketing, which is involved in market retail, commercial fuels, aviation fuel, and so on. In this office we also house Shell Technology Oman, a group of between 10 and 15 people doing enhanced oil recovery R&amp;D for PDO.</p><h4>How does Shell work to develop social infrastructure in Oman?</h4><p>Our social investment agenda falls into four parts: employment, enterprise, environment, and road safety. Employment is the biggest, the main thrust being to create training opportunities with the Oman Society for Petroleum Services (OPAL) in industry, through which people are trained with the promise of a job upon the successful completion of their training. The Training for Employment project has been running for some years now and has been quite successful, creating an average of 140 jobs per year. These projects also include training for people with a range of disabilities for suitable jobs. We were awarded the Sultan Qaboos Award for Social Responsibilities in 2012 for our efforts. On the enterprise side we have an SME fund and we have a partnership with Grofin, the operator of the fund. Grofin is an SME fund specialist, and it set up a fund here in Oman for us, which has been running since 2007. We've invested $17 million in the SME fund and we're trying to attract young businesses that have already started up and need a boost, not just by investing money, but by helping them develop business and marketing plans. Its aim is to create jobs through Omanis starting up and growing their businesses, or taking businesses to the next level. The environmental side includes various projects that we've been working on. The road safety side aims to try and push the awareness of road safety in Oman through schools, families, and the Oman Road Safety Association (ORSA). The loss of life we're seeing is unnecessary, and we hope to bring in more awareness and the right rules and controls to prevent that happening. Our main thrust has been both through the Oman Road Safety Association (ORSA), an Omani NGO, and through schemes in schools to create awareness, and we've done that in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and Royal Oman Police. One more initiative is Outward Bound Oman project, which enables youngsters to go outside and appreciate what the country has to offer, exercise, and pick up leadership skills. This year it runs as an independent organization. It started off in 2009, is headed by Mark Evans, and has gone from 100 to over 1,300 young people in 2013, including both Omanis and foreigners. That's our social investment side in a nutshell.</p><div class="quote">“Oil was first produced in the early 1960s, today peaking at its highest production level ever for gas and oil."</div><h4>What level of support do you provide to PDO?</h4><p>The biggest support we provide is through people and technology. In short, we work to ensure that all the strengths we believe make Shell competitive flow into PDO. Coupled with that is Shell Technology Oman's R&amp;D. That is paid for by PDO, but there are also strategic alliances where PDO and Shell pool money to develop future projects and initiatives. Among these big future projects are enhanced oil recovery techniques, which are being matured by PDO. Shell is helping with this new technology and Oman leads the world in this area. We aim to help PDO not just replace its reserves, but also replace future contingent reserves so it has a stable 10-year plateau. We help with the future, but also with day-to-day problems, asset integrity, system reliability, and reservoir maintenance to keep production levels up and maximize the value of each asset. On the people side, we have an agreement with PDO for it to use the Shell Graduate Training Process, which it has branded as its own to get youngsters from study through to functioning engineers much quicker than would usually happen.</p><h4>How do you evaluate PDO's training and development of its Omani staff?</h4><p>The company has about 7,000 employees and it is roughly 80% Omanized. It has done a great job, with help from Shell and others, in terms of training and capability transfer with a lot of on-the-job training and help. A very visible measure of success is the leadership team, which is all Omani, except for the Managing Director. That gives you an example of how seriously it has taken the subject of developing Omanis. PDO isn't just an exporter of oil, it's an exporter of people into the Omani economy. Ex-PDO people emerge in all areas of the economy, and for good reason, because they've been tested, trained, and had work and leadership exposure.</p><h4>How else do you instill Shell's worldwide values and quality control?</h4><p>PDO has its own culture and identity, and we don't try and change that. It does, however, use many Shell standards, be they engineering, financial, ethical compliance, or other standards. There's also the absorption of Omanis into the Shell system. All their top leaders have spent time in the Shell system worldwide, and that continues. We aspire to have 100 Omanis in the Shell network at any one time.</p><h4>How do you see Oman's production capabilities changing in the future?</h4><p>I think Oman has done a great job at keeping a stable outlook. Oil was first produced in the early 1960s, today peaking at its highest production level ever for gas and oil. PDO alone produces over 1 million barrels a day oil equivalent, which is higher than it has ever been. Exploration is also extremely active, both in PDO and in other blocks. There are more and more production and exploration opportunities, more revolutionary production technologies, as well as a growing diversity of operators, which is up to around 20 now. BP is also coming in the future, and this is great for the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>Do you think more competition is conducive to better production?</h4><p>Definitely. It's a great thing. PDO used to have a dominant position, which may have been healthy at the time to try and kick-start technology and get the oil and gas sector up and running, but as others have come in, it has created a very healthy environment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Omani oil and gas sector over the next five years?</h4><p>Very exciting. Khazzan and Makarem, operated by BP, is a tight gas project that will soon make its investment decision. Be it in tight shale/oil and gas, there is activity everywhere. The outlook is bright.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your incoming strategy?<br></h4><p>President Peña Nieto believes that with an economy as open as the Mexican economy, with exports and imports being such a significant driver for growth, there should be no reason for Mexico not to have its own development bank for foreign trade. We need to continue financing exports, and today we have a loan portfolio of close to $7 billion and a lot of potential for growth. So what is financing exports? We are not only financing exports, we can also finance the production of goods and services. We also finance imports because we believe that they help Mexican industry to modernize and bring in new machinery and practices. We have seen many international firms coming to Mexico, and they bring with them skills, financing, and muscle power. Now, we have the strength to help Mexican firms in the international tendering process, so that when they want to go out and make an investment in Central America or they want to go down to South America, or even go and buy a company in Europe, we can help them. We also want to develop the global supply chain. Around 400-500 firms are responsible for about 70% of our exports; the big volumes are concentrated in a small number of firms. So if you want to export, most likely you will have to be part of a global supply chain. And so we have to be in Mexico. We are realistic about it and we want more firms and more SMEs to participate in these global supply chains. That is not easy because it is not only a financing issue; you really have to comply with quality and timing, so Bancomext will do its part in terms of financing, but the more we know about the supply chain, the more we can help businesses access other institutions. And finally, we have to increase Mexican content. If we export $300 billion worth of goods, and Mexican content is around 30%, we are only really exporting $90 billion.</p><h4>How can SMEs access your funds?</h4><p>We segment the market, and we tend to work directly with firms that need loans above $5 million. For firms that are borrowing less than $5 million, we often go through the financial system. SMEs are offered Bancomext products through their own banks. We work with many institutions that identify exporters and offer them our products. It is important to make this segmentation in SMEs because banks often don't know if they're lending to the owner of a firm or the firm itself, and it could easily be the case that the owner is using his or her personal credit card to finance the business, meaning rates of 30% to 40%. If the bank knew that it was financing an entrepreneur and not just a consumer, then the rate would be significantly lower. Thus, the more we know about the client and the more we segment, it is more likely that our products will be better suited to their needs. Our loan portfolio over the last two years has almost doubled in size.</p><h4>How can SME transparency and consequent growth potential be increased?</h4><p>The informality of the economy is a challenge. According to official numbers, more than 50% of our firms are a part of the informal sector. Firstly, as a government, we should do two things: we should offer every type of incentive for companies to formalize and open up, including punishments for those firms that refuse; we also have to work with them very closely and provide support in terms of training and letting them understand how the world works. They can then grow and become much more successful if they formalize and have access to credit.</p><div class="quote">“Around 400-500 firms are responsible for about 70% of our exports; the big volumes are concentrated in a small number of firms."</div><h4>What is your outlook for Bancomext in 2014?</h4><p>I am very positive about the outlook. I think that Mexico is a country that has been doing its work seriously in recent years. It has been somewhat overshadowed by the success of some other Latin American countries, such as Brazil, which has had a great deal of developmental success in recent years. However, once China's growth began to slow and commodity prices moderated, the expectation for growth from other countries began to decline and people suddenly started paying attention to Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your appointment has been described as a move that will help honest discussion within Mexican society, with the potential for effective public policies that will help build the country. What is your incoming strategy?</h4><p>In the energy sector in particular, we are faced with the challenge of making public policy in an environment where it is necessary to disseminate information about the status of the energy industry, and in which the degree of knowledge and the opinions of the public cover a wide spectrum of ideological positions. Before putting forward any concrete proposals, we believe that the public must be informed about the current status of our energy sector, the steps that need to be taken in order to revert the observed trends, and the price we would pay as a country if we fall behind technically, technologically, and in terms of infrastructure for failing to act. Promoting cultural change among the public is very important, a change that will be revealed in a better use of energy resources and in a new individual relationship by each of us with the world of energy and the stewardship of the environment. We also need to be less introspective and retrospective when it comes to energy and consider the sector in connection with the country's immediate and future needs, concerning both production and consumption. In this regard, the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico) contemplates that energy reform will begin to be designed in 2013 for the purpose of exchanging points of view and developing both the goals and the technical arguments to back it up. Once this effort is consolidated, the changes needed in the current legislation will be put forward. The reform proposal will be discussed, and we hope it can be passed in order to begin implementing the important transformations Mexico is expecting.</p><h4>What part will energy reform take in realizing the Pact for Mexico, and to what extent will the focus be placed on reducing the tax burden of PEMEX ahead of privatization measures?</h4><p>The Pact for Mexico is very clear regarding the timetable agreed upon for the reforms. It therein establishes that during 1H2013, design of the energy reform will begin, followed by an exchange of points of view, and the development of the technical objectives and arguments to back the proposal. Once this effort comes to fruition, necessary amendments to the legislation in force can be proposed. The reform proposal will be discussed, and we expect it to be approved so as to begin implementing the significant changes entailed. There is a significant difference between privatization and modernization. Privatization entails the transfer of property and operation of resources from a public agent to a private one. Modernization, on the other hand, reaffirms the state's stewardship of oil while at the same time seeking manners in which to improve the design and operation of the industry. This approach based on modernization lies at the heart of the reform. Thereby, reform is not a privatization mechanism; the objective is to modernize the sector and achieve the expansion of the benefit of our energy wealth. In this, President Peña Nieto has been very clear: PEMEX is not to be privatized, nor is it for sale.</p><h4>What continued levels of investment into deep-water reserves do you anticipate over the coming years, and how important will this remain to Mexico's long-term energy strategy?</h4><p>The worldwide energy environment has changed dramatically over the last decade. Readily accessible oil is fast disappearing and the world is now turning toward unconventional resources, including deep-water and ultra-deep-water oilfields. Mexico is not exempt from this change and has classified the potential of deep-water and ultra-deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as a priority. The recent discovery of the Trion and Supremus beds bode well for our potential in the Gulf of Mexico. The prospective resources of the exploration project Área Perdido, estimated at up to 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BoE), could double the current proven reserves of Mexico. In fact, approximately one-fourth of all prospective resources in the country are found in beds of this type; such is the scale and importance of deep-water oil drilling in Mexico. PEMEX faces huge challenges in deep water. Some experts have analyzed the constraints that such operations pose, such as a significant fiscal burden, a low level of budgetary and administrative autonomy, and the impossibility of scientific and technological development. All this has hindered us from gaining more experience in deep water. The challenge now is to grapple with these issues and increase our production in these zones so as to recover the frontline position of our industry. It is imperative that we increase our production in deep water and ultra-deep water at the same time as we draft a solid regulatory framework that will guarantee the security, sustainability, and transparency of operations in the sector. We must focus our efforts on preventing accidents, pursuing international standards, and strengthening our industrial safety and environmental protection processes at PEMEX. If we are to optimize our results in deep water, we must assign clear roles to the various stakeholders in the sector. That is, the regulatory agencies must act based on a clear and independent mandate from the operators and institutions in charge of promoting oil activities in deep water. Given the magnitude of the investment required, we need public agencies to oversee transparency and accountability, as is the case in other oil-producing nations. The Pact for Mexico also contemplates strengthening the industry's regulatory agencies, as well as sustainability ingrained in the processes and operations of PEMEX.</p><div class="quote">“The worldwide energy environment has changed dramatically over the last decade."</div><h4>The efficient exploitation of Mexico's shale gas reserves has the potential to transform Mexico's energy landscape. What measures should be taken to realize this potential?</h4><p>In 2010, PEMEX Exploración y Producción (PEP) began work to evaluate the potential linked to this resource. The geological zones of Sabinas, Burro-Picachos, Burgos, Tampico-Misantla, and Veracruz have been identified as oil and shale gas precursors. At present, an investment project is underway to determine the investment needed to carry out geological and geochemical studies as well as the acquisition, progression, and interpretation of 3D seismic information in areas deemed to have unconventional plays. The foregoing will give way to greater certainty regarding the estimates of oil, gas, and recoverable condensate volumes. Also scheduled is the drilling of exploration wells to prove the concept and productivity of the oil beds in the geological zones considered. These elements will make it possible to determine investment programs focusing on the regions offering the highest production potential. Before this happens, the rules for exploration and drilling must be expanded and applied to shale projects in order to reduce the impact on communities and the environment.</p><h4>What do you see as being the key opportunities for Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has great wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and hydraulic potential for power generation. Currently, 13% of all electrical power in the country is generated through alternative power sources, 10% of which takes place through the use of large hydroelectric plants. Nevertheless, this percentage can be increased through the participation of private investment, by making use of the power-generating schemes contemplated by the Electrical Power Public Service Act. In connection with energy efficiency, we must profit from technological advances in order to attain the full potential for savings in the domestic sector. We should also promote greater efficiency in transportation systems and in the construction of buildings. On the other hand, there is enormous potential within the energy sector itself, through achieving a reduction of transmission network losses, using intelligent networks to promote distributed generation, and substituting expensive fuels for lower-cost alternatives, such as natural gas and hydro-electricity for the generation of energy.</p><h4>What current key opportunities exist for the private sector in Mexico's energy industry?</h4><p>A modernizing reform, doubtless, will seek to increase autonomy in the administration of PEMEX. With increased autonomy, the company will be able to make decisions that will optimize its profitability. At the same time, this approach envisions the participation of the private and social sectors in the non-essential activities of PEMEX, as well as in projects that are not to be included in the investment portfolio. An initial step has already taken place as a result of the 2008 Reform, namely, the establishment of Comprehensive Contracts for Exploration and Production, permitting PEMEX to increase its execution capacity and remain the sole oil proprietor. In regard to the rest of the value chain, the Pact for Mexico mentions that the energy reform will seek to create an environment of competition in the economic processes of refining, petrochemicals, and transportation of oil and do so without privatizing PEMEX's assets. In this manner, the complementarity of public and private investment is sought.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends have you noticed in the market over 2012?<br></h4><p>We closed the year very well, with double-digit growth, which is very positive. There are still areas that we need to perform better in, and some aspects have to do with the political environment and public policies, especially in the energy sector. If as a country we solve the important challenges in the energy sector, then we will enable GE to grow in the gas-line construction sector. Expansion is critical for the country and critical for a company like ours and, of course, the oil and gas sector. However, it is very important to clarify that it is not a discussion about privatizing oil; the discussion is around what business models make sense for the energy mix. Over the last four years, GE has spent over $11 billion in acquisitions in the oil and gas sector, which has made our portfolio very robust. GE is now an important player in just about all aspects of the oil and gas industry. The company is well positioned with technology, products, people, and processes. From the macroeconomic perspective, the question of if we are losing ground to Brazil or not was more relevant in 2010 and 2011. Today, all of our macro indicators are positive, which are the inflation rate, interest rates, and GDP growth, which I would say is one of the best in the world. Mexico has grown as a robust manufacturing platform and it has diversified its trade balance. In the 1980s, it was based on oil and now that is a smaller part as it moves to mid-manufacturing integration, which is critical. Economically, I think the discussion of if we are okay and if we can perform is over. The issue now is how we are going to execute ideas that will improve GDP, which will bring wealth not only for GE, but for everyone in all sectors.</p><h4>Could you describe how you are improving your products, services, and technologies through innovation?</h4><p>The internet, intelligent machines, and large data analytics are shaping the future. That is how we are going to leverage all the statistics in the future. It is what we call the “industrial internet," and it is about getting intelligent machines to take advantage of the cloud. In regard to advanced analytical machines, we need people to work on translating all the data that come out of these machines. For example, one blade of our gas turbines produces 550 GB a day of information. The daily volume of Twitter posts is 80 GB. If one blade can create that much data, what are we using that data for? That is what industrial analytics is about. If we could use just 1% of that data to improve fuel savings, aviation, power, rail, productivity, and health care, we are talking about 15 years of savings worth billions of dollars. Why are we leading this as GE? Because we have everything; we have the machines, the technology, the software, the people, and now the analytical machines.</p><h4>What sort of investments are you making into R&amp;D?</h4><p>GE invests 6% of all its revenues into R&amp;D. It is one of the companies that invests the most in R&amp;D, and we have plans to make this figure higher. In 2012, we announced the opening of our offices in Silicon Valley. Mexico can bring in software capabilities and there are great opportunities. Also, everything that comes out of the office will be applied in Mexican hospitals and its oil and gas sector. This is where GE is going to leverage its research centers around the world. We even have an engineering center in Querétaro, and we get our people to implement solutions around the world. It is going to bring a lot of advantages to our customers.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has grown a robust manufacturing platform and it has diversified its trade balance."</div><h4>What opportunities are there for growth in sustainable energy generation formats, such as wind?</h4><p>In the spring of 2013, we are going to open a wind facility in Santa Catarina, Nuevo León. It will be a landmark in Monterrey and hopefully we will be able to announce others. Wind, according to different studies, is estimated to grow at a rate of 1 GW a year. From a worldwide perspective, we are number one in wind. In the US, we have been number one for some time, and in Europe, we are number two. Wind power is big, and Mexico should take advantage of the fact it has lots of it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your incoming strategy aimed at strengthening public finances?<br></h4><p>Our priority is to maintain healthy public finances. Thus, at the beginning of his administration, President Enrique Peña Nieto instructed a balanced budget for 2013. It encompassed an unaltered tax structure and a reduction of government debt. While we have been able to maintain fiscal stability, public expenditure—excluding PEMEX and CFE—has been less than 20% of GDP, while the average in Latin America is approximately 27% of GDP and 46% in OECD countries. This has impacted access to services such as education, health, infrastructure, and social security, among others. At the same time, Mexico still has a considerable margin to improve its tax revenue base; if we include tax revenues from oil, Mexico's income is close to 16% of GDP, but just 10% if we exclude it. These figures are low when compared with other economies; for example, the average levels of tax revenues in Latin America and OECD countries are close to 19% and 25% of GDP, respectively. Hence, there is a need for Mexico to implement a comprehensive and sound fiscal reform. On the expenditure side, in addition to the austerity guidelines established at the beginning of the administration, the government will adopt broader efficiency, transparency, and accountability measures. We will also follow the guiding principle that any increase in expenditure will be consistent with fiscal balance and a corresponding increment in revenues.<br></p><h4>How important a role will fiscal reform play in the government's strategy, and where do you want to see the most immediate changes?</h4><p>Fiscal reform will play a critical role in driving economic development, allowing us to increase those actions and programs that benefit the population in areas such as health, education, and social security, among others. At this moment, we are still analyzing the different alternatives. However, it is important to note that in order to maximize its effects, fiscal reform should involve all levels of government. We must ensure that both federal and local governments take part in this effort; especially considering that a significant margin to increase tax revenues lies at the subnational level. Therefore, effective coordination with local governments is vital for successful fiscal reform. Additionally, fiscal reform has to keep three other objectives in mind. First, it must simplify the current tax system because it has become very complicated as legal loopholes were closed in a piecemeal fashion. Second, we have to keep in mind that both the tax and spending structures change incentives for individuals to be in the formal sectors of the economy, so any reform has to reduce informality. Third, we need to make sure that it is a fair system as mandated by our constitution.</p><h4>Mexico's strength as a prime contender for regional economic prowess is to a large extent attributed to its overall fiscal stability. What role does the Secretariat play in supporting this?</h4><p>Mexico's macroeconomic stability will continue as a government priority. Our country has adopted important reforms to achieve this goal, such as providing statutory autonomy to the Banco de México; introducing a legal mandate for fiscal discipline; consolidating a free-floating exchange rate regime; introducing a defined-contribution pension system; and ensuring permanent efforts to maintain a sound regulatory framework for the financial system. In addition to all these policies, we have a two-year flexible credit line (FCL) for $73 billion with the IMF and international reserves at historical maximum levels of $165 billion. The capitalization levels of Mexican banks are higher than the regulatory minimums of 10.5% established in the Basel III agreements—Mexico is one of the few countries to have adopted Basel III requirements. Mexico has successfully tackled fiscal revenue risks related to oil prices through the derivative markets. Furthermore, Mexico has used catastrophe bonds and reinsurance schemes to transfer risks linked to natural disasters. These instruments have attracted international attention, positioning Mexico as a key player in natural disaster financial risk management</p><h4>What levels of growth do you project for the Mexican economy in 2013, and how do you foresee inflation rates impacting the economy?</h4><p>The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit's growth forecast for the national economy is 3.5% in 2013, well above the expected economic growth for most developed economies worldwide. Nevertheless, this is not enough. We need structural reforms in order to achieve higher economic growth to meet the challenges in education, health, and poverty alleviation in the coming years. Democratizing productivity is one of the main premises that will guide public policies conducted by the Secretariat in order to achieve the desired GDP growth. Democratizing productivity implies reforms to expand human capital through higher educational standards. It also means opening access to investments in the energy sector, higher investment in R&amp;D, and further financing options for social entrepreneurship. We are working to implement significant reforms to transform Mexico. Macroeconomic stability has had a positive impact resulting in moderate levels of inflation and lower country risk levels that have given Mexico access to cheaper external credit. A direct consequence of macroeconomic stability and low inflation are the historic low interest rates: 4.12% for short-term rates (CETES 28 days at February 28, 2013) in the secondary market; inflation is under control at below 4%, and is expected to drop to 3.66% in 2013; and the interest rate spread between domestic long-term bonds (10 years) and short-term bonds (one year) is 81 basis points (bps). At present, Mexico faces better financing conditions. On January 7, 2013, the federal government issued $1.5 billion in UMS Bonds due in 2044 at the lowest cost in history: the rate differential between the 30-year UMS Bond and the US Treasury Bond reached a historical minimum of 110 bps.</p><h4>Do you expect an upgrade in Mexico's sovereign rating in the medium term, and what sort of inward foreign investment flows do you expect looking ahead?</h4><p>Responsible economic policies in Mexico have allowed us to maintain low debt levels and a sustainable fiscal balance. At the same time, our country has experienced a period of macroeconomic stability, with low inflation and interest rates, as well as a flexible exchange rate, which has worked as a buffer in periods of financial stress. The domestic sector in Mexico has expanded, which has been supported by an increase in employment and credit. These factors, along with the recent approvals of the labor and education reforms, as well as the reforms that will take place in 2014, will improve our sovereign rating. Looking ahead, we expect that foreign investment flows will continue increasing as a result of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and the implementation of structural reforms that will enhance investor confidence in Mexico.</p><h4>To what extent do you think that Mexico will remain vulnerable to volatile business cycles in developed economies such as the US?</h4><p>Mexico's economic growth is highly integrated with the US business cycle, particularly in the manufacturing sector. A downturn in the US economy is likely to affect the country's economic performance. However, in recent years, domestic demand has grown stronger, supported by increasing competitiveness. At the same time, Mexico has diversified its export portfolio to reduce such vulnerability. Also, historically high international reserves coupled with the recent renewal of the IMF's Flexible Credit Line and the flexible exchange rate mechanism are important tools that may mitigate any external economic and financial shocks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-enviable-position]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you believe are the strengths of the Mexican economy?<br></h4><p>Mexico has a very stable and positive government administration that has inherited a solid fiscal position. The government has been responsible with spending, and it is now occupying an enviable position when compared to the standards of many countries with stable government expenditures and revenues. There are a variety of Mexican states that have financial difficulties, but overall Mexico is fiscally sound. Inflation is trending in the right direction and the country can be proud of its accomplishments. This will help in the long run with interest rates as inflation continues to be the focus of the Banco de México. The government is also working to introduce additional reforms, which could certainly help the growth of the economy. Mexico should grow in the 3%-4% range in 2012, and the opportunity for Mexico to grow at a 5%-6% range is within the country's reach. The government's current combination of a strong fiscal situation and very sound inflation control has led to the growth of internal demand. The base and competitiveness of the Mexican economy is continuing to be strong relative to the competitive forces that may be found in Asia, which are increasing the cost of manufacturing there. We are also seeing an increase of manufacturing in Mexico. Work is coming back onshore again.</p><h4>What has been your incoming strategy in the dynamic Mexican market?</h4><p>Our main strategy has been to fine-tune our value propositions for our customers. We know that there are many banks in the Mexican market, and customers—whether they are large, medium, or small—have many choices. Our clientele can choose banks, products, and services at a varied price and level, and our strategy has been to refine what we offer. We want to fine-tune our segmentation and find the best package of products with the right channels and prices so that we can serve the customers with the right access points. Increasingly in banking, it is important for banks to be pro-active and anticipate the needs of customers with regard to age, socioeconomic level, and status in life. Each life stage has a different requirement, and it is important for us to be able to anticipate the needs of our customers. The best example of where things are changing for customers is on the channel side. Even Mexico, which used to be known as a bricks-and-mortar type of market where people went to the branches to pay bills, cash checks, withdraw money, or make deposits, is becoming increasingly similar to many other countries in Scandinavia or Europe. There is a lot of penetration in terms of the use of online and mobile banking. Considering that Mexico has 115 million inhabitants and 40 million people online, more people are using the web to research and understand banking products and services. There are approximately 20 million online banking customers across the sector in Mexico, making it a very fast growing segment—some banks registered double-digit growth. The banks have increased the presence of ATMs significantly so that people don't have to go to branches. We recently signed an agreement with a third-party company called OXXO, which allows us to use their 12,000 stores to make payments and pay credit card bills.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the move to acquire Crédito Familiar? Will you make further acquisitions?</h4><p>Crédito Familiar is designed for us to be able to service the D segment of the socioeconomic scale in Mexico. Scotiabank has generally been associated with the A, B, and C markets because of the products and credit that we offer. With Crédito Familiar, we have launched operations in a whole new market segment, which offers a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to provide lending, which can be in smaller amounts that are used to buy basic goods. It is a market that we don't know very well in Mexico, but we are very familiar with its equivalent in Central and South America and the Caribbean, where we have an extremely well-developed consumer banking segment. This is something we are bringing to Mexico and we expect it to grow rapidly. We expect to also graduate approximately 10% of our customers out of Crédito Familiar to the main bank on an annual basis. There is a great opportunity for us there, and much that we can build. As a result, we can penetrate a new segment of the economy and that is also a largely unbanked group, so it is a great opportunity to attract customers as they become more prosperous and their household incomes grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What industries do you believe have the most growth potential in Mexico?<br></h4><p>Heavy manufacturing has been something that Mexico has become very competitive in—specifically auto parts, automotive production, glass, and domestic appliances. We are huge exporters of industrial service goods that form part of the global supply chain. Some companies within that sector are already public, such as ALFA. I believe that more companies will go public in the future. Mexico has definitely become competitive, even as the country faces several challenges. One is the delivery of natural gas, which is very cheap in North America, but there are not enough pipelines in Mexico for the transportation of this resource. PEMEX is confident that by the end of 2013 the problem will be solved and we will have access to affordable gas in the future. This will increase the competitiveness of Mexico's industry.</p><h4>What are the main activities the BMV is currently focusing on?</h4><p>We recently renewed our trading system. The new system has the speed and capacity to process 500 times what we were doing previously. This new system was launched in September 2012, and it has been very successful thus far. We are at the forefront of technology, even though we are a small exchange. With Mexican companies growing in line with predictions, the demand for capital is growing and must be met by expanding the exchange. Even international companies have been using the BMV, including Spanish developer OHL and Santander, which has been the largest listing ever on the BMV. We are very positive that new companies will come and look for growth, equity, and debt on the BMV.</p><h4>Despite the relative strength of the market, IPO levels have been constrained. What challenges do further listings face?</h4><p>The number of listings depends very heavily on the economy; as it grows, we will see more listings. Medium-sized firms reach a certain level where they simply cannot grow further without financing—they need capital and they come to the exchange. We have seen several SMEs tap into the exchange, as well as larger ones such as petrochemical company ALPEK from Monterrey. In addition, Sports World recently used the exchange to expand its operations. Following this trend, I firmly believe that the exchange will grow substantially in the coming years.</p><h4>The Sustainability Index was launched at the end of 2011. What factors spurred the launch of the index and what is its significance for the BMV?</h4><p>The idea is that sustainability should be a part of doing business. The index is not only a green index, but it also has to do with corporate governance and community relations. If a company has excellent corporate governance, maintains a positive relationship with the community, and follows more than the basic rules by going that extra mile in terms of the environment, it can be listed on the index. One of the nice things about the index is that we don't decide who gets listed—the matter is decided by UK firm IRIS and a host of Mexican universities. Therefore, the index is very neutral.</p><h4>In what ways would the proposed Volcker Rule, which bans proprietary trading, impact the BMV and other exchanges around the region?</h4><p>I think the Volcker Rule will impact exchanges globally in terms of less trading, but at the same time the Dodd-Frank legislation regarding the regulation of the OTC markets will imply more trading in established derivatives markets. We have a clearing house for derivatives, so that will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the exchange. We have huge fixed income and interest rate swap markets in Mexico.</p><h4>What new instruments and platforms are being developed to drive the evolution of the stock exchange?</h4><p>One new instrument is the Development Capital Certificate (CKD), which is an open-ended equity vehicle. Investors are able to invest in private equity funds or open infrastructure projects that are not yielding a certain return yet, but will yield a return in the future. We have also developed real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Mexico for the first time. So far, they have been very successful and have shown excellent returns—in 2011, we saw 20%. There are now several REITs in the  pipeline.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mexico such a strong market for Nissan?<br></h4><p>We are neighbors to one of the biggest markets in the world, the US. To the south, we have a strong Latin American market that is buying close to 7 million units per year. Having 44 free trade agreements (FTAs) throughout the globe also provides great conditions for exports in Mexico. There have always been a lot of connections and trade between the cultures of Japan and Mexico. Nissan came to Mexico because of a trade mission for the Japanese government 60 years ago and decided to stay. The relevance of Mexico for Nissan is very important. We are a major generator of domestic volumes, selling about 250,000 units per year. Our production is almost 700,000 units, which we expect to grow to over 1 million in the medium term. The talent pool has grown and now Mexico is exporting talent to other operations instead of the other way around. Our latest investment is a new manufacturing complex opening in Aguascalientes, which was announced in January 2011. It is an investment of $2 billion and will start operations in December 2013. Phase I will produce over 175,000 units. In parallel, we are building a plant in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and Mexico is training the people who will work there. Mexico is absolutely becoming a center of expertise for Nissan around the globe. Our supplier base around our industry in Aguascalientes is also creating strength. We will triple our purchasing power here in the next five years, so we need the suppliers to invest in technology to give us the power to produce more vehicles in the future. This is a very successful and interesting story. We want to be the best in everything we do. We work hard and our plan is to be the best. If we are even number two, we try to figure out how we can be number one. “Good enough" is not enough. All of our 13,000 employees work hard to be the best and we are proud of them.</p><h4>What can be done to overcome the challenges posed to the industry by the lack of new car purchasers in the internal market?</h4><p>The reality is that we have a wave of products coming from the US that really limits domestic sales in Mexico. When we consider how many people we need to sell a car in Mexico compared to other markets, we come to a figure of 120. Japan, Germany, and the UK might need between 25 and 30 people. Compared to similar economies, we are right in line. The government is aware of this situation. I hope it will try to limit the number because the benefits are there. If you increase local demand, you have more people with the possibility of owning a new car. We need more competitive financing to get people in the middle class to buy a new car and help us limit the impact of the invasion of used cars from the US. It will not be a normal flow of growth. It will be achieved by limiting certain structural situations and the banking and financing community need to develop more attractive financing to get people into new cars. If we do both things at the same time, it will boost the industry and we will get closer to our full potential. We will be a country that soon produces close to 4 million cars locally. If you generate more sales, it generates more employment, which generates wealth, which attracts foreign investment. It is a cycle. Everyone will benefit. There is little poverty in Japan; most of the people are in the middle class. In Mexico, we are trying to generate wealth by getting our middle class into their own houses and cars. With 115 million people, we have huge potential. We need education and the conditions for these people to get active in credit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the development and role of the Center of Advanced Technology (CIATEQ)?<br></h4><p>We are a non-profit organization dedicated to R&amp;D in order to enhance industrial competitiveness. We were established in conjunction with a network of public research centers connected to the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). The research center's network covers three sectors: technology, science, and society. CIATEQ belongs to the technological sector. Out of the 27 centers, CIATEQ has been the most successful in creating links, which means working for the productive sector in Mexico. CIATEQ has been able to generate 75% of its own budget, and there are not many centers like this in Mexico. Spanish centers usually generate 50% of their income, and the rest is financed by the government, whereas we only receive 25% from the government. CIATEQ has developed more than 3,000 products, and we have provided more than 35,000 services to industry and have a list of 2,800 customers. There is not a single state in Mexico where we do not have a customer.</p><h4>What growth have you been witnessing in the local industrial sector?</h4><p>The local industrial sector has been growing continuously for the last 20 years. The main supply chain for the automotive industry is one of the most important areas of development and growth in our region, and recently, we were involved in and witnessed the development of the aerospace industry, which has been acting as a catalyst for industry. CIATEQ has been one of the key actors, promoting the sustainable growth of these sectors.</p><p>The central region of Mexico has been very successful at attracting investments and creating new jobs. Querétaro is close to a 0% unemployment rate, one of the lowest in the country, and these kind of results come from an environment that facilitates the establishment of new business opportunities and promotes the sustainable growth and investment in innovation, due to government actions, the safety standards of the community and Querétaro's hard-working society. CIATEQ started here more than 34 years ago, and now we are present in seven states of Mexico, like San Luis Potosí­, Aguascalientes, Mexico State, Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Jalisco, some of the most productive regions in the country.</p><div class="quote">“The central region of Mexico has been very successful at attracting investments and creating new jobs."</div><h4>You developed a technological management model unique to Mexico. Can you tell me about that?</h4><p>We have focused on two things: we have a Director of Design that works directly with the market, and we have six Specialty Directors that work on improving the scientific level of each technology we have. It is not common in a public research center in Mexico to have a marketing department. We have a corporate affairs director that handles our relationship with the government and with the industry so that we help them meet their needs. As a public research center in Mexico, we are devoted to education. We offer Master's and PhD studies in the advancement of factories, where we have a special approach; all of our students are the employees of our customers. We offer each student a scholarship, and the only requirement we have is that their thesis theme needs to be the definition of a problem at the company and the development of a solution that increases its competitiveness. The results come in the long term. We focus on helping people who are working in a company and who have never had the opportunity to get a degree due to their responsibilities. We created a special three-year program where employees can come to class on Saturday. It is offered to employees in Mexico, but you don't have to be a Mexican citizen. Instead of entrance exams, we have prerequisite courses in math and statistics, where everyone who approved these courses gets admitted to the program. Today, we have 75 students admitted to the Master's program, and 80 more applying to the prerequisite courses. We are opening this program in our facilities at Guadalajara, Jalisco.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Telmex story?</h4><p>Telmex was a public enterprise that was privatized in December 1990; Grupo Carso was awarded the tender process in partnership with France Télécom and the Southwestern Bell Corporation, today's AT&amp;T. Back in the 1990s, Telmex was a very outdated IT company in terms of technological usage and equipment, therefore we had to modernize the company at all levels; management, technology, and business practices. For that reason, our main priority was to invest in the company's modernization from the technological point of view, as well as to train our workforce to adapt themselves to the company's new practices and levels of technology. We had around 50,000 employees; the main concern was to improve on education standards. Right after the takeover we established the Instituto Tecnológico de Teléfonos de México (Inttelmex), our own training and education facility that has become a leading institution in its sector. Since 1990 up to now, the educational average level increased from 5.9 to 16 years of education. When we acquired Telmex, the company was ranked around 60th in a worldwide ranking—in 2000 we were top of the league, according to Forbes and in 2012 this was reaffirmed by the World Finance Telecoms Awards. This period proved to be a very critical moment for the company. We needed to heavily invest in many fields. Telmex and Telcel have invested more than $44 billion in the Mexican IT sector since 1991, a period of 22 years in which the IT sector has become very competitive, attracting foreign players. We have supported the development of telecommunications and broadband services in all market segments nationwide, covering more than 105 million Mexicans. Telmex's investments represent over 80% of the sector's overall levels. Today, our company reaches over 97% of Mexico's population, and we take our social responsibility to serve the Mexican people in terms of connectivity and digital culture and education, as well as in national social programs, seriously. At the same time, we are pioneers in many fields worldwide, and, for example, Telcel was the first company in the world to introduce pre-paid mobile telephone services in 1996.</p><h4>What are the main developments you have seen in Mexico in terms of the provision of broadband services, and what role has Telmex played in this context?</h4><p>We started offering broadband services in 2001, four years later than the cable operators in the country. Back then, Telmex had around 67,000 clients, whereas our competitors had around 165,000. In terms of market share, we had around 28%. However, if we look at figures from 2011, Telmex owns more than a 70% market share—we have reversed roles. Investment and more investment has been key in this process, and I am proud to say that thanks to our growth and development the broadband segment in Mexico has been growing at an annual rate of around 54% over the 2002-2011 period, which represented one of the highest growth rates in the world.</p><h4>What are the main lines of investment Telmex prioritizes for the future?</h4><p>Today, we put a lot of emphasis on investing in cultural and educational programs, such as digital libraries. We believe it is a natural step after experiencing such impressive growth in segments such as broadband. In this regard, we need to strengthen broadband penetration in the low-end market spheres of the country, an area where the main hurdle to overcome is the low purchasing power of Mexican families and the lack of computers in households. The National Institute for Statistics and Demographics (INEGI) says that there are only 10 million households with a computer in Mexico, whereas there are over 30 million households in the country. Telmex has played a key role in increasing the number of computers in family units by selling them through economic programs that enabled families to pay them back little by little through their telephone bills. In fact, we have financed over 3.5 million computers in Mexico from 1999 up until today. Therefore, we will keep a strong focus on increasing penetration rates in these segments. For that reason, at the moment we are also heavily investing in digital culture and internet programs. Today, more than 86% of internet users utilize it for entertainment purposes, and we need to boost the number of people who use it for other applications such as e-government, e-banking, e-health, and e-education. According to the ITU's Measuring the Information Society 2011, only 1.2% of Mexico's population uses the internet for government-related purposes, whereas the same figure in Europe stands at around 46%, Brazil 11%, and Chile 12%. At the same time, only 18% of Mexico's primary schools have internet access. Therefore, Mexico has great development opportunities in the segments that depend on current penetration rates as well as educational programs, because we have the necessary infrastructure that let us create massive events of digital culture such as Aldea Digital Telcel 4GLTE - infinitum (Digital Village), which received more than 154,000 visitors and obtained the Guiness World Record as the largest worldwide event of digital inclusion.</p><h4>What role is Telmex playing in developing educational facilities in this sector?</h4><p>Telmex is playing a key role in this process, and we have launched more than 3,600 digital classroom/libraries; we worked with public schools, Telmex Classrooms, among others in the country by providing computers and broadband access, and we have already facilitated with this program internet access for more than 3 million people. Also, we developed over 350 educational workshops to provide scientific and mathematics education to children. We also spent time training teachers to be ready for these workshops. Finally, we also developed specific management software for schools and teachers to optimize their time, resources, and workload. Over the years, both teachers and pupils under Telmex programs have been nationally and internationally recognized. According to our research, students' performance in the “Enlace" educational evaluation and their learning curve has improved by 35% thanks to our programs, something that has also been seen in the national exams the government carries out. We additionally developed an educational network at the higher education level in order to boost knowledge and technological exchange: its name is Académica. Today, there are over 260 universities at the international level that—free of charge—are part of this technology platform. In addition, we have developed our institution to a higher education level, and those interested can even take MA courses in the Inttelmex IT free of charge. These are just some of the initiatives we are heavily focusing on at the moment. However, we constantly develop other social and educational projects nationally and internationally, such as an alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/OCW) for the development of online higher education, as well as an educational collaboration agreement.</p><h4>How significant is the expansion of the Triara Data Center you carried out in 2012 for the company's future?</h4><p>Through América Móvil, there are seven Data Centers that operate across Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru which are very important for our services and activities, especially due to our commitment to keep improving IT services for our customers. This allows us to guarantee our residential and global corporate customers total certainty and security in safeguarding their information, which is their most valuable asset and where we offer practically unlimited hosting. Additionally, all of América Móvil's Data Centers are interconnected and therefore we are able to offer these services within our territory as well as abroad, which is a huge competitive advantage for us. In Mexico, we have almost 17,000 m2 of Data Centers which are located in two different cities: Querétaro and Monte- rrey, which have the highest quality international standards and certifications in terms of information security, service management, quality, environmental and infrastructure as ICREA Level 5 Certification (HSHA-WCQA: High Security High Available World Class Quality Assurance), ISO 27001, Structured Cabling (BELDEN, TYCO, ADC), ISO 9001, SAS-70, NFPA 75, ISAE 3402, ITIL, CDCP, CCNA, CCNP and Microsoft. In fact, broadband and Data Centers represent two of the main areas of investment for the company.</p><h4>What has been Telmex's approach to the development of the national wi-fi network in public places?</h4><p>Currently, we have more than 8.6 million broadband clients. That means that they all have wi-fi services in their homes—either wired or wireless. On top of that, Telmex has more than 5,400 public wi-fi spots that are continuously growing. They are located in key areas such as universities, airports, parks, public areas and service stations. We have more than 4.8 million connections to our many wi-fi spots every month.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for 2013 for both Telmex and the telecommunications industry?</h4><p>I believe that the sector requires higher levels of investment at all levels in order to further boost its development, because we have to keep in mind that without constant investment our sector cannot be competitive. At the same time, Mexico lags in telecommunications multi services. I believe that operators need to be granted the right to offer all services accompanied with a regulation that gives incentives to invest in order to increase the infrastructure. I truly believe that such a process would boost investment, creativity, flexibility, and development in the sector, and in the end, the main beneficiary would be the consumer and the country. It is a win-win situation for everybody.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Mexican market for Xerox?<br></h4><p>The past year has been very special for Xerox Mexico given that we celebrated our 50th anniversary. This event was extremely important for us because Mexico is our oldest affiliate in Latin America and one of our oldest affiliates in the world. Mexico continues to be one of the most important markets for Xerox, as it is where we first began in the Latin American market, and we continue developing our services widely throughout the region. Overall, 2012 was not only important to us because we celebrated our anniversary, but also because we launched several initiatives related to this milestone. We are taking advantage of our 50 years of experience. Our track record of operations provides us with the experience, talent, and the different aspects that we need in order to replicate and develop in other Latin American markets. As a company, we have evolved tremendously, and since we are a technology-oriented organization we have always been at the forefront and kept up with the market's rapid pace. We have had significant technological launches in products and services, and this has helped us to evolve year after year, always looking for a way to reinvent ourselves from a quality perspective, yet maintain the ethical values that are at our core.</p><h4>In what ways is Xerox Mexico trying to evolve brand perception?</h4><p>One of our main initiatives is to build a different image for Xerox. We are proud of our reputation for service and technology, but one of the main ideas that customers have about Xerox is that we are primarily focused on equipment. This is particularly due to the photocopy machine, which the company invented a long time ago, and is naturally part of our legacy. However, Xerox has developed many other lines of business over the last few years, and we want to get the word out about what kind of solutions we can provide to the market and all of the other high-end technology we continue to develop. Three years ago we completed the acquisition of ACS, which has been renamed Xerox Services. This component of the company is completely integrated and offers customer care, information technology outsourcing (ITO), and business process outsourcing (BPO). We continue to expand our portfolio of solutions as we target bigger markets and invest in countries like Mexico. Xerox Mexico has offered the Mexican market end-to-end solutions for companies of all sizes, not just in document printing, but also in integrated approaches to document management, including development, distribution, storage, sharing, and reuse. While the printing market is still very relevant, we are developing more solutions aimed toward the flow of user information, serving both types of market demands. In our business model, the channel represents all that is end-user facing and coverage, which is why one of our main priorities is to continually develop business strategies and programs that provide training and tangible benefits to our business partners. With this, we expect to achieve engagement and loyalty toward our brand and to offer the best service to our end users. Xerox Partner Print Services (XPPS) is the next generation of solutions for Managed Print Services with the Xerox brand for the channel, sharing our global expertise and proven technology with the Mexican market through certified distributors. We also offer our clients an extensive array of communications and marketing services, which are implemented through our high-end technology and support of consultants. These services are intended to help our clients generate 360° communications with all of their users and customers, sharing the right message, at the right time, to the right market segment. Our processes enable us to create personalized content offering results and benefiting brand maintenance while reducing production costs. As an example in Mexico, the telecommunications and retail industries have experienced significant success using our communications and marketing services, reducing costs and time by 30% and 42%, respectively.</p><h4>Today, the company makes half of its revenues from business processes. How significant will this area be in the future?</h4><p>Half of our revenue streams come from services. The technology stream remains very strong and we intend to maintain it as a driver in our business. However, the business services line is providing us with strong leverage. We are capable of offering end-to-end BPO solutions for small, medium, and large corporations for all back office needs. Some examples include invoicing, delivering, and storing accounting information and sharing it with customers. We provide support on how to improve productivity for current business processes, and we externalize these solutions to help keep our clients focused on their core business. The company's broad portfolio includes a wide array of both human resources solutions and accounting solutions. In ITO, we are able to provide the full outsourcing of data centers, including assets acquisition, IT experts, and numerous additional processes. We are investing substantially in the call center business and are evaluating how to make this business line grow within the Mexican market. We could say our sights are set on every potential market because we serve all industries, such as manufacturing, banking and finance, and telecommunications, and we are considering venturing into mining. There is no one-size solution for all, but we can offer customized solutions that are applicable toward any industry. At this time, we are focused on serving the needs of SMEs, where we have found a natural segment given the conditions that we have, not just as a country, but as a region that is growing quickly.</p><h4>How sophisticated is the Mexican market in terms of demand for back-office business processes?</h4><p>Mexico is a mature market compared to the rest of Latin America. Compared to the rest of the world, we believe we need to explore the level of maturity in different business lines. The market trend is pointing in this direction and the Mexican market demands these kinds of solutions, but we need to work with our customers to develop these support and consulting services. Customers know what they need, but Xerox needs to work with them to develop solutions. They need help identifying where and how to apply the solutions. We help them understand how they can be more productive by implementing innovative solutions.</p><h4>What are some of the innovations you have brought to the market recently?</h4><p>Currently, we are working aggressively toward communicating the solutions we offer to the market, all aimed at raising awareness. Many solutions are available worldwide, but the local market continues to lack many services. One of the critical key performance indicators is how to monitor the implementation of business solutions. On PowerPoint, every solution works, but when you start implementing and integrating critical processes, it's not the same. You need the infrastructure, experience, and talented people to do it right, and this is what we can offer. We have a strong presence in Mexico, and with over 4,000 employees we are capable of offering solutions that go from design to implementation. As we work with more companies, we also grow and learn, and since every customer is different, we learn from every experience we encounter. In the past, on the technology side, we launched something new every year; now we release new products every quarter. We developed a new, environmentally friendly way of printing, called “ColorQube." This technology uses solid ink, like a crayon, which can be used instead of toner. ColorQube is one of our biggest investments in the last five years, and we have a family of products that are 100% environmentally friendly, from the production of the cartridges, to the consumables, to the energy used. One of our advantages is that we have narrowed the space between black and white and color with these new developments, and we are very proud of that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[playing-down-the-channels]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the growth the local insurance industry has experienced in recent years?<br></h4><p>Over the last 10 years, the industry has lost weight within the national economy in general terms. Although it has grown every single year, growth figures have only been single digit, as compared to other regional markets such as Brazil and Colombia. Nevertheless, Mexico is the second largest economy in the region, and that is enough to attract all the large international companies. At the moment, there are 106 insurance companies in the market, among them many multinationals. For example, around 70% of the premiums in the market belong to foreign companies. Interestingly, companies that were leading the market a decade ago are today in the hands of foreign enterprises. We have seen an important increase in the number of players in the sector. In the past, the five leading companies owned 65% of the market, whereas now they only own 45%. For these reasons, and some others, we believe that the Mexican insurance market is very attractive at the moment, and we have high hopes for the future. In terms of Mapfre's performance, we have grown above the industry's level for the last 10 years, and that is something we have always prioritized in our business strategy. In nominal terms, we grew by 22% during 2012, whereas the sector expanded by 14%. Vehicle insurance products, among others, considerably grew last year, and we believe that automotive insurance and individual life insurance are the segments that will drive the growth of the industry over the next few years.</p><h4>What have been Mapfre's main strategies to expand demographically and geographically?</h4><p>Branch network expansion has been one of the main priorities of the company in recent years. For example, we closed 2012 with 425 branches across the country, of which 100 are what we call direct offices. They provide regional support and coverage to smaller branches, while they also strengthen interconnectivity within offices and the headquarters on all levels; customer support and insurance queries, for example. Such network expansion was frameworked as the first step to later increase our participation in the micro insurance segment. It is a market that offers many opportunities, especially since 2008, when new regulatory policies came into effect. Today, Mapfre is the leading company in the micro insurance segment, where we own approximately a 40% market share. I would like to say that Mapfre sees huge future potential within the catastrophe insurance segment, where we are already fairly active. However, in order to fully exploit its potential, I believe it needs to reduce costs, because at the moment it is very expensive in Mexico. Overall, I think we have succeeded in making Mapfre a multichannel insurance company that emphasizes its work for the customer's benefit. Mapfre is a leading company worldwide in terms of innovation, and we aim at standardizing insurance processes in order to make things more comfortable for our clients. For that reason, innovation plays a key role in our business strategy around the world. We have a special department in charge of such duties that is in permanent contact with the company's other areas to better analyze client needs and future demands. Technology is key within this strategy, and Mapfre is developing three technological centers worldwide in Spain, Sío Paolo, and Miami. Mexico will be linked to the latter.</p><h4>What role should the Mexican government play in supporting private companies to reduce catastrophe insurance costs?</h4><p>From the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutes (AMIS), we are in the process of compiling data from insurers about the current model of coverage in this segment and whether it addresses the current needs of the market. Particularly, I believe we need to change the current coverage model and look into other market models, such as Spain, in order to change this insurance segment in Mexico. In this regard, I think we need to standardize and reduce insurance rates in this particular segment, and take the example of markets such as Spain, France, or even Florida in the US. Such measures are very much needed, especially for a country like Mexico, which has thousands of kilometers of coastline and there are many people, either as individuals or companies, linked to the tourism sector.</p><h4>On a general level, what can be done to further develop the insurance sector in Mexico and create a better insurance culture among the public?</h4><p>I believe we need to pass the draft laws that are currently being discussed at the national level. In fact, the law on insurance institutions (LISF) can soon become a reality. Such steps will represent a turning point for the industry, laying the foundations for the future development of the sector, as we talk about a more modern and efficient regulatory framework for the industry. We can also talk about the future liability law for drivers on federal roads, which I believe will soon come into effect. This law will force all the vehicles on Mexico's roads to have insurance, and that is something very promising for the sector, because currently, of the 32 million vehicles that circulate in Mexico, only around 27% are currently insured. Such a law is a very important step not only for insurance companies, but for society too. These are just some examples, and there are other potential laws such as labor and federal roads laws that will contribute to the development of the insurance industry in Mexico. It does not only depend on the economic growth of the country in itself, but it needs structural reforms in terms of law too. Mexico is the 14th largest economy in the world; however, it ranks 64th in terms of insurance premiums.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for Mapfre and the insurance industry in Mexico for 2013?</h4><p>We are very hopeful to see some of the above mentioned draft laws to become a reality, especially the one regarding liability for drivers. In terms of growth, we expect the sector to close 2013 with a similar growth rate as in 2012—14%-15%. If the laws come into effect, I believe the sector can even grow at a faster pace. Mexico, in general terms, is economically expanding, and there are some very active sectors such, as automotive and construction. That is definitely contributing to boost activity in the domestic market, and it is obvious that the insurance industry can benefit from such activity. The country grew approximately 4% in 2012, and we believe that it can be a very positive year for our industry. Regarding Mapfre, we expect to grow between 18% and 21% in 2013, giving continuity to the expansion of the company in recent years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Shell has made significant investments in the past. We have a contract with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) to supply LNG, and we have made significant investments in that area. The future depends on how the energy sector evolves. The expectation is that energy reforms will take place in the near future, and we will be following the debate and outcome of the discussion very closely with the intention of continuing to expand our operations in Mexico.</p><h4>The development of Mexico's untapped gas reserves remains the subject of much speculation. What can be done to capitalize on the opportunities that exist?</h4><p>I think Mexico needs to sit down, take a pause, look at successful examples like Colombia or Brazil, and decide what it wants to adopt from these models to create its own. Then, companies like Shell will be able to make a decision on whether to participate and to what extent. We are very keen on working and cooperating with Mexico just as we have in the past. We run a refinery with PEMEX in the US, and our contract with the CFE is also very significant—we would like to continue these relationships. PEMEX has done a great job so far, but the challenges moving forward are so big that no company can do it alone. We are hopeful that energy reforms will take place in the near future that will allow Mexico to tap into its hydrocarbon resources.</p><h4>What potential exists for Mexico to become a significant regional player?</h4><p>I think that the potential is huge provided the regulatory framework that will be put in place is competitive against other models around the world. The knock-on effect of capital investment in the energy sector will have an impact on the rest of Mexico's economy and allow it to continue growing at a very accelerated pace. Health, education, and energy are the key sectors of any economy, and in the case of Mexico, energy is very important. If it were to be developed more intensively, it would create an impressive virtuous cycle.</p><div class="quote">“The knock-on effect of capital investment in the energy sector will have an impact on the rest of Mexico's economy."</div><h4>What are your key ongoing projects and development plans?</h4><p>We are always looking for new opportunities in Mexico. At the moment, we have a few projects in the pipeline. One is called the Mexico Sourcing Office (MSO). Shell has identified four locations in the world where we would like to develop suppliers: Russia, China, India, and Mexico. We are bringing local companies that are established in Mexico up to Shell standards so that they can compete in Shell's international tenders. We are making sure that suppliers buy into Shell's code of conduct and principles, and then we certify them. It is a project that will hopefully not only benefit Shell, but other international oil companies (IOCs) around the world. It will allow them to compete in other international bids as well. We have a team here devoted just to this project and to working with companies in Mexico to make sure they are up to speed. We have a large operation in the US and in Canada, making Mexico very well placed. The labor force is strong and Mexico is very competitive in that regard. Even with the lack of pipeline infrastructure, we are looking on the gas side to see if we can establish or expand the usage of LNG, both in industry and transport. Gas is very competitive price wise. It is more efficient, cleaner, and there is the potential for users to make big savings. It is an area that we are again slowly opening up. I think Shell is probably the first IOC that is tapping into this new business, and it takes a long time and a lot of commitment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is unique about doing business in Mexico, and how does Petrolink deal with these challenges?<br></h4><p>First of all, I would say the contracting system required to work for PEMEX; it is very complex. Plus, there are many things to be taken into account, such as the fees and taxes that are rarely included in the budget of a company that has no experience in Mexico, as well as the different regulations such as environmental ones, which can be tighter than in Europe in regard to areas where drilling activity is not allowed. These aspects have an impact on the financial and operational side of the business. Second, I would say that PEMEX is really demanding in terms of the quality of the information that is taken into account to make decisions. We specialize in collecting and aggregating the data and information at the well-site—at the point of acquisition. That has been the key to getting our reputation with PEMEX. It is also unique because in Mexico, doing business is very personal, and it requires a lot of energy to build relationships. We make ourselves known at PEMEX by fostering relationships locally and visiting the different functional levels from the regulator units through senior management to project leaders, specialists, and field engineers at the user level.</p><h4>What products do you offer?</h4><p>In Mexico we provide much more than products. Our services are based on two key elements: first the technology platform that we generate ourselves through a robust international development team; and second the excelling engineering capabilities and data quality expertise provided through our own unique methodologies. The service lines demanded in Mexico can be divided in two. The first one is static data and information management, where we support exploration and production operations and take control of the data and the information as it is generated, which is basically technical and operational information related to projects and wells intervention. The second one is real-time drilling data, monitoring, and engineering services. In both cases, technology is very important. In terms of the real-time data provision, we are probably the main supporter of PEMEX initiatives to work with well-site information transfer standard markup language (WITSML), which is the industry standard for doing data transmission. We are probably the only provider using the 1.3.1 version. We are working very hard now to make ourselves more competitive and bring to Mexico in 2013 the 1.4.1 version for the very first time.</p><h4>How would the new governmental reforms change your business model?</h4><p>We are going to start serving other operators. It will depend on the Mexican rules as to what size operators they will attract. We have experience with small and major operators in the international arena. For example, Petrofac is already operating in the southern region. We are looking to serve them with our service, but by using a business model more related to products. However, PEMEX will always be the owner of the hydrocarbons, and therefore it will have to keep control. We are starting to think about new solutions and schemes where we can sell for third parties, but still create a benefit for PEMEX. The future is very positive for Petrolink right now. As an international company, we are very respectful of local decisions, and we are more interested on focusing ourselves on what will be the next scenario. The reality is that the industry is in need of a profound change—the whole hydrocarbons industry, not only the E&amp;P of oil and gas.</p><h4>Aside from the hydrocarbons reforms, what is Petrolink's strategy for growth over the medium term?</h4><p>We are developing a market strategy and specific products for the new players that will take advantage of our knowledge of how PEMEX likes to work. Also, we really believe in technology. It is one of the main points that we want to elevate in importance. We as a generator of technology are going to invest a lot of money here. We opened our development team in Mexico two years ago as a satellite of our main center in Indonesia, and we are thinking of expanding by hiring local people. That is our strategy to provide more technology, which is accessible and adapted to the environment of PEMEX.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[reservoir-of-faith]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities might the energy reforms open up for Fermaca?</h4><p>For a long time, the energy infrastructure of our country has been eroding away and always falling short of the expanding national needs. Even worse, in the last 10 years, crude oil production has declined alarmingly and Mexico is importing increasing amounts of liquid fuels, petrochemicals, and now natural gas. The causes include a lack of investment and a vicious cycle where 40% of the federal government's budget depends on PEMEX, because the government is hard-pressed by building hospitals and schools. The government is also sustaining an overgrown Congress and political parties, paying its current expenditures and a full bureaucracy—all without enough support from tax revenue. A lot of noise was made during the past administration about a large reservoir found in deep water, which was held to be one of the largest in the world, but until hard barrels are sold it is worth zero. Mexico is not rich until we make the necessary investments to materialize this wealth. I recently heard that the budget authorized for PEMEX is $25 billion per year, but the largest proportion of that budget goes to PEMEX E&amp;P in order to keep up the production of the crude that's still available, and to pay the unreasonably large number of people the company maintains. For PEMEX to tap into deepwater oil, it needs investments of another $20 billion or $30 billion. We have remained like this since 1938, when another government expropriated oil resources in Mexico. Now, we are in 2013 and we need to change. I hope the country will open up the energy industry to private investment fully. The majority of oil companies in the world today leave midstream and logistical operations to other private companies that can do the job better and more competitively and care more about being productive and safe. Everywhere in the world, production-sharing agreements, block auctions, and risk-sharing contracts exist. Countries like Norway, Canada, China, the UK, and the US have accomplished a monumental industrial base thanks to the crucial role of private companies in oil, gas, and power, with governments collecting an enormous amount of taxes and royalties from them and populations with higher income. In the specific case of natural gas, this product is essential for the country's energy transition and for industrial competitiveness, but is not economic for PEMEX given the price relationship between crude at $100 per barrel and gas at $4 per mmbtu. PEMEX continues re-injecting natural gas into the oil reservoirs, whenever it's available, and not investing in developing new gas reserves, leaving the country without this vital fuel. I believe there are strong foundations now to implement deep changes in our energy industry: I expect an opening for the production of shale gas, for example, where the most valuable liquids can be delivered to PEMEX, dedicated to petrochemicals companies, or exported. The methane can then be delivered to power generators and industrial and residential users. I would even recommend that the government auctions shale gas blocks to private operators in order to sell reliable and long-term supplies to the national power utility company, CFE, which relies on natural gas for 40% of its current generation. Fermaca is already engaged in delivering gas to our customers, and through our Chihuahua pipeline, which is 90% complete now, we will own and operate the Mexican gas highway of the North flowing from East Texas into the Chihuahua Corridor. If a new round of energy reforms takes place in Mexico in the near future, Fermaca will be prepared to enter the upstream operations and perform many of the logistical services that are badly needed now.</p><h4>What projects do you have planned for the future?</h4><p>We have targeted both the large government-sponsored pipeline and compression tenders, as well as non-government projects in gas and power. Fermaca is ready to invest more than $800 million in new projects between 2013 and 2015. We will expand our activities to power generation and will look at addressing the lack of energy infrastructure and fuel deliveries in Mexico, reaching users that could not be served by pipeline. We are analyzing the new Ramones pipeline project, recently reviewed by PEMEX Gas after a failed kickoff by the previous administration. This is a large pipeline project of around $1.8 billion, and this time hopefully the bid rules will be clear, efficient, fair, and transparent. We have confidence in the new Mexican government because it brings a new generation with new ideas, a good vision, more professionalism, and different political and ethical principles than what we have had in the last 12 years.</p><h4>Is there a lot of competition for these tenders with PEMEX?</h4><p>It depends on how the tender is structured. One thing is bidding for a construction contract, and another very different thing is providing pipeline transportation services to PEMEX for the long run and becoming a regulated system trunkline. As a true pipeline project, such as Chihuahua or Ramones, you build, own, and operate the pipeline. You have to develop the project, acquire the permits, buy all the land, make the investment, and become fully responsible for the safe operations over the life of the contract. You give PEMEX a tariff for the transportation of gas, like a highway. You charge for the use the of highway, and this is a highway of gas. There are not a lot of companies that can take care of this here. I think real competition is restricted to a small number of companies. Most foreign companies do not understand Mexico or how the industry works, and they are not competitive unless they receive undue protection or special treatment from the government. But even so, serious problems were provoked with this method by the past administration due to the cost of permits, right of way difficulties, project delays and execution troubles, and regulatory and monopoly issues. Fermaca is very competitive in our own country—we have been here for many years, we have efficient, modern, and streamlined operations, we know the land, and we have the people and the money to do it. Provided there is a level playing field, we can compete against anyone. We have demonstrated this with the strategic Chihuahua pipeline. I know some people may still be hurting for this, but the sun rises for everybody and the industry must recognize that we must all be honorable and respectful under a free, competitive market.</p><div class="quote">“Energy assets are a large opportunity for us—both new and refurbished."</div><h4>If the energy reforms happen, what will be the main opportunities for you?</h4><p>We are very much looking into building and expanding our asset base. I believe there could be an important opening in refined products pipelines. Although we are not anticipating crude oil pipelines yet, we do see the potential for refined products and internals. Energy assets are a large opportunity for us—both new and refurbished. We can see much of that coming. Also, if we are successful in changing the legal and policy framework for mature fields and shale gas, it will be music to our ears. We will need an enormous amount of infrastructure, from wells and pipelines to compression, processing, and pumping and storage facilities. We are an asset-based company engaged in the logistics of energy products. We expect that a lot of the opportunities will be open for us and we are very positive about our country. We will continue fighting for it, to be sure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Roxtec de México fit into the global strategy?</h4><p>We started in Mexico as a subsidiary about two years ago—Roxtec has been around for over 20 years. We have had a presence in Mexico for more than nine years with our agents, but four years ago we decided to have our own people in Mexico, and that was when we started in the oil, gas, and telecoms sectors. This led to us opening the subsidiary two years later. Taking into account that Mexico is the 12th largest economy in the world, it was just right to have Roxtec here, and it is important to make people feel that we are here for the long run. In addition, we have become a technology hub for Latin America. For us, it is a natural market; we supply cable and pipe sealing knowledge, supporting Latin America and the Caribbean as well.</p><h4>Who are your key customers in the country or the region?</h4><p>Our key customers are the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies in energy, oil and gas, water treatment, and construction. Even though we sell through the EPC companies, we always deal with the owners, because they are the ones that suffer the pain of not having their cables protected. It is important because cables could experience fire, water, humidity, rodents, or dust, and I have no idea what amount of machinery that would impact upon. Basically, we go with the model of being close to our customers to create environments of operational reliability from a cable and pipes standpoint. This means that you do not need to be worried about your cables; we can do it all.</p><h4>Which sectors will see the most growth for you in the coming years, and does that depend on whether or not the reforms go through?</h4><p>I believe the energy sector will definitely be a good sector for us if the energy reforms go on. The reforms will be a booster for us; however, without the reforms we will still be in good shape. But with them, we will do well and I think the reforms will go ahead. Also, trains and track-side equipment could be an interesting segment for us since the government has announced two or three different electric trains in Mexico. It could be a huge market for us. Our sealing is on many trains in Europe, so that is another market that is just emerging for us. All the major automobile manufacturing plants use robots or automation equipment that requires proper cable sealing. Looking at the big picture, I think that Mexico is on the right path. The macroeconomics are okay and I believe that the government is getting the reforms passed. The major reforms will be the fiscal reform and the energy reform, and I think that should definitely happen.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in this market?</h4><p>The main challenges are new markets. We are trying to move into mining, water treatment, and trains. For example, to get into mining you need to get to the mines. This means travelling to a remote location. Security plays an important role here and it is key thing for us, because in order to sell to the mining industry, you need to be there, and the mines are pretty much in the middle of nowhere.</p><h4>What are the biggest growth sectors for you?</h4><p>Processing industries such as mining, cement plants, sugar mills, gas plants, petrochemical plants, and onshore oil and gas are big growth sectors. Whenever people think about oil and gas they think offshore, but there is huge, huge potential onshore. We specify new products to greenfield operations, but brownfield operations are where everything needs to be upgraded, so this is a huge area of potential for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Mabe played in contributing to the development of the industry?<br></h4><p>We are very proud in saying that Mabe has become one of the most important companies in the world for household appliances. We operate throughout the entire continent. Mexico plays a fundamental role in our strategic plans, but we have been growing significantly in other countries in Latin America. Mabe has factories and commercial operations from Canada to Argentina. Mexico is a major powerhouse in manufacturing. We have been pioneers in the development of technological solutions for appliances since our beginnings, and we demonstrated it when we began to use plastic coatings for the interiors of our refrigerators.</p><h4>What factors have led to Mabe becoming a large and successful company?</h4><p>In the 1980s, the world was changing and we decided to start exporting Mexico's business. We did it in the late 1980s, and nobody thought Mexico would export household appliances or cars. Also, we started exporting appliances to the US in the early 1990s, and now that is a market where today many of the key players operate. Our electric appliances bound for the US are different from those we sell on the domestic market. For example, the oven in Latin America is generally smaller and electric, while in the US it is larger and uses gas. We have adapted our factories for the needs of these different markets. Additionally, a large part of our success has been due to our joint venture with GE, which has lasted for 25 years. There is no doubt that this has been a very important key for our business.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of consumer demand and purchasing patterns?</h4><p>In Mexico and other countries in Latin America, the middle class is growing. There has been important growth in the middle class over the last 10 to 15 years. Therefore, industry is becoming much more active, and we are growing all around the continent. At the same time, the prices of appliances are increasing.</p><div class="quote">“We have been pioneers in the development of technological solutions for appliances since our beginnings."</div><h4>What challenges do you face while operating in this market?</h4><p>Generally, the regulatory climate is fine. If the energy reform goes through it will make Mexico much more competitive and reduce costs. For example, the US is taking advantage of shale gas, and this has helped the market. There is a good chance for Mexico to become a more efficient country in terms of energy. Even though Mexico is full of resources, it is not competitive in terms of price because of the structure of the market. If you have competitive prices in energy you can be a manufacturing country, because this is a key element. If you ask someone to produce copper or steel, energy is a must. Gas, oil, and other resources from energy are basic industries. These sources of energy have the potential to make your business more competitive.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>There are several people saying Mexico will succeed in 2013. Not only next year, but I think for the next 10 years the outlook is great. At the moment, China is no longer a competitor. They affected the whole world in the first decade of this century and all the manufacturers were there because of lower costs. For example, if you look graphs about the percentage of exports to the West, 70%-80% were coming from China. I think China will not be able to compete with Mexico because of the increase in salaries there. China is trying to double its income every five years. At the same time, there is a huge potential for Mexico to grow based on its domestic market, which is 110 million strong. There is a growing middle class and higher-paid jobs because of manufacturing here. Also, if the energy reform goes through, a lot of money could enter the Mexican market, which would provide extra jobs and increase the average incomes of the population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of the group's operations in Mexico?<br></h4><p>The origin of the relationship between Heineken and Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma (CM) can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when Heineken provided technical assistance to CM. Later, at the beginning of the 2000s, Heineken became the US distributor of CM's brands. At the beginning of 2010, Heineken acquired 100% of CM from FEMSA. The acquisition of CM had a huge relevance for Heineken. CM has an excellent reputation built over more than 120 years in Mexico. Heineken and CM share the values of creating economic and social impact. We take care of our employees, communities, and the environment, and we have a shared passion for quality. We brew great products and we have a focused agenda centered on our customers.</p><h4>How did the acquisition broaden Heineken's access to higher-growth markets, and how important is the market to the wider group?</h4><p>European markets are very mature, and we expect growth to come from emerging markets in the following years. This is why investing in Mexico was obvious for us; we are talking about the second largest economy in Latin America and one of the most attractive and competitive beer industries in the world. The Mexican beer market is expanding. The share of beer in the alcoholic drinks market is around 70%, and 2 million people reach legal drinking age every year. CM's volume is very important to Heineken as it represents roughly 15% of the company, and we expect to continue outpacing the overall growth of Heineken.</p><h4>How much of your production is sold domestically and what are your main export destinations?</h4><p>About 90% of our production is sold domestically. Our main export market is the US, but we are experiencing interesting growth rates in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.</p><h4>How would you characterize the Mexican market compared with other regional markets? Is the market for premium beers like Heineken increasing?</h4><p>There are strong regional differences in Mexico in terms of consumer habits, branding, and packaging preferences. In Mexico, the traditional off-premise retail segment continues to be extremely relevant for the beer industry. However, modern channels are also experiencing accelerated growth. The premium segment is underdeveloped compared to other countries, but we have seen excellent results with Heineken and our domestic premium brands, particularly in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. We are confident that this segment will continue growing at an accelerated pace.</p><h4>In what ways are regional consumer demands evolving?</h4><p>Evolution in beer demand varies dramatically from region to region. However, the demand for light beers, which was high in the north, is now increasing in the center of the country.</p><h4>What expansion plans do you have for Mexico?</h4><p>Our plans are to continue to grow in Mexico and amaze our consumers with our product offering. We plan to increase our capacity if the demand for our products continues to grow at a relevant pace.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>We plan to further accelerate our growth and to continue leading the innovation agenda of the industry and further develop our brands. Most importantly, we want our brands be the preferred choice of the Mexican beer consumer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us a bit about Cablevision's background and the growth of cable television in Mexico?<br></h4><p>We were the first company in Latin America to provide not only high-speed internet access back in 1995, but also high-speed metropolitan ethernet access to businesses. Innovation has always been in our DNA. We rapidly understood the need to shift from being a simple cable company offering entertainment, to becoming a business and carrier class multi-service operator (MSO) offering video, data, and telephony services across all market segments: residential, business, corporate companies, and other carriers. Convergence was clearly driving us to compete in a whole new scenario. To put in place state-of-the-art technology is one thing, but establishing the right mindset and culture within our human resources was the biggest challenge. Supported by our experience with carrier-class data services, we finally became an MSO in 2006 with the launch of telephony. We have built not only metropolitan fiber-optic rings to support these convergent services, but also regional fiber-optic networks, interconnecting every city in order to deploy new products and services faster. For Cablevision and practically the entire cable industry, it has been a 10-year run of consistent double-digit growth in revenues, EBITDA, and subscriber base.</p><h4>How has consumer demand for cable services evolved over the past few years in Mexico?</h4><p>Cable companies have been aggressively growing their networks and offering new, lower-priced services year after year in order to participate in the race for acquiring new customers, especially in driving the need for cable services to customers who had never enjoyed them before. Bundling cable television with high-speed internet and later telephony changed the market conditions and drove cable companies' growth in a very positive way. Average consumers today are demanding higher broadband speeds, video on second and third screens, social networking experiences through different devices, and lower prices for telephony. Cable companies have been very successful in addressing these needs, especially because Mexico has been among the top five countries with the most expensive telephone service in the world, and very low average broadband speeds within Latin America. In the chase for free satellite television from the US and later cable premium channels, piracy has become a trend in the northern states, where the influence of the “American way" is strong. We are also addressing these challenges with new strategies.</p><h4>How do you persuade people to subscribe to cable television rather than pirating services?</h4><p>Bundling cable television with high-speed internet and telephony, in what is known as “Triple-Play," has been our main strategy to address this issue, and customers also realize the value of customer service once they engage with us. We have been strongly investing in technology to fully digitize the video content that runs through our networks, requiring customers to use a digital set-top box with every TV providing access to hundreds of channels and interesting features, all at a much better quality. Meanwhile, we have made solid investments to increase our network's capacity exponentially.</p><h4>How are challenges such as rising cable costs impacting the market?</h4><p>The rising costs for cable companies are mainly driven by two factors: the global rise of sports entertainment rights and the increasing negotiating power from content companies, which have also been consolidating in order to achieve higher prices and increase the distribution of new channels. In our market, not only have prices to consumers not increased in several years due to fierce competition, but also the average revenue per service has decreased consistently over this period. This combination makes MSOs like cable companies and others face the constant challenge of controlling overall costs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DEKA's mission is “to foster innovation." What is the history of the company in that regard?<br></h4><p>I founded DEKA 30 years ago after I sold my first business, AutoSyringe. I wanted to create a company that was focused completely on the research and development of new technologies. I'm proud to say that in the decades since, my engineers and I have dedicated ourselves to redefining “state-of-the-art" in a number of different areas. There are always challenges and frustrations, but DEKA only takes on projects that will directly benefit our end-users. Knowing that our technology will improve lives is an excellent motivator.</p><h4>What have been some your proudest achievements in technological innovation?</h4><p>Asking me what invention I'm most proud of is like asking a parent which of their children is their favorite. I'm very proud of all of DEKA's inventions because each has brought its own set of challenges and rewards. However, I am particularly encouraged by the growth of our FIRST robotics program, which inspires kids to become excited about pursuing careers in science and technology. Each young innovator we inspire will go on to create incredible inventions, so in that sense, FIRST is the gift that keeps on giving.</p><h4>Where are you currently focusing your design disciplines, and where does the future lie for DEKA?</h4><p>We are currently working on a range of projects, from medical devices and prosthetic limbs to water purifiers and Stirling engines. I don't know what the future holds, but given the great challenges of the 21st century, there is no shortage of new technologies we'll have the opportunity to work on.</p><div class="quote">“I'm very proud of all of DEKA's inventions because each has brought its own set of challenges and rewards."</div><p>You have been quoted as saying: “You have teenagers thinking they're going to make millions as NBA stars when that's not realistic for even 1% of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is." What would you like young entrepreneurs to understand about the opportunities that contribute to real economic growth?</p><p>The benefits of choosing a career in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math exist on both the personal level and the large scale. For a young man or woman, a career in technology will not only provide challenges and intellectual stimulation but also contribute to a productive and successful lifestyle. For a nation, having a population that is developing the next generation of breakthrough technologies will ensure economic growth and global competitiveness. In short, there is no better source of wealth for an individual or for a nation than technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Servicio Geológico Mexicano (SGM) play in attracting investment to Mexico's mining industry?<br></h4><p>The SGM provides reliable and high-quality geological, geochemical, and geophysical maps of the entire country's territory. These maps are essential for mining companies planning to or exploring in Mexico, and they request consistent geological facts that make detailed data available for mining exploration. By producing this very important information, the SGM contributes to the country's development and makes the establishment of mining projects possible. Currently, there are at least 10 different gold, silver, and zinc projects available for tender throughout the year. Every two years, México hosts one of the largest mining conventions and exhibitions in Acapulco, where the company takes part in activities by promoting and presenting projects. We also offer our services and expertise to both local and foreign investors at such events.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about Mexico's production activities?</h4><p>Nowadays, we produce around 16 different minerals in Mexico. Traditionally, Mexico has been the largest producer of fluorspar in the world; we are in the top three in terms of production of silver and we have been a world reference regarding basic metals such as copper, lead, and zinc. Regarding gold production, we are not among the top producers because Mexico's gold deposits are being developed.</p><h4>What opportunities lie ahead for mining companies and investors that want to come to Mexico?</h4><p>I believe that interest in mining and mineral exploitation activities in Mexico has always gone hand in hand with international prices. Around 10 years ago, mining activity in Mexico was rather small; however, over the last decade, the worldwide prices of minerals such as gold and silver have sky rocketed, and many companies have arrived in the country, especially Canadian companies. Therefore, investment in the Mexican mining industry also increased dramatically over the last few years, and in 2012, investment in the sector was around $6 billion.</p><h4>What have been the landmark achievements in the mining industry in recent years?</h4><p>Canada's Goldcorp currently operates the Peñasquito mine in Zacatecas, an area that is expected to become Mexico's largest open pit mine. According to the miner's forecast, Peñasquito will produce an annual average of 500,000 ounces of gold, 28 million ounces of silver, 450 million pounds of zinc, and 200 million pounds of lead over a 22-year life. Only 30% of the territory of Zacatecas has currently been explored for mining resources, even though there is a history of vast silver deposits that goes back to the mid-16th century. Therefore, Zacatecas' mineral wealth is nothing new. It is the largest silver-producing region in Mexico, with about 23% of its GDP linked to the mining industry. In addition, it is the second gold producing district in the country, just after Sonora. Zacatecas attracts large amounts of investment, and there are many ongoing projects in the area. Both of these areas, Zacatecas and Sonora, are attracting more and more investment and projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How challenging is competition within the industry?<br></h4><p>In TV, we have only one channel and we don't compete with the likes of Televisa. In radio, on the other hand, we are 100% talk radio, whereas most of the other radio stations are music stations. We have numerous unique 24-hour schedules on different stations, so that is tough. I have to determine what programs go where, what themes, and what topics for all those stations. We are our own main competitor. Music radio stations, on the other hand, have to compete with iPods, internet downloads, and CDs, not to mention each other. Music radio stations have much more competition than we do.</p><h4>Where do you see the most growth potential?</h4><p>Our listeners are looking for more than just news; they're looking for entertainment. News is pretty much the same morning to night. We want to entertain our listeners with different styles of news and programming. We try to keep it light, whether it is politics or finance. Our listeners are generally more educated than music listeners. In the US, we have a potential of up to 30 million listeners; however, it is hard to determine exactly how many people listen to our stations. Also, you have to keep track of young listeners. More and more of them are interested in the news, politics, and global affairs as well as culture, arts, and of course sports. Family issues are also important topics. It is vital to keep a balance between all that.</p><h4>Does piracy still pose a bit threat to the industry?</h4><p>There is a problem with pirate radio in the south. In Mexico, there are two types of radio stations: the ones that receive government concessions, which are commercial stations, and the ones that receive permission. With the former, you can sell commercial time. With the latter, you can only broadcast cultural programs, music, and indigenous language instruction, for example. The government gives permits to those stations based on the proviso that no commercial activity takes place. However, in the south, those “permitted" stations are sometimes used for commercial activity, so that is where the piracy problem comes in. Generally, piracy isn't a big problem for us though.</p><div class="quote">“Our listeners are looking for more than just news; they're looking for entertainment."</div><h4>How much have you been investing in developing your infrastructure?</h4><p>Our infrastructure is very sophisticated. We can broadcast and sell all over Mexico, as well as in the US. We have 45 different markets, one for each station. In each market, depending on the region or city, those stations can create local programming. For example, the station in Guadalajara or the one in San Antonio, Texas provides the local news and focuses on local topics and issues. It is complicated to control and coordinate all those programs from Mexico City. In music, on the other hand, you just have to know what segment of the population you appeal to and play the same music, whether here or in the US.</p><h4>How have you been developing your advertising platforms, and what is your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are still focused on radio for now, but it is growing much more on the internet. We have another company, a below-the-line (BTL) company, which is direct to the customer advertising. We have the opportunity to create intensive special campaigns that are undertaken through various media, including radio, TV, and the internet. These are mostly government campaigns. The BTL business is among the fastest growing markets in the country. We also need to invest in high definition technology, and grow in terms of our satellite presence, both for radio and TV. We also want to set up more 24-hour stations in the US. To achieve this, we have to position ourselves in the main Spanish-speaking markets like Colorado, California, North and South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. The way to grow is by having your own station there; however, it is not cheap. We hope to open a station in Denver soon. We have another station in Los Angeles, and hopefully we will open another one there in the near future, because California is the main Spanish-speaking market in the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ICT sector in Abu Dhabi developed since Injazat's conception in 2005?</h4><p>In 2005, we were leading the industry in terms of setting the pace and the scene. At that time, the market was young and difficult to penetrate; it has evolved dramatically since then, spurred on by a greater understanding and appreciation of IT outsourcing and the value of managed service providers in particular. Abu Dhabi's ICT sector has witnessed tremendous growth over the past years due to its central role in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 (Abu Dhabi 2030). The Abu Dhabi government is on a quest to establish a genuine digital society on its way to becoming one of the world's top governments in the coming years, and so a lot of focus and effort is being directed toward ICT capabilities.</p><h4>How did Injazat revise its strategies during the economic downturn?</h4><p>We were in the right place at the right time during the downturn. When times were really tough, capital investment, in particular start-up costs, was considered a daunting challenge. Companies that were hit by the financial crisis were looking for someone to provide them with services at a better cost. The shift toward outsourcing their IT services provided a substantial reduction in their operating costs. A unique element characterizing Injazat's portfolio of IT services is its exceptional flexibility toward customers with regards to service selection. Based on their business requirements, customers can either elect for a single managed service or choose the full gamut. This kind of adaptability has served us in good stead during the downturn.</p><div class="quote">“We uniquely combine our local specialized experts with our extensive global partnership network."</div><h4>Which of your services had the most demand during this period?</h4><p>Our services have been generally met with good demand during this period. Enterprises have been embracing managed services and outsourcing not only to reduce their operating costs, but also to transform business models to compete more effectively, a trend that will definitely continue to gain momentum. At Injazat, we uniquely combine our local specialized experts with our extensive global partnership network to respond to any corporate IT challenge.</p><h4>How important is the IDEX exhibition, and what opportunities does Injazat see in the defense sector?</h4><p>Since IDEX was established almost 15 years ago, it has grown to become one of the leading defense events in the region. IDEX 2013 was very successful for us as we partnered with several entities to deliver IT, data center, and security services that put us in a primary position in the defense field. We already provide business, consultancy, and technology-related services to several defense entities; we are working with HP and many other partners in order to deliver even more key services to the sector. We are currently planning further expansions to our defense-related technology skill sets to better support the UAE's defense initiatives, in cognizance of the dramatic growth of the defense industry.</p><h4>What services are you providing to du?</h4><p>We consider du as a strategic and important partner. In order for du to deliver services to its clients, it needs the 100% availability of its services, which we can provide. Under the terms of our renewed agreement, our Tier IV data center will continue to support Managed Colocation services for du's mission-critical systems. The center will incorporate standards from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a set of IT service management practices that aligns IT services with business requirements to provide reliable, secure, and high-value 24/7 managed IT services. We are honored by the opportunity to continue hosting du's mission-critical systems via the Middle East's first Tier IV data center. We will ensure that we have the technology and the expertise to keep du online while it delivers vital telecommunications services to its customers. This partnership helps maintain a high standard of excellence in the UAE's telecommunications sector.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the market in terms of demand for services?</h4><p>Among the current trends to watch out for are big data, cloud computing, and virtualization. Big data is changing IT frameworks around the world. In 2012, 2.5 exabytes (quintillion bytes) of data were created every day; the world's technological per capita capacity to store information is estimated to have doubled every 40 months since the 1980s. The interest around the cloud, especially the private cloud, has led to large-scale virtualization adoption across the UAE. Given the affordability of virtualizing enterprise IT infrastructure, 2013 is expected to witness huge growth in the virtualization segment. In 2011, total market spending around cloud delivery (public, virtual private, and private) in the UAE stood at $15.5 million. Cloud computing will definitely continue to be a driving force for industry in the coming months. Among the things that set Injazat apart from other service providers in terms of these trends is our ability to deliver secure end-to-end services to our clients.</p><h4>How does Injazat work with the education sector in the UAE?</h4><p>Education and health care are very important for the UAE, and we happen to be active in both of those sectors. Injazat already has a contract with the UAE's Ministry of Education to deliver IT Helpdesk Support services to the Ministry's headquarters and the educational zones of Dubai and the northern Emirates. Apart from delivering services to the education sector, Injazat believes in the importance of instilling the value of technology and its influence on society at an early age. We engage in various initiatives that emphasize the important link between technology and the UAE's social and economic development. Injazat regularly extends training, sponsorship, and partnership programs to leading local universities in this regard. For instance, this year we were actively involved in a conference on big data systems in cooperation with New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi Institute and the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. We also work closely in collaboration with Zayed University and Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) to host their students at our company and sponsor their technology-related events.</p><h4>How can Abu Dhabi develop itself as a regional hub for ICT?</h4><p>The UAE has been quite successful in positioning itself as a business and knowledge hub in recent years. As a result, the country has witnessed an increase in global organizations expanding their footprint in the region and selecting the UAE as their regional headquarters. The government has played a crucial role in supporting new initiatives to help foster innovation and entrepreneurship to support the knowledge-based economy to complement the UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi 2030 plans. From an IT perspective, the UAE has emerged as a very attractive IT market in the region, with local and multinational service providers here offering high-quality services with adequate support for local and global customers. Managed services and data center services in particular are on the rise, as we have also observed organizations from neighboring countries utilizing UAE-based data center providers for their infrastructure hosting and disaster recovery requirements. Injazat is well positioned to both respond to an increasingly competitive business landscape and the expanding IT needs of an evolving government. Our unique blend of local expertise and global partnerships allows us to develop and deploy solutions that are timely, cutting edge, and customer-centric. We have earned a respected place in local industry that we intend to take further into the regional and international arenas.</p><h4>How can e-government contribute to more efficient services?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi has a strong commitment to developing an e-enabled, service-oriented government. In its e-government vision, the Abu Dhabi government's ambition is to become a “high-performance government delivering world-class services to the benefits of all its customers." This vision translates into various focus and design themes for the e-government strategy, including a focus on end users and efficiency and a comprehensive and cross-government design. Injazat is currently working with many governmental entities to build sharing services. That is another area that can improve services in a more efficient way. In this regard, Injazat has raised the benchmark for all IT services providers and intends to continue playing a vital role in the evolution of the region's dynamic IT services sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about Graiman's background and evolution?</h4><p>It all began 55 years ago as a family business, like most of the businesses here in Latin America. Graiman was the answer to the group's need to obtain an income in hard currency, mainly in US dollars. At that time, Ecuador's currency was the sucre, and, like most of the currencies from developing countries, it was always subject to devaluation. Our main business at that time was importing steel as a raw material and producing steel pipes and structures for the construction industry. We bought raw materials in US dollars and sold them in sucres, and while we collected our sales, the price of our basic raw materials was subject to international demand. Obviously, this was a big problem at that time. Around 20 years ago we developed an industry that used raw materials produced in the region, like clay and sandstone. We started exporting our finished products, such as ceramic tiles for walls and floors. This activity gave us an income of much needed dollars. From that time until now, a lot of positive things have happened. Ecuador opened up its economy to the world through capital investment in new and modern technology directed at many industries to produce for local consumption, as well as for exporting finished products. We continued to search for new resources to optimize our production process, and we identified long ago that our bottleneck was our sources of energy needed for the industrial process. The main issue then became very clear; Graiman needed to change its energy suppliers. Until then, we relied on the use of LPG, but today we use natural gas. At that time, natural gas as a source of energy was not available for industry. We did our research and found out that Ecuador had 20 sources of natural gas, but as there was no infrastructure for exploitation; the industry was not using it. We worked with the government to develop these projects and we are proud to be the pioneers of using natural gas. This cost us around $10 million, just for the infrastructure.</p><h4>What was the impact of having your own source of natural gas to use?</h4><p>It allowed us to compete with our neighbors. Our competitors in Colombia and Peru already use natural gas in their ceramic and porcelain industries, as well as in their surrounding industries. Graiman uses a lot of energy to produce and transform raw materials into finished products. If you don't have the right energy source or the right cost base, you won't be able to compete or invest in the future. Natural gas is a very safe source of energy and, in terms of costs, it is very competitive. The cost of LPG depends on the oil price in the international market; it goes up and down and you never can know what will happen. Under this scenario it is hard to project long-term costs. On the other hand, natural gas is an independent resource, thus you have a fixed cost for the future.</p><div class="quote">“We started exporting in 1993-1994 and now export 40% of our porcelain production."</div><h4>How would you describe the evolution of Graiman's exports?</h4><p>Our exports have been successful. We started exporting in 1993-1994 and now export 40% of our porcelain production. We can do more, because right now the economy of the region is really hot and demands a lot of products from us. We are currently investing in our factories to increase production. In a couple months, we will inaugurate two kilns producing 20,000 sqm a day of porcelain or red clay products. Right now, we produce it all here in Cuenca. We have deals with other factories in Europe to produce our products; however, what we sell under our name is manufactured here in Cuenca.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand into other markets?</h4><p>There is a very good market in Central America, but it depends on macroeconomic development. Ecuador just signed a trade agreement with Guatemala, which opens a market for us because it allows us to sell our products without restrictions. We also have one with El Salvador. For us, Central America is very interesting. There are some markets that produce the same products, but they have different structures. For us, Central and Latin America are very important, as well as North America and the Caribbean. Those are the markets that are developing and we can get into those markets if we have the right product at the right price with the right marketing and at the right time. I think we are ready for them.</p><h4>How many people do you have working in R&amp;D?</h4><p>We have three labs that work together. Each lab researches different parts of the value chain. The raw materials lab has people that go to the mining sector and investigate the materials, which is very important to us. We have excellent and unique materials in the Andean area. Therefore, research is very important in order to find the right raw materials. We have another lab that looks into the production sector and another group that looks into energy. It is very important because if you don't use the correct energy, you can ruin your products. The good thing about natural gas is that it is very clean; it is a clean energy source that can be managed in a very specific way. We also have a lab that is trying to research the anthropological aspects of the mine. Marketing tries to ask questions about what the people want. We have a store that tries to convert these ideas in a way so that they can be used. We have developed some metallic floors with a shiny look, for example. We put a great deal of money into R&amp;D, and that is how we prepare for the future. Right now, we make money in the higher rotation offerings, such as red-body products. These make up for 80% of the sales in the market; however, the remaining 20% that is porcelain is growing fast because people want to have a different floor, which the red-body cannot give you. That is why we don't make an interesting margin, but we are putting a lot of effort into it because we think that white-body products will be the future. At the moment, China and even Colombia and Peru have lower costs. Those countries, especially China, can produce one square meter for $3. Our costs are more than that and they sell it to us at that price. We need to differentiate ourselves and give the customer more than just a product. We are putting a lot of effort in our stores to introduce a special service and design. If you are a customer and you go to our store to change your floor, we have our studio and designers who will help you decide what really suits you. Nowadays, the culture of ceramics is developing so fast that people expect more than a price. This is something we are working on a great deal.</p><h4>How would you describe your logistics chain?</h4><p>We are working now with new software to allow us a rational communication of information; supply chain management software is very important for us. Ecuador is changing a lot. Six years ago, the roads were not as good, meaning you needed to have warehouses. Every city needed to have a warehouse. Nowadays, we feel that we need fewer warehouses and more logistics and transportation. We are working on that issue right now. We do 30% of our own finished-product transport and 70% we outsource. We would like to outsource 100% when the industry gets more sophisticated. We have a lot of items to move and control. Even though we are working on our supply chain management, it is not our core business. This industry, in developed countries, is different. There is an industry for mining and another that distributes raw materials. We do all of that now, which is another thing that is changing a lot. The new law gives us more security to do business. Before, you needed to buy land and talk with all the people who work and live in the area, then do the paperwork and give the community what it needs. Now, the government is doing its part. We pay the government royalties and it goes to the community to work with the people. It helps a lot. In the past, we needed to do all of those things. Now, we have concessions and we export raw materials. We also produce the product and do the selling. Those are three big sectors and we participate in them all. Of course, it is a challenge being in all three and staying competitive in all three fields. However, so far, we have been doing a good job.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[determined-to-grow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the launch of your Turkish subsidiary Odea Bank go, and how will it help expand Bank Audi's regional presence?</h4><p>Over the last few years, the most important development in the group was the launch of its Turkish subsidiary. We have been very lucky in Turkey to have been granted the first license in 14 years, so we are stepping in without incurring any goodwill. Having the luxury of being granted a license and entering a market without paying goodwill provides you with important flexibility in acquiring top-notch people, investing in the best technology, and acquiring all the necessary means to deploy your business plan. We are not just establishing a presence in Turkey to have another subsidiary; we have chosen Turkey on the basis of its strong fundamentals, and our strategy is to build in Turkey a subsidiary that would rank second to Lebanon in terms of assets and earnings on a three-to-five-year horizon. We have an appetite for growth and we have built a business model that, in principle, should lead to size in Turkey. Turkey provides a huge opportunity given its sizeable economy in terms of population and GDP and its significant engagement in the exponentially increasing trade, finance, and human flows between Turkey and the Arab world, including countries in which our group is present.</p><h4>What have been your results in Turkey so far?</h4><p>On November 1, 2012 we officially launched the business. In seven months we have been able to go from a greenfield operation starting from scratch to building a deposit base that represents close to a 1% market share in Turkey. To give you some benchmarks, two of the most successful foreign banks in Turkey, which are European banks having on average 22-25 years worth of presence, each have a market share in deposits of 2.5%. We have been able to achieve 40% of the market share of those prominent European banks in just seven months of activity.</p><div class="quote">“We had to expand in order to keep generating economies of scale and efficiency gains."</div><h4>What is behind this success?</h4><p>At the end of the day, banking is about people. Banking is considered to be a capital-intensive business because, by definition, banks are subject to capital ratios. However, I believe it is a much more labor-intensive business because it is about relationships: acquiring customers and managing business relationships. Our competitive strength in Turkey is that we have acquired the best people. We have a very high-quality management team, with 10-15 years of experience on average. We got on board very well-established relationship managers, who enjoyed a deep-rooted knowledge of the Turkish customers and market. They were recruited from prime banks in Turkey with very important customer and account portfolios, and this has translated into franchise acquisition.</p><h4>How do you assess the current performance of the Lebanese financial sector?</h4><p>In order to have a good empirical assessment of the financial industry in Lebanon, it is better to start with the statistical experience. I believe statistical historical experiences are as much important as empirical experiences in assessing any business or industry. Lebanon went through very difficult times over the last 20-25 years. I am talking about the post-war era, which entailed the post-reconstruction period, the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, the summer war with Israel in 2006, and so on. All throughout this period, the Lebanese banking industry showed a great deal of resilience. The performance of the financial sector in Lebanon has been consistently disconnected from that of the real sector. When we have a changing business environment, it affects the real sector much more quickly than the financial sector. The real sector has a limited resilience, depending on the magnitude of change in the environment. But despite the adverse trends we may have witnessed, the impact on the financial industry has been very limited at all times.</p><h4>What factors have contributed to this resilience?</h4><p>In figures, we have been able to add $76 billion in deposits in Lebanon since the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in 2005, and $53 billion since the outbreak of the global financial crisis. From time to time there is a small drop, but it then catches up and the overall trend is noticeable growth. There is a very high correlation between this resilience and being so-called boring banks. As a matter of fact, boring banks have been the most resilient throughout the global turmoil. A boring bank is generally a deposit-rich bank, a retail bank, and a bank whose funding comes almost exclusively from customer deposits. On the back of strong fiduciary responsibility, the use we make of these deposits is a very careful one, particularly if this funding comes from customers who our branch managers know almost all personally. On the loan side, Lebanese bank lending is short-term, revolving around working capital financing and trade finance with huge guarantees, with a limited share for long-term finance and project finance. When we lend it is mainly to defensive and immune businesses; very little to volatile businesses. Normally we lend a maximum of 50% of our customers' deposits. The remaining we keep in immediate and available liquidity with central banks and our correspondent banks, and in a portfolio of securities. We are considered boring banks because our balance sheet is so transparent; you do not need an expert in order to understand how clean it is, how liquid it is, and what quality there is in the bank's assets.</p><h4>What is your view of the central bank's stimulus package, and what segments are going to benefit from this?</h4><p>Those are coincidental measures. The Governor of the Banque du Liban is a wise man and very experimental, and his duties include boosting economic activity, being responsible for monetary and banking policy, and deciding which objectives should fit perfectly with the economic objectives of the government. Although the central bank is an independent entity from the executive and legislative powers in the country, the policies it implements should align with macroeconomic policies to ensure a permanent improvement in the standard of living and welfare of the citizens. This is where the Banque du Liban is doing its best in order to support those targets, though these remain coincidental measures of a limited magnitude. It would have an impact that could reach up to circa 1% of economic growth, which is not immaterial. These are wise policies aimed to help boost economic activity within a slowing economic environment.</p><h4>What are Bank Audi's regional ambitions?</h4><p>Our initial expansion strategy (which is still ongoing, but with some slight adjustments) was to enter the very inner circle of real regional players. There are many large banks in the region. When you look at the regional landscape, the national champions in the GCC are NCB in Saudi Arabia, NBK in Kuwait, and QNB in Qatar. These are mainly domestic players, focusing almost exclusively on their internal market. None of them have expanded significantly outside. We can understand those strategies because there is so much wealth in their domestic market. For us, it is a different story. We became too big with respect to the size of our domestic economy, and we had to expand in order to keep generating economies of scale and efficiency gains. When you look at the regional banking universe, none of those banks are involved in interregional banking, or cross-selling countries and business clients. Regional banking for Audi is cross selling countries and business clients. It is like in trade finance, providing the Saudi importer with the LC opening and the Egyptian exporter with a supply of finance. We have a captive market share because we hold both sides of the equation. There are Kuwaiti banks covering Kuwait, Saudi banks covering Saudi Arabia, but none of them are really interregional. There are very few real regional players, but a huge need for them exists, so our real strategy was to become one of them. There is a very interesting market for cross selling. Our strategy was to become a very important regional player as soon as possible and to become as large as possible. The first results of our strategy are quite enticing and encouraging. We have been able, in less than three years of average activity in three markets only (Egypt, Jordan, and Syria), to build close to $7 billion in customer deposits, representing 22% of the consolidated activity of the group. The recent developments, particularly in Syria, impacted on our growth negatively; however, we are building for the future, so we are not driven by short-term considerations. In our wise management strategies, we adjust very quickly to adverse trends, especially material ones like those we have witnessed in the region, by putting in place a range of contingency plans and all the right buffers in order to protect our bank from “short-term shocks." We entered Turkey at the right time. It was triggered by our view that a presence in Turkey is complementary to our regional presence. The license was provided after the outbreak of the Arab Spring, so it came at an excellent moment to compensate for a delay in the revamped business plan—a delay which was driven internally by a consolidation strategy rather than a growth strategy in Egypt and Jordan on the backdrop of a quick deleveraging in Syria in order to maintain the quality of our assets and to protect our bank from any short-term spillover effects. When prospects start improving, such as in Egypt, we will directly reap the benefits. We are actually looking to generate $45 million in profits from Bank Audi Egypt in 2013, after provisions and taxes. It is not as if we are doing nothing in those countries, but we could have done maybe two times what we are doing today if the environment had been more supportive. Our Turkish subsidiary offers a unique rebalancing opportunity due to the size of the Turkish market and the fact that our operating model in Turkey is proving to be successful. The end result will be considerably to the group's advantage in terms of assets and earnings growth as well as our rating at large.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Indupalma's greatest achievements in the last few years?</h4><p>Indupalma was traditionally a producer of palm oil, as well as some other related products. Throughout the years, it has grown and positioned itself as a national leading company in terms of R&amp;D with over 2,000 workers. Some 20 years ago, our R&amp;D department developed a palm seed that resists the worst diseases. Today, we commercialize this product and sell it in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. A decade ago, the company looked into different possibilities to diversify its business activity. When we acquired the company it was close to bankruptcy. We pulled through the crisis and faced a dilemma: either to go back to the primary stages of the industry or explore the biochemistry area of the business. At that point, we started to closely work with farmers, making them owners of the business and carrying out a kind of agriculture reform in the private industry. We also sold the business model to investors. As the result of the positive evolution shown during this period, Indupalma went from being an oil producer to a company generating business and investment opportunities, and we explored several other business areas such as pension funds through investment activities. Today, the farmers under our business model generate an average of $14,000 a month, and they pay back their investment loans from the land they acquire in only 10 years. The average pension fund currently gives farmers around $6,000 a month. Therefore, the margin is significant, and we encouraged a shift in the perception of the palm tree business, which went from a mere agricultural activity to an investment opportunity.</p><h4>The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has also praised your model as a clear example to follow for other companies. What does that recognition mean for you?</h4><p>We are pleased with that recognition. We knocked on the IADB's doors in order to finance the project. It offered us the possibility to provide 80% of the funds, and we would need to assume the remaining 20%. However, we declined the offer, based on the fact that when developing such projects with farmers that before did not have a penny, if we own 20% of the company, they would always be wary of our intentions. In addition, they would always rely on the resources of a larger company like Indupalma to overcome any economic setback. The value and warranty of the project resides in other elements, as we provide technical and business support to farmers to run agribusiness enterprises on their own, and we buy their final production in accordance to international prices. After that setback, we temporally shelved the project, and later on we were able to implement them thanks to the acquisition of land by Indupalma. The exercise has been extremely successful, because everyone has been able to pay back their loans within 10 years instead of the 14 first planned.</p><div class="quote">“We expect to see major developments in the rubber segment of our activities in the near future, as we will plant 35,000 hectares."</div><h4>What are your main investment lines for 2013?</h4><p>In Magdalena Medio, we developed a new extracting plant and a company named Oro Rojo, which started operating in late December 2012. This is a palm fruit processing plant that produces raw oil. Following this example, we are about to open another processing plant to produce biodiesel, and we foresee the construction of two other processing plants to supply oils for the food industry, as well as sulfated methyl ester, a key raw material to produce biodegradable detergent. One of these production facilities will be operating soon, and the other one will be opened in two year's time. These facilities are essential for the development of the cluster Indupalma aims at developing; Oro Rojo is based in a free trade zone, and we want to attract more investment to develop palm tree production activities that will supply our processing plants in the area, which has traditionally based its agriculture activity on livestock. We also plan to develop a large project of 20,000 hectares of palm trees in the Meta region. In total, 10,000 trees will be under Indupalma's control, and the remaining 10,000 will be owned and operated by third parties. We expect to see major developments in the rubber segment of our activities in the near future, as we will plant 35,000 hectares.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[decisive-moves]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Netherlands is one of the leading foreign investors in Mexico. What makes Mexico so attractive to European investors?<br></h4><p>Mexico's proximity to the US, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and a very skilled and affordable workforce make it a competitive place for the production and assembly of many products. Mexico is a very open country with a liberal trade regime and has an extensive network of 12 FTAs with 44 countries, representing 1.2 billion people. Moreover, investments by the Netherlands in Mexico and vice versa are facilitated and protected by an agreement on promotion, encouragement, and the reciprocal protection of investments, signed in 1998.</p><p>Mexico is also a large market. The area around Mexico City alone is one of the biggest consumer areas in the world. The Mexican middle class is growing—social programs and better access to education have boosted the country's workforce, and this makes Mexico a very attractive market for all varieties of consumer products. There are more than 1,000 companies with capital from the Netherlands in Mexico. Nearly all of the Dutch multinational companies are represented in Mexico—they have found their way there for hundreds of years—but Dutch SMEs are also now finding their way to Mexico. There is strong Mexican demand for Dutch know-how in integrated water management, nanotechnology, logistics, offshore technology, and agricultural products and services, for example. The embassy plays a crucial role in facilitating the Dutch-Mexican interaction.</p><h4>How does foreign investment fit into the Netherlands' strategy for economic recovery?</h4><p>Foreign trade and investment are vital to our economy. The Netherlands has always been a trading nation eager to seize opportunities as they arise. Exports remain one of the main pillars of the economy and have grown at a rate of 3% to 6% in the last five months, despite the current economic slump. The domestic jobs generated by foreign trade are essential to our economic recovery. In today's global economy, we see many countries that used to have less prosperous economies quickly turning into self-aware, fast-growing, trading nations. This means that to be successful, we have to look beyond nearby markets and seize opportunities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Naturally, it is up to our private sector to make concrete trade and investment decisions, but they can count on the government's help if needed. Our embassies, consulates, and business support offices offer tailor-made assistance and, where the market fails, we help to provide the necessary financial resources. For example, we are setting up the Dutch Good Growth Fund. This revolving fund offers tailor-made financing to entrepreneurs with good plans for trade and investment in low- and middle-income countries. A precondition is that the activities must be socially responsible, sustainable, and relevant to development.</p><div class="quote">“Foreign trade and investment are vital to our economy."</div><h4>If new reforms are enacted, what would it mean for investments from the Netherlands?</h4><p>The new Mexican government has carried out decisive education and telecommunications reform, and we are now following the process of energy reform very carefully. It is important to take action at the right moment and not lose momentum. The Netherlands has large multinational companies but also many SMEs, which are knowledgable institutions with unique expertise and know-how. For example, a delegation of senior PEMEX representatives visited the Netherlands to explore potential areas of collaboration in 2012. The conclusion was that both countries share similar challenges and there are several areas for further collaboration.</p><h4>What challenges does the economic relationship between the two countries face in the coming years?</h4><p>Mexico has already diversified its exports, but about 80% of them still go to the US. Mexico therefore remains very dependent on the US. President Peña Nieto has mentioned on various occasions that Mexico needs to diversify its exports. The Netherlands is an excellent partner for Mexico in meeting this challenge. As the Gateway to Europe, it offers Mexican companies the opportunity to reach 500 million consumers in Europe through the biggest port in the Western hemisphere. Out of 15 sea cables, 11 connect directly to the Netherlands. We want to see more Mexican investment in the Netherlands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[our-politics]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has lobbying evolved in Mexico over recent years?<br></h4><p>Lobbying is a fairly old practice in Mexico, but we can speak of two stages in its evolution. In the first stage, the public decision-making process was mainly focused in the Federal Executive Branch, organizations seeking dialogue with the authorities directed their efforts towards lobbying with the Executive Branch. After a long democratization process in 1997, and for the first time in history, Mexico had a divided government. It was at this time that the government's party (PRI) lost the majority in Congress and the opposition started to take control of more public spaces; it was here that Lobbying in Congress began. I had the privilege to be one of the first founders of a lobbying consulting firm in Mexico. We sought the creation of a “Professional Lobbying Association in Mexico" due to the need of having an organization where firms, companies, and organizations working in the areas of government affairs were represented, dignifying activity by bringing transparency and ethics to it. Today, there are lobbying regulations in Congress, among others, firms, companies, and associations must register every three years, each time the Legislature changes. Although we fully comply with the regulations stipulated by Congress at GEP, it hasn't been able to formulate a cohesive, long-lasting regulation on lobbying. We believe that this is because the activity is not well understood in Mexico. A lobbyist's permanent task is to convey that the dialogue between private sectors and public powers is necessary.</p><h4>What kind of trends have you been witnessing in terms of demand?</h4><p>There are individual complaints according to the type of industry in question. For example, there are single-issue groups, like the food industry, whose main topic of interest revolves around obesity. Other groups are far more demanding, not only because of the great number of issues in which they have interests, but also because their issues are part of the public agenda, such is the case of the insurance sector. Also, there are issues where there is a multitude of stakeholders, such as the energy sector, where there is widespread interest for legal reforms and market participation. We have another group of clients that are composed of large foreign companies, which need information and advice in order to conduct their own lobbying in the Executive Branch. Because of this, GEP offers a monitoring service. It observes what's happening in Congress, the Executive Branch, the State Legislatures, and in the State governments. We have developed an interesting and personalized communication system. This means you can be online 24 hours a day to follow up on specific topics of interest. Congress generates vast amounts of information and works in a very dynamic way. With this system, GEP offers immediate information, focusing specifically on our client's interests.</p><h4>How competitive is the industry?</h4><p>There isn't much competition. However, quality and good service is a common denominator among competitor firms. We are one of the largest firms that is completely dedicated to providing political consulting and lobbying to our clients. Because of this, we are always improving our communication platforms and strategies.</p><h4>What are some of the key changes that need to be made to the regulatory environment?</h4><p>Lobbying activities in Mexico are often misunderstood or misinterpreted, confusing the term “lobbying" with “favors," “corruption," or “pay-offs." The solution to this relies in making our activities transparent.</p><h4>What do you think 2013 holds for Mexico?</h4><p>Today, Mexico has what I call a “new democracy." We have been a democracy for many years, but now we are a democracy according to our needs, culture, and location. Every six years our democracy grows; and because of pressures from our society and the evolution of social media, we have a government that is concerned with transparency and accountability issues, which makes for a better democratic system. More sectors of society, such as companies, groups and associations, now have the opportunity to participate in the design of public policies, a clear sign of democratic maturity. In Mexico, a new government has been elected. Enrique Peña Nieto is a young president with strong political basis who rose to power after being the governor of the State of Mexico. His government began its term pushing forward an aggressive agenda that privileges dialogue with all political parties through an active participation mechanism known as the Pact for Mexico. President Peña has made clear that the top priority for his government will be to make sure that all structural reforms will be presented, discussed, and approved. Enrique Peña Nieto has proven to be a good strategist and politician. In government, the name of the game is politics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-touch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the cornerstone of your incoming strategy aimed at strengthening Mexico's participation in the international economy?</h4><p>In line with President Peña Nieto's five-pronged government strategy for a peaceful, inclusive, educated, prosperous, and globally responsible country, ProMéxico aims to build a prosperous and globally responsible Mexico by boosting investment, trade, and the internationalization of Mexican companies. Therefore, the strategy is to continue pushing Mexico's foreign trade, diversifying both the goods and services that the country exports, and their destinations. Moreover, another relevant topic of our strategy remains in fostering value chains in the export sector. The concept of global value chains implies that production processes are no longer carried out in one country. Every process, from producing raw materials to transforming them into finished goods, is carried out where the skills, materials, cost, and quality conditions are best. By this logic, statistics of imports versus exports become less important and the relevant goal is to become the country that adds the largest value to the products, especially in knowledge-intensive and complex manufacturing processes. To attend to the call of the Secretary of Economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico is favoring regional economic integration by strengthening its global supply chains. In this sense, we are promoting our ACT model, which is a Spanish abbreviation meaning “alliance with multinational corporations." It is a strategic alliance that identifies Mexican suppliers and puts them in touch with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and multinational corporations that demand their products or services. Through this program, we are fostering the domestic market and promoting direct and indirect exports. On the other hand, ProMéxico is hard at work to become the best ally of companies seeking to export from Mexico or to transfer their operations and productive investments to our country. ProMéxico strongly supports investment projects that generate opportunities and well-paid jobs for Mexicans, and aims to be a strategic facilitator for every project that comes into the country. Therefore, ProMéxico will strengthen its collaboration with local states, the business sector, and the academic sector, working hand-in-hand to generate more opportunities for growth and development.</p><h4>The flow of FDI and international trade are key components of Mexico's economy. What are the main strengths attracting foreign investment?</h4><p>Mexico has positioned itself as one of the most attractive and profitable destinations for business development worldwide. There are at least five reasons behind this, including our favorable macroeconomic environment, the existence of a legal and regulatory framework that favors investment, the availability of highly skilled and specialized talent, our strategic location, and competitive production costs. Furthermore, Mexico has a highly productive export sector that is founded on the intensive use of capital and technology offered in our country. Mexico has proven it is ready to support more innovation and high-technology activities, given its highly skilled human capital and experience, as well as an economy that exports sophisticated products. Therefore, the goal is to support every sector in the country to help them move forward in their transition to more advanced and high-tech manufacturing, with a focus on boosting those industries that are able to generate more technology and knowledge transfer, such as the automotive, auto parts, aerospace, IT, electric-electronic, medical devices, and renewable energy industries, to name a few. Mexico is already a very attractive destination for these sectors. The goal is to seize this opportunity and further the competitiveness of these industries, attracting even more foreign investments that foster our supply chain. In this sense, ProMéxico plays a relevant role in strengthening our supply chains, as well as having a particular understanding of the challenges faced by companies in their export and investment processes abroad.</p><h4>How will you be adapting ProMéxico's services to optimize the support provided to the business community both at home and abroad?</h4><p>ProMéxico has 36 offices abroad located in 23 leading economies that, in turn, represent over 70% of GDP. Moreover, ProMéxico has 29 offices in México, where several services can be provided. We have to adapt our services and key programs for the business community on a permanent basis, in order to provide personalized attention to our customers' needs. In this sense, ProMéxico has become a strategic partner to promote the country overseas in trade- and investment-related areas. From 2008 until March 2013, it confirmed 437 investment projects by foreign companies in Mexico for multi-annual investments reaching $54.71 billion. They have gone into sectors such as automotive, electric electronics, aerospace, and renewable energy, and have come from trading partners like Japan, Spain, the US, and Germany, to name only a few. Since its creation, the Investment and International Business Promotion Unit at ProMéxico has supported over 5,000 companies and will be increasing this figure even more.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy do you think hold particular potential in terms of strengthening Mexico as a contender to become Latin America's largest economy?</h4><p>Mexico's commitment to promote growth via economic openness and competitiveness has been an essential factor to it becoming a leader not only in Latin America, but worldwide. Mexico is growing in the right direction and the country's business environment is full of certainty and trust among the international community. In fact, our country is today one of the major players in the international arena. The structural reforms that are being promoted by the federal government are boosting Mexico's position at the core of the world's competitiveness. Furthermore, as a result of the country's commitment to economic stability and free trade, Mexico has become a strategic platform to reach key markets around the globe. This openness has changed Mexico's economic model. Before Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), our economic model was based on import substitution and the domestic market; and our exports at that time were mostly raw materials. Today, high- and medium-tech products represent more than 50% of our exports. This is a very different profile compared to the rest of Latin America, which is focused on commodities. Mexico's commitment to the free flow of goods and services, as well as investment, has transformed Mexican industry into a globally competitive manufacturing hub, in sectors such as aerospace, automotive, electric-electronic, medical devices, and IT—to name a few. These competitive advantages are already flourishing under President Peña Nieto's government. In fact, Mexico recently achieved record-high exports. Also, our GDP has the largest expansion in North America, with 3.9% real growth from 2011 to 2012. We are a country with clear stability, low inflation, and enormous opportunities for business and investment. In short, this is Mexico's momentum; it is a leader and a country that always looks forward, full of trust, growth, and development.</p><h4>What would you say are the key challenges that need to be addressed to enable Mexico to optimize its potential as an economic hub?</h4><p>Mexico should continue promoting its high-tech sectors, such as the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and IT industries, which provide an important platform for advanced manufacturing and R&amp;D projects. Today, Mexico is the third-largest exporter among the G20 nations for medium- and high-tech manufacturers. The country is also the leading exporter of these products in Latin America. In order to become a key player and also an economic hub in these sectors, we have to implement policies that endorse more innovation, as well as research and industrial development in the country, just as a starting point.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I am very optimistic for Mexico's future. Currently, the country is very well positioned and continues to improve its advanced manufacturing capabilities, strengthening its internal market and consolidating domestic production chains. All these strengths have led to great results: analysts, consultants, entrepreneurs, and specialized media around the world agree that we have a stable and growing economy. Goldman Sachs, Nomura, HSBC, Accenture, and PwC, among others, estimate that Mexico will be between the fifth and eighth largest economy in the world in the years to come; however, we are working hard to leverage Mexico's future even further. Our present administration is focusing on promoting reforms to the country's regulatory framework—mainly in the education, finance, telecoms, and energy sectors—in order to encourage investment and competitiveness. I strongly believe that with all these efforts we will boost Mexico's momentum. Our country is ready to face today's challenges, and I agree with the various analyses that say that the country will become one of the strongest economies in the world in the coming years. That is the main goal of the strategies we are implementing at ProMéxico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Tijuana to Mexico?</h4><p>Tijuana is now considered either the third or fourth largest city in Mexico, and has over 2 million people. Our border with California gives us the largest crossing between two nations, with over 16 million people crossing per year. Our economy is more or less a revolving door with Southern California. We have a city that has over 30 public and private universities. We are one of the largest industrial cities in Mexico, and along the border with the US we are the most important city. We have an inspirational concept that we call “San Diego, Tijuana: two cities, one region." We share the same air and water and there are at least 80,000 US citizens that live in Tijuana. The only problem that Tijuana has right now is the delay crossing the border because the US is investing $600 million in revamping the border crossings. There have been delays on the US side; however, the Mexican side was finished in November 2012. The delays can take three or four hours, which is unacceptable to both sides and it hurts. San Diego County receives about $6 billion in business from Tijuana residents every year. It is a little uneven because we are getting $1.5 billion from San Diego. A few years ago, we had the perception of violence, but I can name you several US cities of a comparable size that are a lot more violent. We have reduced crime by around 60%-70% over the past two years, and now if you go to Tijuana you see the nightlife is back. The only problem we have with tourism is the border crossing. You don't want to go for dinner and lunch and wait two hours to cross the border. We have formed a bi-national association across the border cities because our capitals have difficulties—Washington, DC and Mexico City—understanding border economies. It is a different economy because our commercial areas compete with the more sophisticated places in the US. A lot of people don't realize that the economic activities between all the border cities from the east coast to the west coast form the sixth largest economy in the world, and Tijuana is the leader of that. The association that we built with US border cities started two years ago. I was chairman on the Mexican side and the Mayor from El Paso was the chairman of the US side. That helped us lobby to get more things done and encourage a better understanding in our capitals. It helps to have not just one mayor going, but the mayors from both sides. It is kind of working. I think the change in our federal government has done great things for Tijuana. One of the things you are going to see is a new transit system here. Thanks to President Peña Nieto's understanding that this city needed a makeover in its transportation, we can look forward to immense growth. Many people come here with the intention of crossing the border, which is much more difficult now, and they end up staying in Tijuana. They say that Tijuana grows three hectares a day. We are really having difficulties in catching up with utilities and infrastructure. With President Peña Nieto giving us federal funds for the new infrastructure, you are going to see a different Tijuana in two or three years.</p><h4>What plans do you have in terms of infrastructure investment?</h4><p>The first investment is for Ps1.5 billion, and there is going to be much more. There is a lot of private investment right now in the commercial areas. I think Tijuana will be the second largest city in Mexico very soon. We have an excellent airport connection to the entire country and our road network  is very good. We are rebuilding the inner city system, in which the city is going to invest about Ps800 million in 2013 to fix the roads and infrastructure to better receive foreign and local investment. I think that we have an excellent relationship between our labor and business communities, and one of the things we promote in Asia and Europe is the education system that we have here. For example, one of the universities that we built about 15 years ago is Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana (ITT), which has over 2,000 students. The curriculum can be adjusted to what investors need. For example, Toyota has been here for several years and we did the training for all of its employees at the university. One thing that stands out is that about 80% of the students have a job when they graduate. The flexibility of being able to ensure the companies that they will have a workforce is extremely important. There are over 4,000 trucks that cross every day from Tijuana through the commercial area, and this number is growing. We are trying to, with the federal government, repair the old rail system that is not in service right now. That is another thing that we are trying to obtain from President Peña Nieto, which we are sure we will get. There are many things that we are doing right now to receive more investment because we have so many people. A problem is that California is deporting around 300-400 people a day. We don't have the infrastructure or the money as a city to help them out. We have been talking to the US authorities because they deport them by air out of Phoenix and El Paso to the country that they came from. We are about to get authorization to fly them out of the US side. That is a joint program with the US government because that is really a human problem. You pick up these people and they have families, but they are called “illegal," but “undocumented" is a better word. At night, they open the gate and push them back to Tijuana with only the clothes on their back—no identification or anything. We really have that problem. Now, what we are doing is helping them take a bus back home, but we cannot force them. California is emptying its prisons of not just Mexicans, but Central Americans as well.</p><h4>Why is it so important for Tijuana to diversify trade relations?</h4><p>I am actually a businessperson. This is the first time I have been a politician. I am very optimistic about Asia because when Samsung came to Tijuana it was because I took it to our industrial park, and it grew so much that it built its own Samsung City. We also have Kyocera from Japan and Hyundai from South Korea. We were just there in November 2012, and it is starting another investment to build parts for motors in the Alabama plant. Instead of bringing its suppliers from South Korea or China, it is building them in Tijuana. Right now, if you check the cost of labor in China and add the high cost of transport and shipping and oil, the Chinese have more benefits; however, it is not as cheap as it used to be. A decade ago some US firms that were in Tijuana went to China, and now they are coming back to Tijuana.</p><h4>How do you foresee the new administration creating changes in Tijuana?</h4><p>President Peña Nieto, during and after his campaign, was the first elected president to receive the mayors from all over the country. He understands that everything starts at the local level. We call him the “Municipality President." He visits the different cities, and he came to Tijuana 15 days after he took office to see what we were doing. For all the cities, he is very interested in what we are going to do to prevent crime. The government is giving us Ps58 million for crime prevention. The President is very interested in pacifying the cities and I think it is going to be great for all the cities, not just Tijuana.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths of Nuevo León as an economic hub?<br></h4><p>It is very important to point out that Nuevo León is the most competitive and productive state in the country. It has four strategic pillars that are the focus of all our energy. The first is our human capital, the second is our strategic location or logistics platform, the third is our supplier base, while the fourth and last pillar is innovation. These four pillars contribute much toward Nuevo León's development strategy. With just 4% of the national population, Nuevo León actually produces 8% of the country's GDP. We have been and continue to be the industrial capital of Mexico, and are transitioning to advanced manufacturing in several strategic sectors. Nuevo León produces 11% of all manufactured goods in the country, and in terms of exports that means approximately $30 billion a year. If you compare that to other places, we export more than all Central American exports combined, and are comparable with the US states of Tennessee and Massachusetts. This is a $90 billion economy. We are double the national average for GDP per capita. The national average is around $10,000 per year, while in Nuevo León it is around $20,000 a year.</p><h4>What strategies is the department employing to ensure that this is a sustainable, competitive, and innovation-based economy?</h4><p>The governor commissioned us to restructure the primary functions of this organization to become more efficient and tailor it to the needs of enterprises. Nuevo León is interesting in the way that the industrial community tends to push or align public policy. It has a very important say in how public policy is drafted. This comes from Nuevo León having 10 out of the top 20 companies in Mexico. Industry here has a very strong weight. Thus, it was necessary to understand and bring the needs of enterprises closer to the Secretariat of Economic Development. As a result, the entire undersecretariat was restructured. Now, it is called the Undersecretariat of Investment and Industrial Development. We are very tailored to foreign investment, but in 2013 we want to begin to develop local industry. To stimulate industrial development, we created two divisions that are now a part of our pivotal strategy. The automotive sector is key and it represents one of our nine strategic sectors. What we try to do is identify the needs of entrepreneurs and enterprises. How do we do this? We map the value chains. For example, in the automotive sector, Nuevo León produces approximately 27% of all auto parts in Mexico. However, we want to map all the components that compose a car in order to see all of our tier-one, tier-two, and tier-three suppliers. This is done to see how well integrated our supply chain is and to fill in the gaps. What we do then is develop SMEs, certify them, and promote them as reliable parts of the value chains of larger enterprises. Out of the 27% of national auto parts we produce, 70% of all raw materials are still imported. Consequently, we need to stimulate import substitution from a competitive standpoint. We bring in SMEs and develop them so that they can provide services via certification.</p><h4>Nuevo León recently won the tender for the construction of the new Caterpillar plant. What does this and other recent successes demonstrate about the state's attractiveness?</h4><p>Winning this tender was a very important step for us as it means a $45 million investment. It represents the first time Caterpillar is outsourcing its cabin manufacturing to Mexico. Also, it represents an interesting time for us because the transition from simple manufacturing toward advanced manufacturing is where Nuevo León is proving itself. Nuevo León has the advanced technicians and specialized engineers available in order to produce the cabins for general tractors, which will be assembled in the Caterpillar plant in Victoria, Texas. It was a very interesting expansion. We welcomed it and assisted with a whole soft-landing platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The 2012 World Economic Forum on Latin America was held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Why was this year important for the country and the region?<br></h4><p>Mexico has the second largest economy in Latin America and acquired more prominence in global affairs as Chair of the G20 in 2012. The context of Mexico's Chair of the G20 and hosting the G20 summit, together with Brazil hosting the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+ 20), have been unprecedented opportunities for Latin America to take on a leading role in global issues. Despite the current international economic context, Mexico has proven to have a dynamic and resilient economy and has continued to receive significant flows of FDI in diverse sectors. A similar positive economic trend has been experienced by some other Latin American economies. Both regional conditions and positive trends, together with the region's stance in the international scene, have put Latin America in a relevant position in 2012.</p><h4>How would you assess the outcome of the event?</h4><p>It was extremely successful. We convened more than 850 leaders from business, government, international organizations, academia, and civil society from over 70 countries, setting a record for the number of participants and in their diversity for a regional meeting on Latin America. There was also a positive response acknowledging the relevance of Mexico and Latin America in world affairs, since the meeting was an important milestone in the process leading up toward the G20 summit at Los Cabos. The key priorities for the Mexican presidency of the G20 were mapped by the Mexican government, and the World Economic Forum contributed to this with the creation of multi-stakeholder task forces on the eight priorities outlined by the B20, including green growth, food security, transparency, trade and investment, innovation and ICT, financing for development, and the creation of an advocacy group that will ensure continuation between one G20 presidency and the next.</p><h4>What key economic priorities have been identified for Latin America?</h4><p>While the dynamism and financial resilience of Latin American economies have been acknowledged, a broad consensus about the importance of introducing more innovation in Latin America was clear, as well as other challenges—such as the need to increase productivity, modernize infrastructure, simplify governmental procedures, and promote wider hemispheric integration—and obstacles preventing Latin America from reaching its full potential. Other acknowledged priorities are the need for improved education and training, together with public security issues and the need to strengthen institutions and ensure a firm rule of law to offer both legal and physical stability in the long term. Creative policies must be implemented to foster a path toward societal growth while building on the wealth of human capital in Latin America.</p><h4>How important do you believe public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be for the development of the country going forward?</h4><p>I am sure that PPPs will be an important catalyst for the economy. However, it will not only be significant for large infrastructure, energy, and connectivity projects as traditionally conceived, but also for other less evident areas such as health care and education. I believe there is significant opportunity to work through PPPs to achieve social agenda goals. A great example of this is the Mesoamerican Health Initiative launched in the Forum's meeting in Puerto Vallarta—it has brought together the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carlos Slim Health Institute, the IADB, and the Government of Spain as donors to contribute to maternal and child health in Central America and the southern states of  Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) playing in promoting international trade development in Mexico?<br></h4><p>IMCO has advocated for competitiveness for the last 10 years. We define competitiveness as the ability of a country to attract and retain investment and talent. IMCO is an independent think-tank with an emphasis on fact-based public policy improvement. As a result of our advocacy strategy, we have partnered with world-class institutions such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), International Finance Corp (IFC), Emerging Markets Forum, the OECD, and the Open Government Initiative, to mention just a few. We are international advisors for the National Council on Competitiveness of Nigeria, together with Harvard Professor Michael Porter. IMCO advocates on a broad spectrum of specific policies such as transparency, public procurement, security and drug policy, productivity, drivers of economic growth, and small business policy.</p><h4>The flow of FDI and international trade are key components of Mexico's economy. What are the main competitive strengths of the country?</h4><p>Mexico is a democratic country with stronger institutions than many of its competitors in the global landscape. Of course, there is room for improvement, but the authoritarian, un-egalitarian, and un-civil stigma attached to the country is nothing but a historical reminiscence. We have an open regime for FDI in most sectors, and those that are still secluded from the international markets are undergoing radical reforms. Mexico is not a cheap manufacturing base; it is a place where the middle class is thriving, which entails limitless possibilities in terms of industrious, innovative people, and a large consumer market. Violence figures have had some improvements during the last couple of years, and are still lower than in many other countries in the region—the free flow of information about crime attests to the institutional strength of a country that is continuously making efforts to provide open government data to anyone interested. In trade activity and the attraction of FDI, the country is quite heterogeneous. While some states such as Chihuahua trade more than 250% of their GDP, others such as Michoacán do less than 15%. Those states with a tradition in free trade, such as those on the border and in Central Mexico, are comparable to the most prosperous regions in Asia and Europe. Nonetheless, our southern states and other landlocked localities still face serious challenges in terms of integration to the export effort, FDI, and development.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy do you think hold particular potential?</h4><p>Mexico won't become Latin American's largest economy in the near future just because of the sheer size of the population difference between the country and Brazil. We would have to increase our per capita income to more than twice that of Brazil's in order to become as large in economy terms. However, Mexico has the potential to become the most productive and highest-growing country in the Latin American region. Our growth figures for the last few decades are not too bright, due to the very astringent adjustments that the economy had to suffer, from resolving its debt crisis to improving its productivity in a competitive landscape. Due to Mexico's openness to the world, flexible exchange rate, and low public debt, it has focused its economic activities, concentrating on the core of manufacturing sectors with a very high potential in automotive, aerospace, electronics, and bio-medical equipment. In the service economy, things such as hospitals, resorts, and restaurants also have an international reputation for outstanding service and quality at an attractive price.</p><h4>What would you say are the key challenges that need to be addressed to enable Mexico to optimize its potential as an economic hub?</h4><p>Education, quality of public services, corruption, and openness in activities still reserved for the state, such as energy, still need to undergo first-generation reforms. In the case of energy, its openness to the participation of private operators is fundamental to unleash a Mexican version of the North-American shale revolution, an indispensable change to preserve the competitiveness of our manufacturing and service economy. Informality is prevalent in the economy, which entails costs in terms of productivity. A financial system that channels savings into productive ventures while keeping public monies unexposed to entrepreneurial risk is a must. Mexico directly needs to develop equity financing for small businesses, both to unleash their power as engines of growth and to provide new investment opportunities for its thriving middle classes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core of Mexico's foreign policy and how has the secretariat been working to make Mexico's voice heard amongst multilateral institutions and organizations worldwide?</h4><p>Mexico's foreign policy is guided by a firm belief of the country's right to self determination. Within this basic premise, our foreign policy has been guided by the protection of human rights, free trade, and the pursuit of global solutions to global problems. Because of our history, culture, and geography, Mexico has always been a country open to the outside world. We firmly believe that our integration with the rest of the world will translate into higher welfare for our citizens. Mexico has 13 free trade agreements (FTAs) in force, giving us privileged access to 44 different countries. Our foreign trade in 2012 reached a record $740 billion, accounting for two-thirds of our GDP. This is not random; it is a consequence of a shift in our economy over the past 20 years, which has moved from an oil-dependent, import-substitution scheme to an open market in which manufacturing accounts for over 80% of our total exports. I firmly believe that our foreign policy should work toward the creation of new economic opportunities, and we are working steadily on different fronts. We are in negotiations to build a free trade area with Chile, Colombia, and Peru within the Pacific Alliance. The Pacific Alliance will be a regional platform to promote closer ties with the South Pacific area. Mexico has been participating in the negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership since October 2012. We have been extremely successful in achieving increased trade volumes with our North American partners. We are also ready to seek new opportunities in those markets in which we have a limited exchange, but that will certainly drive the shape of the world economy in the following decades. Mexico has always been a strong advocate of international institutions as facilitators of global dialogue. Our strength in multilateral institutions derives, I believe, from our non-ideological approach and our desire to be pragmatic and consensus building. It is also derived from our willingness to shoulder our share of responsibility in global governance. Some recent examples are our participation in the UN Security Council in 2009-2010, the hosting of the UN Climate Change Conference in 2010, and the G20 chairmanship during 2012.</p><h4>In what ways will the new administration be pursuing a more modern and proactive approach to foreign policy?</h4><p>President Peña Nieto established five clear axes for his government: security, education, prosperity, inclusiveness, and global responsibility. The fifth component, ensuring that Mexico acts responsibly in the global arena, falls squarely in the realm of foreign policy. It calls for Mexico to be an active participant in finding solutions to short-, medium-, and long-term global challenges. It implies that in the bilateral, regional, and multilateral arenas, Mexico's positions must be in accordance with the search for a better world for all. Our foreign policy, however, goes beyond being a responsible global actor. In fact, foreign policy must be geared toward the achievement of all five axes of government and not only the last one. To that end, we foresee four main pillars for our foreign policy strategy: our bilateral, regional, and multilateral policies; our overseas development assistance policies; our policies to promote Mexico in the economic, cultural, and tourism arenas; and our policies aimed at protecting Mexicans and Mexican interests outside of our territory. As I mentioned above, our foreign policy must leverage our domestic policies. Our offices abroad will be extremely useful in achieving our goal. Mexico has the largest network of consulates in the US; actually, it is the largest consular network that any country has in another single nation: 50 offices spread from Anchorage to San Diego and from San Juan to Boston. We also have 75 embassies and 16 consulates distributed throughout the world. President Peña Nieto recently addressed our diplomatic corps and instructed ambassadors and consuls to get directly involved in this institutional effort to promote Mexico as a destination for business and travel. The goal is to engage our diplomats in regular actions of public diplomacy that reach wider audiences. As head of the Secretariat, I will personally coordinate this endeavor, which I am sure will be successful in the medium term. On a parallel track, we are committed to the adoption of increasing actions toward cooperation for development. The Mexican government recently set up its own Agency for International Development, which has proved to be a tremendous help in coordinating the international aid that Mexico offers to third-party countries. We have taken part in different projects throughout Central America and the Caribbean, in which Mexico has financed or offered technical support in the design and implementation of several programs. These include constructing hospitals and markets in Haiti, supplying electricity to our partners in Guatemala and Honduras, and modernizing border crossings in Panama and Costa Rica. We strongly believe that as Mexico's economy grows, we must help our neighbors and friends bring about further opportunities for development.</p><h4>How important are collaborative efforts between Mexico and other Central American countries to strengthening the region, and what initiatives are you undertaking to improve relations?</h4><p>Central America and the Caribbean region are of the utmost priority for Mexico's presence abroad. Historical, social, and economic ties link Mexico to the region and, therefore, Mexico has assumed its political commitment to be an important player in all cooperation and development issues in the region. Our countries share common challenges, and we can also find joint solutions if we work together under a framework of mutual responsibility. Certainly, much of the focus has shifted lately to security and immigration issues, but there is a large threshold of opportunity in the economic, social, and development fields that should be reinforced and promoted. As an example, since 2008, under Mexican leadership, the Mesoamerica Project unites 10 countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panamá, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Mexico). The purpose of this mechanism is not to create a new bureaucratic body, but a platform to find solutions in eight main areas of action. Moreover, in 2011, during the last Tuxtla Summit, Mexico set up the Yucatán Fund, which provides resources through innovative financial schemes to support the development and integration strategy in the region. With an initial endowment of $160 million, Mexico was able to provide resources to three infrastructure projects in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Belize. The current portfolio presented by the Mesoamerican countries is increasing and Mexico will continue its financial and technical support as long as the projects fulfill two requirements: they must have a strong social impact, and they should also consider a regional spillover of benefits. Mexico wants to become a beacon in the cooperation for development field in the region. We are committed to sharing our best practices and institutional development experiences with those countries that share common problems with us. And we are also working on more traditional cooperation stages; for instance, we want to increase the number of grants and scholarships for Mesoamerican students to come and study in Mexico.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I am very optimistic about Mexico's potential for this year. Our macroeconomic stability, strong institutions, and dynamic private sector place us in a most favorable spot to take advantage of both internal and external opportunities. Even though 2013 will likely still be marked by the legacy of the economic downturn of 2009-2010, a period of increased global stability looks more likely than not. There are of course still challenges ahead and we should all work to ward them off. The US' long-term solution to its fiscal challenges and the stability of the eurozone are still the main sources of potential risk. However, progress has been made on both fronts. Authorities in the US are keenly aware of what is at stake and Congress and the administration are working together to reach a lasting solution. Along the same lines, the European Commission and European Central Bank, as well as all national European governments, have been most responsible in taking appropriate action to contain the contagion from crisis countries. European leaders have proved with concrete actions that the European project remains worthy and alive. Mexico thus faces an external environment that can be supportive of reasonable economic growth rates in the coming years. The extent to which we take advantage of these conditions will be determined in part by our ability to resolve long-standing structural issues that have held back our potential. The signals we are seeing from different actors indicate that the right conditions can be found to advance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Mexicans have a legacy that is pre-Hispanic, colonial, independent, democratic, and revolutionary. The past for us has been our identity and a source of inspiration, and so it will remain in my government. We are heirs to an ancient tradition that survives today in indigenous languages and cultures. We are the expression of the Hispanic culture. Our institutional vocation is a fact proven by history. Very few countries, not only in Latin America but worldwide, have had our continuity. Since 1934, we have witnessed the swearing in of a new President every six years.</p><p>
	During these years, the country has maintained internal political order. Mexico has progressed without dictatorship, which was the aim of our revolution. Full democracy has taken time, but today democracy has been consolidated and become part of our culture. Generations of women, men, thinkers, politicians, activists, and citizens have worked to make the democratic Mexico of today. In Mexico, there is a real separation of powers and there exists a healthy plurality of parties in Congress. Federalism in Mexico is not an ideal, but a reality.
</p><p>
	These achievements have included bringing macroeconomic stability to the country over the past three decades. After surviving a number of successive financial crises, Mexicans have learned hard lessons. It is now up to us to use this platform to accelerate growth. We have a historic opportunity to project Mexico to the world, for it to become the economic powerhouse that it deserves to be.</p><p>
	We currently have a clear picture of what Mexico needs to sustainably accelerate its development and economic growth so that it is able to realize the huge potential it has in both natural and, more importantly, human resources.
</p><div class="quote">
	“The signing of the Pact for Mexico shows that we can agree. It is unequivocal proof that with political will and a shared vision of the future, the transformation of our country will be possible."
</div><p>
	We also need to rediscover ourselves and our strengths. We are living in a new political climate, which fortunately for Mexico allows for different visions. This climate helps us to reach agreements that allow us to move toward better conditions, especially in terms of transforming our legal codes and institutions so that they are more in line with the social and political realities of today.
</p><p>
	Mexico today has a number of strengths, including a high level of macroeconomic stability and low debt. This puts it above many countries and gives us the confidence to move forward and a mandate to use our wealth for the benefit of all Mexico. At the same time, we have a clear diagnosis, too, of what we have to change. That is the challenge for this government.
</p><p>
	We want a Mexico that is free of violence, one of peace and tranquility for all Mexicans. We want an inclusive Mexico and a Mexico that recognizes the importance of quality of education, because education sustains and supports the development of any nation.
</p><p>
	In order to accomplish this, we must grow at an even faster rate. This is the aim of a government-wide effort to give more credit to productive projects, to develop more competitive industrial policies, and to create more jobs and opportunities for Mexicans. I am convinced that if we achieve these objectives, Mexico will assume a greater role in the world, able to support and defend the noblest causes that humanity has.
</p><p>
	Our vision for Mexico is to never become complacent. We must harness the current spirit of change and transformation and engage all sectors of society and the economy to forge a new future for the nation. As President of Mexico, I call on everyone without distinction of party, social standing, or ideology in order to reach shared goals. This is precisely what has been proposed by the Pact for Mexico. Because reform cannot succeed without the support of a large majority, we are laying at the foundations of this a level of political agreement and dialogue that allows for democracy, economic growth, and the reduction of poverty and social inequality.
</p><p>
	Mexico is commencing a new stage of democratic life. Now is the time to come together and take the next step in improving our democracy. In this way, policy makers should, or must, walk together. We need dialogue to build consensus. This decisive moment in the life of our Republic requires politicians to reach agreement. It is a great display of political maturity that the political parties in Mexico have come together to sign the Pact for Mexico.
</p><p>
	The Pact includes five essential agreements for our national life. Firstly, to transform Mexico into a society of rights, so that all Mexicans can exercise the rights set out in our Constitution. Secondly, to promote economic growth, employment, and competitiveness, to create conditions that allow Mexico to grow to its true potential. Thirdly, to foster security and justice, in order to realize the desire and right of Mexicans to live in an environment of peace and tranquility. Fourthly, to increase transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption measures. Finally, to perfect conditions for democratic governance.
</p><p>
	Based on these five major agreements, we, as political actors, have managed to lay the foundations of a consensus aimed at jointly improving our country. The signing of the Pact for Mexico shows that we can agree. It is unequivocal proof that with political will and a shared vision of the future, the transformation of our country will be possible. Beyond good intentions, this is a visionary initiative that will allow us to build a future based on the shared goals of various political expressions. It is an innovative agreement that imposes specific goals and deadlines to achieve them. It is also a realistic agreement, detailing practical tools to carry out the aims within a realm of clear facts. The Pact does not replace or limit the legislative process. It strengthens and opens a new avenue to reach agreements and build majorities.
</p><p>
	The Pact for Mexico is a major political agreement, but it is also a national project that everyone can share in and endorse. We invite civil society organizations, researchers, academics, unions, business leaders, and the media to join and adhere to this Pact for Mexico. We invite each and every one of our citizens to know this Pact, and to make it their own. Through the various social networks and technology platforms, we will open this Pact to society. Everyone can sign it and join in the great transformation of Mexico. We all need to promote Mexico's transformation, and recognize that this is Mexico's time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Colombian government assess economic relations between Mexico and Colombia?<br></h4><p>Historically, our two countries have had good economic relations and now that we are part of the Pacific Alliance, along with Chile and Peru, they are at their best. Since August 2011, when the deepening of our free trade agreement (FTA) came into force, an agreement that not only opens markets for goods and services but also sets forth clear-cut rules on trade and investment matters, the number of Colombian products with preferential access to the Mexican market has increased, as in the case of dairy products. With this deepened relationship, reinforced by the Pacific Alliance, we expect to increase access for our products into Mexico. We attach particular importance to the investment opportunities that emerge from the FTA. Mexico's cumulative FDI in Colombia between 1994 and 3Q2012 reached $844 million, while Colombian investment in Mexico over the same period exceeded $1.85 billion. Confidence in the country and the FTA's advantages have enabled the arrival of Mexican companies to Colombia such as Marí­tima Mexicana, Mabe, Mexalite, Coca-Cola Femsa, CEMEX, Bimbo, Mexichem, Cinépolis, the Vitro Group, Comcel, and Telmex. Our bilateral trade, which did not amount to $1 billion in 2002, reached $7.2 billion in 2012, with an increasingly positive trade balance in favor of Mexico. This trade imbalance has reached important proportions, which we seek to reduce by taking advantage of the trade opportunities afforded by the agreement.</p><h4>What areas hold the most potential for development in terms of imports and exports between the two countries?</h4><p>Mexico is an attractive country that has been a key trade partner for the diversification of our exports, especially for non-mining products. It is the fourth economy in the Americas and the second in Latin America, with 115 million inhabitants and a per capita GDP close to $18,000. One of the characteristics that makes Mexico such an important country is that, just as Colombia, it continues to open its markets and has a positive attitude toward imports. This is reflected by the FTAs it has signed and by the $390 billion on average it purchases from around the world each year. Through Proexport, our exports promotion agency, trade opportunities for Colombian businesses have been identified in sectors such as spirits, specifically rum; processed fruits and vegetables; designer cookware and other decorative articles; hotel supplies; cosmetics; apparel, such as jeans, swimwear, and underwear; software and IT services; fats and oils; sugar and sugar confectionary; cocoa and its preparations; dairy products; eggs; honey; preparations of meat, fish, or crustaceans; and chemical products and plastics. It is also important to attract their investment, given the fact that Mexico is the second Latin American country with the most investments abroad. Worldwide, Colombia is the ninth destination for Mexican greenfield projects, and the third in the region.</p><h4>How can the Mexican and Colombian governments work together to combat common regional issues of violence and poverty?</h4><p>Without a doubt, inequality is a concerning phenomenon in the region, as well as the violence levels generated by many factors, but in particular as a result of the global drug problem. Latin America and the Caribbean have been engaged in a head-on confrontation against this scourge, with high human and economic costs, and it's extremely important to ensure greater international cooperation. We have also proposed that the Organization of American States (OAS) should conduct a thorough analysis of the War on Drugs we have been fighting for over 40 years, in order to determine where it has and where it hasn't been successful, and identify what other alternatives are available to fight trafficking more effectively throughout all of its ramifications. At the Summit of the Americas held in Cartagena during April 2012, Mexico and Colombia, along with the other countries in the hemisphere, agreed on the need for this evaluation, which is expected to be ready in summer 2013. Colombia and Mexico have joined efforts through different cooperation mechanisms on intelligence matters, information exchange, and judicial cooperation. The purpose is to strengthen the policies, programs, and strategies, not only between our two countries, but also with the Central American region. In particular, on security matters, Colombia has activated the “International Cooperation Strategy on Comprehensive Security," where we share experiences and capacities with 10 countries in the region: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Haiti, and Suriname.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The name Grupo Pegaso has long been associated with the communications sector. What led to the extensive and successful diversification of the business?<br></h4><p>My grandfather pioneered the communications industry in Mexico and he was a key player in the 20th century development of our country. His steps became my foundation, and thus I have always been inclined to pay more attention to the wireless industry. When you like what you do, you tend to do it better. In regard to our diversification, it has come about because my office receives an average of five diverse business proposals per month. Our exposure to other industries is very common.<br></p><h4>What sectors of the economy do you believe hold particular potential in terms of strengthening Mexico as a contender for the title of Latin America's largest economy?</h4><p>In 2012, Mexico's stock exchange was the second best performing stock market in the world, lagging only behind Germany's. In the next decade, we should become not only the largest economy in Latin America, but one of the most dynamic among emerging markets. Three industries are set to drive this development. Manufacturing presents tremendous opportunities. For years, China has always been the go-to place for manufacturing, and according to JP Morgan, Chinese workers earned half of what Mexican workers earned in 2002. Today, they earn just 12% less than their Mexican counterparts. There are a number of Chinese companies moving their operations to Mexico to save on costs. Companies in 41 different countries are also looking to set up multimillion and multibillion dollar manufacturing facilities in Mexico. If most of these interested parties decide to build facilities in Mexico, construction companies will experience tremendous growth, not only in terms of these new facilities, but also in the construction of infrastructure to support the manufacturing explosion. Energy is another area where there are many opportunities. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, Mexico is the world's most energy secure nation among 25 of the largest energy-consuming countries. Our Congress will pass a new energy reform bill that will inspire investments of billions of US dollars in Mexican energy companies, as the nation opens up the industry to private capital. We export 80% of our goods to the US, so it helps to be a neighbor of the largest economy in the world. In 2012, we earned $227 billion exporting goods to the US, and this will only get better since what it could take a month to receive from China, it only take a few hours from Mexico. With the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), there are no trade wars or tariffs to negotiate, and everything is set. These are a few reasons why the world is bullish about Mexico.</p><h4>What is Grupo Pegaso most interested in developing in its portfolio and what are your growth and expansion plans?</h4><p>We are taking a close look at the energy industry and, as always, the telecoms industry. As for growth, we are very bullish when it comes to the energy industry and more conservative in telecoms, but it is still early in the game to be specific.</p><div class="quote">“We will continue focusing our investments in fields that are beneficial for the social and economic development of the country."</div><h4>Where do you see the main opportunities for the private sector?</h4><p>US economist Jeffrey D. Sachs has expressed his views that in the US, there is a new progressive era in which the government will play a positive role in providing education, fighting climate change, rebuilding infrastructure, taking care of the poor and disabled, and generally investing in the future. Mexico needs all of its players to act in concert for the benefit of all Mexicans and in all areas of our economy, and all businesspeople should examine some projects from a purely financial perspective and others with more social benefits in mind. In regard to our future success, it depends on the ability of the government to implement a number of reforms, and also on its ability to be prepared for the implementation of the changes that need to happen.</p><h4>What would you say are the key challenges that need to be addressed to enable Mexico to optimize its potential as an economic hub, particularly from an economic perspective?</h4><p>We need to have judicial certainty in all aspects of business development, but especially in terms of fairness in market competition. The business community around the world, as well as local entrepreneurs, need to believe that they can invest in Mexico and compete on equal terms with local incumbents.</p><h4>What are Mexico's strengths as a host country for major sporting events?</h4><p>We have held all sorts of world-ranking sporting events in Mexico, such as two FIFA World Cups, and that experience helps. In addition, Mexico is a very hospitable country with a tourism industry that consistently ranks as a top income producer. I believe it is within our DNA to feel comfortable as a host nation. We do not compete with the US, simply because there are enough events for everyone on this planet. We have our own unique style that is not comparable to anything or anyone else.</p><h4>What can be done on the national level to address the current lack of high-profile tennis players in Mexico?</h4><p>In the early 1990s, Mexico had four tennis players among the top 100 in the world. However, today we do not have any. We need to encourage and support young talented Mexican players to reach the highest levels, because while our country does have a tennis culture, we lack high-profile players. I believe that the Mexican Tennis Federation should work to bring in more expertise in this field. For example, we could organize seminars and courses with the best tennis coaches in the world, as well as host high-level youth competitions in our country. In this context, we are closely working with the private sector to strengthen the game of tennis in our country. For that reason, we are looking at establishing business partnerships and securing funds for projects and infrastructure. We believe that as soon as Mexico has a high-profile tennis player, the sport will experience a boom.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I have a positive outlook for this year. We will continue focusing our investments in fields that are beneficial for the social and economic development of the country. Agribusiness and Stevia production are two of our main investment activities. Also, we will expand our presence and infrastructure along the border region, as well as continue working to generate new content within the sports and communications  industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[business-generator-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013-mexico-2013]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Grupo Hermes?</h4><p>We started as a family company, and in 1978 we became a holding. We began with the manufacture and assembly of trucks, and then we moved into energy generators, which is the second most important business at Grupo Hermes, our industrial branch. Grupo Hermes later entered into the construction and operation of infrastructure: highways, dams, water treatment facilities, hospitals, and museums.</p><h4>How have your individual groups been growing, and what has been Grupo Hermes' growth strategy?</h4><p>Grupo Hermes has four divisions: infrastructure, energy, transport, and tourism. What has given Grupo Hermes a strong position is its ability to specialize in each of the sectors in which it participates, and to focus on contributing to Mexico's growth through developing key infrastructure. We now have a presence in the most important states and cities in Mexico, having built more than 500 kilometers of highways and 13,600 meters of high-specification tunnels in some of the most challenging projects in the country. We have had a major presence in the international market since 2005 in the energy sector, and we were recently awarded a $148 million project for energy generation in Saudi Arabia by the Sadara Chemical Company. The whole project is the largest petrochemical plant in the world built in one stage, worth $20 billion. We will be supplying four steam energy generators. Each one is as tall as a five-story building. We have started to assemble everything in Mexico and ship the units to Saudi Arabia. In fact, the first two were shipped on January 2013. Grupo Hermes has been selling to Saudi Arabia for a while, and it has been quite successful so far. We have already developed more than 10 projects there. Ours is a very cyclical business, so it changes a lot and we must be ready for the good times and the bad. We have been developing our own technology and we have joint ventures with a number of highly prestigious international companies. By developing our own technology, we have become largely self-sufficient.</p><h4>How have you been diversifying your business operations?</h4><p>We began the construction company more than three decades ago, and now it has a lot of expertise in water-related businesses, such as dams and waterwheels. We also specialize in highways. Grupo Hermes owns and operates several highways and bridges in the country. We see a lot of potential in roads, because Mexico has a huge need for new infrastructure if it wants to regain competitiveness vis-á-vis other emerging economies. Recently, the association between the public and private sector in schemes such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) has been going well, and we have carried out some construction projects for the government. Usually, we finance everything so we own and operate our own roads; after 20-30 years we give them back to the government. I am confident that this is the way Mexico will go in  the future. For our latest highway, Durango-Mazatlán, we worked in alliance with a Spanish company to develop a project the government had wanted to do for 20 years. However, it was very expensive and difficult because it had to cross one of the major mountain ranges in our country, the Sierra Madre. It is almost complete now, and has been one of the biggest challenges we have faced. We are also building a large dam in Central Mexico called El Zapotillo to supply water to more than 2 million people in the cities of Guadalajara and León. There is a lot of potential and we are well equipped to compete. We are well positioned to associate ourselves with international companies to develop infrastructure in the country.</p><div class="quote">“We have started to assemble everything in Mexico and ship the units to Saudi Arabia."</div><h4>Will PPPs become increasingly important for companies like Grupo Hermes?</h4><p>I am convinced that PPPs are the development scheme of the future. We have some projects, such as large roads, being financed by Mexican institutions. We also have Spanish and Mexican companies that provide the financing, buildings, and operations. The projects that are built by the government just need reliable construction companies. Then there are some projects that need construction, financing, and operations. We can contribute in all these areas. We offer integral solutions through PPPs. This model has a lot of potential. So far, we Mexicans have been investing about half of what we should in much-needed infrastructure. Under the Calderón administration, PPPs were most important, and that will continue under the current government. Our financial situation is much better in Mexico now. The US and EU are facing many deficit problems, but Mexico had its problems in 1994 and 1995. We have learned from those challenges and strengthened the fundamentals of our economy. In Mexico, the public deficit is very small, the commercial balance is still positive, and our institutions are strong, so we are in good shape to grow. There is a lot of money in the world, and we are able and ready to attract investments. Brazil has been successful and now it is our turn. I am optimistic that the situation in Mexico is very positive.</p><h4>You have successfully bid for work in Saudi Arabia. How easy is it for Mexican companies to compete in Middle Eastern markets?</h4><p>It is all a matter of being competitive. You begin by finding small windows of opportunity and doing things better and better. First, we started selling small energy generators to Chile, and continued selling small energy generators to Saudi Arabia. That was the case for us 12 years ago. It becomes a small world. We are probably one of only 10 producers of those generators globally. Slowly, people begin trusting your products. They buy small products at first, then medium ones, and so on. There is fierce competition from the South Koreans, the Indians, and the Italians, and we probably end up winning 10% of what we bid on—mainly key strategic projects. With our technology, sometimes we have to be innovative to meet the special needs of our customers. For example, there is one company in Canada that wants to use tree bark as a combustible material, so it asked for our help and we came up with a solution. It is a completely different generator than the one that runs with coal or gasoline; however, we were able to find the best solution. It's good to get to know the market, but also good to get to know your products, and we have also the ability to develop the technology to face these new challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-fortunate-position]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) was set up by the State of Qatar in 2005. What ideas led to its founding?</h4><p>The QFC was established by the government of Qatar in 2005 with a mandate to support the development of a world-class financial services industry. Our strategy is in line with the ambitions set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030 to diversify our economy. A principal goal of the Qatar National Vision 2030 is to develop Qatar as a dynamic, knowledge-based economy and a world-class financial services sector, and QFC is a vital component of that vision. We have made great strides in the last few years in implementing our strategy. A growing volume of business by QFC firms, coupled with an attractive, world-class business, tax, legal, and regulatory environment is stimulating the development of the financial services sector in the State of Qatar. This is further demonstrated by the increasing number of Qatari firms that are using the QFC as a platform for their international growth ambitions.</p><h4>When one hears the name Qatar, the ï¬rst thing that comes into many people's minds is oil and gas. What eï¬€orts is the QFC making to promote Qatar globally as a ï¬nancial center?</h4><p>The QFC Authority, as the strategic and commercial arm of the QFC, is dedicated to playing a major role in the expansion of Qatar's financial services sector. Besides ensuring that this world-class environment continues to evolve to maintain best practices and facilitate the growth of the financial sector, we also help to promote Qatar as an international financial center in a number of other ways. Developing international links is an important element in our growth strategy. In the last year or so we have entered into Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with our counterparts in China, India, Japan, Turkey, and the UK. We have strengthened our cooperation with Luxembourg for Finance, the agency for the development of the financial sector in Luxembourg, and Europlace, the promotional body for the French financial services industry. Thought leadership by way of increasing the availability of data and analysis on the MENA region is another important element in our strategy. With a population of over 380 million, the MENA region accounts for a combined GDP of over $2 trillion. As a key international energy exporter, the region is an increasingly attractive proposition for financial services providers. In 2012, the economies of the region's oil producing nations grew by an impressive 5.5% on average. The QFC Authority continues to commission significant research to further its business strategy by supporting thought leadership initiatives, including events and publications, which encourage dialogue, the sharing of knowledge and best practice, and the identification and exploration of growth opportunities. During 2013, these initiatives have included the Seventh MultaQa Conference, organized with Global Reinsurance magazine. MultaQa has become the leading international insurance industry event of its kind in the Middle East. The QFC Authority also supported the second Bloomberg Doha Financial Summit, which was attended by more than 300 asset management professionals from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the US. Our research shelf includes the D&amp;B Business Optimism Index, the MENA Insurance &amp; Reinsurance Barometers, the FTSE Global Markets Asset Management Survey, and the GCC Mutual Fund Survey. In April, we published the first annual MENA Asset Management Barometer, providing industry practitioners with detailed insight into the regional asset management. In May, we revealed a groundbreaking report on private wealth and the scope for family offices in the Middle East.</p><h4>There is sometimes a perception that the QFC is more inclined toward multinational companies. What opportunities exist for local companies to establish themselves under the QFC umbrella, and what is being done to promote this?</h4><p>The QFC is an integral part of Qatar's financial sector and, therefore, an integral part of Qatar's economy. We offer domestic as well as regional and international firms a highly attractive base from which to expand their businesses. The QFC specifically provides domestic companies with an ideal environment from which to launch their businesses internationally. This world-class environment comprises a legal system based on English common law, independent principles-based regulation, a competitive tax regime, and efficient administration. Domestic firms can also benefit from the evolution of the QFC's regulatory framework, where developments have been designed to add capacity and facilitate the growth of the financial services industry within Qatar. At the end of 2012, for example, we introduced new regulations for Special Purpose Companies and Single Family Offices. Almost half the firms newly licensed with the QFC in 2012 were Qatari firms. Quite a few of the local players have capitalized on the QFC platform to support their businesses, including QIA, Ooredoo (QTel), QIC, QNB, Doha Bank, Amwal, Qatar First Bank, QInvest, and SEIB Insurance. In short, the QFC helps all licensed firms generate new and sustainable revenue streams and provides access to local and regional investment opportunities.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy is in line with the ambitions set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030 to diversify our economy."</div><h4>What role does the QFC play in diversification and what are your aims for the future?</h4><p>One of its objectives is to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on hydrocarbons. Developing the financial sector is an important part of that diversification, and is essential as the economy matures and wealth accumulates. Part of the synergy between the hubs is therefore the extent to which they all play an important role in the evolution of the financial sector and cross-fertilize each other. For example, the insurance and asset management sectors are closely connected. Asset management and insurance are also vital components of the rich ecosystem of financial services firms and activities we are stimulating. The potential for asset management lies regionally in rapidly increasing wealth. This wealth is first and foremost driven by strong economic growth. The IMF forecasts that the GCC economy will grow at 3.5% a year between 2012 and 2017. Qatar is forecast to grow at 5.2% annually over the same period. Qatar is fortunate to have the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas, and the monetizable value of Qatar's oil and gas reserves has been put at $16.7 trillion. The country also enjoys the world's highest per capita income and the largest percentage of millionaires. There is increasing evidence that high-net-worth individuals from across the region are increasingly looking to invest their money closer to home and Qatar also has a substantial sovereign wealth fund. Regionally and internationally, Qatar's strategic location in a time zone between the mature markets of the West and the emerging markets of the East and South, the stable and world-class business environment, and the increasing attraction of Qatar and the GCC more generally as an investment destination underpin the case for basing asset management operations in the QFC. Despite spectacular growth rates, the reinsurance sector in our part of the world is still in its infancy, accounting for as little as 1% of GDP as compared to 6%-7% in the developed world. However, we believe that the potential for further growth is enormous. Qatar plans to invest $140 billion over the next five years in projects such as a new airport, a seaport, and a rail and metro system. Total infrastructure investment, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup, may be about $200 billion over the coming decade, a fact that illustrates the possible synergies between asset management and insurance. The region's demographic profile is another factor that supports the long-term growth projections for the insurance sector. GCC governments, including Qatar's, are introducing compulsory insurance schemes; for example, healthcare and motor insurance, which further boosts premium volumes. GDP growth is set to remain above the global average for the foreseeable future. These strong economic fundamentals, combined with the QFC's first-rate regulatory and operating environment, suggest that our objective of developing into a leading financial center is within reach. But again, we pursue a long-term approach and are committed to building a sustainable platform. Our long-term vision continues to be to cement Qatar's position as a platform for financial services in the region. All three hubs share huge growth potential, not only in the domestic market but also through the use of Qatar as a strong regional base for expansion into the GCC and beyond into the wider Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian subcontinent, reflecting the global shift in influence and business toward these economies. Qatar is geographically, economically, and philosophically extremely well positioned to take advantage of this trend. In short, we aim to build a broad and representative range of licensed local, regional, and international firms. Our goal is to be a major center for asset management, reinsurance and captive insurance, as well as being a continuing source of growth for the financial sector, as an integral part of Qatar's financial system.</p><h4>FDI in the region is expected to rise over the next few years. What is the potential for attracting investments into Qatar from new markets such as Africa and Latin America?</h4><p>It is certainly true that FDI in the GCC region is expected to increase over the coming years, attracted by strongly growing hydrocarbon-based economies, favorable demographics, and massive state infrastructure spending plans against a backdrop of developing capital markets. Heavy public infrastructure investment will create a wide range of funding and investment opportunities for the private sector such as project finance, bond and sukuk issues, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These all point to excellent opportunities to find growth when other parts of the world, notably the mature and debt-laden economies of the West, are still offering only modest returns. There is growing interest from overseas investors in Qatar in sectors such as health, education, and technology, as well as infrastructure and, of course, hydrocarbons. We fully expect that investors from the fast-emerging economies, such as Africa and Latin America, in addition to those from Asia, will show increasing interest in Qatar.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-rare-bouquet]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal background and how did you come to be at Amouage?</h4><p>I have an extensive background in luxury goods. I started out in retail, on the fast-track promotion scheme at Liberty's of London, and have since held positions at various companies, taking in Simpsons of Piccadilly, Harvey Nichols, Dunhill, Pringle, and Ozwald Boateng. My métier in the latter half of my career became company or brand turnaround, and that is why I was interested in the opportunity presented by Amouage. This brought me out to Oman in 2006 to turn around the fortunes of the brand. I could see that Amouage's range of fragrances clearly had the potential to be marketed and retailed successfully on the world stage. The packaging of the products, however, was at that time too recognizably targeted to the Gulf market, and not relevant enough to the contemporary, international consumer. Amouage attracted me hugely, as my background in brand turnaround and product development led me to feel there was a genuine opportunity to create something unique.</p><h4>How has Amouage developed from its Omani origins into projecting an international retail strategy?</h4><p>Today, we are an international brand based in Oman. All our decisions are based on our international strategy. Britain, Russia, Europe, the Far East, and all our successful locations sell to indigenous audiences. You can never design for a specific region in this day and age with the amount of information available to everyone globally and with taste levels becoming homogeneous. I believe it is important not to define one's brand as being limited to any specific region, which is why we do not create products for any specific market or region. There has been a paradigm shift in retail and product development as international markets and consumer demands have converged. Of course, areas of the world have certain taste or product differences in desirability, but the overall message of any luxury brand is the same these days worldwide. Arab consumers have the same aspirations as consumers from other regions; they are all international consumers, particularly at the luxury end of the market where we operate. I believe that prior to my arrival and that of our Creative Director, Christopher Chong, Amouage had rather forgotten this and the product presentation had become rather irrelevant to today's consumer. Amouage today has a brand that is aspirational, relevant, and crucially displays a presence that will flourish in the international context. We sell around the world, from Sydney to Santiago, and we have created our own style rather than purely following trends. We are proud to be a brand with a Head Office based in Oman, but we now have five international sales offices around the world, all with product design, packaging, and branding created in London.</p><div class="quote">“We do not follow trends in the choice of our collections as we believe we have, to a point, become trend makers."</div><h4>What is the creative process behind Amouage's fragrances?</h4><p>We work with various producers across the world, in Grasse, Paris, New York, Geneva, and beyond. Our Creative Director Christopher Chong handles the entire design process for every fragrance, from conception to realization. His inspirational and creative brief, which kicks off the process, can take ideas from a myriad of sources, from music to literature, fashion, interior design, art exhibitions, and movies. Once the brief is created he then puts this to our “noses" to prepare their fragrance submissions. This can be anything up to 250 individual fragrances, all created to express the inspirational brief. There are then various meetings to adjust the intensity of certain notes until the final five fragrances are chosen, which are then reworked and refined until around two or three for each gender stand out. Only at the end of this arduous process of refinement and gradual elimination are the final perfumes presented to me, each with a male and female version. Then, Christopher and I ultimately decide together which fragrances will form the final two and will become the new fragrances for the coming year. We tend to launch two mainline fragrances (a men's and women's) per year and one Library Collection. The Library Collection is a really unusual juxtaposition of often rare or exclusively created notes that are presented as highly complex and unique fragrances. The Collection is Amouage's comparison to fashion's Haute Couture, and was developed to express the true mastery of perfume creation. The ongoing success of each launch within this Collection has surprised even me!</p><h4>How would you characterize Amouage's fragrance collection today?</h4><p>Our fragrances certainly have their own voice. We do not follow trends in the choice of our collections as we believe we have, to a point, become trend makers, since we know some other brands follow us and try to replicate our fragrances as closely as possible. This we see as highly flattering, but of course we guard our product secrets and recipes very closely. Our fragrances tend to be oriental and we have several wonderful chypres in our women's collections, but we also have amazing white florals and rose-based scents too, such as Honour and Lyric. We are renowned in our men's range for creating woody, spicy fragrances, one of the most successful being Epic for men, amongst others. Our current product portfolio incorporates around 26 fragrances, of which seven are in the Library Collection. We believe that with our increasing collections we are now seen as an important player in the world of luxury “haute parfumerie."</p><h4>How important is the quality of ingredients in Amouage's fragrances?</h4><p>The ingredients we use are the best and often the rarest available. Throughout the whole development process the only focus of the perfumer is to create something beautiful and unique. At that stage we do not consider the cost of the ingredients, as we believe our responsibility is to create something truly special. The cost only becomes an issue once the final fragrance has been chosen. This allows the noses to be highly creative, and we know that in this way we will get only the very best submissions from them. Our materials are sourced from all over the world, and working with Amouage is something the noses really enjoy, as they are allowed the opportunity to explore the most exotic ingredients. Only the finest of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are used in creating our fragrances. In fact, synthetic molecules are becoming very popular in the fragrance industry today because they provide limitless creative possibilities. The level of concentration we include in the fragrance of the actual perfume concentrate is, we believe, one of the highest in the world.</p><h4>What has Amouage done to capitalize on its success in the fragrance market in terms of diversification?</h4><p>I believe that Amouage can move into other product categories that are accessory-related, but not restricted to fragrance. Of course, by increasing our retail presence, we are also able to add on product categories such as the bath and home collections and the recent addition of leather goods ranges, in high-grade calf and exotic skins, hand stitched by artisans in Florence, the home of the best quality leather goods in the world. Leather goods from Amouage have been readily accepted and are now proving to be successful with our consumers, which leads me to believe there maybe other opportunities for diversification in the accessories market in the future, so I would say, “watch this space."</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Amouage?</h4><p>My vision for the future of Amouage is pretty simple. Today, we have around 250 employees, with approximately 100 in Oman. We will have 20 shops around the world by the end of 2013 and I plan to double that at least in the next five years. I want to have a retail presence on the right opinion-forming high streets in capital cities around the world. We shall continue our wholesale development, working with the best partners in a controlled environment, with clear brand identification wherever we sell. Brand awareness will continue to grow among our target audiences as Amouage further establishes its name as one of the top global luxury retailers. I believe there are further product categories that we could develop successfully and market in our own shops. Of course, in market terms, we have still not broken into certain key markets, which will be our main focus in the near to medium future. These markets include China, Japan, and South Korea, all of which we believe are good potential markets for the brand. However, we are biding our time as far as this is concerned and making sure that we find the right partners with whom to work to bring about a successful and impactful entry with long-term potential. Our brand has a métier that consumers have recognized and bought into, and the brand DNA is clear. There are areas for Amouage to build, and this industry demands that we keep constantly abreast of creative trends and developments. We aim to be a trailblazer, plowing our own furrow with a reputation for innovation and a cool market image.</p><h4>What opportunities does Oman have to develop a reputation in the luxury market?</h4><p>Oman has a fantastic opportunity to develop itself as a luxury tourism destination. However, there are serious obstacles to this progress due to the lack of development, especially in the hospitality sector. The road network and airport infrastructure are beneficial for the economy, but the foundations for tourism must be put in place to capitalize on this potential. It is one thing to have a huge capacity airport, but if we don't want it just to be a terminus for travellers flying on elsewhere, and there is a serious intention to diversify the economy into high-end tourism, then we need many more luxury hotels to house the potential influx of tourists. There just aren't enough in Muscat, and so I believe more focus needs to be placed on developing Muscat, first and foremost, as a seriously up-market destination, with interesting experiences and facilities for a sophisticated, international travelling consumer who will be availed of all the facilities and needs such a consumer would expect to be provided in a luxury, international destination. For this to happen, however, requires a steadfast commitment to such a strategy in order to fast track this very real opportunity for the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What policy decisions have contributed to making Tanzania such an attractive destination for FDI?</h4><p>One is our diplomacy, which is working. We have been succeeding in our diplomatic efforts. For example, a super computer was donated to Tanzania by India, and it is capable of doing amazing things. In e-medicine, which we are working hard to develop, we were able to see its capabilities when the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, visited the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology. My reaching out to Bill Gates at Microsoft led to support for our schools, and communication with IBM resulted in 28,000 books on technology being sent to schools. I have visited laboratories at Google and Stanford University, and everyone wanted to work with us. When it comes to investment, it is a question of putting the right policies in place and ensuring that the climate is attractive for the private sector. We see a lot of interest in Tanzania's resources, such as exploration for natural gas. The peace, stability, and predictability of our investment policies are also very attractive. We made a number of changes in our investment law, but we are always working in a civilized and solid manner. The country's geography itself is a resource, and if someone chooses to locate their business in Tanzania, they have access to a huge market. I believe that is what draws FDI.</p><h4>How will the “Big Results Now" initiative help Tanzania achieve its Vision 2025 goal to become a middle-income country?</h4><p>Planning has been our tradition since independence. We started with five three-year development plans over a period of 15 years. With the oil shock, the war with Uganda, and the historical droughts, the implementation of the second five-year development plan did not go as well as we had hoped. We almost stopped doing the five-year plans. In 2000, we developed a long-term perspective and Vision 2025, through which Tanzania aims to become a middle-income nation. When I came into this position in 2005, we had declared the Vision, but we still lacked a plan. Recently, I came back to the 15-year development plan. We are now doing the first three-year development plan, and in 2025 we will emerge as a middle-income country. Breaking it down even further, we also draft annual plans. Within those, we see strategic areas of investment and focus. In the cabinet, we decided to agree on the first six sectors that needed our focus. It was almost a secret ballot. Everyone voted privately and that is how we decided on the top six sectors: infrastructure, energy, water, education, agriculture, and tourism. Had we agreed on seven, we would have also chosen health, so we incorporated it as well at a later time. With Big Results Now, we gathered in groups to discuss each sector, identify the achievements made in each, and note the future challenges. In addition, we wanted to draft proposals on the interventions that are necessary moving forward. We then realized that it was key to make certain things happen, and those actions had to be incorporated into the budget. We have been a bit late in terms of dealing with the process, and some of the areas have not yet been taken into account when allocating the budget. We knew it was important to implement the projects and follow-up with their progress. We wanted Big Results Now. The various ministries have made agreements to finish the projects in areas that they themselves identified; our task is simply to check in and make sure that they deliver on their promises. The government has made promises to the people, and we want to create more efficient ways to make those dreams a reality.</p><div class="quote">“If someone chooses to locate their business in Tanzania, they have access to a huge market. I believe that is what draws FDI."</div><h4>How can Tanzania influence its neighbors to increase regional prosperity and stability?</h4><p>We have been making contributions to peace in the region. However, as the English say, “charity begins at home." While we have been working aboard, we have been concentrating on peace and stability on the home front. There is rule of law, respect for human rights, and democracy in the country. We believe in the policies pursued by the founding fathers and the successive generations, and these have helped in making us a sustainable and peaceful country. In addition, we have also been able to make progress in many areas, and this is a factor of social, political, and economic policies that have carried through over the years. Furthermore, the dynamism, open-mindedness, and receptiveness to change of the Tanzanian people has also been key. We entered a market-based economy and we continue to open up the economy. In 2014, we are going to celebrate 50 years of the union, and although we have experienced challenges, on the whole we have succeeded. As we celebrate 50 years, I suggested that we review our constitution to decide whether or not there are any points that can be improved on. The commission has completed its part and made public many of its ideas; there are debates going on, and at the end of the dialogue we expect that we will be able to agree upon a constitution that works for everyone. There is inherent dynamism on the part of the ruling party, readiness to advance, and the room to advance and make the necessary changes. This has been the secret of the stability of the country and is a catalyst for positive changes to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the success story of Nobis in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our success has been driven by a woman named Isabel Noboa, and it is her vision that has brought us to this level. We are still a very young conglomerate of companies—we are not a consortium, but rather a conglomerate because we are so diverse. The key elements of this success have been our teamwork and a vision that has allowed us to get involved in business areas that have driven the company into new areas. We believe that we can profit from the growth of the country, and this has actually proven through the years to really help drive our success.</p><h4>How do you maintain a focus on core business interests?</h4><p>We have a very well-developed, strategic board within the company that overlooks all of the operations and decides the strategic path. It may seem as if we are very diverse in our interests and companies, but we are actually focused on three main sectors; agriculture, industry, and commerce. We move along these three core areas of development and will soon be expanding into a fourth area: energy. This is not a self-sufficient area as of now as it is very much connected to production; however, we have looked at a map of needs that the country has and we work to meet those needs. We are entering 2014 with a division of self-sufficient businesses in the energy sector.</p><div class="quote">“There are two areas of great development here in Ecuador. One is logistics and the other is energy."</div><h4>What will be the level of investment for these projects?</h4><p>We have three energy plant projects that are already approved and, of those, one is 15 MW and will cost between $10 million and $12 million. It will be self-funded, but we have another that will be 25 MW in size and we have already received confirmed funding from a consortium of private banks. We will fund about 40% of that project. Then, we also have a larger plant that is 47 MW in size, and we are discussing the creation of a partnership with a foreign group for this.</p><h4>Would you like to partner with more foreign investors?</h4><p>Yes, we would like to partner with some foreign investors and we would like to choose the most strategic partner. Usually, we are looking at South American partners because we share the same language and face similar programs. When we enter a partnership, it is not that I open the doors for them to come to Ecuador, but it is more to create a network of partnerships around the region, specifically South and Central America, more than North America and Europe.</p><h4>Would you be willing or able to work with Colombia or nearby countries in the region?</h4><p>Sure. Even though energy is something that you have to produce and sell primarily to the central government, we also sell to partnerships and it is still a business. However, there is just one major buyer, and this is why you need to look at how these partnerships can come into these new businesses. We have to take new ideas from one starting point, and in doing so, sparks that create new ideas end up developing into something greater. One idea can lead to another, and one growth area can also lead to another.</p><h4>Is this new approach part of the big changes set to take place here in Ecuador?</h4><p>I think that there are two areas of great development here in Ecuador. One is logistics and the other is energy. We will be present in both areas, and the role that we intend to take will be as leaders. We would like to be the logical leaders that foreigners want to contact in order to attract investors from the private sector.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the strength of the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>I think that Ecuador has a strong economy, but one that can be held back at times by the government's policies. I think the country is doing very well and has been growing for the last 12 years, and especially in the last four. Economically, the country has been growing, and for the last four years there has been some substantial growth as debt levels have fallen. I do not think that anyone in the industrial private sector could say that they have never had a bad year, but anyone who has worked hard has had a good year. The government has been saying that there will continue to be a steady increase in growth for the years to come.</p><h4>Is this the right moment for expansion at Nobis?</h4><p>We always target a five-year strategy and follow it. It has proven that, in the last eight years, due to stability within the government and the economy, we have really been able to meet our plans. If you plan and do your job well, then you can accomplish your plans. I believe that is one of the main drivers in the economy. You cannot blame the government for not having been here, because it has really pushed the private sector to grow and that is the good part. If you do your planning and you can fulfill your business quota, then you can build a company and do something that you want.</p><h4>Are there any new projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>We are going into the logistics sector for a deep-water port. If everything goes well, we will work with the people from DP World, and we will be able to have the port ready soon.</p><h4>How will this contribute to the country's main interests?</h4><p>It has been planned to cover the needs of the next 75 years. The plan will be able to accommodate ships of more than 15 meters in draft, which will allow it to function very much like a hub. The shipping lines are always building larger boats to put more tonnage on each ship, so that is why they decided to do this; to follow those ships.</p><h4>Do you foresee servicing more exporters?</h4><p>Exports will be more associated with the agriculture sector. Right now, one of the biggest exports that Ecuador has is through the banana trade, which is still mainly carried by freighters. This port will see significant container traffic, and this is good because you can ensure the parameters based on the time that it takes the fruit to get to each specific market. This is a big project for us because it is worth some $600 million.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Qatar Steel and what have been some of your major achievements throughout the years?</h4><p>Over the last decade, Qatar Steel has transformed itself into a growth-oriented business entity posting impressive operational and financial performance. Since 2003, the company had gone ahead with many expansions increasing capacities in all its production facilities: direct reduction (DR) is up from 0.75 million tons per annum (mtpa) to 2.25 million mtpa, the electric arc furnace (EAF) increased from 1.2 mtpa to 2.15 mtpa, and in the rolling mill (RM) it is up from 0.70 mtpa to 1.5 mtpa, thereby increasing the sales volume of saleable products from 1.00 mtpa in 2003 to 2.580 in 2012. The subsidiary unit in Dubai was upgraded with a new bar rolling mill with a capacity of 0.30 mtpa and by increasing the capacity of wire-rod and rebar-in-coil mill from 0.18 mtpa to 0.24 mtpa. Over the years, the company has built its reputation on sound operational and management practices in various facets of business. We have also acquired a number of accreditations for product quality, and launched a new corporate brand identity in April 2007, whereby QASCO was changed to Qatar Steel with an external promise of making steel matter. Qatar Steel was the first known Qatari organization that initiated Balanced Scorecard implementation at the beginning of the millennium. A decade later, it became the first Qatari company to be inducted into Palladium's Hall of Fame for Strategy Execution, an international accreditation for excellence in strategy management practices. At present, Qatar Steel is the exclusive provider of steel to the State of Qatar, a source of national pride, and one of the major contributors to the non-hydrocarbon economy of Qatar. The company directly employs around 2,000 people across operating units in Qatar and the UAE, primarily providing long steel products to the regional market.</p><h4>What effect has the rise in prices of raw materials had on Qatar Steel?</h4><p>Input costs play a vital role in the steel industry globally, and not just for Qatar Steel. The metallic steel price movement makes a significant impact on the movement of finished product prices across the globe as they are closely linked. Typically  the oxide pellets that go as a feedstock into  DR based production  constitute around 60% of the cost of goods sold, such as rebar and finished products. Therefore, any volatile movement in these prices has a major impact on the bottom line unless the price escalation is well absorbed in finished product prices. The demand for construction steel in the GCC also plays a vital role in the finished product price movement in this region, which is historically higher than the global average. They have been supportive in absorbing price increases in metal prices, except during the recession period in the latter part of 2008 and in 2009, when demand dropped drastically. Finished product prices have been reasonably supportive. Qatar Steel is also maintaining its cost position as an integrated steel mill through operational excellence to derive competitive advantage in the market.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar Steel is also maintaining its cost position as an integrated steel mill through operational excellence."</div><h4>What is Qatar Steel's target market?</h4><p>Qatar Steel sells its finished products predominantly in the GCC. The primary market of rebar for Qatar Steel is Qatar, which constitutes around 65% of its total rebar sales in GCC, while wire-rod and re-bar in coil are predominantly sold in the UAE and Qatar.. The company meets the growing domestic demand and also maintains a market share of around  15% in its core rebar business in the GCC. The strategy has always been flexible with exports depending on the supply and demand situation. In essence, we maintain a presence in all export markets within the GCC with higher volume of sales in major markets like Saudi Arabia and the UAE while maintaining large presence in Bahrain which is small and import driven.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the steel industry?</h4><p>Through constant innovation, Qatar Steel develops new technologies and processes, which result in increases in productivity, cost savings, and also significant reductions in carbon emissions and other pollutants. Qatar Steel's focus on innovation extends to its by-products, including slag generated from EAF molten steel processing, oxide fines produced by the DR iron plant, and mill scale generated from caster and RMs. Instead of discarding these by-products, Qatar Steel repurposes them to maximize their value and sells them to customers for further use. Qatar Steel has created an R&amp;D department to provide impetus to research activities and to be pro-active in meeting market requirements as a leading integrated steel manufacturer in the GCC.</p><h4>What investment efforts is Qatar Steel making in “frontier" markets?</h4><p>Apart from fast expansions in the operating unit in Qatar, we have also invested in a re-rolling unit in the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai since 2003 that is producing rebar, wire rods, and rebar-in-coils. We have gone ahead with prudent investments within the GCC and in the MENA region totaling in excess of $550 million. This includes a new joint venture in Algeria, to be owned 51% by Algerian companies and 49% by Qatar Steel International—50% Qatar Steel and 50% Qatar Mining—for Phase I with 2 mtpa long-steel capacity. Qatar Steel has signed an MOU with Sheikh. Jassim Bin Mohammed Bin Thani Establishment for Social Care for a JV steel project in Qatar with 0.700 mtpa capacity of bar mill and 1.1 mtpa capacity of Steel Melt Shop.</p><h4>How would you assess importance of, and how do you go about the development of human capital?</h4><p>Qatar Steel recognizes its employees as the company's greatest asset, and as such it views employee engagement and Qatarization as a critical component of success. Under the “Organization Development Program," a number of initiatives are aimed at enhancing employee morale, introducing a corporate culture to create a spirit and sense of belonging, upgrading the performance review process, and finding innovative ways to increase and sustain motivation. There is an annual performance appraisal system to reward, recognize, and retain meritorious employees.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the industry sector in Qatar?</h4><p>The steel market in Qatar has been favorable over the last decade, especially during 2003-2008 when we had an unprecedented construction boom. The outlook is positive with real GDP growth expected to come from the non-hydrocarbon sector in the coming decade. Qatar is making rapid progress with its formidable pipelines of infrastructure investments worth over $130 billion that will run through to 2020. These investments cover transport, logistics, and rail (Doha metro, long-distance rail, freight, and the Lusail people mover), roads, new stadiums, hotels, and ancillary facilities. The impetus is on FIFA-related infrastructure development and the steel industry will largely benefit through this period. Steel demand is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% to 6% during 2013-2022, with supportive government spending and Qatar Steel prepared to meet this growing local steel demand.</p><h4>What are the medium-term plans and goals of Qatar Steel</h4><p>Qatar Steel pursues its growth strategy of upgrades and new expansions in order to meet the growing steel demand in Qatar. It needs to consolidate its competitive position in the regional markets within the GCC. With no additional advantageous feedstock in Qatar in the medium term, the company will find new sources of growth and look for strategic investments by way of acquisitions and joint ventures in iron ore and steel-related products within the MENA region. We will continue to create value for our stakeholders through profitable growth from operating units in Qatar and Dubai and through our strategic alliances and investments.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Dr. Hossein Ghazavi, President of ECO Trade and Development Bank, on the goals of the bank, challenges to increasing regional trade further, and expanding the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).</p>
<h4><span class="red">THE BUSINESS YEAR</span> What were the goals of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) member states when establishing the bank in 2005?</h4>
<p><span class="red">HOSSEIN GHAZAVI</span> ECO Trade and Development Bank is a multilateral development bank (MDB). It was officially established in 2005 by the ECO founding member countries of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. As with every new institution it takes time to acquire the necessary staff and adapt to the rules and regulations. The policies, rules, and regulations adopted in this respect are all aligned with the practices of other MDBs and the needs of member states. Meanwhile, we are experiencing an endowment of admirable professionalism in terms of human resources. We’ve been fully functional as of 2008. During these past several years the Bank has achieved considerable milestones, even though it is the youngest regional MDB in the world. The bank is headquartered in Istanbul, with representative offices in Tehran and Karachi. The main purpose of the bank is to initiate, promote, and provide financial facilities to accelerate inter-regional trade and economic development. The bank is designed to be the main financial pillar for the ECO region and for the economic co-integration of ECO member states. The bank’s subscribed capital is SDR1 billion, and the paid-in capital is SDR300 million, which is equally shared between the three aforementioned founding member countries. The institution is not meant to be a profit maximizing one, but it needs to be sustainable, which is why it emphasizes profit and other satisfactory financial ratios in order to prove itself efficient in the market. The main goals of the bank are to finance developmental projects and inter-regional trade in ECO countries, to facilitate private and public sector investment through cooperation with international and national financial institutions, and to mobilize resources and provide other banking services as are deemed necessary or incidental to the advancement of its purposes.</p>
<h4>What have been the bank’s main achievements?</h4>
<p>We finance trade and promote the development of SMEs in member countries, and we also finance the investment needs of corporates and developmental projects. If I may give some examples of our operations, one was a wind power project in Pakistan, financed by the bank in cooperation with other financial institutions. The other co-financers were IFC, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and a Pakistani bank. The other major projects we’ve helped finance are an irrigation and wastewater project in Iran and a metro project in Istanbul, where we provided financing to the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. We place emphasis on infrastructural projects and projects that have developmental aspects. These can be public or private sector developments.</p>
<h4>How would you assess the level of trade integration in the ECO region and what do you think needs to be done to increase trade further?</h4>
<p>Economic integration is essential for every region in the world. The EU is a prime example of this, regardless of the current crisis it’s facing. Overall, EU countries have benefited from economic cooperation both in economic terms and politically. The ECO should take the EU as an example. Within the ECO framework, trade is regarded as a powerful tool in supporting regional integration, growth, cooperation, and development, as well as in terms of creating jobs. Total trade volume of ECO countries amounted to $880 billion in 2011. There is huge potential for improving even this considerable volume. However, there are still trade impediments like tariffs and other barriers. When we compare the ECO to other regional organizations like ASEAN, where the volume of inter-regional trade is 24%, or the EU where it’s almost 70%, we find that we have a lot of work to do to fill this gap, because the volume of inter-regional trade in the ECO region is a mere 8%. We have to raise this to, say, 20% by 2015. The ECO trade agreement, which is just now being implemented, will lower tariffs in the region. Moreover, we need to forge joint ventures, develop trade-related infrastructure, establish economic and trade zones, create currency swap agreements, establish cross-border trade settlement mechanisms, mutually open bank branches, and support the development of e-commerce. We need to do this to improve the volume of trade, as this will lead to economic growth and job creation in member countries. There is so much potential in the region. I think all the member states realize the importance of initiating and developing these projects. People in the region are already feeling the positive outcome of economic integration, and governments of ECO member states realize that these projects must be continued.</p>
<h4>Azerbaijan and Afghanistan are now joining as the fourth and fifth members of the bank. How does that fit into the goals of the bank, and do you think continued expansion is what is needed to promote the development of trade and integration in the region?</h4>
<p>The more members, the more financial resources at our disposal in terms of capital and better conditions in terms of recapitalization on the part of shareholders. It will also enable this Bank as the MDB of the ECO region to follow its goals more efficiently. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has a considerable number of members, for example. Azerbaijan and Afghanistan will soon finalize the internal states procedure to become members of the Bank, and hopefully other ECO member states will soon join, thus improving the bank’s financial capitalization, leading hopefully to become a premier regional institution having the support of all regional countries. Then, we can mobilize resources at more reasonable prices on the international market, and this will enable us to allocate far more considerable resources to various projects in member countries.</p>
<h4>You have proposed the creation of a regional partnership forum. How do you think this will help the bank meet its goals?</h4>
<p>We believe that finance is an important factor in regional development and integration. Without mobilizing the necessary capital for developmental projects, we go nowhere. In this respect, there is a need for coordinated and collective action to improve strategic partnerships and alliances among relevant stakeholders. The bank emphasizes the importance of organizing a periodic regional partnership forum comprised of various international and regional institutions that are active or looking for opportunities to locate investment and conduct business in the region. We should bring these institutions together and get them to work on joint initiative and projects, creating some synergy between them. This will benefit the region and the bank greatly.</p>
<h4>What steps do you think Turkey needs to take to ensure that it maintains a sustainable level of growth, and what is your medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy?</h4>
<p>Turkey is one of the founding members of the ECO Trade and Development Bank and is also a member of other MDBs. It’s a very significant member. I believe the authorities need to give more emphasis to a model of export-led growth that keeps in check the current account deficit, which is Turkey’s Achilles’ heel. I know that the local authorities are aware of this situation and are trying to absorb more sustainable capital inflows into the country, rather than volatile, short-term capital inflows. The economy needs to gain further competitiveness and raise its national savings rate to provide safer financing sources. Access to sustainable financing resources is essential. Turkey benefits in that it’s a bridge between Europe and Asia, and has a stable government. It is able to attract sustainable capital. To ensure these factors remain consistent for the country in the medium and long term, the current account deficit must be addressed. In addition, increasing investment in R&amp;D, innovation, human resources, creating more brand names and promoting energy efficiency would enable the country to achieve higher levels of socio-economic development.</p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of AROPE Insurance and the insurance sector in general over the past two years?</h4><p>Despite the slowdown in the Lebanese market, a new traffic law was published at the beginning of this year. Third-party liability insurance covering material damage became mandatory in addition to the compulsory bodily injuries insurance implemented in 2003. Unfortunately, this law was put on hold due to many legal flaws. As for AROPE Insurance, the past two years were digitally fruitful. AROPE Insurance was the first insurance company in Lebanon to develop a mobile app with unique features to provide full assistance on the go. It can be downloaded from Apple store, Google Play, and Blackberry App World. Our website was re-designed, a new mobile website was developed, and social media was activated to give us a full presence in the digital world and better communicate with our customers.</p><h4>What have been your major initiatives in 2012 and what are your plans for 2013?</h4><p>AROPE Insurance's focus remains on offering innovative insurance solutions to cater to different customers' needs, especially in the personal lines of business. On the other hand, we aim to continuously provide exceptional customer experience. To better serve our customers, our new Customer Care Plaza will be inaugurated in summer 2013 in the strategic location of Zalka—Metn, connecting Beirut and its suburbs to Keserwan.</p><div class="quote">“Customers are now less price-sensitive but quite demanding in terms of the quality of service they get."</div><h4>How do you assess competition in the insurance sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Customers are now less price-sensitive but quite demanding in terms of the quality of service they get. Consequently, what differentiates a company from another is neither product nor size but rather the service provided to its customers. Although our choice years ago was to be a customer-centric company with a good reputation in the market, AROPE Insurance's focus remains on achieving excellent bottom-line results. In 2012, AROPE Insurance held a market share of 10.1% in the life business and 6% in the non-life business. We are ranked fourth in terms of production in the life and non-life business among 52 insurance companies operating in Lebanese territory. We are proud to be in the top one or two when ranking is based on bottom-line results. Now that the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) has started publishing detailed figures of the companies—the last report was in 2011—a clearer view of the market has been established.</p><h4>What can be done to increase the attractiveness of the insurance sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Even though Lebanon is ranked high in terms of insurance awareness in the region, I believe we still have long way to go. Insurance is negatively perceived by customers and considered, most of the time, as a burden or a tax to pay rather than a tool for protection. But looking at the figures, we can clearly see the amount and number of claims that companies pay on a yearly basis. Investing in educating people about insurance is a big role that our government, the ICC, and the Association of Insurance Companies in Lebanon (ACAL) should play in order to better position the market.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved in recent years?</h4><p>We are market leaders in motor insurance, and we are one of the big players in life insurance. Our focus is on the personal line of business as we truly believe it is the future. There is a need for such protection in our market due to the weakness of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and the absence of social support from the government. Most of the time, Lebanese citizens have to get at least their own health insurance, retirement plan, and education plan for their children to preserve their financial stability and ensure the future of their families in case of unforeseen events.</p><h4>How does AROPE Insurance work with BLOM bank?</h4><p>Every branch is a hub for us. We work closely together to answer all customer inquiries using a one-stop shop model. Customers go to the bank not only to execute financial transactions, but also to settle bills. Insurance has become a part of these transactions, due to the introduction of mandatory insurance and as a guarantee on bank products.</p><h4>What needs to be done to enhance the regulatory environment?</h4><p>Our regulatory environment requires improvement since it doesn't properly regulate all industry activities and products, especially considering that the last amendment was published in 1999. Because of the political environment and instability, there is a slowdown in passing new laws. A new draft law for insurance has been left in the drawers for many years now.</p><h4>How do you see the insurance sector and AROPE Insurance evolving in the short to medium term?</h4><p>I am very optimistic. We are, in Lebanon, the masters of crisis management. We have learned that the hard way and the number one rule is to always be optimistic and look at things in a positive way. This is what we are doing in our sister companies in Egypt and Syria. We are going to keep on playing a major role in the market; we will hopefully always be one of the main players.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What evidence of stable growth have you seen in 2013?</h4><p>There are a couple of matters to consider. One is the investor confidence index and the other is the consumer confidence index. Consumer confidence is higher now, and at the same time so are our economic figures—GDP growth is doing very well. In 2012, we achieved 3.5% growth. We are pursuing steady growth, while investors are seeing what they like to see, and certain sectors that were heavily impacted, such as real estate, are coming back slowly in a controlled way. At the same time, we are seeing indicators that new investors are coming to set up business in Dubai. Looking at the last survey that was conducted asking the Arab youth in which foreign place they would like to live if they got the chance, the UAE ranked first, and Dubai is the highlighted city; France and the US came second and third. These indicators are important to consider because stability comes not only from economic prosperity, but also lifestyle. It was the number one factor investors valued in our Why Dubai survey. People like to stay in a place to do business, but also one that fits around their lifestyle. People want luxury and safety, and you get both of those in Dubai. Security comes with having the clarity of where you are. The government has sought a continuous vision of where we are going, our targets, and the measures taken to get there. We are sending a message that within the larger region we are very clear about our goals and ambitions and how we will reach them.</p><h4>Tourism is growing steadily, but which other sectors can you identify as having the biggest potential for growth?</h4><p>FDI grew 26.5% in 2012 compared to 2011. It is very encouraging to look at what it could be in 2013. Tourism is one of the most important sectors, especially with His Highness Sheikh Mohammed's new tourism strategy for 2020, which is looking to double Dubai's current visitor numbers from 10 to 20 million. That will open up more opportunities for more investors to develop their future plans. We see trade and logistics as the strongest contenders because Dubai is a trading city. Trade will continue to be a strong sector, while exports will continue to grow stronger. Logistics is the tool Dubai uses to be a world trade hub. Logistics are expanding, with air and sea transport being strongly recognized, and Dubai is gaining global recognition as being a world logistics hub for many companies working in that field. The Dubai plan that people see comes with a strong logistics influence.</p><div class="quote">“We have excellent relations with GCC countries, and we all complement each other."</div><h4>International trade is always a precursor of direct investment. Do you see a relationship between the locations Dubai is increasing trade with and direct investment?</h4><p>In Dubai, 85% of the average investment is in greenfield areas, while 70% is the global average. This shows that Dubai is a strong facilitator for trade. When we look at trade, we also look at facilitating start-ups to expand the market. Dubai is naturally the regional center for trade and exports. This is where companies come to grow their production through outreach programs and connectivity. We are focusing on trade to encourage investment. Trade is more likely to be the answer to the global crisis, rather than financial services. Trade will ensure a better flow of money globally, and that is what will allow businesses to rebound.</p><h4>Some sectors, like oil and gas and telecommunications, remain protected by the government. What opportunities are available to foreign companies in these areas?</h4><p>Oil and gas will continue to be a strategic sector for the government. It is not necessarily protected; however, it is for the better utilization of our current wealth. For telecommunications, we understand more companies can enter the market. Etisalat used to have a monopoly, and then Du came along and that brought a positive impact for consumers, and the services are ranked among the top in the world. By 2015, the government will look to allow additional telecommunications companies to enter the market, as long as they suit the UAE. Looking at both sectors, we have had no problem in allowing foreign investors to invest in oil production facilities, especially biodiesel and biofuel, since the government supports the green economy. At the same time, while there is a level of protection in certain cases, like telecommunications, the UAE is one of the most advanced countries in the region for connectivity per capita on a global scale. The system allowed for the better utilization of any service. You could bring in 10 telecommunication companies and you still wouldn't have enough of what you think would allow for businesses to grow. Only with clear policies from the authorities can telecommunications perform well in the UAE.</p><h4>The Bankruptcy Law will be soon implemented. What other policies are being employed to encourage FDI?</h4><p>The Bankruptcy Law is still being negotiated, and we are waiting for a couple of laws such as the FDI Law and the Companies Law. There are more than five relevant laws currently under discussion. It is not of course a case of pushing the law through; we need the right law to encourage investors to utilize the incentives. Some laws can hinder economic development. What we are looking for are laws that will allow better business development and for us to really bring in more investors, because they see the incentives of these laws and have confidence in our system. We are working with a number of authorities as well as a range of stakeholders to ensure we design the best law possible to achieve this.</p><h4>His Highness Sheikh Mohammed aims to make Dubai the center of Islamic finance by pushing the sukuk market. What impacts will that decision have in attracting FDI?</h4><p>I think it is beyond sukuks; however, the sukuk market will be an important element. The strategy is multi sector and goes into finance, production, and the implementation of certain other measures to allow for an Islamic economy, not just Islamic finance. The components are of significant importance, not forgetting that the first Islamic bank and modern Islamic finance started in this city. Dubai is a strong facilitator of services for business, and we will try to make it similarly applicable for Islamic businesses, which will give the city a boost. Islamic finance took many years to reach $1 trillion in size. We expect it to reach the second trillion in five years' time. We are taking the holistic view, and I think His Highness was clear about Dubai's ambition. When we add sectors to the Islamic economy, they are the ones that are already strong in Dubai, and we will help integrate them.</p><h4>Many Dubai companies voice concerns about sustainability, both with regards to business and the environment. What actions are you taking to tackle this?</h4><p>We have been working hard over the past year to establish the green economy partnership program with other governments and private sector stakeholders. This is a very unique perspective that goes beyond the environment and toward business sustainability. It is about how to utilize the resources that you have and make them better in the short term, not only in time but also as per the economic impact on people's lives. Economic development always involves people. This is what His Highness envisioned, and this is what we are trying and able to achieve, starting with the better utilization of our resources. When we look at developing our IT program to better utilize our resources, we look at it from a larger perspective. We need to use every component of our economy and ensure it is sustainable. Looking to the future, we aim for clean technology. The green economy is totally linked into that. By 2020, this business will be rolled out on a global scale and will amount to $4 trillion.</p><h4>In 2012, Dubai FDI attracted 119 companies to Dubai. How would you evaluate the competitive nature within the GCC in attracting new FDI?</h4><p>We have excellent relations with GCC countries, and we all complement each other. Competition helps us, and we see it as very positive. We believe that challenges are the motivator for change and for better future development. From a regional perspective, if an international company wants to establish itself in the GCC, looking at it as one bloc, we see this as very positive. Then, it depends on the nature of the investment and the economies around us. We strongly emphasize our strengths in trade and services. This is the very unique proposition of Dubai globally. We can promote doing business in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain and many other countries in the entire MENASA region through Dubai, and at the same time have businesses coming to us first. We have these discussions internally in the UAE as this healthy competition between the cities is a normal practice for many years, and it has helped to ignite positive economic change. This engine was always one of the successes of the UAE—the combination of competition and collaboration. There are many complementary aspects we share as a country that made us able to provide a wide range of offerings to investors and attract a large number of them to start here. We have already approached some regional investment bodies to collaborate with them and we have a good understanding. We promote the region as a whole—we promote investment opportunities in Qatar, because the businesses will come here to set up and then if they want to go to grow into another country we will take them with us on our outreach program. We want them to expand their operations here and launch their investments in other countries from here. Whenever we can assist a neighbor, we will. We are not afraid of competition, because there is always a positive side and we focus on the glass half full.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Hispana de Seguros built up its local business operations?</h4><p>Our business strategy is based on strong, client-oriented products with suitable marketing, giving us a necessary advantage in the Ecuadorean insurance sector. This sector is very competitive; today there are over 40 active companies in the country. Despite the intense competition, Hispana de Seguros, a company that was started from scratch, has achieved a high level of success in the Ecuadorean market. Thanks to our aggressive strategy, we have positioned the brand and our products in the market and we are now among the leading insurance companies in niche markets such as Guayaquil within the automotive insurance segment. We have also expanded our branch network and, at the moment, we have a presence in the main cities of the country, including Quito, Guayaquil, Loja, Machala, Santo Domingo, and Cuenca. Hispana de Seguros has always prioritized the provision of value-added products and services to its clients at the national level.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Hispana de Seguros?</h4><p>The cost-benefit ratio we offer to our clients is one of our main advantages as a company. This element has facilitated the implementation of our business strategy and allowed the company to achieve its goals. The wide range of products, coverage, and value we offer to our clients has enabled us to quickly achieve double-digit, sustainable growth over recent years.</p><div class="quote">“The economic and social expansion of the Ecuadorean middle class has positively impacted the development of the sector."</div><h4>What are your expectations for 2013?</h4><p>We expect 2013 to be very important for us in terms of direct sales to customers; we have put a great emphasis on expanding our client portfolio through the expansion of our sales staff and the implementation of other strategies such as call centers. This strategy has enabled us to better address the needs of the market and facilitate direct communication with clients. Overall, we expect the sector to continue growing, given that the purchasing power of Ecuadoreans is increasing and penetration rates of insurance products in many segments are continuously growing. We expect to close the year with a 12% growth rate—an aggressive figure, but consistent with our background.</p><h4>How has the company's service portfolio evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>Hispana de Seguros has a wide product portfolio that includes, property, vehicles, and life insurance products with universal coverage for individual customers. We also offer technical and corporate products, focused on coverage for property, transportation, and all risks involving business management, as well as other traditional products such as automotive insurance. In this regard, our premium insurance for vehicles is among the company's top products. Over the years we have managed to create a very diverse client portfolio that includes individuals, private companies, and public entities.</p><h4>What is the percentage between individual and corporate customers in your client portfolio?</h4><p>Our current client portfolio has over 15,300 clients, of which 13,300, or around 87%, are individuals. It also includes 1,500 private companies, or 10% of the entire portfolio, while 3%, or 500 companies, are public entities. This gives us a tremendous diversification in terms of client base and business production, reducing our dependence on any client or entity. It also mitigates risks due to the diverse location, activity, and business of our clients.</p><h4>How has Hispana de Seguros' financial performance evolved in recent years?</h4><p>We have always employed a conservative approach to our investment strategy and our top priority has been the financial sustainability of the business in the long term. This model has allowed the company to achieve sustainable growth at a fast pace. Our growth strategy is emphasized by our direct client approach, which gives us a better understanding of the activities of our clients and the risks involved.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of development of the insurance sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The economic and social expansion of the Ecuadorean middle class has positively impacted the development of the sector in the country. The penetration of the insurance sector has grown along with this middle class and, as a result, it has generated many opportunities for all players in the market. In this regard, our strategy is focused on generating the greatest value-added services to this population segment. The Ecuadorean insurance sector is very competitive and consumers also look for competitive prices. The company's niche has always been to offer competitive price and value-added products, and we can proudly say that we have achieved significant growth in this market. Looking forward, I think the Ecuadorean insurance sector holds a very attractive and promising future ahead and there are opportunities to grow in all the segments of the industry, provided that companies have a very well structured strategy.</p><h4>What are some of your main goals for the company?</h4><p>We want to continue being consistent in our business approach, for we believe that efficiency has to be among our top priorities. In this context, it is important to keep informing consumers about our activity and services. For 2013, we plan to expand our presence in the banking insurance segment, while continuing to be a very innovative company in terms of products as well as adding value to our services. For example, Hispana de Seguros is continuously complementing its offering in the automotive segment, as we believe this is the way to expand our presence in this market segment. At the moment, we do not have plans to expand our branch network, given that we can more than adequately cover the Ecuadorean market with our current offices.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Qatar Airways normalized since the return of the Dreamliner to the skies?</h4><p>It is still not normalized, as the aircraft were grounded for such a long time that we had to retrain all of our cabin crew and pilots. Qatar Airways had not been operating the Boeing 787 for a long time before that, so the experience of the crew was such that we could not put them back on board without retraining. It has also caused a lot of disruption, vis-í -vis our expansion plans, our network, and the planned increase of frequencies to current destinations. In the first month alone, we had to downgrade 2,500 flights, and we had to delay four new destinations because of a lack of aircraft. We were also affected by the fact that other 787 deliveries did not take place. There was a huge capacity shortage.</p><h4>How will Qatar Airways' new cargo fleet help position it as one of the leading cargo carriers in the Middle East, and internationally?</h4><p>We want to be a major player in the cargo business. We will have a large fleet of Boeing 777-200 freighters, and we are also looking at a substantial number of feeder aircraft, which will either be the traditional Boeing 777 or Airbus 330 freighters. We are now in the process of taking on one more aircraft, which is being delivered from Seattle in the coming days.</p><div class="quote">“Hamad International Airport will be one of the most modern, sophisticated, and passenger-friendly airports in the world."</div><h4>Qatar Airways was a pioneer in being one of the first Gulf airlines to join an alliance. Why was oneworld chosen?</h4><p>We received an invitation from oneworld, and we accepted it graciously. We fit very well into the oneworld alliance, and the alliance provides us with the right type of exposure for expanding our network. We feel that oneworld is the most flexible and most liberal of alliances. We, as part of oneworld, will still be able to codeshare with airlines outside of the alliance, and this is something that is not permitted with the other alliances.</p><h4>What percentage of your passengers use Doha as a hub, and how will the new Hamad International Airport cement Qatar's role?</h4><p>Currently, 70% of our passengers use Doha as a hub. This will decrease as Qatar's tourist infrastructure develops. Hamad International Airport will be one of the most modern, sophisticated, and passenger-friendly airports in the world. The passenger experience will be second to none. It will offer world-class duty-free shops, a five-star hotel within the building, as well as a spa and other facilities. Hamad International Airport is the first airport that has been designed by an airline. We will also have the best selection of restaurants, airport lounges, duty-free areas, spas, hotels, and a swimming pool.</p><h4>What steps is Qatar Airways taking to differentiate itself from an increasingly competitive market?</h4><p>The answer is simple: we are the only five-star rated airline in the region.</p><h4>What regions are you specifically focusing on for further expansion of Qatar Airways?</h4><p>We are focusing on all the regions of the world. We are going to expand in North and South Americas, Africa, the Asian subcontinent, and also Southeast Asia and Europe.</p><h4>What are your medium-term strategic plans, goals, and visions for Qatar Airways?</h4><p>My first priority is to get Hamad International Airport up and running. My second priority is to fulfill the network expansion that I have in mind over the course of the next three years. My third priority is to satisfy the economic needs of my country by keeping Qatar Airways at the top of the airline league.</p><h4>With all of this large-scale, rapid expansion in a short time, and other plans for the future, what is the secret of your success?</h4><p>The secret is very simple; we are absolutely focused on where we want to be, and everybody works in that direction. There is nobody that pulls in the opposite direction; everybody follows the same strategy, and this comes from the top. If everybody works together in this way, you can make decisive gains and be successful as a business.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medellí­n was recently declared the most innovative city in the world. What does this award mean for the city?</h4><p>This award marks one step toward our goal of continuing to show the world a new image of the city while changing old stigmas and stereotypes. Although the past was painful, the present and the future are bright. In addition, the award strengthens the metamorphosis of Medellí­n and gives us extra positive energy for the challenges we face. We will continue strengthening our security levels and work to make Medellí­n a more equitable city. The city has experienced huge changes in the last decade. No one would have said 15 years ago that Medellí­n would be internationally awarded for its innovation and creativeness. I have been to many different European and non-European countries and felt that both media and investors have been surprised by our city's development and evolution over the last few years. In fact, there is a larger appetite for Medellí­n among foreign investors, especially in services, innovation, IT, and education. In this regard, we have become the Latin American hub for IT-related companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Kimberly-Clark, among others. In addition, Medellí­n is setting an example for many Latin American cities that send official delegations to our city to see what we do in terms of public services, industry, and business.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Medellí­n in terms of investment?</h4><p>The most relevant one is its human capital. We are creative, hardworking, innovative entrepreneurs, and, above all, very happy people. These features are common among people from the Antioquia department and are widely recognized by all Colombians. Also, we have the best national companies in terms of public services, utilities, and transportation. Our public transportation system deserves a special mention because there is no such integrated public transport anywhere else in the country. It is highly recognized for being environmentally friendly and award winning in the case of the metro. The integrated public transport in Medellí­n is the perfect example of the innovative and dynamic character of the city. In addition, Medellí­n represents a unique case nationwide, and I'd say even regionally, in which the public and private sector and the higher education system work jointly toward achieving the development of the city and share the same goals.</p><div class="quote">“Medellí­n is setting an example for many Latin American cities."</div><h4>What role does urban development play in changing Medellí­n's image?</h4><p>We expect that 2013 will be a key year to see urban developments in the city, such as the establishment of a new district that will play a vital role in the expansion of the health cluster in the city. Medellí­n's future urban development will have its neighboring hills as the epicenter, especially in areas that already provide public services. However, we have to keep in mind our 10- to 15-year plan, and we are currently drafting the next Land Management Plant (POT) to structure the urban development of the city for the next 12 years. In this context, there are two key projects for our administration. One is the Medellí­n River Park, which is a 23-kilometer-plan to recover the river and its importance for the city's life through public infrastructure that will make the river available again for our citizens. The budget for the Medellí­n River Road Park is about $1 billion, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be a vital element in its development. The other project is the Metropolitan Green Belt and the circumvent garden of Medellí­n, which focuses on the construction of many elements: housing, road infrastructure, and public services, located within the borders of the city. The initial budget for the first phase of this project is $500 million.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant milestones for the company since it was established in 1999?</h4><p>There have been several milestones achieved in our short history. The first dates back to 2001 when the Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) and Export Pipeline Agreement (EPA) were signed. Then a year later, Qatari and Abu Dhabi Emiri Decrees formally recognized the DPSA and defined the role of the project. Following five years of construction, the first gas flowed from Qatar to the UAE in July 2007 and a year later we achieved full throughput of 2 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas per day (scf/day). In 2010, we completed the Taweelah-Fujairah Pipeline Project helping secure much needed volumes of natural gas to the east coast of the Emirates. The year after, in 2011, we reached the production milestone of 3 trillion scf and at the beginning of 2013 Dolphin Energy reached 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. These achievements could not have been possible without the support of the governments of Qatar and the UAE, the support and guidance of our shareholders and partners, or the commitment, hard work, and dedication of our employees.</p><h4>Dolphin Energy is a strategic venture between companies and governments. What does this venture signify for regional energy cooperation?</h4><p>The first thing it signifies is the way the governments, shareholders, and partners have worked together to bring a dream to reality. The project has helped enhance regional energy security and created a set of legal precedents that other nations can follow. It has also combined the strengths, expertise, and experience of our international and local shareholders to create a robust company that meets the needs of its customers.</p><div class="quote">“Natural gas is critical to the transition to a low-carbon economy and the preferred choice of fuel to minimize carbon emissions."</div><h4>What role can inter-GCC government and non-government organizations play in the development of gas and energy production?</h4><p>The project is a perfect illustration of what can be achieved in this regard—government and non-government institutions working in tandem to meet the needs and requirements for natural gas and working together to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and creating and driving the conditions that meet a new, emerging sustainability agenda that will be critical to the future direction and success of the region.</p><h4>How does Dolphin Energy work with local education institutions?</h4><p>We work with them in a number of ways—we offer internships to students studying in areas relevant to our business and sponsor programs with institutions like the UAE Higher Colleges of Technology. However, we also offer opportunities through our corporate connections. For example, we utilize our relationship with Total to offer MBA programs to national employees and are a supporter of the Absher Initiative, a program run by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs to train and develop Emiratis for positions in the private and public sectors over the next five years. Our involvement in this has seen us commit to employing 100 nationals up to 2017 and train a further 500 for opportunities in the private and public sectors. We have joined forces with Tanmia and the Etisalat Academy for the latter.</p><h4>What impact is US shale gas having on the sector?</h4><p>It is transforming the US energy landscape and estimates suggest that the country could be energy self sufficient by 2035. This presents a huge opportunity for the US to help meet an anticipated increase in the global demand for natural gas. In Europe, countries like France and Germany remain circumspect about shale development because of environmental concerns, and the renewable energy lobby is concerned that cheaper shale will shift focus from the development of more expensive renewable technologies. Closer to home, Saudi Arabia is fast tracking shale development, which would help address its domestic requirements. In time, the advent of shale gas and the ability of countries like the US to export volumes around the world could lead to a situation where countries in this region free up supply to help meet domestic demand.</p><h4>There have been talks of a new contract to supply more gas from Qatar to the UAE. What is generating demand for an increase in supply?</h4><p>While there is plenty of speculation about a new supply of gas to the UAE, in reality the position is still the same and we wait for a decision on the moratorium from the Qatar government. The demand for more gas is being driven by increased industrial development, diversification of the economy, and increases in population growth. In addition, natural gas is critical to the transition to a low-carbon economy and the preferred choice of fuel to minimize carbon emissions.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges and opportunities in catering to the UAE market?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is the availability of gas. Currently, there is a shortfall of around 1 billion scf/day of natural gas to meet demand, and that demand is increasing because of the increase in industrial development and the growth in population. However, where there are challenges there are always opportunities. I believe the chance exists to educate people about the need to conserve more electricity and consume less water. This will have a positive impact on the amount of gas required for power generation and water desalination. Second, by developing a robust renewable energy industry and a safe, reliable nuclear energy offering, the UAE's energy security will be enhanced to create a solid energy mix that will fuel future sustainable development.</p><h4>As part of Vision 2030 Abu Dhabi is diversifying its economy away from oil and gas. What trends are emerging as Abu Dhabi edges closer to green energy?</h4><p>We're seeing the growth of a renewable energy industry and a nuclear energy industry that will help boost energy security. Critically, we're seeing the development of a young, ambitious Emirati talent base that will take the UAE energy sector into the next stages of development. The opportunities open to them are phenomenal—this is a really exciting time to be involved in this sector. In this region, the UAE is really leading the way in renewable and nuclear energy development and the launch of the Shams 1 solar facility and the ongoing development of the country's first nuclear plant are testament to that. However, it is worth pointing out that natural gas will play a huge role in a future green energy mix. This is evidenced by projects like Al Hosn and the Bab Gas Field development and by estimates from Deloitte that more than $68 billion worth of contracts will be awarded over the next five years to raise gas production.</p><h4>With five years of gas production behind you, what will Dolphin Energy focus on as part its strategy over the next five years?</h4><p>The next five years will see, I hope, Dolphin Energy exporting increased volumes of natural gas under a new gas sales agreement so we utilize the capacity of our export pipeline. It can throughput 3.2 billion scf/day—we currently transport 2 billion scf/day. We are currently exploring opportunities to expand our distribution network in the UAE to help meet demand for more gas. It is too early to go into more details at this stage, but we're considering a number of options. Third, we will continue to focus on ensuring reliable, safe volumes of natural gas to meet the requirements of our customers and provide employment opportunities where people can train, develop, and build a long-term career with the company. Last, we will continue to support the sustainability agendas of the UAE and Qatar through our commitment to safeguarding the environment, supporting societal growth, and helping to drive economic prosperity.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our entrance to Ecuador was through purchasing a local company, and it took a transition period to implement the acquisition and bring Kimberly-Clark's international standards to the operating processes of the local company. Today, we are a leading company in the market with  our consumer brands known worldwide, such as HUGGIES®, KLEENEX®, SCOTT®, KOTEX®, POISE®, KIMBERLY-CLARK PROFESSIONAL®, FLOR®, JACKSON SAFETY®, KLEENGUARD®, and WYPALL®. For example, in Ecuador we own 71% of the market in the diapers segment, 49% in bathroom tissues, and 27% of the market in the sanitary products for women segment. We have very much improved our position in the last few years thanks to the acquisition of several brands in the sector. We also operate in other areas, such as security clothing for companies, wipers, soaps, and cleaning products, among others behind our institutional line, Kimberly-Clark Professional. Over the years, we have also invested large amounts of money in a production facility in Ecuador. At the moment, we produce mainline diapers (we only import premium products in this area) and some sanitary products. Quality standards are one of our main concerns and focuses, and we invest every year in making sure that we present products with the highest quality standards to our clients. Our mission is to lead the world in essentials for a better life.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in your business activity?</h4><p>We have innovation centers across the world, whose main work is to develop new products for our portfolio. They also carry out detailed market research in order to establish strategic lines when it comes to importing products from other markets and developing production facilities in operating countries. We apply innovation in our product portfolio, production lines, and commercial strategies. Kimberly-Clark Ecuador has been a pioneer in electronic billing for the wholesale segment, and we apply innovative strategies to the production chain to give our products added value and make them more competitive and attractive for consumers. These are just a few examples, for we always aim to offer better services and products to consumers. In the last few years, we have been very innovative in Ecuador in terms of the new products and lines launched into the market, as well as detailed market research in the country.</p><div class="quote">“We are in a very positive double-digit trend in terms of the growth of gross profit for the company in the last few years."</div><h4>What are the particularities of the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>According to our market research in the region, there are more similarities than differences between South American markets; however, it is very important for multinational companies to understand the commercial behavior of local markets in the region. In this context, Ecuador offers the perfect scenario to implement pilot projects for the region. In our particular case, Ecuador was the country where we implemented—for the first time in the Andean region—a very innovative planning strategy, and we have exported many business practices from this country to other regional markets. That is a great advantage for Ecuador, for in cases of a recognized multinational like ours, we can showcase those successful practices and strategies and export them.</p><h4>How have operating profits evolved in recent years?</h4><p>We are in a very positive double-digit trend in terms of the growth of gross profit for the company in the last few years. For example, in 2012 we grew around 10%, and this has been our average growth figure for the last five years. Regarding market share, we are constantly growing, and we have experienced a very positive recovery in portfolios of great value for consumers, which shows that they really value our products.</p><h4>What role does Ecuador play in Kimberly-Clark's regional operations?</h4><p>Ecuador is very important in the region; it is a mid-sized country with a huge potential for gradual and sustainable growth. For that reason, we have very ambitious plans in terms of asset investment and the expansion of product portfolios. Ecuador is extremely important for the company's global activity in terms of human capital. There are several key positions at the regional level that are held by Ecuadorean professionals.</p><h4>How relevant is social responsibility in your business model?</h4><p>Sustainability and social responsibility are two of the main pillars of the company's business model.  We take into consideration all the stakeholders of our value chain, supporting the communities where we operate while generating Kimberly-Clark's brand visibility. We dedicate many resources to environmentally friendly practices and production activities. Our innovation activity is also very much focused toward reducing the impact of our production activities on the environment. Furthermore, we are a company that prioritizes the human side of business rather than just the economic. This is one of our most precious competitive advantages, and we are among the top companies to work for in the entire Latin American region, if not the world. We have achieved such important milestones thanks to our continued efforts to provide career prospects to our staff. We create value-added in those items that already have value.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the further expansion of the company in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our main objective is to continue our sustainable growth experienced over the last few years, as well as to continue expanding our product portfolio in the best interest of consumers. That will allow us to grow our activities and market share in the country. This can only be achieved thanks to the contribution of every single individual involved in our activity in Ecuador from administrative staff to specialized workers and partners. Ecuador holds huge potential, and we can continue providing our company with more skilled and qualified Ecuadorean employees for relevant positions within the regional and international operations of Kimberly-Clark.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo AVE has a presence in 20 different countries. How has the company evolved over the years?<br></h4><p>In 1928, my father established a veterinarian and pharmaceutical laboratory, and thus I grew up in a unique environment. In 1978, I set up my first company with the concept of differentiating the services and products from the multinationals that were already operating in Colombia. At that time, it was very expensive and not profitable to produce injectable and maquila products in Colombia. The industry needed a reliable company to offer such services. At that point, and thanks to the support of a European company, I managed to provide packaging services to almost all of the 15 multinationals operating in the Colombian industry. This helped me to build up a reliable profile. After some years and a number of political events, investors saw great opportunities in Mexico thanks to its geographic position and the size of our domestic markets. Then, the Colombian pharmaceutical industry all but disappeared, and most foreign companies headed to Mexico. That represented a tough challenge for me; companies would offer to invest large amounts of money in production facilities only to later on decide that they would import everything from Mexico. At that point, I decided to shift the company's activity, and I began to register my own products and commercialize them for pharmaceutical companies in Colombia. I managed to get economic support from a multinational company in Colombia to push forward my plans. Although the beginning was difficult, after I set up Vitalis in 2000 I was able to register new products and sell them to multinationals within the pharmaceutical industry. I opted to start commercializing them in other countries, such as Ecuador and Peru, in order to avoid competing with companies in Colombia that were already my clients. That was the turning point in our history. Today, we are present in about 20 countries, with a special focus on markets such as Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile.</p><h4>What was your financial performance in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012, we sold products worth a consolidated $105 million, and although we are not a very large company, we export over 50% of what we produce. In fact, there are only around 25 companies in the country that export to five or more markets, and we are among them. Over the years, we have evolved to what we are today; a family-run company in which we all work together to bring stability to the development of the enterprise. Today, our enterprise has over 1,000 employees and partners, and seven companies comprise Grupo AVE.</p><h4>What are the future plans of the company?</h4><p>We will heavily invest to triple our activities in Mexico, in terms of both laboratories and packaging lines. In fact, we have developed a number of pioneering products and packaging designs, complete with higher levels of sterilization and hygiene. We also have to remember to set ourselves apart from our competitors in many countries, which is a reflection of our extensive experience in the sector and our perfect knowledge of both its players and market needs. Therefore, we will continue investing in R&amp;D for our laboratories, while at the same time purchasing new infrastructure in countries such as Argentina, where we are about to buy a $10 million laboratory to start exporting to new markets. We want to take advantage of the Argentinian pharmaceutical regulatory framework. In this regard, we will continue registering health registers, which now total over 1,000. The company's expansion in foreign markets is also very important for the future, as we aim at to establish 70 health registers per year and enter new markets in Asia and Europe. We are already active in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, where we believe we can set up a production plant in the near future. Finally, we are working to develop a biotechnological project, which is the most important future project for us.</p><div class="quote">“There are only around 25 companies in the country that export to five or more markets, and we are among them."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the evolution of the higher education system in Colombia?<br></h4><p>The tertiary education system in Colombia, like that of a number of other Latin American countries, places special emphasis on the social sciences. That means that the level of specialization in technical programs is slightly lower. In my opinion, the sector must shift its focus of attention toward the current needs of the country: applied sciences and the professions. Colombia lacks a strong and large road infrastructure network, and therefore we must strengthen engineering programs across the country in order to make Colombian companies more competitive. In addition, we should boost technological research.<br></p><h4>What are Universidad Nacional de Colombia's (UNAL's) curricular strengths?</h4><p>We are highly recognized for our medical studies, although we currently lack a university hospital where students can carry out research. Also, we have a very good reputation in terms of engineering programs, and we are one of the only higher education centers in the country that offers high-standard programs for basic sciences: mathematics, biology, and statistics, to name a few. Our alumni in these areas are well known throughout the country. Therefore, I believe that UNAL plays a more important role in the sciences field as compared to other higher education institutions in the country. Additionally, the university has high levels of penetration in bordering urban centers such as San Andrés, Tumaco, and Arauca. The university has a very strong presence outside of Bogotá, and that is a clear differentiating factor. However, I believe that the national government should boost the arrival of students from rural Colombia to the main cities through a more extensive scholarship program. Overall, our institution plays a key social role in bringing higher education closer to some strata of society. In this regard, our university currently has 40,000 undergraduate students. In fact, we have 8,000 students in our several post-graduate programs. In addition, our institution trains around 40% of the country's PhD candidates, and we have been a pioneer center in this field—we were the first university offering PhD programs back in 1986. We have also played a very important role in training professors for doctoral programs at the national level, and I would even say that we set many national standards in this field, becoming a clear vocational center.</p><h4>How much can students expect to pay in tuition fees?</h4><p>The cost of the tuition fees for undergraduate programs is linked to the family income of every particular student, and also their subject of study—whether it be engineering, social sciences, or humanities. Overall, costs can vary from Ps100,000 to Ps4 million per semester. In terms of post-graduate courses, tuition fees are the same.</p><h4>How significant are relations with companies from the private sector in offering training opportunities in the field?</h4><p>This is one of our weaknesses as compared to other universities. Over the years, we have introduced training opportunities for our students in terms of accepting work experience for thesis and final project purposes. However, it is not very common for our students to take up such opportunities. I believe that other institutions have a stronger focus on how to better position their students in the professional market, whereas our institution primarily focuses on their training and education process. That is something we aim to change in the near future.</p><h4>What role does research play in the university?</h4><p>We have a very strong focus on research. For example, research in the field receives the largest amount of funding from our budget. The budget is primarily focused on providing funding opportunities for our students. At the same time, we also develop co-research programs with other institutions such as Banco de la República and Colciencias. In addition, we facilitate professors' mobility through several initiatives in order to boost know-how transfer. Also, we sponsor many events at the national level in cultural, scientific, and educational fields.</p><h4>How many scholarships did UNAL grant its students in 2012?</h4><p>At the post-graduate level, we awarded 250 scholarships for MA and PhD students to support their studies. This line of scholarships can be renewed every year. In addition, we also have a scholarship program for assistant professors, as well as to cover studying material costs and fees.</p><h4>How many foreign students does UNAL currently have, and how are your exchange programs evolving?</h4><p>Over the last two years, Colombia in general, and our university in particular, has seen an increase in the number of international students. For example, we receive an average of 100 students from abroad each semester. They come from Mexico, Germany, Norway, Spain, Argentina, and France, among other countries. However, in the last few years, we have also seen a very important increase in the number of local students going abroad, and we are sending an average of 170 students to other countries each semester. These are figures from our undergraduate programs. In terms of post-graduate studies, we receive an average of 50 students per semester.</p><h4>How significant are international partnerships with other universities for UNAL?</h4><p>We have a very large network of agreements with other institutions at the international level from many countries. For example, we have very strong ties with Latin American institutions, because we believe that it is very important to boost know-how transfer through student- and professor-exchange programs. In this regard, we have agreements with important Latin American institutions such as USP from Brazil, UBA from Argentina, and UNAM from Mexico. At the same time, we have partnership agreements with many universities in Europe, such as Universidad de Valencia and Universidad Complutense de Madrid, as well as several polytechnic institutions in France and Italy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medellí­n was recently declared the most innovative city in the world. What does this award mean for the city?<br></h4><p>This award marks one step toward our goal of continuing to show the world a new image of the city while changing old stigmas and stereotypes. Although the past was painful, the present and the future are bright. In addition, the award strengthens the metamorphosis of Medellí­n and gives us extra positive energy for the challenges we face. We will continue strengthening our security levels and work to make Medellí­n a more equitable city. The city has experienced huge changes in the last decade. No one would have said 15 years ago that Medellí­n would be internationally awarded for its innovation and creativeness. I have been to many different European and non-European countries and felt that both media and investors have been surprised by our city's development and evolution over the last few years. In fact, there is a larger appetite for Medellí­n among foreign investors, especially in services, innovation, IT, and education. In this regard, we have become the Latin American hub for IT-related companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Kimberly-Clark, among others. In addition, Medellí­n is setting an example for many Latin American cities that send official delegations to our city to see what we do in terms of public services, industry, and business.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Medellí­n in terms of investment?</h4><p>The most relevant one is its human capital. We are creative, hardworking, innovative entrepreneurs, and, above all, very happy people. These features are common among people from the Antioquia department and are widely recognized by all Colombians. Also, we have the best national companies in terms of public services, utilities, and transportation. Our public transportation system deserves a special mention because there is no such integrated public transport anywhere else in the country. It is highly recognized for being environmentally friendly and award winning in the case of the metro. The integrated public transport in Medellí­n is the perfect example of the innovative and dynamic character of the city. In addition, Medellí­n represents a unique case nationwide, and I'd say even regionally, in which the public and private sector and the higher education system work jointly toward achieving the development of the city and share the same goals.</p><h4>What role does urban development play in changing Medellí­n's image?</h4><p>We expect that 2013 will be a key year to see urban developments in the city, such as the establishment of a new district that will play a vital role in the expansion of the health cluster in the city. Medellí­n's future urban development will have its neighboring hills as the epicenter, especially in areas that already provide public services. However, we have to keep in mind our 10- to 15-year plan, and we are currently drafting the next Land Management Plant (POT) to structure the urban development of the city for the next 12 years. In this context, there are two key projects for our administration. One is the Medellí­n River Park, which is a 23-kilometer-plan to recover the river and its importance for the city's life through public infrastructure that will make the river available again for our citizens. The budget for the Medellí­n River Road Park is about $1 billion, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be a vital element in its development. The other project is the Metropolitan Green Belt and the circumvent garden of Medellí­n, which focuses on the construction of many elements: housing, road infrastructure, and public services, located within the borders of the city. The initial budget for the first phase of this project is $500 million.</p><div class="quote">“There is a larger appetite for Medellí­n among foreign investors, especially in services, innovation, IT, and education."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of taxes do potential investors need to be aware of?<br></h4><p>The Equity Tax is a one time tax liquidated in 2011. It is paid over four years and eight installments, starting in 2011, 2012, 2013, and the final one in 2014. Colombia has the most competitive free trade zones (FTZs) in Latin America with a 15% income tax as well as the possibility to sell to local markets with no customs taxes—VAT or customs duties—on purchases. There is a VAT exemption for raw materials, inputs, and finished goods sold from the national customs territory to industrial FTZ users or Single Enterprise Free Trade Zone (SEFTZ). Investors can take advantage of the benefits provided by the FTZs even by locating outside of a permanent FTZ.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for foreign companies in Colombia?</h4><p>The economic challenges include fiscal and current account deficits, the poor state of infrastructure, and corruption. Colombia has a great need for infrastructure development. One of the most critical factors is the lack of adequate infrastructure to become a global market. In regards to the tax structure, investors looking to inject capital in the form of non-US dollar denominated currency face tax uncertainties, as the Colombian tax legislation refers only to the peso/US dollar exchange rate. Foreign mergers or spin-off companies holding Colombian interests are taxed in Colombia when through these mechanisms direct ownership of Colombian companies or assets is transferred, provided the value of the assets exceeds 20% of the total assets of the group to which the participating companies in the merger or spin off belong to. As of 2013, Colombia has active treaties to avoid double taxation with Spain, Switzerland, Chile, and Canada. As of that same date, Colombia has negotiated or signed treaties with South Korea, Mexico, Portugal, India, Belgium, Czech Republic, and France. Double taxation treaties are also being negotiated with the US, Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan. These treaties have been structured following mostly the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) model, and it is expected to encourage foreign investment, guarantee legal stability, reduce the overall tax burden, and avoid double taxation in both the country of the investor and the country where the investment is made. As of 2013, Colombia has five Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) in effect and ongoing negotiations or DTAs signed with 11 countries</p><h4>What sort of reforms to the legal framework would enhance the development of the national economy?</h4><p>During the last three presidential mandates, Colombia has improved the legal framework by providing advantages to investors in making investments, particularly by offering permanent FTZs. The legal framework developed from early 1991 opened the economy to private investments in all major sectors of the economy and promoted competition and fostered foreign investments in the country. The climate for foreign direct and portfolio investment is very open. If we see the Ernst &amp; Young Globalization Index, where Colombia is fourth place in Latin America and 40th in the world, it is necessary to stimulate the strengthening of the exchange of technology, ideas, cultural integration, and movement of capital and finance for continued growth and as a market that exploits the opportunities of economic news.</p><h4>What is the potential of Colombian companies for internationalization?</h4><p>The aspects that influence the decisions of the internationalization of Colombian companies are defensive behavior against competition investments, the risk reduction associated with a presence in one market, and after market research, while decisions on the selection of a foreign market are taken primarily based on the size of the market, the competitiveness of the target market, and tariff barriers. As for the obstacles perceived by local companies when entering foreign markets, the main ones are: political risk, certifications, taxes, and the availability of raw materials. Today, we see that growth needs are given by the necessity to address new markets, expand and diversify sources of income, venture into other businesses, or simply because there is not much room to grow in Colombia. Although Colombian companies are not among the largest in Latin America, they are slowly gaining ground through mergers or acquisitions and also belong to a variety of economic sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the development of the tourism industry in Colombia?<br></h4><p>In my opinion, Colombia is one of the best tourism destinations in the region; it has everything. Above all are its friendly people, who are always smiling and welcoming foreign guests. This makes a huge difference when comparing the country to other destinations. However, Colombia has suffered problems; it went from dealing with a lack of image in the industry to a very bad reputation in a short period of time. Only when Colombia developed the National Tourism Corporation did the country start experiencing tourism trends and emerge from anonymity. In this regard, we followed promotional trends, and today we have offices in neighboring countries as well as in the US and Europe. In 2011, some 1.7 million tourists visited Colombia, and that puts the country at the same level of visitors as in 1982. Nevertheless, we are optimistic and hopeful for the future, because there has been a very positive trend over the last few years. At the end of the 1990s, Colombia was receiving only 500,000 tourists a year. It is true that the tourism industry was booming in the 1980s, but several key events at the international and national level damaged the country's image worldwide and we are still in the recovery phase.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the tourism industry?</h4><p>Back in 1982, the main purpose of 85% of Colombia's visitors was to discover this beautiful country, whereas the remaining 15% were here on business. Curiously, these figures have reversed; now, about 85% of the visitors are business tourists, and the remaining 15% are here to discover Colombia. On top of that, tourists mainly come from South and Central America. Colombia boasts breath-taking landscapes, beautiful spots along the coastline, vistas in the wild interior, and amazing people, history, and culture.</p><h4>What are some of the main challenges the Colombian tourism industry must face to grow further?</h4><p>The main tourist destinations across the world have an element that characterizes them. For example, London has Big Ben, Paris the Eiffel Tower, and Brazil has Christ the Redeemer. Colombia does not have something like this, and therefore we lack a distinct image in the worldwide tourism industry. One of our main challenges is to build up a global image for Colombia and change the damaging stereotypes that come to people's minds when thinking of the county. Countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam faced similar challenges many years ago, and today they have emerged as top destinations in Southeast Asia. As soon as we can show people that security is not a matter to be concerned about, I am sure that the tourism sector will experience a massive boom. I am hopeful that we can make this happen within the next decade.</p><h4>What is Aviatur's growth strategy, and what parts of the business are performing best?</h4><p>In the past few years we spotted a very interesting niche market in Colombia that I believe will offer us the chance to further grow and diversify our portfolio. The idea is to manage other travel agencies or offer them a partnership with Aviatur's large network. As of today, travel assistance and Aviatur's services to third-party companies are some of the business elements that are performing better, and I think they will play an important role in our future strategy. In addition, MICE tourism has plenty of room for growth in Colombia, and we are already very active in this segment of the industry. Finally, I would like to add that there are many governments that externalize visa services, and that is a market niche where we are already operating, with countries such as Spain, Sweden, and India. We see the potential to further grow in this area.</p><h4>Which foreign markets is Aviatur Group active in?</h4><p>We have operations in almost every country in the region: Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and with AXA Assistance in Panama where we provide cruise services. We also have a cargo agency operation in Miami. Our network of correspondents enables Aviatur to operate in any country around the world, and that is something that makes us stand out in the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the relationship between The Petroleum Institution (PI) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC)?</h4><p>ADNOC is our main sponsor and PI was founded by an Emiri decree on December 30, 2000 under the direction of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Institute is governed and financed by a board, which consists of members from ADNOC and its international partners: British Petroleum, Shell, Total, and Japan Oil Development Company (JODCO). The purpose of founding PI as a university was to provide the UAE, its oil and gas sector, and the energy industry as a whole with engineers educated and trained to the highest standards. All students who attend PI have tuition, housing, books, and fees paid for by the ADNOC scholarship committee. The ADNOC scholarship program awards monthly stipends to full-time Emirati students who are registered for a minimum of 12 hours. The stipends are based on maintaining a good academic standing and a minimum semester GPA of 2.0. The amount is based on the student's academic level: freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior status. The ADNOC scholarship program also awards special rewards to Emirati students toward their academic excellence. These are awarded based on the semester GPA, with 3.0 being the minimum. Students are employed by ADNOC upon their graduation and, of course, some go on to graduate school, either locally or internationally.</p><h4>What are the challenges for PI when recruiting talented faculty?</h4><p>This is a big challenge because we are competing with the oil companies. Oil companies offer higher salaries and there is a great demand for oil and gas people. Faculty members sometimes prefer to work for these companies. This is one of the difficulties; to recruit high-caliber people in oil and gas who choose to be educators. It is a big challenge.</p><div class="quote">“The easy oil is gone now, so now comes the challenging part."</div><h4>How can PI work with both local and international institutions to facilitate faculty exchange?</h4><p>We have several partnerships with overseas universities, and also local universities. For our overseas universities, we have many partnerships with US, British, European, and Far East universities like the University of Tokyo. We have strong collaboration with these universities. We also have very good collaboration with the University of Petroleum in Beijing, China and with Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) in Malaysia. In the US, we have partnerships with the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Maryland, the University of Minnesota, Rice University, Stanford University, and others. Aside from faculty exchanges, these universities also offer student exchanges and joint research projects.</p><h4>How important is an institute such as PI in the UAE today compared to when it was first established?</h4><p>We started the institution to educate engineers to serve the oil and gas industry, but right now we are heavily involved in applied research that serves the needs of ADNOC as well as other operating companies. We are now shifting to emphasize research.</p><h4>How involved is PI in R&amp;D?</h4><p>PI is shifting its emphasis to applied research. That is exactly why we are establishing the Petroleum Institute Research Center (PIRC); to serve the needs of ADNOC in getting more oil out of the ground. The easy oil is gone now, so now comes the challenging part of extracting oil using enhanced oil recovery and improved oil recovery.</p><h4>Can you tell me about the PIRC?</h4><p>It is really going to be heavy in research, especially in enhanced oil recovery, geophysics, geophysical engineering, and unconventional methods. The challenges facing Abu Dhabi's oil fields maturing and becoming depleted, coupled with the goal of expanding production capacity, gives PI the opportunity to become a key player in R&amp;D in meeting the goal of increased production. The new PIRC is being constructed on PI's campus next to the TAKREER Refining and Petrochemical Research Center and in the vicinity of the Borouge Innovation Centre, located close to Glenelg School. High-quality R&amp;D projects will be conducted to provide efficient, environmentally acceptable, and cost-effective solutions for ADNOC and its group of companies upstream and downstream, Abu Dhabi's R&amp;D growth needs, and to develop a recognized and admired R&amp;D culture to attract and train top R&amp;D talent in the UAE and the region.</p><h4>How does PI contribute to Emiratization and the diversification of the economy?</h4><p>Education is never ending; people get Bachelor's degrees, and while employed have to come back for professional development courses, Master's degrees, and PhDs. The easy oil is gone, now it is a very high-tech industry so you need to train people beyond the Bachelor's degree level. This is a very advanced industry now. With the government wishing to see the creation of higher-value employment opportunities, especially for nationals, and the increased participation of women in the workforce, the PI plays a major role in the future development of the UAE. We have the highest number of national faculty members compared to other institutions in the UAE.</p><h4>What are your current student numbers?</h4><p>PI has over 1,300 students enrolled with 34% of these students being female. We are proud to have a 91% success rate for continuing students. We have graduated over 900 engineers to work at ADNOC and its operating companies. We expect many more in the 2013-2014 academic year because of the opening of the dormitories for female students, and we are already getting quite a few applications from the northern Emirates.</p><h4>Is there any potential for PI to work with the Masdar Institute?</h4><p>We do work with Masdar Institute by complementing each other's mission; Masdar focuses on renewables and sustainable energies, while we focus on traditional energy. There are many common interests between us. For example: the enhancement of oil recovery and the injection of CO2 in the ground; the sustainable part is Masdar's duty, and it is our part to enhance oil recovery. We work together, complementing each other on these issues.</p><h4>How will you target students to study here?</h4><p>We are a very specialized institution in engineering and applied science for the oil and gas industry, and this is the bread and butter of the country. Having female students is very important for the country because eventually those female students will propagate science and technology in society. The PI ensures that we provide a high-quality education service to UAE residents. We ensure that the young national population has the opportunity for attractive, high value-added employment opportunities. According to an announcement made in late 2010, ADNOC expects to add about 7,500 new jobs by 2015. This is in response to the projected energy demands, which are expected to double by the next decade and the goal of expanding production capacity to 3.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2018. This represents approximately a 30% increase in production and growth in the workforce in the next five years. We cannot do it overnight; it takes time. We have to be patient about it. We cannot really achieve 1,000 graduates overnight to meet the needs of ADNOC and other companies. Plus, just as in any industry or any business, you do not want all of your graduates to be from one place otherwise you lose diversification. If we thought we were going to be the only producer, there would be something lost in the diversification of the workforce. We are not trying to be a monopoly. The oil industry is not just engineers. The oil industry is a multidisciplinary field; we need economists, business people, and social scientists. Our focus at PI is engineers.</p><h4>Is the university market saturation hurting PI?</h4><p>Our focus is on oil and gas. Other institutions are not competing with us because we offer a package that really nobody else offers. We offer jobs from day one after graduation. We offer full scholarships and even pay monthly stipends. Where else would you get this? Nowhere!</p><h4>As Abu Dhabi moves forward in diversifying its economy, what will PI focus on over the next five years?</h4><p>We need to increase our number of graduates. This is our mission. The need for the oil companies is 1,000 engineers per year for the coming 20 years. We are not there yet; we have a long way to go.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has IDE contributed to the development of higher education in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>Our institution was established in 1993 and we started with high-profile business management course for CEOs, which attracted the leaders of the main companies in Ecuador. Over the years, we have specialized in training professionals and people, as our education offers values as well. Since 2006, we are among the top-20 Latin American business schools, and the top business school in Ecuador; we prepare the future business leaders of Ecuador and the entire region. We put huge emphasis on social responsibility, ethics, and making Ecuador and its leaders a more attractive investment destination for foreign investors. Over the years, we have expanded our course portfolio and extracurricular activities in order to broaden the scope of activity of the institution. Today, IDE Business School's brand and its academic staff are highly recognized in the entire region. Therefore, we have positively contributed to the development of Ecuador and its business sector for two decades now.</p><h4>How has IDE sought to build up its international profile over the past 20 years?</h4><p>We have an extensive network of international partnerships and agreements with schools in Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, Spain, and Brazil. These agreements enable us to boost student and professor exchange, and we always aim to strengthen our international profile to improve research activities, programs, and make our activity more global and recognized. Currently, we have agreements with 17 business schools from four different continents. We are also strategic partners for Harvard in Latin America for research projects. At the same time, these agreements contribute to build larger and more global network communities for businesspeople in the region.</p><div class="quote">“IDE seeks to consolidate its position as a social influence in Ecuadorean society."</div><h4>What other future projects is IDE currently working on?</h4><p>The most important project is the establishment of the Banana Research Center, which will be inaugurated in 2013. The objective of this center is to boost research in the banana industry and provide training opportunities for businessmen and women in the sector. In addition, we are developing several projects with the Ecuadorean agribusiness industry in order to help optimize resources and production, developing leadership and innovation. We are also in the first stages of the development of the Banking Innovation Center, which aims to provide tools for the further development of the banking sector. IDE also has a data center that provides macro and micro economic statistical information, and in 2013 we opened the Center for the Development of Women, which aims to research and boost female leadership in the business industry. We will also implement women-oriented business programs to this end.</p><h4>How do you see IDE evolving in the next few years?</h4><p>IDE seeks to consolidate its position as a social influence in Ecuadorean society, contributing to its development from many points of view: research, education, and values. In addition, we want to consolidate our position as a key player in the provision of leading businessmen and women for the country and its future development. We also want to transform the way Ecuadorean businesspeople interact, and ensure that social commitment and ethic values are pillar elements in that. Also, we must make of our research activity a leading source of data and information for the country and the region. I personally believe that we need to continue innovating and promoting the establishment of technical and specialized centers within Ecuador and make these centers global players through alliances and partnerships. Our staff body is composed of 80 people, counting our two campuses in Quito and Guayaquil.</p><h4>What are the most demanded courses?</h4><p>We have two types of programs: Bachelor's and Master's degrees. Regarding the former, our courses for business leaders (CEOs) and management members are both in high demand. Also, we have an SME-oriented course that is becoming more popular in recent years.</p><h4>What sectors do your students come from?</h4><p>Most of them come from the finance and banking sector, industry, communications, or law. Overall, the breakdown of our students shows that they come from many different backgrounds and sectors.</p><h4>In your opinion, what steps should be taken to further develop the higher education sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The country is undergoing key and much-needed reforms in the higher education sector, and I believe these are the right changes. We need to give the reforms time to generate results and benefit the economic and social development of Ecuador. We have achieved much, and I am sure that in the next few years we will achieve even better results. I would like to praise the government's decision to take determined decisions to improve the quality of the higher education sector. In my opinion, these reforms are in line with the Bologna process in Europe. I am very optimistic for the future development of the sector and the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Quito was named one of the top-20 destinations in 2013. How has the tourism industry evolved in the city?</h4><p>Overall, it has been a positive and successful evolution. Around 11 years ago, when the Metropolitan Corporation of Tourism was established, we saw a significant change in terms of promotion and priorities in the sector, for there was no such municipal/city organization before. This city institution gave a boost to both private and public engagement in terms of tourism, and today we have a public office in charge of promoting Quito as a tourism destination, coordinating everyone's efforts toward the same goal. In this context, the tourism sector was named back in 2011 as a strategic sector for the development of the city's economy; La Mariscal, La Floresta, and the city's historic center were labeled as key areas. Such a move is a clear sign of the evolution of the tourism industry in Quito, because it implies common efforts led by local authorities through public policies and city laws. In terms of numbers, in 2012 Quito received 570,000 visitors, which is the highest figure of the last decade and represented 7% growth as compared to 2011. Also, this figure puts Quito above average world growth in terms of tourism. In addition, internationally recognized media and publications such as National Geographic, Lonely Planet, and tripadvisor.com named Quito as one of the top tourism destinations both in 2012 and 2013. I would also like to mention that The New York Times included Quito in the list of the 1,000 places to see before dying. These recognitions emphasize the good work done by Quito's Municipality authorities and also the private sector to boost tourism in Ecuador's capital city, while making sure that visitors feel at home when visiting the city. We have strengthened security levels, and even police officers are part of providing visitors with the most comfortable experience when in Quito by guiding them and working as ambassadors for the city.</p><h4>What are the main strategic plans to continue promoting Quito as a tourism destination in 2013?</h4><p>Quito will be hosting the TravelMart Latin America in 2013. It is a very specialized event within the tourism industry where tour operators, countries, and other agents from the entire region gather together to share their experiences and offerings. TravelMart Latin America will be happening from September 18-20, 2013. Quito will also be hosting the 4th Iberoamerican Meeting of Digital Cities. These are just two of the main events to happen in Quito in 2013. Our main goal for the next few years is to consolidate Quito's position in the US market as an attractive tourism destination. Also, we will increase efforts toward promoting the city in South America, with special attention to Brazil and Argentina, as well as some European markets. Additionally, we are implementing a very ambitious strategy in terms of press and leisure trips. We invite specialized press from different countries to come to Quito and find out more about the city. In 2012, we organized 46 press and leisure trips with 150 journalists. The media value of what these professionals published after the visit was worth $6 million. Also, we will increase efforts toward MICE tourism; Quito's old airport will become a MICE center. I think Quito has a huge potential to become a regional hub, a door to South America, and also become a regional reference within the MICE industry. Finally, all the ongoing infrastructure projects such as the new airport and the future metro of Quito, among others, will be a major push for the development of the tourism industry in the city. We hope to close 2013 with a growth rate of around 5% to 7%, driven mostly by events like TravelMart Latin America 2013.</p><div class="quote">“The New York Times included Quito in the list of the 1,000 places to see before dying."</div><h4>Where are travelers coming from, and what is the average expenditure of travelers visiting Quito?</h4><p>According to our reports, we calculated around a $500 daily expenditure for an average stay of seven to eight days. In terms of country of origin, 27% of our visitors are from the US, followed by Colombia, 12%; Spain, 7% (mostly linked to returnees); Venezuela, 5%; and the rest is divided among many other countries. In this regard, Brazil and other countries from the Southern Cone are gaining relevance, and that is why we are increasingly focusing our promotion efforts toward these markets.</p><h4>What makes Quito such a unique tourism destination?</h4><p>Quito—a millenary city—has a unique mixture of historical and cultural roots that one can experience in the old town. In terms of nature, we have beautiful surroundings that visitors can easily access from the city center. Also, there are plans to boost traditional trade routes from Quito to the coast by restoring a railway connection. Additionally, Quito is surrounded by wonderful Andean and rural tradition, combined with legacy from the Hispanic period. All these offerings are topped off by delightful cuisine at very reasonable prices. Overall, Quito is unique thanks to its blend of history, culture, nature, and cuisine.</p><h4>What role can Ecuadoreans both at home and abroad play to increase the number of visitors to Quito?</h4><p>We have a very ambitious strategy to encourage Ecuadoreans living outside Quito, as well as people from Quito, to discover what the city has to offer in terms of adventure, events, and traditions, especially during public holidays. In this context, we have already implemented expeditions to other cities in the country to promote the city as a destination for Ecuadoreans during bank holidays and cultural celebrations.</p><h4>What advantages does Quito offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>Right now, we have the old airport, which will soon be transformed into a center for conventions, and that infrastructure is open to foreign investment. Also, there are parts of the old town that are looking for private partnerships and funds to boost activity and change their image. Quito is a very attractive destination for foreign investors; there are ongoing infrastructure and logistics projects and higher education initiatives that will boost the flow of university students.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatar Fuel Additives Company (QAFAC) and what have the major milestones been so far?</h4><p>QAFAC is a joint venture that was first established in 1991 by the Emir's decree, and operations began in 1999. QAFAC's shareholders include Industries Qatar (IQ), with 50%, OPIC Middle East Corporation (OMEC), with 20%, International Octane LLC (IOLLC), with 15%, and LCY Middle East Corp (LCYMEC), with 15%. The company started by producing methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in the petrochemicals and chemical business. This is part of Qatar's vision to diversify its resources and increase downstream productivity. In 2012, we had our best year ever in terms of financial results; our revenue was $928 million. As far as major milestones are concerned, in 2006 we initiated a revamp of our methanol plant. We started to receive CO2 from our neighbouring company, Qatar Fertilizer Company (QAFCO). This CO2 helped us to enhance our methanol production from 2,500 tons to 2,950 tons per day. We also have the largest natural gas steam reformer in the world, with 960 tubes in our methanol plant. We are now proceeding with the installation of a high-tech facility that will help in the CO2 capturing process. This project will not only increase our capacity but will help in creating a healthier environment.</p><h4>How is QAFAC aiming to cement Qatar's role as a leading exporter of petrochemicals?</h4><p>Qatar currently produces 9.5 million tons per year of petrochemicals. By 2020, Qatar aims to produce around 23 million tons of petrochemicals and other chemicals. This is a huge increase in just a few years. Qatar Petroleum (QP) already has a project with Shell for a major petrochemical complex, as well with Qatar Petrochemical Company (QAPCO). Without question, we want to be part of Qatar's vision in expanding the downstream petrochemical and chemical industries. We are exploring to see if there are any areas for expansion in methanol and MTBE, because there are new refineries being built and they will need MTBE. We really want to be a part of, and contribute to, the Qatar National Vision.</p><h4>What efforts does QAFAC make in regard to sustainability?</h4><p>This is very important for us, and we are establishing a strong foundation for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. We are aligning this with the National Vision for 2030 and the Qatar National Development Strategy 2011-2016. We have a continuous effort to optimize and utilize Qatar's vast hydrocarbon resources, as well as produce and export methanol and MTBE in a safe and environmentally friendly manner. Our ultimate aim is to contribute to the social and economic development of the State of Qatar. Our strategy is really based on four themes: operational excellence, growth, value to stakeholders and shareholders, and the team. We have the QAFAC Carbon Dioxide Recovery (CDR) project, which is a really innovative solution that will reduce QAFAC's total greenhouse emissions. Upon the completion of this project, the QAFAC CO2 recovery plant will become the first in the world to capture and utilize 500 tons of CO2 per day. We have no problem investing in projects to have a healthier environment. It is not only for us now, but also for the next generation in Qatar. We are introducing this project to the UN as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The State of Qatar could benefit from this through carbon credits. We also have flare management systems, as well as a leak detection and repair (LDR) program. We place a strong emphasis on social activities. QAFAC sponsors activities in schools and sports events. As we strongly promote sports, we have established a sports committee that runs various activities for the company and, with a great enthusiasm and passion for sports, we have established highly skilled cricket, volleyball, and basketball teams. As we have a rally car that uses 20% methanol, we have recently created our own rally team.</p><div class="quote">“By 2020, Qatar aims to produce around 23 million tons of petrochemicals and other chemicals."</div><h4>What is your outlook for the petrochemical industry in Qatar?</h4><p>The outlook is very bright. We are studying different scenarios, aiming to expand inside and outside Qatar. There are real opportunities for expansion outside and inside the country at the moment. Various industries in Qatar are exploring different opportunities to expand outside Qatar. We have the expertise in petrochemicals; we have the knowledge, skilled people, and the technology, so the opportunities are there.</p><h4>What is your vision and medium-term plan for QAFAC?</h4><p>Our vision is to be among the top-five producers of methanol, its derivatives, and butane derivatives by 2020. Being amongst the top five means we have to double our production or more. This is our long-term vision. For the short term, we have our CO2 project. This will increase our production to around 100,000 tons of methanol per year. We will begin production at this plant by the end of 2014. Also, there are new refineries coming and they will need MTBE. In conjunction with QP, we are looking into the possibility of expansion; however, this is only in the initial phases at the moment. Hopefully, we can go ahead and say that we need to expand in either 2013 or 2014. We have one plant right now, for methanol and MTBE, located at Umm Said, and we are also exploring possibilities with QP to expand in Ras Laffan Industrial City.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is moving forward in diversifying its economy away from oil and gas. What potential do you see in the sector and what trends are you seeing?</h4><p>There are two trends in this area that present TAQA with opportunities. On the one hand, Abu Dhabi is in the process of diversifying its economy, while on the other hand the whole world is wrestling with its fuel mix. It is part of Abu Dhabi's vision for 2030. Abu Dhabi recognizes that the age of fossil fuels will end, and it has to plan for that world. The process of moving the economy away from primary commodity exports at the same time as the world wrestles with its fuel mix brings a set of opportunities. We are in a unique position because not only do we have those scaled businesses in other markets, but we are present throughout the value chain. Part of our mission is that we are scale players in all our businesses in other markets, and we are owner-operators of these businesses; meaning we have large operating businesses in the rest of the world. We are the largest UAE investor in Ghana, Morocco, the Netherlands, the UK, and Canada. We have large businesses in the oil and gas and power sectors, where the license to operate is a very important element because these businesses are capital intensive, highly regulated, and of significant importance to the host government.</p><h4>How do your renewable projects tie into that vision?</h4><p>Renewables are clearly going to play a much more important part in the fuel mix. It is an opportunity because you don't have the same incumbency you would have in other energy markets, which tend to be dominated by the major players. We are keen to be in renewables, for both big and small reasons. First, because it is inescapably important to changing the fuel mix; second, because you can be distinctive by being a master of technology in a niche area. In this area, we have advantages because we understand how energy efficiency systems work together, which is applicable to fossil fuels and renewable energies. In Abu Dhabi, there is a big opportunity because this is a large enough market to be meaningful. It is a market in which we have an extremely high influence, meaning if we start a demand-side management program here in Abu Dhabi, a city of a million people that will reach 3 million in a decade, we have got a test market there of credible scale that we control.</p><div class="quote">“Renewables are clearly going to play a much more important part in the fuel mix."</div><h4>One of your high-profile acquisitions was made in the North Sea in 2008. What opportunities are you seeing five years on?</h4><p>The North Sea was a highly productive reserve beginning in the 1960s running all the way through. It has moved more into its later life and there won't be any more large discoveries. You aren't going to get 100,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to 300,000 bbl/d, but there is still a lot of oil and gas to be recovered. What that means is that the North Sea oil fields have steadily become less attractive to the major players. Our first stage of play in 2008 was acquiring Shell's and Exxon's assets in the Brent system. That is a massive production site. When we took them over they were doing 22,000 bbl/d. Now, those same assets are doing 50,000 bbl/d. We have proven that we can take late-life assets, stop the decline in production, and push it in the other direction. We have acquired a suite of assets from BP around the Harding Platform, which is in the central part, and this provides us with another hub. Everything in the northern area runs through the Brent System and that runs across Cormorant Alpha, meaning it is bottlenecked around the one platform. We are vulnerable there in that if something goes wrong, then we are shut in. We really wanted to find an asset in the North Sea that gave us another hub that was a first-generation asset, and gave us significant current production while bringing more gas into our portfolio. What we didn't want was our production plateau to go into decline before our development projects come on-stream. We looked hard for assets that fitted the bill, and the deal we did fit perfectly. It has essentially secured and stabilized the reserve life of our North Sea business for 10 years. It puts us in a position to be able to play the end game of the North Sea.</p><h4>What is the scale of development you are anticipating in the Cladhan oil field?</h4><p>We haven't got the full development plan sorted out yet. Ultimately, it depends on our understanding of the structure. With Cladhan and Darwin, if they are big enough, we are hoping to put in a new platform close to Cormorant Alpha, which would then enable us to develop those reserves over a new platform. This would allow us to steadily replace infrastructure on Cormorant Alpha. We'd put in a platform big enough to be able to support Cormorant Alpha as we decommission it. That is actually quite attractive to us as it is a way of managing two problems; while we decommission the old platform, we develop a new one, meaning we don't lose any production time.</p><h4>What role will TAQA play in the signing of a deal between the UAE and Turkish governments to develop energy plants and mines in Turkey?</h4><p>The inter-government agreement has been signed. Underneath that is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between TAQA and EÜAÅž, which is the government-owned Turkish energy generating company. Together, we will develop power plants in the Afşin-Elbistan basin in south-central Turkey, where there is a huge lignite deposit. It has probably got fuel to produce 7,000 MW-10,000 MW of power. We will start by buying an existing plant, the Afşin-Elbistan Plant B, which is a 1,440 MW lignite burner operating now. Over time, we will build a series of plants. There is a total potential in the region for 11,000 MW, but we are not committed to that. We are committed to buying the first plant and developing around it as is feasible; that is our role in Turkey. We have looked at Turkey for a long time, and we like the growth dynamics there.</p><h4>Which of TAQA's high-profile series of global acquisitions are most significant, and how would you evaluate their quality?</h4><p>Our recent acquisitions have been very measured. They haven't been opportunity led. In the early days of the company, we had IPO proceeds, a credit rating, and access to capital. We did deals where the discriminating factor was low-cost capital. Until we made the acquisition, we didn't have the expertise. As it happens, all of the acquired businesses have high going concern resilience, so we have the luxury of having time to reshape the portfolio. In the last three to four years, we have devoted ourselves to essentially disposing of what we foresee as non-performing assets and put that money into our other businesses. We have spent our time concentrating on our portfolio and then devoting our time developing organic projects. We are spending about $2 billion a year on capital expenditure (CAPEX) in projects within our existing businesses. Between 2010 and 2014, we will spend about $10 billion in total on developing projects inside our existing portfolio—drilling in western Canada, the UK's North Sea, the Bergermeer gas storage project in the Netherlands, the Jorf Lasfar power plant expansion project in Morocco, and our Takoradi expansion in Ghana. These are our five major spending programs. They are all developing value-accruing projects inside our existing footprint. The focus of the company changed when I took over, changing the strategy from growth by acquisition to stabilize the business and develop value opportunities. Now we are four years into that five-year program, and we are starting to see that spending turn into money. The free cash flow dynamic has started to change dramatically. We have focused more strategically on our country's entry into Turkey and Iraq, while stabilizing the North Sea business and generally trying to develop our future business opportunities around three factors. The first is what Abu Dhabi brings to this; for example, is there something in our ability to trade as a government-related entity of the Emirate? Second, do we have existing business synergies? And, third, do we have the resources? Where those three circles intersect will be the sweet spot on our strategy map.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What contributions has Sony made to Ecuador?</h4><p>At Sony we see ourselves as part of the social fabric of local society. We play an important role in giving back to society in various ways. We hire and train personnel to be productive members of this multinational corporation. We have many examples of members who were hired for an entry position as promoters, and today are key players at our HQ. We have key talents who have been given regional positions in marketing, promotion, and sales, and we currently have two local employees on foreign assignments as country managers. We provide constant training to our personnel to teach them new skills and improve on their current talents. We use our technical resources to grow tomorrow's technical companies. We have created an alliance with ESPOL, a local technical university in Guayaquil, to develop high-tech gaming software for the PlayStation 3. As part of this effort, ESPOL students are receiving guidance in developing and marketing tomorrow's software from our PlayStation Software Development headquarters in California. With the same ESPOL, we are also working together on creating widget applications to be used on smart televisions. In terms of local assembly, we started our local television assembly operations in Ecuador in 2013. This operation was developed with the support of all our technical groups around the world to develop a cutting-edge operation in line with the high-quality standards found in other Sony factories. In Latin America, Ecuador joined our other operations in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. We are always training and transferring knowledge to the local staff on issues such as assembly processes, quality control, technical record keeping, inventory management, and procurement. Our operation today has reached our expectations as a professional and accurate operation, for which Sony has always been known to have.</p><h4>What is the size of Sony's operation in Ecuador?</h4><p>In total, we have 168 members of the company. They are all Ecuadoreans, except for myself and two other members. We have two Sony Stores; one is in the Mall de Sol in Guayaquil and another in Quicentro Norte in Quito. These stores are our flagship stores and are managed by our own staff. All of our promoters and store staff members are 100% Sony employees and not third-party hires. This way we have full commitment from our staff and they receive all the benefits of belonging to the Sony family. Within the company we have many cases in which employees have worked their way up the ranks. Many have started off as promoters or store sales employees and now work for sales and marketing, so our employees are people who have grown up here.</p><div class="quote">“In 2012, we established local television assembly operations in Ecuador."</div><h4>What innovation have you brought to the sector?</h4><p>Sony has brought 4K technology for our Bravia televisions into the Ecuadorean market. This technology is the next generation of high definition, which has a 4x better resolution than previous versions. In addition, we have developed the latest improvements to the reproduction of real colors with our Triluminos technology, introducing, for the first time, real colors as never before seen on a television. Sony has also brought the latest NFC technology into the market this year, which allows our products, such as cell phones, radios, headphones, audio devices, and computers, to communicate among themselves without any complicated pairing process. This technology allows anyone to transfer data, music, photos, or movies with one touch. One of the best products to hit the market will be the Xperia Z mobile phone and tablet, which are both 100% water resistant. They can both withstand 30 minutes submerged. This is a dramatic breakthrough since it is very common to have your phone destroyed by water.</p><h4>What products are most in demand?</h4><p>We have seen continuous demand for televisions, computers, and tablets. Ecuadoreans are latecomers to the tablet market; the boom only occurred over the last year. Smartphones are big as well, and they're not just for the affluent consumer. This market is definitely a market in which consumers expect the latest in technology. It is an investment; the average person does not have a large disposable income, so they like financing when they purchase and thus they want a good product from a reliable brand since the purchase is a big investment for most. This is why Sony is growing very well in Ecuador; it is a brand that is trusted and always has the latest innovative technology.</p><h4>What is your expected financial performance for 2013?</h4><p>Over the last three years, Sony Ecuador has grown 85%. In 2013, we are expecting slow and steady growth due to issues related to consumer credit laws. Credit controls are an action the government is taking to manage the economy in order to avoid an explosion of credit, which will allow for a stable future.</p><h4>What does Sony Ecuador mean to the company's global operations?</h4><p>If we look at Sony worldwide, it is a huge conglomerate and one can understand that a market like Ecuador may be of small importance, but this is not the case. We are continuously receiving visitors from top management and engineers from HQ to see and understand the local market. We receive all the support a larger market may enjoy. In 2012, we established local television assembly operations in Ecuador. We joined a very small exclusive club of countries with this capability. In Latin America, we only have assembly operations in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and now Ecuador. Even though it is a small country, we have huge support. To open an operation is not so simple for a multinational since it requires all the necessary quality controls and procedures. We had a stream of engineers from Japan, the Green Management team from California, and the president from the headquarters all visit us. We also brought in an engineer from the Sony plant in Mexico as well. This is a small country, but we have high visibility. Why? Because we have strong growth, strong personnel, and we also have a very strong position in the market as a brand, and this gives people confidence in our operation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Ecuador's economy in the coming years?</h4><p>I think that 2013 is a year of stability, which is good. Issues are being addressed today in order to create stability tomorrow. The government is working in certain directions to allow growth to continue for the coming years. In Ecuador, petroleum is obviously a key resource, but like all resources, it does not go on forever. Of course, the government is using renewable resources, such as hydro-plants, to export electricity to neighboring countries. The government is serious about expanding industrial mining operations and diversifying the production scheme of the country. We see a bright future for Ecuador and that is why Sony is investing in its future as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Yıldırım Group of Companies choose Colombia as its first step into Latin America?<br></h4><p>BRIC is an acronym invented for the dynamic emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which epitomize economic growth moving from developed to developing countries. However, that was some 10 years ago. The new term being used now is CIVETS, which stands for Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa. For years, Colombia had been closed to investors, not only because of its heavily regulated economy, but also due to economic instability and an unstable internal security environment. It has now become the world's fourth biggest exporter of coal, and the country is keen to exploit its mineral resources by giving mining concessions and regulating the industry. Yıldırım Group of Companies made its mark initially in the coal trading business, and we are also very active in coke production in that country. Therefore, it is natural for us to direct our attention to Colombia because of its desire to do business with foreign companies, and we feel that we can bring synergistic capabilities that combine mining, coal trading, coal production, port construction, operation, and erecting energy power plants using coal.</p><h4>What are Colombia's strengths and challenges as a place to invest and do business?</h4><p>Some people say that Colombia is the next Brazil, and from the performance over the last few years we can see that the country is growing at a fast pace. It is the hidden investment gem in South America, opening up to foreign investments and increasing tourism. Much of the growth in the Colombian economy can be attributed to the government focusing on creating a favorable business climate. For example, the ease of doing business index in Colombia is higher than in Brazil. Also, its geographic location on the north-west tip of South America, with ports on both the Caribbean and in the Pacific Ocean, is a major advantage as it provides easy access for imports and exports. To a large extent, the Colombian economy's growth and development has been powered by infrastructure investment. This is welcome news to investors such as Yıldırım Group of Companies because you need roads to haul the minerals or coal and bring them down to the ports for export. One other very valuable feature of Colombia is that it has one of the most qualified workforces in Latin America, with an adult literacy rate of 93%. The labor force is both highly qualified and competitive. However, the labor market suffers from a rigid employment infrastructure.</p><h4>Colombia has recently displaced Russia as the largest supplier of thermal coal for power generation. What potential does this imply for Yıldırım's import/export activities?</h4><p>Colombia now ranks as one of the top coal producing countries in the world. We opened our Colombian office back in 2011, and we have been very active in searching for favorable deals with local Colombian coal companies. Our activity will continue unabated regardless of what happens in Russia or in China. Our first energy investment will be the 200 MW coal-fired power plant to be erected next to our Eti Krom ferrochrome production facility in Turkey, and it is most likely that this plant will be using imported coal from Colombia. We have also been very active in 2012 with coal trading and coke in Colombia, and have bid for some major coal and coke contracts in Turkey. We will continue to build on this activity and seek mutually beneficial opportunities with Colombian producers in the years to come.</p><h4>In 2010, Colombia received upward of $3.24 billion in mining investment. What makes Colombia a favorable destination for exploration?</h4><p>About a decade ago, Colombia was not known as a mining destination. However, now it is crowded with giant mining and exploration companies as well as the smaller junior players, putting the country on track to become an international mining powerhouse. Certainly, the perception that the countryside may not be safe for mining is now changing because Colombia is safe and politically stable. Of course, at the top of the list is coal mining primarily for export purposes, which are operated by hundreds of small coal operators. Aside from coal, Colombia has gold and nickel deposits, and the largest nickel mine in Latin America. The glitter of gold has attracted more of the junior miners. The Colombian government is also encouraging and giving priority for the exploration of phosphates, potassium and magnesium ores, uranium, and iron. The government is encouraging foreign investors to come to Colombia, and the government has set aside close to 3 million hectares of land for exploration. This is welcome news for mining companies such as Yıldırım Group of Companies because we have one of the most established mining records in the world, and we would like to create joint ventures and partnerships with local Colombian partners to do exploration and mining.</p><h4>How are Colombia's new public-private partnership (PPP) laws and increased infrastructure spending shaping potential for port investment and development in the country?</h4><p>In order to become the fourth largest coal exporter in the world, Colombia had to figure out a way to improve its ports and the country's overall infrastructure. To a large extent the growth and development of the country in recent years has been primarily powered by investments made in the infrastructure segment, and the funds for these projects have been raised by PPPs. When it comes to the ports, Cartagena and Buenaventura are the most competitive ports for coking coal. On the other hand, Barranquilla handles more metallurgical coke. There are a few other ports such as Bahí­a Cupica, Bahí­a Solano, Golfo de Tribugá, and Bahí­a Málaga on the Pacific Coast, which will require further port developments. With the recent acquisitions of the Port of Gemlik (Gemport) and the Port of Rota (Rotaport) on the Sea of Marmara in Turkey in 2012, Yıldırım Group of Companies and its subsidiary, Yılport, are now becoming substantial port operators not only locally in Turkey but also globally. It is our intention to explore port construction, development, and operational opportunities in Colombia because we can bring valuable insight and operational expertise as a major up-and-coming global port operator.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Colombian economy, and what does this signal for Yıldırım's activities in the country?</h4><p>What the Colombian government has been able to achieve in recent times has certainly been remarkable. A large share of the total investments in the country has been allocated to the oil and mining sectors, and in the improvement of the country's infrastructure, such as highways and ports. Advances in terms of business attractiveness have also been supported by a massive improvement in the security situation, increased financial market stability, and tax incentives. All these factors make us very optimistic regarding the growth prospects of Colombia in the medium term. In 2013 and beyond, we feel Colombia will be able to grow at a healthy pace of 4% to 5% per year, and there will be many opportunities for our company to enlarge our business in Colombia and extend beyond coal trading and coke production. Our synergistic capabilities, having been operating in 10 different sectors in Turkey and elsewhere in the world, furnish us with a unique proposition to bring to Colombia, and that is to provide a “one-stop shop" from mining to logistics, port construction to operations, and coal and coke production to erecting power plants.</p><h4>What is your vision for Yıldırım Group of Companies' global expansion?</h4><p>If one reviews the most successful international companies, one can identify five features which also apply to Yıldırım Group of Companies, and therein lies its vision for global expansion. First, Yıldırım Group of Companies envisioned itself as a global concern from the very beginning as it grew in the 1990s first by trading coal with Russia, and then with China and later with South Africa, and now Colombia. So, in our global vision, there is a commitment to do business globally and utilize global sourcing with active market participation by leveraging our global expertise and partnerships to gain a competitive edge and improve our value-adding market share. Second, is the ability to choose the proper market entry so that you can be profitable and viable very soon. We at Yıldırım Group of Companies firmly believe that our technical, legal, tax, and financial due diligence process has worked well for choosing the right partner, the right project, and the right entry beachhead. Third, the shining international companies are likely to become engaged in joint ventures, acquisitions, manufacturing, and operations overseas closer to their markets. Yıldırım Group of Companies' acquisition of Vargön Alloys, a Swedish ferrochrome manufacturer, in 2008 had this primary objective of producing ferrochrome closer to the European and American stainless steel markets. Fourth, Yıldırım Group of Companies' vision is the commitment to be respectful of local culture and to employ foreign nationals, encouraging multi-country careers and leadership development. The fifth point is to be able to find a happy balance between global and local organizational structure, promote cross fertilization between the center and the commercial units, encourage interconnectedness, bring in the expertise gained from overseas to further enhance the business practices at home, and lead centers of excellence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Cerrejón's short-term investment plans?<br></h4><p>We are currently investing $1.3 billion in growing our infrastructure. Most of that investment is in doubling the size of the port, which is the most important maritime facility in Latin America in terms of coal exports. We are generating 5,000 jobs throughout the cycle of the project, which is a very important project for the region that we operate in. We are in the middle of the project.</p><h4>How would you characterize the demand for coal, and how do you see it evolving in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Coal continues to be an important element for electricity generation worldwide; 40% of electricity comes from thermal coal. All of the experts say that the coal requirements will continue to grow, however the mix is going to be reduced from 40% because renewables are growing faster. It is still a promising market because it continues to grow. However, the share of the market might decrease in terms of overall energy demand. We are very well positioned in Colombia because of the resources that we have and our proximity to the sea, with our train and our port. That's why we are investing. Our shareholders are three of the largest mines worldwide: BHP Billiton, Xstrata, and Anglo American. They feel that Colombia has great future prospects.</p><h4>What main challenges is the sector facing?</h4><p>We have many different challenges in this industry. Thinking about the market, I would first mention that our marketing situation is currently difficult. The US used to be our customer, but it has now become a coal exporter. It has become our competitor. Another challenge are international environmental regulations. These have led to very limited growth in new power plants fueled by coal. That's another challenge. From a local level, and it is happening in other places as well, we have regulatory challenges in the form of initiatives for increased royalties and taxes. There are social demands. Cerrejón has always been a good neighbor. It has always invested a considerable amount of money into nearby communities, but NGO activism has increased. There are more and more social demands on our production processes. We have recognized them and we have four different foundations.</p><div class="quote">“Coal continues to be an important element for electricity generation worldwide."</div><h4>Which are your most successful development programs for communities?</h4><p>We work with indigenous communities with water, institutional strengthening, and with alternatives to generate income, such as hotels, which is part of the work we are doing with the progress foundation. With these foundations we have one of the most comprehensive social programs worldwide for a mining operation. We are working to become the partner of the state we work in, La Guajira, to make sure that we continue to drive economic development in a sustainable fashion. We believe that tourism is one of the potential industries. We are working hard to establish a museum with the hotel. It will be the first four-star hotel in La Guajira, and will meet environmental standards. We are working very closely with the indigenous community to mix ancestral knowledge about how to develop agriculture in a desert area with technology from Israel, where they have converted the desert into a productive area. We have run very interesting pilot tests to make sure that we provide water security. With water security we provide food security, and with food security we can provide health and education for the people. Then we work on what the people do after they graduate, and that involves employment in different industries. More than 30% to 40% of my time has to do with social work, because if the community is doing well we have the opportunity to grow our mining operation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the mining sector in Colombia?<br></h4><p>Mining offers wonderful opportunities because it has been underdeveloped for the last 20 years as a result of security issues. In terms of mining, the country is like Peru 20 years ago, or Chile 30 or 40 years ago. We have much higher prices in certain commodities, and the technologies and techniques we use are designed with the environment in mind. The deposits that we have in Colombia include nickel, copper, gold, and diamonds. The potential is there. We have the entrepreneurship and the management skills to succeed in the sector. The Colombian workforce is very fast at training people, and Colombians are very hard workers, so we have what we need here. The big challenges are the government and its institutions. The National Mining Agency (ANM) and the Environmental Ministry understand that you need very clean processes. For us, that means we need to know the requirements at every stage of the process. I'm referring here to exploration, construction, and production. But we are probably eating the pie before we cook it, and we need to be more careful about that. We need to generate the right signals in order to develop projects that can generate both royalties and high employment rates for the country and consolidate the “new Colombia." It is important to generate employment and possibilities outside of urban areas, and the best way to promote that is with mining. This is because mining is a sector that generates infrastructure, is highly intensive in developing suppliers, and pays higher wages than other sectors. All of that can only happen if we understand that Colombia needs to develop mines, so we need to explore and we need to be able to construct mines to the highest specifications in the world.</p><h4>Ashmont Resources recently expressed interest in acquiring American Gold Mines. What is the strategy behind this decision?</h4><p>The deal has not been finalized yet; we are in the process of due diligence. What I can tell you is that in Colombia there are a lot of artisanal workers, and there are a lot of products that have been underdeveloped because of idiosyncrasies in production—people have the wrong ideas about production, engineering, and design. If you go into those areas with fresh eyes, you're adding more knowledge. At Ashmont Exploration we are mainly focused on geology as well as social and environmental challenges. As a private company we can move very quickly, and I think that is our big advantage—we see opportunities and we go for them.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the El Alacran and Santa Cruz projects?</h4><p>El Alacran is a copper-gold deposit, and it is a project that is moving forward very fast. We are in the second phase of the drilling campaign right now, and we expect to move to pre-feasability in 2013 and then to feasibility by the end of the year. It is a fantastic deposit in terms of the geology and geometry of the body. In terms of infrastructure, because it has been developed by Cerro Matoso, it is in a mining district, so it is among pro-mining communities. My personal challenge is that El Alacran is one of the first of a new generation of professional mines in Colombia. Although it is not a huge mine, more second tier, it has access to infrastructure, which is not very common in the Colombian mining sector. Overall, we are very happy about the results we have obtained so far. We feel comfortable moving forward, and I think we are addressing the major issues.</p><div class="quote">“El Alacran is a copper-gold deposit, and it is a project that is moving forward very fast."</div><h4>How important are your relations with the community?</h4><p>I think that, as in any country, you need to maintain good relations not only with the ministry, but also with the community. We have successfully built that, and for us it is very important, not only because the mining code is being written right now, but also because it is important for us as Colombians to share experiences and give advice on what communities can do better, and what they should not be doing. I am very active in participating in the Mining Chamber to share my point of view on the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove the 9.5% growth in the ICT sector last year?</h4><p>We experienced remarkable growth in the ICT sector in 2011. The objective of President Santos in ICT is simple: to use the internet to reduce poverty and create jobs. That's the focus. We want to expand internet penetration at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid. We are installing internet access in a large number of schools. We are also focusing on increasing technological awareness and teaching IT skills to teachers, students, and citizens. Thanks to our policies, Colombia is the fastest growing market in terms of internet penetration and computer sales in Latin America. The government's aim is to increase internet connectivity four fold by 2014. In the first two years of this administration, internet use increased from 2.2 million to 5.5 million connections. If we continue at this pace, we will achieve our goal.</p><h4>How is the Ministry planning its ambitious connectivity targets?</h4><p>We see the industry as an ecosystem with several elements. Our aim is to make that ecosystem grow. The first element of the ecosystem is infrastructure. Every country needs permanent investment in ICT infrastructure. At the beginning of this administration, only 200 towns  and less than 20% of the municipalities were connected to the fiber-optic network. Fiber-optic technology is what we need to transmit the media we use today for videos, images, and teleconferencing. For us, the key was to expand the network. Now, we have the network connected to 100% of all municipalities. Building a fiber-optic network depends on economic feasibility as well, and sometimes the government has to subsidize the network, which is what we do here.</p><h4>What role do public-private partnerships (PPP) play in developing this infrastructure?</h4><p>Initially, it was not a very profitable business, and so the best way to go about it was through PPPs. We put $230 million on the table, and we auctioned the money to the private company that offered the highest number of municipalities that would be connected to that network. Several international companies participated, and a Mexican company got the job. For every peso we put into this program, the private sector puts in four pesos. The PPP model is very important for the success of our efforts.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is the fastest growing market in terms of internet penetration and computer sales in Latin America."</div><h4>How is the government pushing to develop the ICT sector further?</h4><p>The government is helping the industry grow through subsidies. Our first goal was to have the cheapest computers in Latin America so that more households have computer access. Now, Colombia has much cheaper computers than the US, and we accomplished this by eliminating taxes on computers. There are no duties or VAT, and anyone can sell computers in Colombia; it's a very open market. Colombia now has the fastest growing market for computers in Latin America. Fiscally speaking, reducing taxes for technological development increases revenues in the long run. If technology is cheaper, the economy moves faster and produces more revenue. This is why we eliminated VAT for computers at the base of the pyramid. We know that making the internet cheaper has both economic and social benefits.</p><h4>The Ministry is focusing on increasing internet usage in schools. How are you going to achieve this?</h4><p>We've attached great importance to spreading internet and computer penetration in schools. Our “Computadoras Para Educar" program won a prize for being one of the most innovative programs in the world in 2012. What we do is buy a lot of computers at an auction and get the best prices. We aim for the most efficient procurement process possible, and we get those computers at half the market price. The Ministry also offers teacher-training programs, and a certification program called the Digital Citizen, which teachers receive upon passing a test. By 1Q2014, 1 million children will have tablets provided by those operators, which is one of the conditions of these license auctions.</p><h4>What other initiatives is the Ministry involved in?</h4><p>The role of the government is to generate demand. We have a very comprehensive e-government plan for Colombia. We will have e-defense, e-justice, and other e-portals for government ministries. All ministries will be accessible by the internet for citizens. Other projects we are focusing on are mobile coverage and social penetration in the mobile phone industry, as well as increasing internet use for the mobile segment. We are replicating the telephony model for the internet. The way to increase internet use further will be through wireless. In 2012, 70% of rural communities were connected to the internet, and in 2013 it will be 100%. At the same time we are also supporting the development and use of applications for teachers, homemakers, public servants, and others.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's ICT sector in the medium term?</h4><p>In five years, I see Colombia as a leader in the region in terms of application development. We have the people, the talent, the demographics, and we are strengthening that through our training programs. The government is also currently auctioning five licenses for 4G bandwidth. Colombia is growing in terms of data centers—the country is increasingly well connected. We have five sub-marine cables connecting Colombia to the world, and two new ones under construction, meaning we have excellent international connectivity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (ANH) evolved since it was established in 2003, and how has it made an impact on the oil and gas sector in Colombia?<br></h4><p>Before 2003, Ecopetrol was the state oil company and the upstream regulator. Since the creation of ANH as the regulator in 2003, Colombia has been able to incorporate more than 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. ANH has, through aggressive promotional campaigns, attracted high levels of investment in the oil and gas sector. That is a good indicator of the amount of research we have incorporated over the last eight years. In addition to that, Colombia has almost doubled its production levels in the last seven years. In 2005, Colombia produced around 500,000 barrels of oil per day (bbl/d). Today, we are producing 940,000 bbl/d, which is a very significant increase over the last seven years. Only a few countries in the world can tell the same story.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>FDI in the oil and gas sector in 2012 totaled $5 billion. The investment climate in the country is very strong. We believe that foreign business is not just a matter of capital flows from one country into Colombia, but that it is a way to gain know-how and new ideas and technology. That is the value of foreign businesses for us. Colombia provides very clear rules for foreign investment. It is a country with a long tradition of legal stability that respects the sanctity of contracts. Colombia has never intervened in an oil and gas contract, and that gives a lot of comfort to companies investing here. In addition, we provide attractive fiscal and contractual terms.</p><h4>What is ANH doing to further develop the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>The bidding rounds that we are implementing over 2012 are a very aggressive promotion. That is something that we believe in. We are now going to continue on this path, as that is the way to attract foreign investment. In 2012, we reached $5 billion in FDI for the oil and gas sector, and $13 billion for the whole economy. According to estimates we have for 2012, foreign investment for the whole country is going to amount to $17 billion, so you can expect that the oil and gas sector will provide a very significant part of that increase.</p><h4>As the fourth largest oil producer in Latin America, what is your outlook for Colombia's oil and gas sector in the medium to long term?</h4><p>We believe that Colombia will achieve production levels above 1 million bbl/d. We are confident that we can be above that number. I think we can continue growing that production up to 1.15 million barrels per day (bbl/d), which is the goal that we have in this government for 2014. We are going to continue increasing the reserves of the country, which are not huge compared with Venezuela or Mexico. The forecast that we have for the next 20 years is that we can incorporate 9 billion additional barrels of oil.</p><h4>What role is technology playing in this increase in output?</h4><p>Technology definitely plays an important role. The recovery factor in the fields is still averaging 16%-17%, and so the incorporation of the reserves is coming mainly from the ability of the companies to increase that recovery factor in the existing fields. We still have a lot of things to do going forward. We need more discoveries in new fields, and we have to develop the unconventional sector, both of which depend on technology. The development of unconventional oil here will require a lot of participation from service companies, which provide some of the technology that the sector needs to develop these resources. Offshore technology plays a very important role. This is an industry where everything is dependent on technology.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the new contract policy you implemented in May 2012?</h4><p>The new policy we implemented is that the general rule for granting contracts to companies will be through competitive bid rounds. However, we have incorporated an exception to that rule. In some cases, we will allow direct negotiations with companies in particular areas. We apply it when the area requires a very significant exploration program, or when we believe that the offer that the companies make is greater for ANH than what we obtained in the last two years through competitive procedures. Knowing that only a certain type of company can develop activities in certain areas, we do leave some exceptions to the rule.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[challenge-at-the-wheel]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the prospects for the $200 million investment in the industrial conversion of your plant in Bogotá?<br></h4><p>The idea came as a desire to reinvent the production model. We felt the need to do so because the country's economic model is changing. We used to have a model in which everything had to be produced in the country so it can be sold. That began 56 years ago. In 1990, the president at the time opened up the economy and producers were then able to import goods to sell in Colombia. However, that was with a duty tax of, in our case, 35%. As a result, we changed some things around and began importing. We import 40% of the cars we sell and produce around 60%. Juan Manuel Santos, when he was the Minister of Economy 10 years ago, signed an agreement to completely open up the economy with 0% duty on goods from Mexico. This had been preceded by the creation of the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), which created a common market like the EU. Colombia also signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, and potential negotiations with South Korea have been discussed in congress. An FTA with the EU has already passed through the European Parliament and it will pass here soon. When the model changes, we need to as well. We assemble five platforms of cars and we also assemble trucks. We have to create a model that is not only efficient, but can produce various products. It is a bit more costly than having one line producing one car. When you have to compete with the entire world, then you have to be more efficient. As a result, the model has to change.</p><h4>What is your current focus in terms of models?</h4><p>At the moment, we are focusing on the Chevrolet Sail and the Cobalt in Colombia. The $200 million investment is destined to improve the factory and develop new areas of opportunity while reducing costs and boosting efficiency. Part of the investment will be in the stamping plant. Stamping is important because it is one aspect of production that is impacted by logistics. When you import body parts they must not be scratched or damaged. They are, therefore, very expensive to transport. We need to develop volume. You cannot change the molds every hour to begin stamping a new part, and must be able to produce at higher volumes in order to reduce costs and boost competitiveness. Investment will be targeted at installing robots in certain areas that will boost efficiency and ergonomics at the plant.</p><h4>In which segments is GM strongest?</h4><p>We try to produce cars in the biggest segments. The largest segment in the country is the mini-car segment. Looking at that area, we have a 55% market share with the Spark and the Spark GT. They are both produced here. In the small car segment, we have gained a 40% market share through the Sail and Sonic models. We import the Sonic from Mexico. We believe that we can reach a 50% market share. However, the Sail is bigger in its segment with a nearly 30% share. That will not change much. If we become more competitive on the manufacturing side that does not mean that we will jump from 30% to 70%. We currently produce 60,000 cars. We would like to boost this to 100,000. Without other models, sales will not increase, but excess production can be exported. That is the key challenge.</p><div class="quote">“We import 40% of the cars we sell and produce around 60%."</div><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become an export hub in the region?</h4><p>Everything is in place for that to be a reality. We have to push hard for it, but it will happen. Colombia is in a special location. It has two oceans, and that gives businesses access to both the Pacific and Atlantic. It is also located on the equator and that means we're close to the US, Mexico, and Central America. We can also head south to Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. Human talent here is excellent—Colombians are hard working and well organized. The economy and the country's politics have been stable for almost a century, and the level of security is up there with the highest in the region. Based on the democratic security of the President, we are finally in a position to put an end to violence. The world is finally seeing the real Colombia. It is seeing the opportunities that it has on offer as the second highest populated country in South America.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Colombian demand for automobiles?</h4><p>Around 300,000 units are sold every year. This equates to around seven cars for every 1,000 people, and puts us only slightly ahead of Bolivia and Paraguay. Brazil, Argentina, and Chile sell around 22 cars per 1,000 people, which is three times what we sell in terms of population. Ecuador sells 10 per 1,000 people, higher than what we do. That is why there is huge potential in this market, and we are beginning to see it bear fruit.</p><h4>What factors are contributing to the increasing demand for automobiles?</h4><p>Statistics show that the middle class is growing quickly. A growing middle class means more money and more wealth. This creates a huge potential to sell cars. Everybody wants to have a car. The car today is like the TV was 30 years ago. Everybody wanted to have a TV. Now, everybody has a TV and a cell phone. The car is synonymous with wealth and gives you the ability to go anywhere you want. That is very important for people. The government's focus on investing in infrastructure will also impact the industry in that respect. For example, the completion of the La Lí­nea highway tunnel will reduce travel times on one of Colombia's main east-west road connections by up to 30%. In terms of the location of our new plant, it has to be close to a major population center, and we chose Bogotá. As Bogotá is in the middle of the country, you have to pass through three mountain chains to efficiently export. The parts are imported, built, and the car is then sent back along the same route. This costs a lot and, as a result, developing infrastructure is not only important for the people, but also for the efficient production of cars.</p><h4>What role are small cities playing in your overall strategy?</h4><p>The changes that we're seeing in the middle class are also being reflected in small cities. Bogotá is Bogotá, and it has its own challenges. The medium-sized cities in Colombia are well developed and, as a result, I do not expect to see a lot of growth in those areas. Places such as Cartagena and Barraquilla will benefit hugely from the FTAs. Smaller cities like Armenia, Popayán, Yopal, and Barrancabermeja are also growing a lot. Five years ago, nobody had a dealership in those cities. Today, we have complete dealers, not just promotion points. People are buying more cars as they have extra disposable income. Automobiles are tools that will develop the economy, especially trucks and pickups. This is an area the country is growing well in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bracing-for-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the future goals of Agencia Nacional Infraestructure (ANI's) future goals, and what strategies are you implementing to achieve them?<br></h4><p>Essentially, our main objective is to increase the investment level per year from about $1.5 billion to $6 billion through programs that will improve roads, railways, ports, and airports. In the past, the average investment in transportation infrastructure had been around 1% of GDP, 50% of which was through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The current government aims to increase the rate of investment in transportation infrastructure to 3% of GDP, of which 2% would be through PPPs. We expect that by the end of the current government's term, we will have twice as many kilometers of dual-lane highways as we had at the beginning of this government. In other words, we will go from 800 kilometers of highways to 1,700 kilometers by 2014. In fact, by the end of the road program, we expect to have 3,400 kilometers of dual-lane highways in Colombia. In terms of ports, we are working on improving our merchandise handling capacity by 50% by 2014, and 50% in the next four years. We also expect to double railway capacity in the next six years.</p><h4>What are the railway challenges and your prospects for the railroad in the Magdalena Valley?</h4><p>The first thing to have in mind is that Colombia is only planning on the short run to develop railway infrastructure for cargo purposes. We are not planning right now on developing transportation for passengers by railroads. We are simultaneously working on all fronts: roads, ports, airports, and railway. We are working to maintain the infrastructure we already have in the Magdalena Valley, where only 300 kilometers of approximately 900 kilometers are being used. This first line does not require high levels of investment, as the infrastructure is already there, and we just need the operators to fix it and use it. The second line foresees a $6 billion plan to build new railway lines, and at ANI we are encouraging investors to take part in the projects through private initiatives via the new PPP law. In addition, we work closely with mining companies to develop railway projects so we can boost cargo transportation in the railway sector. Our strategy is for the private mining groups, who are the ones interested in developing railway infrastructure projects to invest in railways through private initiatives, but we are keeping in mind that in the future these railways need to be available to other sectors and companies. The next few years will be very important for the sector, and we expect to have the entire railway network connecting the coalmines from the Pacific, passing through the Boyacá region and continuing through the Magdalena Valley and reaching the Caribbean by 2019.</p><h4>How would you assess the investment climate in the sector?</h4><p>We have seen an increasing interest from foreign investors coming to Colombia, and we expect to have the participation of as many investors as possible as there is plenty of room and opportunities for everybody. Spanish, South Korean, and Brazilian companies have all shown a great deal of interest in our infrastructure projects and programs. However, there are companies from all over the world looking at Colombia. In this regard, we will soon open a round of negotiations with foreign companies to gradually tender about 25 to 30 projects.</p><div class="quote">“The current government aims to increase the rate of investment in transportation infrastructure to 3% of GDP. "</div><h4>What are the main criteria you evaluate when tendering a project?</h4><p>Increasing transparency in bidding processes has been one of the government's top priorities in the last few years, and we have successful experiences with Inví­as, our sister company, which tendered projects worth $1.3 billion. In this regard, we are setting registration processes publicly available that will be followed by a pre-qualification process in which we will tell companies one by one the criteria and minimum requirements to develop the project. That will enable us to create a shortlist of a maximum of six companies that will need to commit themselves to develop a proposal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose to start operating in Colombia?<br></h4><p>LAN has been in Colombia since December 2010. For the first six months, our focus was mainly operational. It was getting all the operations up to LAN standards in terms of safety, security, maintenance, and operations. In those six months, we obtained the IOSA certification, which is an international operations safety audit. Most of the large airlines have this certification, and LAN acquired it in the first six months; it was a record, even within LAN. We also improved service, especially for on-time performance. We measured how many flights we had arriving on time versus our promises in the itinerary. We went from the 45% that AIRES had to 80% in two months. AIRES used to fly its airplanes for 13 hours a day, but we dropped that to nine hours a day. We used the planes less and used buffers within the itinerary so that if there were a contingency in the morning, we could recover operations by 11.00 am, for example. Planes on the ground are not generating revenue; however, that is money that we are investing for the sake of service. Generally, on-time performance in the US is about 75%. Colombia was similar, but we raised it to 80% to begin with; now it is 85%, and we are aiming for 90%. LAN is always aiming for a 90% on-time rate in all the countries it operates in, including Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, and now, after the merger with TAM, also in Brazil.</p><h4>What are you doing to target and attract the corporate segment?</h4><p>We are being very aggressive commercially, offering discounts to large companies that have a lot of business customers and trips throughout the year. We have a commercial strategy for that, and we have two business models: long- and short-haul operations. What the passengers expect on a short-haul flight is different from what they expect on a long-haul flight. That is why we are obsessed with on-time performance. Everyone expects to leave on time and arrive on time.</p><h4>What are the most important routes right now, and are you planning to increase the frequency of any flights?</h4><p>Our strategy right now is more about increasing frequencies to the places we fly rather than opening new routes. In fact, in the domestic market, we have taken out some routes. AIRES used to fly to 24 places within Colombia. In Peru and Argentina, we fly to 12 destinations. In Chile, we fly to 13. We don't fly to Armenia or Manizales in Colombia anymore. We fly to Pereira instead. Weather-wise, it's much easier to fly into Pereira than operate in Armenia and Manizales. There were too many weather delays on those routes, and we were competing with Avianca's much bigger planes. Our operating costs were higher than Avianca's, meaning it had a competitive advantage. Bogotá-Medellí­n is the most popular route, then Bogotá-Cali, Bogotá-Barranquilla, and Bogotá-Cartagena. For Bogotá-Medellí­n, we have nine flights per day.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy right now is more about increasing frequencies to the places we fly rather than opening new routes."</div><h4>Where do you fly internationally?</h4><p>We fly to Miami, Lima, Ecuador, Santiago, and Buenos Aires via Lima. We are considering opening new flights to increase our penetration in Brazil, and we fly to Sío Paolo from Colombia. We are also looking into the EU and other markets in the US as well. The growth we have in Colombia is aggressive, not only within Colombia, but also in the international market. However, we won't be opening anything new in the next six months.</p><h4>What were your expectations for 2013?</h4><p>We are still investing. Over the past 18 months we have invested around $600 million. In comparison, the new international airport was around $1 billion. As a sole company, we have been investing around 60% of what the new airport cost. We have invested in infrastructure, people, systems, and planes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges in the shipping industry?<br></h4><p>Colombia has issues with logistics and infrastructure. There is a positive thing in all this, and it is that the ports are well developed. Cartagena's port is state of the art, and so is Buenaventura thanks to the new port TCBuen. The problem is moving inland; as it is very costly and approximately double the price. We really need to work on this. However, the biggest challenge for Colombia's growth is the continuing development of shipping and transport. A lot of people ask me, “Why is everything in Bogotá, and why do we need to move cargo in and out of Bogotá?" And there is no answer, but we have been centralized for years. We can't travel more than a thousand kilometers over really difficult terrain.</p><h4>What impact will the recent free trade agreement (FTA) with the US have in Hamburg Süd's operations in Colombia?</h4><p>If you monitor all the FTAs, there will be a huge increase in imports and exports; we have seen it in Chile and Mexico. So in the short term, what you will see—and what we're already beginning to see—is that there will be an increase of about 30% to 40% in import volumes. However, the long-term impact—the real significant impact for Colombia will be in exports, and that takes many more years to develop. Historically, FTAs in Latin America triple trade volume in three to four years. And we're looking at establishing free trade with the largest consumer market in the world; 40% of all goods in the world are bought by the US.</p><h4>What sectors represent higher revenues for Hamburg Süd in Colombia?</h4><p>We move slightly more imports than exports. Let's say 60% imports and 40% exports. In the import sector, we're involved with anyone you could mention. For example, one of our biggest accounts is Mazda. We also carry Renault, Falabella, Exito, Samsung, and LG. Most of them come from Asia, over 30%. We also move a lot of cargo from Brazil. There is a huge import of Brazilian sugar to Colombia, even though Colombia produces a lot of sugar. And from the US, we import anything and everything. Generally, we import finished and manufactured goods, and they all usually pay good freight rates. On the exports side, Hamburg Süd is the largest shipping line for coffee. We also move a lot of resin from the industrial sector of Cartagena. The sector that pays the best freight is refrigerated cargo, which is a sector that we are very active in. We are the second largest shipping liner in the world that moves refrigerated cargo. For example, we are moving flowers to the UK. That is a sector that has great potential for development in Colombia. Peru is the single largest destination for iron, followed by Ecuador, Chile, and Mexico. Exports to Venezuela have decreased a lot. The main places Colombia exports to are regional or interregional.</p><div class="quote">“The sector that pays the best freight is refrigerated cargo, which is a sector that we are very active in."</div><h4>According to the National Business Association of Colombia (ANDI), maritime transportation in Colombia increased around 17% last year. What is your outlook for container shipping over the medium term?</h4><p>Historically, container shipping has been a very easy industry in which to track growth. This sector has grown at 10% for 20 years. It looked like it would remain that robust forever until we felt the effects of the economic crisis in 2009. GNP dropped to 1%, and volume dropped 10% in 2009. It drove everybody crazy because we were growing at 10%, and suddenly we had a 10% drop. Even though the sector rebounded in 2010, growth was about 7% to 8%. Worldwide, the shipping industry has some problems; it is losing money. It is important to understand that world economic growth has been based on globalization, and it has been possible because of the low cost of transportation. Shipping is a weak link.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claro recently launched operations in Colombia, following the union of Comcel and Telmex. What have been the major advantages of this merger?<br></h4><p>We have made a statement to the market that has been clearly recognized by consumers; the industry of telecommunications is evolving into a new era of convergence, which is a worldwide trend. Everybody understands that telecommunications is a critical sector; it extends into many other segments of the economy and supports productivity. In that sense, consumers have started to see that the company is blending fixed networks, such as internet subscriptions and TV services, with mobile services, which shows the strength of our business and the power of telecommunications for the future of our country. It is easier for the consumer to jump on to what's next instead of wavering back and forth. The merger introduced an international perspective to Colombia. Today, people recognize that there is a wider telecommunications world beyond the local players. Currently, the company has subscribed close to 37 million clients.</p><h4>What makes the Colombian consumer unique?</h4><p>Colombian consumers are heavy mobile services users. They use voice services for about twice as long as anyone else in the region. This comes combined with the fact that we offer almost the lowest tariffs per minute worldwide.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding 4G services?</h4><p>There is a great deal of contention surrounding 4G. There are many proposals from our competitors, and recent reports show huge potential. Everyone is aware that internet and broadband services outside the home are happening through the mobile world. However, we also need to provide fixed internet for people who demand the highest quality. The vast majority of consumers are demanding these services, and there is an incredibly powerful plan from the government to make this happen. Regardless, many different companies need to come to Colombia, invest in the country, and enjoy the legal stability we have enjoyed in the past few years. Our outlook is that the implementation of 4G will be the Ministry's decision. Our infrastructure is ranked third in the region, behind Brazil and Chile. The telecommunications infrastructure is one of the few aspects of the country that is not falling behind that of other countries in region. I am positive about the next five years—4G needs to happen, but sometimes decisions take a long time. The authorities discuss the issue and forget that 47 million users are waiting for a resolution. In the end, the service will be for the people and the users, not the government, so we are pushing for the process to move more quickly.</p><div class="quote">“The demand for data is growing, and has reached about 17%-18% of our daily revenue."</div><h4>What financial performance are you expecting for 2012 compared to last year?</h4><p>In 2011, our service revenue grew by around 10%-11%. This is significantly higher than the growth of the country's economy. There is huge demand for the services we provide. We are seeing that consumers demand more communications technology, which we struggle to provide because we lack different spectrums. 4G needs to be applied as soon as possible, so that we can provide higher-quality services at a faster pace. The demand for data is growing, and has reached about 17%-18% of our daily revenue.</p><h4>What is your vision for the ICT sector and Claro in the medium term?</h4><p>We definitely believe that the industry can become a locomotive for the economy. The telecommunications sector has the opportunity to become much more robust and a driver of development in the country. What we have been creating is a think tank for the telecommunications industry. The size of the market is an invitation for competition. If the conditions in the country are maintained, and we don't change the rules of the game, people will continue to invest. I believe that we will start to see a more competitive environment. The country welcomes investment and seeks to ensure that there is always competition to drive the quality of services up. Claro will continue to push and compete, just as we have done over the past 18 years. We will do everything possible to maintain the leadership position that we have today.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of SuperGIROS and what kind of services are offered by the company?<br></h4><p>In May 2006, a group of businessmen came together to create SuperGIROS, the main objective of which is domestic money transfer in the form of postal payment services. Its operations began in the departments of Nariño and Choco through gaming and gambling companies. Additionally, 19 offices were opened in Cali, Medellí­n, Pereira, Armenia, Cartago, Valledupar, Bogotá, Tunja, Sogamoso, Neiva, Monteria, Cartagena, Sincelejo, Santa Marta, Orito, Puerto Asis, Mocoa, and La Horminga. Given that the financial, logistics, and technology infrastructure of the gaming companies was very similar to what SuperGIROS required for billing purposes at the time, a strategic alliance with these companies was reached so that they could provide services—as business partners—through their sales points. This was very well received by the business community, and as new business partners were incorporated the number of offices increased from 68 by the end of 2006 to more than 7,500 by April 2013.</p><h4>What is the profile of your customers?</h4><p>While our services are used by people from all socioeconomic levels, our main customers are those belonging to levels one to three.</p><h4>How does the technology allow a customer to transfer money through a wide network of services?</h4><p>As is well known, SuperGIROS makes heavy use of technology to operate. Electronic transactions go through different networks using various technologies such as GPRS, radio frequency connections, wireless internet, and ADSL channels, among others. These networks are managed by datacenters and virtual private networks (VPNs) are being set up at online sales points to secure and encrypt data. It is in this way that electronic money is safely transferred all over the country.</p><div class="quote">“SuperGIROS makes heavy use of technology to operate."</div><h4>How big is your network?</h4><p>We currently have over 7,500 service points across the country. We are expanding this network every month and project over 8,000 service points by the end of 2013.</p><h4>Who are your main competitors and what advantages do you have over them?</h4><p>The domestic market for money transfer is a very competitive category, with Efecty, SIN, and RedService our major competitors, among others. We also have indirect competition from banks that provide a similar service. Since inception, SuperGIROS has been characterized by differentiated values in the marketplace such as extended working hours, sales point vicinity, Sunday-to-Sunday operations, our business partners' goodwill through which services are being provided, and so on. Also, the quality of service provided to our users is one of the fundamental pillars to differentiate ourselves in this category.</p><h4>What trends have you seen recently in regional non-banking money services?</h4><p>The trend is toward concentrating the number of deliveries not exceeding $200,000, which represent 81% of the operation. Those greater than $400,000 represent only 8% and $160,000 is the total average of deliveries.</p><h4>In addition to your existing business, the company SuperENVÍOS has recently initiated operations for postal and courier services. What was the reason for creating this company and what is its target market?</h4><p>First of all, it is a very nice opportunity to continue contributing to national development, especially in remote regions where this service is not yet available. It is also a way to take advantage of our business partners' resources so as to maximize their income. The target market is still levels one to three; people who already use money transfer services but do not have easy access to low-cost parcel services near their homes with nationwide coverage.</p><h4>Latin America is chronically restricted by the banking system, but many banks have begun initiatives to bring people closer to the formal banking system. What is your strategy to remain relevant amid competition from banks?</h4><p>We are currently implementing a customer service program through which we intend to train more than 12,000 sales point advisors so as to continue making this one of our strengths. In this way, we will prevent users from making long lines at both banks and other competitors' sales points. Furthermore, 80% of money transfers are in the lower range of the table in which our prices are still the lowest in the market, an advantage that can hardly be surpassed by banks in Colombia.</p><h4>What challenges is SuperGIROS facing now and in the medium term?</h4><p>As you mentioned, one of our greatest challenges today is the banks, as well as some economic measures made by the government that may not only affect category interests but also our users' pockets. In this sense, we can also point out that the competition analyzes SuperGIROS' movements and strategies in order to copy them and avoid being left behind.</p><h4>SuperGIROS is involved in social development programs. What are the objectives of your contribution?</h4><p>First of all, we aim to benefit people with fewer opportunities. It is so rewarding to observe children in Choco having fun by going to the cinema or watching successful sportsmen who, regardless of their competitive abilities, do not have the economic resources to train properly. We do a lot to ensure the future of Colombia without neglecting children's education, recreation, health, and capacity.</p><h4>What is your vision for 2013?</h4><p>In 2015, our aim is to be positioned as one of the three main national and international postal services providers, remaining in first place in domestic payments and consolidating our business partners as providers of the best customer service network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core market factors that encouraged BD Promotores to invest in Colombia four years ago?</h4><p>Four years ago, when the crisis hit Spain, we analyzed several potential markets where BD Promotores could grow, and Colombia offered the greatest growth opportunities. In fact, I believe Colombia is the best destination for foreign investors in Latin America.</p><h4>How has the real estate sector evolved in Colombia since you entered the market?</h4><p>Colombia was a “cold market," due to the economic crisis that affected the country in the late 1990s, as well as the security issues that everyone is aware of when thinking of Colombia. However, the sector has seen some important growth over the past four years, thanks to the development of the country and the potential that the main economic sectors offer.</p><h4>How would you assess the environment for foreign investors in the Colombian real estate sector?</h4><p>Colombia has high levels of legal security, and the market offers plenty of opportunities. There is an increasing middle class whose purchasing power is growing at a very fast pace, and its members are the main engine of our sector. Everyone knows about Colombia and its potential now; however, we have been here for four years and that offers us a better position in the market than newcomers. No foreign investors landing in Colombia should expect to make profitable business operations right away, because, as in our case, there is a process of understanding Colombia and its people while getting accustomed to the market and its trends. Basically, you have to understand that Colombia offers huge opportunities as long as you commit yourself to medium- to long-term strategies. BD Promotores' story has been based along these lines.</p><h4>What are you expecting from BD Bacatá, the tallest building in Colombia?</h4><p>We believe that it will be one of the tallest buildings in Latin America at 250 meters and 66 stories. The main challenge in this project has always been the design; we never aimed at developing the tallest building, but a key project. We are very proud of the entire project. We want the citizens of Bogotá, and Colombians in general, to feel the building is theirs, making it a landmark in the skyline of Bogotá. Also, the project aims at revitalizing the center of Bogotá, because it is an area that has been neglected over the years. We expect to open the project at the end of 2014.</p><h4>What other projects has BD Promotores lined up for the near future?</h4><p>Currently, we are developing another hotel, in Bogotá. It will be a smaller scale project than BD Bacatá with 100 rooms, and its name is Bacatá Express. We believe that it will be finished by July 2013. At the same time, we have other ongoing projects in other cities, such as Cartagena.</p><h4>What has been your level of investment in Colombia since you first started operations in the country?</h4><p>We have been handling some key projects over the last three years, and we have set up even more promising ones like BD Bacatá. Overall, the project investment has been over $100 million. We have to put these investments into context though, because we are not a large company and the decision to establish operations in Colombia looked risky back then. Today, everyone knows about Colombia and its development, but four years ago the environment was completely different. In addition, the stereotype of a lack of security in Colombia has damaged its image. The reality is far from that; anybody can tell you that Bogotá, for example, is not a dangerous city as many believe.</p><h4>What are BD Promotores' plans outside of Colombia?</h4><p>We currently have operations in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. At the moment, we do not have any short- to medium-term plans to launch operations in any other neighboring countries. BD Promotores is strongly focused on the growth and development of the company in Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the evolution of the real estate sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Politically, we are very stable now, but we have a lot of reasons to remain concerned about what is going on around the country in terms of the economy, security, and controls on handling cocoa crops. The world is in turmoil, and this makes countries like Colombia attractive for investors looking to grow businesses. Plus, the next generation of Colombians, educated abroad, are returning to Colombia in much greater numbers than they did in the 1990s. Now that they are coming back, they are managing and generating huge interest from their peers working in real estate funds, which is a very popular method for accumulating wealth in today's world. Many real estate and construction companies are basing their future growth on real estate funds. This makes a big difference because we are not simply thinking about initial sales or presales to fund projects anymore. Now, we're getting new and fresh money to build projects, and then evaluating which markets will be able to buy mature products in four or five years. This is another way of enhancing property value. With regard to retail, office space, hotels, and industrial space, we have been selling everything piece by piece. This is how the sector operated until about five years ago, when builders and investors began to keep properties with the intention of renting or offering them to different funds, such as pension managers. This development is changing the whole spectrum and horizon of the real estate sector in Colombia, and it will bring more and bigger investors to the country.</p><h4>Fiduciary rights are becoming more popular with local investors. What advantages do these rights offer?</h4><p>Our company began the fiduciary or trust style of sales 20 years ago. We were the first company in Colombia to do so, and we successfully brought this model to Ecuador. However, when we took it to Panama, people didn't pursue it. At that point, the biggest problem was that we didn't have the money to fund whole projects, and we had to go to small investors to get them to fund pieces of a project. At this time, maybe from 1991 to 1993, individual hotel suites, which might cost $50,000 to $60,000 per unit, were significant investments for small investors. We divided the units into five or six parts to make it easier for people to get into the market and expand it. Now, people can get into the real estate sector or hotel business by paying only a fifth of a room; this is the basis of the fiduciary trust system. When we began doing this we had a lot of success because we could bring investors with just $5,000 or $7,000, and let them gain access to the profits of a high-yield business with only a small investment. That was a big hotel investment title (HIT) at that point. We did very well in the 1990s with this model and sold many hotels in this manner, including all of the Sheraton hotels in Colombia. This model hasn't changed, and it is still a valid model for raising money for a project. However, it is just one of many tools that we have for raising funds.</p><h4>With 20 years of experience in the hotel sector and developing large projects such as the Sheraton and Capital Towers, what are you expecting with your latest project?</h4><p>We've had several good years; we've been growing steadily for more than six years. About two years ago, we decided to focus mainly on hotels. Even though we do some residential, second-home, and retirement developments, our main focus in the current period is hotels. We just opened our first hotel, the Tryp Hotel. This was recently bought by Wyndham, a US company. This is a great location because it is safe and close to the airport. We're planning to open the others in the coming months. We also operate hotels through a management company called Diplomat Hotels, and we are pursuing many more opportunities. Colombia is similar to a child that is beginning to grow, and we want to nurture this growth. Colombia is a new economy.</p><div class="quote">“The next generation of Colombians, educated abroad, are returning to Colombia in much greater numbers."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current state of development of the infrastructure sector in Colombia, and what impact will public-private partnerships (PPPs) have on the industry?</h4><p>We currently operate in Colombia as a concessionary for Ruta del Sol Sector II, a road infrastructure project that goes from Puerto Salgar in Cundinamarca to San Roque in César, and has an approximate length of 528 kilometers. Our expected investment in the project will be Ps3.4 billion. Our partners are the Colombian companies Estudios y Proyectos del Sol and CSS Constructores. In this regard, we are very interested in the further development of infrastructure projects in the country, and we welcome the great efforts made by the government of Colombia to boost the sector. In this context, PPPs will be key in the future development of the industry.</p><h4>How is the Ruta del Sol project progressing, and what does this project mean for the country?</h4><p>We are pleased with the development of the work so far, as we have paved more than 110 kilometers already, and we expect to completely finish it by April 2016. The project is of high importance for the country, as it will be the final link between the mountains and the coastal cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena. It will definitely contribute to the development of the logistics and tourism sectors of the country. Currently, around 70% of the users of the Ruta del Sol road are heavy vehicles. We also have to put this crucial project into context, because after the several free trade agreements (FTAs) Colombia has signed, the project has become essential.</p><h4>What is behind the potential partnership agreement with Riopaila?</h4><p>We have been talking to many different stakeholders in the Colombian ethanol industry to get a better understanding of the local market opportunity for ethanol. We believe that ethanol could play an important role in the energy sector, boosting gasoline fuel by adding up to 20% to the mixture. We would love to support Latin American countries to develop their ethanol production capacity, increasing renewable energy participation in the energy matrix, and contributing to reducing CO2 emissions and making ethanol a worldwide fuel solution. Odebrecht is also open to entering the energy sector, where we have already several ongoing projects in Brazil and Peru. In this context, the Colombian energy sector is rapidly growing and Odebrecht can contribute to such development thanks to its international experience. We are currently looking into specific projects within the generation segment. However, we mostly focus on infrastructure and road projects in Colombia right now, and the other option could be a medium- to long-term vision.</p><h4>What are some of the other ongoing projects for the company in Colombia?</h4><p>We are very interested in all of the fourth-generation PPP projects the government plans to widely tender, and we evaluated all of the proposed projects. At the moment, we are preparing for the pre-qualification process. We are mainly talking about four processes named Victorias Tempranas, Cartagena-Barranquilla, Girardot-Puerto Salgar, the circumvallation of Bogotá and Mulalo-Loboguerrero road projects. We believe we can qualify for all of the tendering processes. However, the competition will be tough.</p><h4>What are the main challenges the road infrastructure industry faces in Colombia?</h4><p>The government has a very ambitious plan to construct dual carriageways. For example, we constructed 76 kilometers of dual carriageway out of the 207 kilometers constructed in 2012. In 2013, we have already developed 30 kilometers of this type of road infrastructure. The main issue for the future will be to de-bureaucratize and accelerate processes because issues regarding the mitigation of the environmental impact of the projects are slowing them down heavily, especially in terms of environment licenses. Simplifying the process would be key for the country to capitalize on the huge growth and development capacity that it has. In addition, the development of road infrastructure projects is essential for Colombia to take better advantage of the numerous FTAs it has recently signed. These types of projects will not only benefit foreign companies coming to Colombia, but will make local companies more competitive as well.</p><h4>How would you rate Colombia's human capital?</h4><p>I believe that sourcing human capital is one of the main challenges ahead for the country. In our particular case, we base our success on the expertise and quality of human capital; wherever we set up operations, we always aim at hiring the highest number of local workers. I would even say that this challenge does not only apply to Colombia, but many countries in the world. Hiring and integrating them into the company's structures is a very tough challenge. In Colombia, there are a reduced number of Brazilian expatriates working for Odebrecht. In this context, we have our in-house facilities to train workers and integrate them into our structures. Outsiders are also welcome to join our programs, as it also works as a small university that offers job opportunities afterward. For example, in 2012 we hired around 4,000 people worldwide out of 7,000 trainees. In 2013, we want to maintain these figures because the industry and the development of many Latin American economies require it. In addition, and in the context of Colombia, we also have several agreements with universities, and for example, we have 45 such graduates currently working for Odebrecht.</p><h4>How do you see Odebrecht's operations evolving in Colombia, and what roles does Colombia play in the company's overall activities?</h4><p>Currently, Peru and Colombia represent the most important operations in the South American region for the company. Today, we have two key projects in Colombia—the Ruta del Sol Sector II and the transversal road of Boyacá. Obviously, Ruta del Sol is a key project not only for Colombia, but for the company's global operations, and for that reason it is our main focus at the moment. At the same time, there are some potential projects such as the roads I previously mentioned. We are also studying the navigability of the Magdalena River. There is huge potential to further expand our activities in the country, and I believe Colombia will become an even more important market for the company's global operations. Odebrecht is open to analyze and explore new projects in Colombia, a country that holds great potential in terms of road, maritime, and energy infrastructure projects. Cartagena and Barranquilla need to see further developments in their maritime infrastructure in order to be able to better channel the opportunities that will come from the FTAs, and our company is more than ready to step into any interesting project in this field, regardless of it being private or public.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the infrastructure sector in Colombia, and what role do public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in that context?<br></h4><p>Colombia has huge challenges ahead, especially regarding the infrastructure sector. For that reason, the country has ambitious investment plans to boost the development of infrastructure projects in the mining, road, energy, and logistics segments. Colombia plans to invest Ps99 billion over the next 10 years, and transportation infrastructure projects comprise around 60%-65% of that investment. I believe that many of these infrastructure projects will contribute by reducing transportation costs in the country, making the logistics sector (and the country overall) more competitive at the international level.</p><h4>How has El Condor evolved over the years, and what sectors are you most active in?</h4><p>El Condor was born as a construction company based in the Department of Antioquia. We began by developing construction projects in the region, and little by little we went national. In order to better compete with foreign companies in Colombia, we, along with a number of other relevant players in the infrastructure industry, set up a holding. This step enabled us to develop an investment portfolio in the infrastructure industry, alongside our construction business line. Construction work is very much linked to political and economic cycles, and our current investment portfolio makes us less dependent on the construction business line. At the same time, these investment projects provide us with enough cash flow to grow our construction activity. Overall, our construction company is totally consolidated today; we develop all types of infrastructure projects at the national level, and in terms of investments, we have mining, airports, and road concessions, as well as interests in other construction companies.</p><h4>How relevant is the Transversal de las Americas project for the country?</h4><p>It is a project of around Ps1.5 billion that covers over 700 kilometers, spread across almost the entire country. The project aims to provide infrastructure solutions to areas with high levels of traffic and road activity, contributing to their economic and social development. These areas are very rich in terms of natural resources, but lack the tools to extract them out of these regions. Although a number of legal and bureaucratic issues slowed down its development, the project will finally take off in 2013. We own a 33% stake in the consortium behind the project, and Transversal de las Americas represents the most important project in terms of business activity for us.</p><h4>What results did the IPO in 2012 yield for the company?</h4><p>The company needed to strengthen its financial side because of the fast pace of growth it experienced over the last few years. At the same time, we foresaw the need for the country to have a reliable and economically strong company for the development of infrastructure projects. The stock market offered many opportunities for us, especially in the context of giving continuity to the growth of the company, which was ready to take the next step in terms of its own development. The IPO was envisaged as the next natural step to consolidate our activities in more significant projects. The IPO was extremely successful, as we attracted international investors, Colombian pension funds, individuals, and corporations. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.15 times; therefore, we increased the initial stake offer (Ps150.00 million) up to Ps162.58 million. The company plans to use the funds raised from the IPO to finance its growth plan for the coming years.</p><h4>What are some of the greatest challenges facing the infrastructure industry in Colombia?</h4><p>I believe that national companies need to consolidate their activities because there are many companies operating in the market right now. The current boom will contribute to the consolidation of some of them, whereas others will continue with a small part of the cake. Overall, the current level of infrastructure development in the country will contribute to make the industrial and enterprise network within the infrastructure industry much stronger. In the near future, I see many Colombian companies going abroad. Companies need to be ready to access financial tools to take on infrastructure projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the infrastructure and housing sector in Colombia evolved in the last few years, and what impact is that having on the cement industry?<br></h4><p>If you have to select a sector in which to invest, it should be housing and infrastructure, followed by the oil and mining sectors. Colombia has huge infrastructure needs. When it comes to housing, this is a country that has about a 1.5 million-unit quantitative housing deficit plus another 1 million-unit qualitative deficit. Probably half of the population is also under 25 years of age. Cement consumption is at 225 kilograms per capita per annum, while the average in Latin America is 330 kilograms. This means that in order for Colombia to catch up with Latin America, it needs to grow by 50%. The sector will lead economic growth in the near future, and the government is taking steps in order to close the gap. At this particular moment, there is more of a focus on housing, and that is why the authorities have just launched an initiative to build 100,000 houses per year. There are also a lot of regulations that need to change in Colombia in order for that number to grow much faster. For example, in Colombia there is no program for people not formally employed. The government needs to deliver regulations to provide housing, or facilitate housing, for that population group. In infrastructure, I think it has been taking the right steps in recent years. It has faced some problems with corruption, which has created a slowdown in the development of new infrastructure projects, but I think the country is quite clear about what it needs. Officials are trying to position Colombia as a country for safe investment. FDI has been growing tremendously over the last couple of years. Several free trade agreements (FTAs) have been signed and more are planned.</p><h4>CEMEX is present in over 50 countries. What does Colombia represent for the company, and what further expansion plans do you have?</h4><p>Colombia is number two after Mexico in CEMEX's estimations, and we believe that the country will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. In order to catch up with that vision, we have to invest. For example, in our aggregate business we have doubled our capacity. In our ready-mix business, a year ago we had just 16 plants, and now we expect to finish 2012 with 38 fixed plants and 24 mini plants, which we did not have in the past. If you add it up, it totals 62 plants. We are also bringing in 200 new trucks for the ready-mix business. For the cement business, we brought in 350 trucks and increased our cement capacity by 20% over 12 months. Equally, we are also planning to invest in two new plants; one in Antioquia and one on the north coast of Colombia. This will allow us to increase our production by 50%.</p><h4>Where is demand mainly coming from, and how do you see it changing in the medium term?</h4><p>Right now, it is coming from housing. Approximately 70% of cement is sold in bag form. This is sold in small quantities and used in the construction of informal housing. However, after 2013 I expect the main driver will be infrastructure. I see Colombia growing over the next 10-12 years in order to catch up with the big gap that it has in infrastructure.</p><div class="quote">“In our ready-mix business, a year ago we had just 16 plants, and now we expect to finish 2012 with 38 fixed plants and 24 mini plants, which we did not have in the past."</div><h4>How are plans progressing to list the company on the Colombian stock market?</h4><p>We believe in this country, as it is the second most significant country in CEMEX's portfolio. We are planning to create a holding in Colombia called CEMEX Latin American Holding, where most of our Central and South American operations will be based. We are then planning to sell a minority stake in that new holding in the very short term. It will be a huge transaction for the Colombian market. It is very important for the country as it is the first time a foreign company has done something like this. It is also important for CEMEX because it is the first time in our history we have decided to do a listing like this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since it was established in 1939?<br></h4><p>I am the third generation of engineers in my family, and I have been presiding over the company since 1975, when I took over from my father. Our company, which was established in 1939, has specialized over the years in developing public infrastructure projects such as roads, dams, and bridges. Throughout our history, we have been pioneers in terms of civil engineering solutions in the construction of roads, as well as the machinery used in such works. In this context, we have won a couple of engineering awards in Colombia for coating a dam near Bogotá in 1994, and more recently the execution of a false tunnel in an area where we had already developed road projects that had some infrastructure issues. The latter project was very complex and challenging; however, we successfully completed it thanks to our advanced and innovative studies and engineering techniques. Today, we directly employ 1,200 people—indirectly the figure would increase to more than 6,000—and we have 630 construction machines.</p><h4>How does the current boom in infrastructure projects that Colombia is experiencing impact on your operations?</h4><p>The current Santos administration has prioritized the development of infrastructure projects in the country; however, everything is still gathering pace, because some bureaucratic decisions slowed down this boom. In addition, Colombia's geography also poses some challenges from the engineering point of view; we are the only country in the world with three different mountain chains, and that makes the development of certain infrastructure projects very challenging. For example, to connect Bogotá with other coastal cities, we have to keep in mind that the capital city of our country lays at over 2,500 meters above sea level. Also, Colombia is behind some other regional countries in terms of concentrating industrial areas near the coast—Colombia has yet to exploit the advantages of having access to two different oceans. However, not everything is negative; the authorities are very determined to exploit the country's industrial potential, and we have seen a significant increase in the number of free trade zones (FTZs) across the country. Such developments also contribute to the improvement of the road and logistics network in Colombia.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Ruta del Sol project for Colombia?</h4><p>The Magdalena River is the backbone of the country, and the Ruta del Sol project aims at exploiting the industrial and economic potential along the road corridor. In other words, the route connects the country from the south to the north and, through a more extensive road network, will also go from west to east. We also need connections to the two ocean coasts, the Atlantic and Pacific. Overall, we are talking about 1,000 kilometers of road, which is relatively flat and wavy and enables fast and stable road connections for the cargo industry. It also helps to boost both imports and exports.</p><h4>What are some of the other key projects you have taken part in?</h4><p>We were pioneers in the concession process in Colombia. In 1994, the government of Colombia decided to start tendering projects, and we moved forward by putting together a very competitive and qualified group of professional engineers, which was a way of sharing risks as well. These types of projects give engineering companies continuity and long-term stability regardless of the political color of the government. Over the years, we have become a very strong company from a financial point of view. The main projects we took part in have been El Dorado Airport and La Lí­nea Tunnel. Overall, we have taken part in all the tendering processes for the main projects.</p><h4>What role does MHC play in attracting foreign investment into the country, and what role do international partnerships play in your business activity?</h4><p>We have always established partnerships with foreign firms, such as Skanska from Sweden and Construtora OAS from Brazil. Regarding the fourth-generation construction projects, we have recently signed a cooperation agreement with a Costa Rican company, Meco, and we have experienced a growth in the interest among foreign companies to come to Colombia and establish a partnership with us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technological advances have you implemented to improve productivity?<br></h4><p>In Colombia and Latin America, we find many pests and diseases. Therefore, we need to conduct specialized research on our needs here in this region. We have been developing some new tools and knowledge to understand the behavior of these diseases and find out what the causes are so we can have crops that are not affected by this problem. In Colombia, we have developed a new palm that is a hybrid between the American Palm and the African Palm. From this new hybrid we can obtain a new oil that we call “high oleic palm oil," which is different from the regular oil in food and non-food industrial applications. We have reached 50,000-planted hectares of this species of oil palm.</p><h4>What is Colombia's annual production of palm oil?</h4><p>In spring of 2013, we will be going above the 1 million-ton mark per year. This is going to be the first time the country will reach this number, so it is a great achievement for the sector.</p><h4>What is Fedepalma's role in regional economic development?</h4><p>Since land is a big issue for many different reasons, for example the social impact on rural workers, smallholders, and medium-sized producers, we have been developing a model where an entrepreneur has a piece of land and an extraction mill. This larger company then helps smallholders by putting them together in what we call “strategic alliances" to produce palm oil. Through this model, we have been able to significantly increase the amount of fruit being produced without direct investments from entrepreneurs. They do it indirectly through these producers and this also helps enhance social relationships in the region because everybody feels part of the business, and not like a big company came in and bought everything. We try to make everyone participate. We call this “inclusive business." At the moment, we have about 80,000 hectares under this type of model out of the 450,000 hectares that we have in the country. There are over 100 of these smallholding alliances, and through these we improve our social impact and social perception in the communities. They are also supporting the development of the oil palm industry in Colombia. Instead of having large plantations owned by only one company, this is a way to have a larger, nuclear estate not belonging to only one company. It involves small- and medium- sized producers. In the late 1990s, 70% of the fruit that we processed in the mills was from owned plantations and 30% from other suppliers. Today, it is the opposite.</p><h4>What percentage of the palm oil goes into the food industry, and what percentage goes into the bio-fuel sector?</h4><p>Today, with the development of the palm biodiesel program in Colombia, we have about 50% of local sales going to bio-diesel and 50% to the food industry. We sell to the local market about 85% out of total production and export 15%. Europe has been our major export market for almost 20 years. Also, some Latin American countries, such as Mexico and Chile, have been important to us. Now, the US is demanding more palm oil for the food industry and hopefully soon for biodiesel as well.</p><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become an exporter of energy in the short to medium term?</h4><p>The oil palm is a miraculous plant. It transforms solar energy in a very efficient way into energy in the form of oil. It is very productive when compared to other oilseeds. It is 10 times more productive than soy beans, for example. For many years, we were only looking at the food industry and the soap and detergent industries. Now, we are looking more into many different oleochemical areas. We have six biodiesel plants in the country producing close to 500,000 tons a year. Now, I see many companies looking for fresh opportunities to manufacture feedstock for the detergent industry and other industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mayagüez evolved since it was established in 1937?<br></h4><p>We started in the sugar production segment; however, 10 years ago, we decided to shift business activities and look to expand our business line in the energy sector. In 2006, we set up an ethanol plant that today produces up to 250,000 liters of ethanol per day. Annually, we can produce 80 million liters. In this context, we are a very innovative company that recycles vinasse and re-circulates it into the system rather than dumping it on the land, which might contaminate the soil and water reserves underground. In addition, our storage and delivery system is regulated by the National Fire Protections Association (NFPA) and ASTM International standards and ensures efficiency and reliability in our operations. Today, in Colombia, the mix of ethanol with gasoline is 8%. In addition to ethanol, in 2010, we set up a cogeneration plant that has an installed capacity of 37 MW per hour per day. We sell around 19.5 MW per hour to the grid, and the remaining is consumed internally.</p><h4>This is a company that has achieved sustainable growth through renewable energy production. What is the potential for investment in the biofuels sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The sector holds huge potential, because there are only five sugar-based production companies, but there is capacity to construct five to seven more. The thing is there is no clear indication on what can happen with the price of ethanol, and that is the reason why some companies have halted projects in the sector. Additionally, many sugar production plants prefer to export sugar rather than devote their product to manufacture ethanol. For example, the Cauca Valley has the potential to produce 200 MW of electricity from bagasse, and several players in the industry are working together to achieve such a capacity. Mayagüez is one of the largest producers of energy in the region, but many other companies have boosted investment in the industry. We will see important events in the near future.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of development of the sugar industry in Colombia?</h4><p>There are around 13 operating mills in Colombia and thousands of stakeholders involved in this particular segment of the industry. For example, out of the 230,000 sugar-cultivated hectares in the Cauca Valley, only 25% is from the sugar mills, whereas the remaining 75% comes from non-related producers. Colombia is among the top-three sugar producers in Latin America, and today the country devotes 320,000 tons of sugar to the production of ethanol. Currently, 42% of the sugar we produce is devoted to the domestic consumption market, 23% goes to exports, whereas the remaining 35% is for ethanol production</p><h4>What are some other of the strategic plans for Mayagüez?</h4><p>We decided to expand operations into two or three countries in the region, and our financial projections foresee an investment capacity of up to $150 million. In this context, the future of the ethanol industry will be very much related to fibers, and although the technology developed is still very expensive, we are currently looking into future options to start producing ethanol from fibers. Finally, we will invest in more storage and distribution facilities, machinery, and new technologies, which currently represent 47% of our investment portfolio.</p><h4>The company recently changed its image. What was the strategy behind this?</h4><p>The move was envisaged to strengthen our position in the market and make sure that the market saw our shift toward energy production business activities. The logo and colors chosen are aimed at showing the market that we are a serious and solid company, and that we have high levels of environmental responsibility, which play a very important role in our activity. I always say that one can be profitable and respect the environment at the same time. For example, we currently use less than half the amount of water we did in terms of irrigation 10 years ago. In terms of social responsibility, we are highly committed in terms of educational programs; we have had our own school since 1954 with over 1,000 students, which has nationally certified programs. We make annual investments of around $2 million, and we plan to construct a new education facility in the Pradera community with a kindergarten,  a public library, a school, and public facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize freedom of expression in Colombia compared to other countries in the region?<br></h4><p>Colombia has a very high level of freedom of expression, both in legal and practical terms. If you compare it to other countries in the region, where there is a trend toward suppressing freedom of expression, we are very well ranked. Considering the reports made by the special rapporteur on freedom of expression in the hemisphere and the Organization of American States, it is more or less clear that we enjoy a wide margin to report on the many issues that arise in this country. It is true that in the past there was some violence against journalists. In that sense, we have improved dramatically from a high of more than 20 journalists killed per year in Colombia 10 or 15 years ago down to one death in 2012. It is also true that for national media such as ours, it is easier for us to do our job than for regional media, especially in the more remote areas of the country, where journalists are subject to pressure either from violent or political actors. In general terms, Colombia is very well ranked.</p><h4>How have you seen readership evolve over the past few years? What trends can you identify in terms of print versus online?</h4><p>Due to the security problems in Colombia for many years, business journalism was really macroeconomic journalism. Because many of the sources from the private sector did not want to appear in the media, it was difficult to report about major companies. In that sense, companies have begun to increase their profile, and that has attracted interest. At the same time, the Colombian economy has grown dramatically; in US dollar terms, 3.5 times since 2000. It is clear that there is a greater audience as the middle class is growing, issues regarding personal finances, the state of the economy, and specific companies attract more interest and readers. It is clear that our print circulation is more or less static, but our online readership is growing in double-digits.</p><h4>What is your reader profile?</h4><p>Our readership comprises mainly male professionals. The average age of our readers is 47 years old, located in the top five Colombian cities: Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. We also have a high correlation with people who own smart phones, a car, a university degree, Master's degrees or PhDs, married with children, and travel abroad more then once a year.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that our readership is going to use more and more portable gadgets such as tablets or smartphones."</div><h4>What is your outlook for the Colombian economy in general in 2013 and for the medium term?</h4><p>Regarding 2013, if we are able to solve the issue of executing public investment at a faster pace, we foresee a better year than 2012. We should grow above 4%. I don't know if we will reach the government's target of 4.8%, but of course that depends on the international situation, which looks slightly more promising than it did 12 months ago. In the medium term, Colombia is very well positioned. This country should be able to double its GDP per capita over the next 15 or 20 years. Of course, we could go even faster if we do our homework. There is a long list of things to do. In that list, we see the issue of road infrastructure, the quality of education, the issue of innovation or investment in science and technology, and adapting to climate change.</p><h4>If you were to flash forward five to 10 years, where do you envision Portafolio?</h4><p>I see it as the number one journal, with a much stronger presence online. I believe that our readership is going to use more and more portable gadgets such as tablets or smartphones, and in that sense we have to understand and follow the trends to remain a large financial newspaper. The Financial Times receives more than 50% of its revenues from its online section, and we have to follow that, as we're still at less than 10%, so we have a long way to go.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombian flowers and coffee are well recognized worldwide. What other main export products and markets are being targeted?<br></h4><p>The internationalization of Colombian agricultural goods began long ago. The country has signed trade agreements with several countries and blocs: MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), Mexico, the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), CAN (Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador), Chile, Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and others. However, the free trade agreement (FTA) with the US, signed in May 2012, is perhaps the most significant commercial step for us. Colombia increased export volumes to the US by more than 20% in the first 11 months of the year from 460,000 tons in 2011 to 553,000 tons in 2012, mainly due to sugar and confectionery exports, (+154%), bananas (+17%), and coffee (+30%). The main agricultural trade partners of Colombia are Belgium, the UK, Germany, the US, Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Traditional products—bananas, coffee, flowers, sugar, and tobacco—represent on average about 77% of our total exports, and in the last five years we reported an average annual growth of 8%. Henceforth, our future goals are to create the right conditions for the modernization and specialization of agricultural production, strengthen Colombian agricultural institutions, and expand the supply of exportable products for which the country has great potential: beef, fruit, palm oil, cocoa, rubber, forestry products, and biofuels.</p><h4>What trends in investment can you identify, and which sectors are the most attractive?</h4><p>According to the IMF, the Colombian economy will grow by 4.4% in 2013. Total foreign investment increased from $2.47 billion in 2000 to $13.39 billion in 2011, mainly in the mining and energy sectors, and in free zones and hotels. Although the flow of foreign investment in agriculture accounts for only 1% of total FDI, the Colombian agricultural sector offers great investment opportunities. Colombia is one of the countries with the greatest potential for the expansion of agricultural lands in the world. Of the total area suitable for agriculture (21.5 million hectares), only 4.7 million hectares in agriculture and 459,000 hectares in commercial forestry are currently in use. Therefore, we hold huge potential to develop production facilities in crops like cacao, highly recognized for its flavor. Colombia expanded its cacao acreage by 56% between 2002 and 2011, reaching 145,000 hectares, and we target the establishment of 28,000 new hectares and the renewal of 36,000 more as part of the Decennial Cacao Plan. In regard to cattle, the country ranks fourth in Latin America (29.2 million head in 2012). The formalization of the industrial link (slaughterhouses), as well as the improvement of distribution and marketing practices, present opportunities for private investment. In terms of biofuels, the country has been increasing its production capacity in biodiesel and ethanol. Nearly 439,000 tons of domestic crude palm oil production are used for biodiesel, and more than 374,000 tons of raw sugar are used in the production of ethanol. To increase our competitiveness we urgently need to attract further investment to improve local and national road networks, transport capacity in ports and consumer centers, as well as irrigation and drainage infrastructure.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to increase the volume and quality of small producers?</h4><p>The government, through the draft Rural Development Act, is proposing a new regulatory framework that aims to promote programs of rural development, more effective management of territory, and sort and formalize land ownership issues. It also aims to define protected areas and resolve conflicts in land use. The proposed regulation aims to strengthen rural human capital, with a focus on early childhood nutrition, offer a universal coverage of education and basic health, as well as provide universal social security in rural areas. It will increase capital, spread knowledge and productive technology, strengthen partnerships and rural organizations, and improve the basic infrastructure of transportation, water, education, health, and sanitation in rural regions.</p><p>Also, according to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), 32,000 new or rehabilitated housing units were delivered to low-income farmers in 2012. For 2013, we have an ambitious budget plan to increase the figure to up to 100,000 housing units. Finally, more than 20,000 small producers have benefited from the Productive Partnerships Program that the government launched five years ago.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In other words, we have to try harder to achieve our goal of constructing 1 million social housing units. We are now operating under new free trade agreements (FTAs) that may impact foreign players and new residential offerings, as well as infrastructure projects that have been labeled as strategic for the government through public-private partnerships (PPPs). With the new PPP law, we have the right legal framework and this model is really taking off, especially for infrastructure and social-housing projects.</p><h4>In what way will the new PPP regulatory framework impact construction companies?</h4><p>It is the first time that Colombia has a legal framework for the application of PPP as a business model for the development of infrastructure projects. We believe it is a key element to improve relations between the public and private sectors.</p><h4>Camacol turns 55 in 2013. How would you assess the role played by CAMACOL in the development of the construction sector in Colombia over this time?</h4><p>We have three main goals: to create a sustainable and strong urban plan, to be a speaker between the government and the private sector, and to generate a link between companies in the construction sector. At the same time, we are trying to implement nationwide programs to boost the construction of organized and sustainable urban centers and to contribute to the development of the sector. Currently, we have 1,300 affiliates in the country, and we are very proud of what we have achieved over the years thanks to our dialogue with the government. For example, we have reduced the housing deficit as well as boosted the construction of complementary infrastructure to these housing units with such things as schools and hospitals. It is very important for us to keep the construction sector constantly growing. Finally, we are also highly committed to reducing informality levels in the industry, because the construction industry is a significant generator of employment in Colombia.</p><div class="quote">“With the new PPP law, we have the right legal framework and this model is really taking off."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Indupalma's greatest achievements in the last few years?<br></h4><p>Indupalma was traditionally a producer of palm oil, as well as some other related products. Throughout the years, it has grown and positioned itself as a national leading company in terms of R&amp;D with over 2,000 workers. Some 20 years ago, our R&amp;D department developed a palm seed that resists the worst diseases. Today, we commercialize this product and sell it in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. A decade ago, the company looked into different possibilities to diversify its business activity. When we acquired the company it was close to bankruptcy. We pulled through the crisis and faced a dilemma: either to go back to the primary stages of the industry or explore the biochemistry area of the business. At that point, we started to closely work with farmers, making them owners of the business and carrying out a kind of agriculture reform in the private industry. We also sold the business model to investors. As the result of the positive evolution shown during this period, Indupalma went from being an oil producer to a company generating business and investment opportunities, and we explored several other business areas such as pension funds through investment activities. Today, the farmers under our business model generate an average of $14,000 a month, and they pay back their investment loans from the land they acquire in only 10 years. The average pension fund currently gives farmers around $6,000 a month. Therefore, the margin is significant, and we encouraged a shift in the perception of the palm tree business, which went from a mere agricultural activity to an investment opportunity.</p><h4>The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has also praised your model as a clear example to follow for other companies. What does that recognition mean for you?</h4><p>We are pleased with that recognition. We knocked on the IADB's doors in order to finance the project. It offered us the possibility to provide 80% of the funds, and we would need to assume the remaining 20%. However, we declined the offer, based on the fact that when developing such projects with farmers that before did not have a penny, if we own 20% of the company, they would always be wary of our intentions. In addition, they would always rely on the resources of a larger company like Indupalma to overcome any economic setback. The value and warranty of the project resides in other elements, as we provide technical and business support to farmers to run agribusiness enterprises on their own, and we buy their final production in accordance to international prices. After that setback, we temporally shelved the project, and later on we were able to implement them thanks to the acquisition of land by Indupalma. The exercise has been extremely successful, because everyone has been able to pay back their loans within 10 years instead of the 14 first planned.</p><h4>What are your main investment lines for 2013?</h4><p>In Magdalena Medio, we developed a new extracting plant and a company named Oro Rojo, which started operating in late December 2012. This is a palm fruit processing plant that produces raw oil. Following this example, we are about to open another processing plant to produce biodiesel, and we foresee the construction of two other processing plants to supply oils for the food industry, as well as sulfated methyl ester, a key raw material to produce biodegradable detergent. One of these production facilities will be operating soon, and the other one will be opened in two year's time. These facilities are essential for the development of the cluster Indupalma aims at developing; Oro Rojo is based in a free trade zone, and we want to attract more investment to develop palm tree production activities that will supply our processing plants in the area, which has traditionally based its agriculture activity on livestock.</p><div class="quote">“Today, the farmers under our business model generate an average of $14,000 a month."</div><p>We also plan to develop a large project of 20,000 hectares of palm trees in the Meta region. In total, 10,000 trees will be under Indupalma's control, and the remaining 10,000 will be owned and operated by third parties. We expect to see major developments in the rubber segment of our activities in the near future, as we will plant 35,000 hectares.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Between January and November 2011, Colombian exports to Uruguay registered an 18% increase in year-on-year terms. How do you assess the economic relations between both countries?<br></h4><p>Colombia and Uruguay must deepen their economic relations, which have been historically reduced. For example, Uruguay doesn't buy oil or coffee from Colombia, and Colombia doesn't buy meat from Uruguay, and we are in a very specific moment for the expansion of world trade. The emergence of the Asian giants and the financial economic crisis that has affected industrialized nations created a handful of opportunities for our countries, which have seen sustained growth in the price of commodities. We must make the most of the juncture to diversify our exports not only in terms of markets, but also in terms of products. We can't repeat the same mistakes from the past and limit ourselves to being providers of raw materials. We must incorporate the labor of our people into what we export. For that to happen, we need to encourage commercial exchange between countries in the region.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>MERCOSUR and the Andean countries signed an agreement at the Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración (ALADI) congress in 2004. That agreement can and must be deepened by Colombia and Uruguay in terms of bilateral relations. Any agreement that we subscribe to should cover not only the exchange of material goods, but also services and investments. The two countries can complement each other in several areas. Uruguay has received a great deal of FDI over the last few years, quintupling in the last seven years and going from levels close to $330 million to over $2 billion. This process has been accentuated in the last few years, among others, through the attractive regime of investment promotion that Uruguay has, and the installation of some foreign investments of great importance.</p><h4>What are Uruguay's priorities in the region?</h4><p>The countries in the region need more than ever to join in and share a common voice in the world today, overcoming the natural weakness of our small states. The world of today is based on the interaction of big blocs and the region must act as such. We live on a continent that probably has the most natural reserves, especially in terms of food, but at the same time, it is still the most unjust place to live. Latin American countries must join together to enforce fairness and equality. We also need to join our efforts to protect these reserves, which are coveted outside the region. These are Uruguay's priorities: economic development hand-in-hand with equality, the integration of the underprivileged into social life, a secured international voice, the protection of our rights and natural resources, access to advanced technology, and the development of markets for production. We insist that we must deepen the integration between our countries.</p><div class="quote">“The world of today is based on the interaction of big blocs and the region must act as such."</div><h4>Uruguay has the presidency of MERCOSUR for the first half of 2013. What have been the benefits of being a permanent member, and why do you believe MERCOSUR should merge with Unasur?</h4><p>Unasur is a response from South American countries to the needs of integration. It was born from the urgent need to tend to topics that should not be postponed and that can't be resolved by countries in isolation. At the same time, it has played a key role in the resolution of political crises inside some countries and problems raised between them. In the case of Venezuela and Colombia, the role played by the then Secretary of Unasur, Néstor Kirchner, was very important. Unasur emerged also from the convergence of the deepest integrated processes that maintain their validity: the Andean Pact and MERCOSUR. Unasur encompasses of the 12 countries South America. It is a political arena and more ambitious in the long term, but it is also less deep in terms of economic integration. Unasur emerged clearly from the necessity to develop maximum unity, respecting the diversity in all of its member states. The different processes of cooperation between our countries sometimes overlap. I understand that their existence responds to realities that must be taken into account.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the significance for Colombia of the Sixth Summit of the Americas celebrated in Cartagena in 2012?<br></h4><p>The Sixth Summit of the Americas gave us the opportunity to propose to the countries of the region to concentrate on advancing the achievements of the two hemispheres, mainly integration and comprehensive development. Our proposals were widely supported by member states and became a concrete action plan for the Americas in the coming years. The Cartagena Summit will also be remembered as the first continental meeting to hold, at the highest level, an open and frank exchange of views on the most divisive issues on the Americas' agenda. In Cartagena, the hemispheric political dialogue gained a new dimension. Among others, and as a result of it, the Organization of American States (OAS) is preparing an analytical study on the region's current antidrug policy and on existing alternatives to give more strength and effectiveness to our fight against this scourge.</p><h4>What have been your Ministry's major accomplishments over the past two years and what are your priorities for 2013?</h4><p>Over the past two-and-a-half years, we have implemented a policy of reaching out to new partners in Central Asia and the Pacific as well as expanding the thematic issues and areas of exchange and cooperation with our traditional partners. Likewise, we have focused on two social programs and the economic impact on small municipalities bordering our neighboring countries. These are the Border Plan for Prosperity and the Children and Youth Opportunities Program. Our priorities for 2013 are developing these approaches both with our traditional and new partners, enhancing our work in Colombia's territories in the Caribbean basin, strengthening our cooperation with Central America and the Caribbean, reinforcing our partnerships with Latin American countries, and consolidating the Pacific Alliance as a pragmatic partnership that will bring major benefits to all the economies involved.</p><h4>How would you assess bilateral relations between the US and Colombia and in what areas is there more potential for cooperation?</h4><p>We have had, for many years, a special relationship with the US. Our successes in combatting major global challenges in Colombia are also their successes due to the commitment and cooperation of successive US governments. During this administration, we have sought to expand the items for dialogue and exchange. From an almost monothematic agenda, we have now strengthened our areas of cooperation in the agriculture and energy sectors as well as in science and technology and the environment and sustainability. They are all essential for our development and the creation of prosperity.</p><h4>What has been the most important change in Colombian society in recent years?</h4><p>Since the beginning, I have strived to highlight the positive environment of our new reality and the opportunities it can offer to both Colombians and the world. This is a challenge, as there is a problem of perception within the international system related to our past realities, which we have been able to overcome in many aspects. But indeed, the major challenge is for Colombians to feel that they are on an equal footing with nationals of any other country, after having been stigmatized for so many years. This change in our own attitude is essential in order to explore new regions and markets and feel confident about our strengths in human capital, as an investment destination, and also the quality and competitiveness of our industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, the UK Foreign Secretary William Hague launched the Canning Agenda—a drive to reverse a long-standing British tendency to underestimate Latin America and neglect its huge opportunities.<br></p><p>Colombia has been a clear case in point, and a country with which we have been determined to work more diligently. We have a long-standing relationship with Colombia that has supported the country's transition from being described as close to a failing state 20 years ago, to a modern, dynamic, and progressive economy in 2012—particularly in security matters. Our relationship is now starting to develop even further, and together we have made big strides toward a more mature and wide-ranging relationship.</p><p>A major step along the way was President Santos' Guest of Government visit to the UK in November 2011, during which he inspired many people with his vision to transform Colombia. The visit also helped to develop a close working relationship between our two governments, reflected ever since through a series of ministerial exchanges on issues such as education, science and innovation, climate change, and human rights. We have also developed a close partnership on global challenges, notably during Colombia's time as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and around the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012. Throughout, we have found Colombia to be a particularly constructive partner on a wide range of foreign policy issues, and we are pleased that Colombia is now taking on more of a leadership role across Latin America.</p><div class="quote">“Overall trade between our two countries reached a record level of £1.68 billion in 2011 and UK exports of goods and services to Colombia rose by 45% compared to 2010."</div><p>The UK has also been championing Colombia's bid to become a full member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as part of an agreed accession process. We welcome the Colombian government's strong leadership to achieve OECD standards. We see this process as an important opportunity not only to support Colombia's transformation into a more competitive and open economy, but also to make the OECD a stronger and more globally relevant institution. I am delighted that we have been offering technical assistance where appropriate, including in areas such as fiscal transparency and anti-bribery legislation. We have also helped with the establishment of a National Contact Point as part of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to encourage adherence by businesses to international standards of business ethics.</p><p>British companies are being alerted to Colombia's impressive growth rates and by its unwavering commitment to trade liberalization and investor protection. Colombia looks set to become an even better place to do business if, as we hope, the EU-Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is ratified over the coming months and as the Pacific Alliance trading bloc continues to develop. Given this encouraging backdrop, it is perhaps little surprise that overall trade between our two countries reached a record level of £1.68 billion in 2011 and UK exports of goods and services to Colombia rose by 45% compared to 2010.</p><p>The UK is the second largest investor in Colombia after the US, with recorded investments of over $5 billion over the last 10 years. This investment is primarily concentrated in the services, beverages, and extractive (oil and mining) sectors. Many of the British companies present in Colombia are seen as pioneers in responsible business practices, and we will continue to offer support to their efforts. The UK is also funding a number of projects involving UK companies and local NGOs to promote and implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p><p>The Colombia of today is a place of great dynamism and optimism. It is therefore encouraging that so many influential British people and organizations are overcoming outdated stereotypes about the country and are finding such imaginative opportunities for collaboration. The UK government will do all that it can to facilitate further such exchanges and to support President Santos in his drive to transform Colombia. Given how much we have achieved over the last two years, it is clear that we have only just scratched the surface of the wealth of opportunities that exist for us to work together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of the recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and EU for Colombia?</h4><p>The signing of the FTA with the US, which took effect in May 2011, and the agreement with the EU, which we expect to enter into force in 2013, are both milestones in the history of our foreign trade. These are our main economic partners, and they are two of the most dynamic economies in the world. They represent great opportunities for our exporters of goods and services. As a result of the FTA with the US, expectations point to the creation of 500,000 new jobs and, based on quantitative studies, an increase in GDP of between 0.5% and 1%. It is also projected that in the five years following the implementation of the agreement, the economy will grow an extra percentage point and unemployment will be lowered by two points. As for the EU, we will be able to access 27 countries, with over 503 million inhabitants and an average consumption per capita of $34,000, which is four times that of Colombia. This gives an idea as to the EU's purchasing power. Trade, FDI, and tourism with the EU and the US have shown significant dynamics. Between January and September 2012, exports from Colombia to the US grew 6.7%, and the trade balance showed a surplus of $6.64 billion. Also in this period, 20.9% of foreign visitors who entered Colombia came from there. Regarding FDI from the US to Colombia, it reached $268 million, excluding the oil sector, in 1H2012. As for the EU, Colombia's exports to this bloc grew 4.1% in the first nine months of 2012, which yielded a positive trade balance of over $1.19 billion. During this period, 16.9% (199,645) of the foreign visitors that entered the country came from the EU.</p><h4>What are the prospects for FTAs with other nations, and in what areas does Colombia need to improve to make the FTA boom successful?</h4><p>We have set the goal of having a total of 18 FTAs by 2014. On this front, we have concluded negotiations with South Korea, and we are continuing negotiations with Israel, Turkey, Costa Rica, and Panama. We have also advanced contacts for the start of negotiations with Japan, the Dominican Republic, Australia, and China, among other countries. Moreover, we aim to advance further through agreements with the Pacific Alliance, the countries of the Northern Triangle of Central America, and Uruguay so as to improve the integration of Latin America. These agreements will open up great opportunities for the producers of goods and services in an expanded market of 1.5 billion inhabitants. We are also making great efforts to improve competitiveness in all of the areas that this concerns, such as in road infrastructure and the renovation of seaports and airports, among others. To this end, the Santos administration has announced significant investment over the short and medium term. Furthermore, another major challenge is to achieve real access for our products, especially those of agribusiness. Here, we have been working on an agenda to meet the eligibility requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards, which have included the Agricultural Institute of Colombia and Invima. In respect to trade promotion and making the best use of our trade agreements, we have been strengthening programs and initiatives that aim to manage and develop the best conditions of access. To this end, we have relied on the support of Proexport, which has been conducting outreach programs and facilitating export and investment activities.</p><h4>What are Colombia's advantages as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>Today, Colombia has become one of the best countries regarding the protection of foreign investment, and herein is the reason for our boom in this indicator. According to reports from the Banco de la República, as of November 2, 2012, over $14.16 billion had entered the country. This is an increase of 12.9% when compared to the same period last year, which came in at over $11.52 billion. Other significant factors that have contributed to this good performance include the progress that we have made in our agenda of trade and investment agreements, and the improvements that have been made in our business climate, as well as the excellent management that Proexport has shown in promoting the country as a destination that is well suited for the creation of companies. As for our investment goals, we seek to have 16 international agreements in force, which means 10 more than the six that this administration has already begun. These new countries include Canada, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), India, the US, China, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Turkey, and the EU. During this administration, we aim to establish stable rules for investment with these countries.</p><div class="quote">“The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism has established clear goals, which include boosting the nation's non-mining/non-energy exports to roughly $20 billion."</div><h4>In what sectors are you seeing increasing activity and from which markets?</h4><p>Over 2012, we observed that the commerce, restaurant, and hotel sectors were the most attractive to foreign investors. In the first half of 2012, they received $811 million in foreign investment, which is $202 million more than in the same period in 2011. Other sectors that have been gaining ground include oil, mining, and quarrying (including coal), agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, electricity, gas, and water, as well as financial and business services. By country of origin, during the first half of 2012, the top investors in Colombia (excluding the oil sector) were Chile ($386.9 million), Anguilla ($315.6 million), the US ($268 million), Panama ($233.9 million), Bermuda ($212.3 million), the UK ($171.9 million), Canada ($115.8 million), Brazil ($92.8 million), Peru ($83.9 million), and the Netherlands ($82.8 million).</p><h4>What is your outlook for the performance of the Colombian economy in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>The Colombian economy is on a solid track, and we aim to keep up this positive performance over the coming years. To this end, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism has established clear goals, which include boosting the nation's non-mining/non-energy exports to roughly $20 billion, half of which will be from the 16 high-potential sectors that are currently enrolled in the Productive Transformation Program (PTP), as well as gaining preferential access to a market of over 1.3 billion consumers through our various trade agreements that are in place, signed, or under negotiation. And, of course, we aim to welcome over 3.6 million foreign visitors to the  country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, it is not news to say that Colombia has been putting its house in order. Politically, the country is far more stable and new peace negotiations with the FARC are raising renewed hopes of further progress. Social indicators have continued to improve, with nearly 1.2 million Colombians lifted out of poverty or extreme poverty between 2010 and 2011.<br></p><p>By 2011, the country set a series of records for job generation, FDI, and export growth while keeping inflation under control. In 2012, following an impressive jump in GDP of 5.9% in 2011, Colombia's tax revenues were up an additional 30%.</p><p>More to its credit, Colombia has been making these gains in the midst of an unfavorable international context. The global economy and market sentiment continue to be subdued, encumbered by the eurozone debt crisis, the slow recovery of the US economy, and concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in emerging markets, most notably China.</p><div class="quote">“The tax system could benefit from becoming fairer and simpler, while raising more revenues."</div><p>There are many factors that help explain Colombia's remarkable advances, but there is one that we at the World Bank find particularly significant and not sufficiently advertised; its fiscal soundness. Through a series of prudent fiscal reforms, Colombia has helped erect a kind of protective perimeter—a fiscal fence—that should ensure the sustainability and protection of Colombia's recent progress.</p><p>To appreciate the significance of this fiscal fence, it is useful to consider how Colombia laid its foundation. Following the introduction of a new constitution in 1991, the size of government started to expand. Much needed public spending in health, education, and justice, however, was not matched with a commensurate rise in revenues. By the end of the 1990s, fiscal sustainability in Colombia was uncertain; central government debt was rising fast, and local governments were over-indebted.</p><p>Starting in the early 2000s, successive governments embarked on fiscal adjustment. The sovereign debt trajectory was brought under control in part through a series of revenue-raising tax reforms and changes to subnational transfers. Fiscal rules were introduced for departments and municipalities to rein in fiscal discipline. Medium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks were implemented at a national level to help strengthen the overall direction of fiscal policy. Debt management was also shrewd, including the reduction of currency mismatch and increased use of fixed-rate paper with extended (and cheaper) maturities.</p><p>Toward the end of the 2000s, new challenges emerged: royalties paid to subnational entities were negligible in size. Buoyed by high international prices, Colombia was becoming an oil and mining nation and royalties stood to rise to 2%-3% of GDP in the coming decades. Royalties were often poorly spent and only benefitted a few producing regions.</p><p>As President Santos came to office, the first major fiscal reform that he embarked on was the development of a new royalties system, which entered into effect in 2012. In brief, all departments and municipalities now benefit from these revenues, some of which are prudently saved in a fund while global prices remain high.</p><p>While the fiscal framework had been strengthened at the national level, important challenges remained. Most importantly there were no clear targets for fiscal policy and the fiscal course could be changed by the stroke of a pen by any given minister of finance. At the same time, oil and mining revenues were rising and there were concerns about how and when to spend a possible oil bonanza of the central government.</p><p>Over the past two years, the World Bank has increasingly tied its support to the government's fiscal reforms. Budget support worth a total of $500 million has provided a cheaper alternative to bond financing.From the perspective of the World Bank, Colombia is the new frontier where innovative financial and knowledge solutions are piloted.</p><p>Going forward, Colombia continues to face important fiscal challenges. The tax system could benefit from becoming fairer and simpler, while raising more revenues. The pension system needs wider coverage and enhanced equity, which will strain public finances. The health insurance system requires additional fiscal and financial reforms to sustain close to universal and equitable coverage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, Canada and Colombia are celebrating 60 years of full diplomatic relations at a time when our bilateral relations are stronger than ever before. In Colombia, Canada has a friend and a key partner spanning the three goals of Canada's “whole-of-government" engagement in the Americas: increasing economic opportunity, addressing insecurity, and advancing freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, as well as strengthening our relationships and partnerships in the hemisphere. Our links with Colombia are many, from our recent bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) to Canadian peace and security programs in Colombia, defense cooperation, an agreement to undertake joint anti-narcotics capacity building in Central America, and cooperation in multilateral organizations.<br></p><p>I have personally had the privilege of visiting Colombia twice since becoming Minister of State of Foreign Affairs responsible for the Americas. For his part, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has undertaken three official visits to Colombia. What we have consistently encountered is a strong and committed partner that is building prosperity by embracing open markets. At the same time, I can see Colombia working to overcome the remaining hurdles on the path to peace as it addresses the challenges of the long-standing internal armed conflict.</p><p>Our two countries are building mutual prosperity through trade, investment, and closer commercial relationships. Since 2011, Canada and Colombia have benefitted from a modern FTA that goes far beyond trade in goods and services, with commitments on the environment and labor. Two-way merchandise trade reached a record high of $1.6 billion in 2011 and is poised to post significant gains in 2012. Canadian investors are flocking to Colombia, not only in the oil and gas sector and mining exploration, where Canada is the largest international investor, but also in other areas, such as financial services.</p><p>As Canada's presence in Colombia grows, we are actively engaged in promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). Since 2009, Canada has employed a CSR Counselor for the Extractive Sector to review the practices of Canadian companies operating abroad and to advise on the implementation of performance standards. Furthermore, the Canadian embassy in Bogotá is actively promoting the implementation of Canada's CSR Strategy for the International Extractive Sector. For its part, the Canada-Colombia Chamber of Commerce has an active committee on CSR.</p><p>There can be no question; Colombia is an emerging market with many advantages: high levels of education, a strong sense of entrepreneurship, abundant natural resources, and a robust financial sector. We are confident Colombia is committed to taking the appropriate steps to sustain an environment conducive to economic growth. We know Colombia is working to develop its infrastructure both to serve its people and for commercial reasons, and it is committed to maintaining the security gains made during the past decade, all of which should not downplay Colombia's ongoing challenges, particularly with regard to human rights and the security situation. While much progress has been made, much work remains to be done.</p><p>This is why Canada is pleased to support these endeavors through funding and programming supplied in partnership with the Colombian government, representatives of civil society, the international community, and multilateral organizations. Since 2006, our government has provided over C$100 million to Colombia on development programming focusing on the rights and humanitarian needs of indigenous groups, internally displaced persons, and children and youth, as well as C$30 million to support initiatives on transitional justice, protecting the rights of victims of the internal conflict, supporting mine action, and enhancing security and stability. We firmly believe that increased cooperation with Colombia, including through our FTA, enables us to share our values of respect for freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, while enhancing economic opportunity both in Colombia and in Canada. It is upon strong economic foundations that responsible governments can build strong democratic governance and security.</p><p>Five years after Prime Minister Harper first made the Americas a foreign policy priority, Canada's engagement in the hemisphere has never been stronger. Colombia is at the forefront of this effort. Looking to the future, I am confident that Canada and Colombia will work ever more closely to increase economic opportunity in both our countries through trade and investment, and at the same time continue to support the pursuit of peace, security, and respect for human rights.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The defense partnership between the US and Colombia has been strong, remains strong, and will continue to be strong in the future. Both of our nations are committed to deepening our cooperation even further.<br></p><p>Over these last decades of very close cooperation, Colombia has built one of the world's most advanced military and police forces and has accomplished an historic transition. In the last few years alone, Colombia has moved from a nation under siege from guerillas, drug-trafficking mafias, and paramilitary groups to a country that is a force for security and prosperity in South America. That is a tribute; a tribute to the strength, fortitude, and above all sacrifice of the Colombian military and the Colombian people.</p><p>In particular, Colombia has made significant progress in its campaign against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). I want to commend Minister Pinzón and the Colombian armed forces for their efforts against this terrorist group. The Colombian people have expended a great deal of precious blood and treasure in their campaign against the FARC, and as a result the FARC has been seriously weakened.</p><div class="quote">“During President Obama's visit to Colombia, he and President Santos signed a new Regional Security Assistance Cooperation Action Plan."</div><p>The US stands in solidarity with Colombia in its campaign against the FARC, and we will continue to provide training, equipment, and assistance that Colombia has requested in order to defeat this common enemy. Colombia is planning to receive 17 Black Hawk helicopters between December 2012 and January 2014 to help its efforts against the FARC.</p><p>It's a testament that the progress Colombia has made in resolving its internal security challenges has really helped bring together our relationship and our cooperation on regional security challenges, particularly those emanating from Central America. Our two nations both understand that our security depends on stability; not just within our borders but beyond our borders. And there is a great deal of potential for our two militaries to work closely to help build the capacity of other nations in this region to address these security challenges.</p><p>To that end, in April 2011, during President Obama's visit to Colombia, he and President Santos signed a new Regional Security Assistance Cooperation Action Plan. Minister Pinzón and I have discussed the next steps that we can take within the framework of this plan to achieve our shared desire of a secure, stable, and prosperous Western Hemisphere. We are working with our State Department colleagues to move forward with this plan.</p><p>One of the specific steps we debated was the establishment of a state partnership program between Colombia and our own National Guard. This program has helped deepen our defense cooperation with other partners in the region, including Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. The South Carolina National Guard will be partnering with the Colombian Ministry of Defense to share knowledge, exchange expertise, and develop an action plan moving forward.</p><p>State partnership programs have helped us share lessons learned and expertise that has been shared for disaster response and other missions where the armed forces can provide critical support to our civil authorities.</p><p>The Colombian armed forces already have tremendous experience and expertise in disaster preparedness and extensive experience dealing with floods and other natural disasters. The establishment of a state partner program represents an opportunity to further enhance our capabilities in this area and represents an important new avenue for defense cooperation.</p><p>Colombia is one of our closest partners in the hemisphere and an emerging regional and global leader. In the new defense strategy that we established in the US, one of the key elements is to develop innovative security partnerships around the world. The kind of partnership that we have here in Colombia is an example of the kind of training exercises assistance that we hope to be able to develop elsewhere as well.</p><p>What Colombia has done is a tribute to the strong partnership we have built—a defense partnership that has endured for more than 60 years and which has helped bring stability and prosperity to both of our great nations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the US-Colombian commercial relationship?</h4><p>The US-Colombia commercial relationship is very promising as a result of the entry-into-force of our trade agreement on May 15, 2012. This marks the beginning of a new chapter for both countries in terms of trade and investment. Both of our economies gain from trade. For example, Colombia is a large importer of grains from the US, while it exports a number of tropical fruits to our country. Also, US cotton, yarn, and fabric exports to Colombia are used in many apparel items that Colombia exports to the US. Now that our trade agreement has entered into force, key US exports receive duty-free access to Colombia, including most products in agriculture and construction equipment, aircraft and parts, auto parts, fertilizers and agro-chemicals, IT equipment, medical and scientific equipment, and wood. With more than 46 million consumers, Colombia is a fast-growing market for US businesses. Even before May 15, Colombia was the third largest market for US exports in South and Central America, with over $14 billion in US exports in 2011.</p><h4>What advantages does Colombia offer US investors?</h4><p>Colombia offers a level playing field for US investors. Our trade agreement provides guarantees that US companies in Colombia are protected against discriminatory or unlawful treatment, and it grants them recourse to a neutral and transparent mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes. Colombia also offers US investors a prime location for international trade. Colombia is the only country in South America that has coasts on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, which gives it a shipping advantage in today's global market. Aided by major security improvements, steady economic growth, and moderate inflation, Colombia has become a free market economy with major commercial and investment ties to the US, the EU, Asia, and Latin America. The past 10 years have brought extraordinary change to the country in terms of economic development and improvements in national safety and security. The political stability, growing middle class, and improved security have created an economic boom in Colombia that has lessened the impact of the global economic crisis.</p><h4>What will be the medium-term impact of the recently ratified FTA between Colombia and the US?</h4><p>In the medium term, this comprehensive trade agreement will eliminate all tariffs on US exports to Colombia, which will promote further economic growth and continue the expansion of trade between our two countries. A US International Trade Commission study estimates that US exports to Colombia will be $1.1 billion higher once the trade agreement is fully implemented, supporting thousands of additional American jobs. The US Department of Agriculture has projected that American farmers and ranchers can expect to see their exports grow by more than $370 million, or more than one-third of the current total. One challenge lies in the area of Colombian infrastructure, which President Santos has committed to addressing through an investment and infrastructure plan. However, this also presents an exciting opportunity for US infrastructure-related exporters as well as construction and engineering companies seeking to expand their businesses.</p><div class="quote">“The political stability, growing middle class, and improved security have created an economic boom in Colombia."</div><h4>What is the potential of Colombia to become an export platform to other Latin American countries with which the US does not have FTAs?</h4><p>It is clear that the Colombian government has embarked on an ambitious agenda of concluding trade deals with many partners around the globe. Securing such access for Colombian exports would certainly make the country a more attractive investment destination.</p><h4>The US is Colombia's largest trading partner, representing about 42% of Colombia's exports and 26% of its imports as of November 2011. What is your outlook for US-Colombian trade levels in the medium term?</h4><p>We expect a substantial increase in US exports to Colombia across many sectors. While the US-Colombia Agreement only went into effect in the middle of May 2012, our trade data already shows that US goods exports are up 28% compared to those of May 2011. In addition, the Open-Skies aviation agreement was fully in place in January 2013. This gives US and Colombian airlines further flexibility to transport additional goods and passengers between the two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Colombia to UK business?<br></h4><p>British exports of goods and services to Colombia in 2011 were worth £698 million, following an average increase over two years of more than 60%. Services in particular have grown rapidly and now represent more than half of that figure. In 2012, for the first time, Colombia overtook Argentina as an export market. While this is good progress, Colombia remains a market where we could be doing more. Countries such as South Africa or Thailand generate a lot more exports despite being only slightly larger economies.</p><h4>Colombia is the UK's fifth largest export market in South America. How do you assess the British-Colombian commercial relationship?</h4><p>Data from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) shows that in 2011 Colombia moved just ahead of Argentina to fourth in the region. More importantly, it is a relationship that has grown rapidly, more than doubling within two years. While this is positive, there is still much more to do and Colombia offers opportunities in a wide range of sectors where the UK has expertise, for example infrastructure and education.</p><h4>What is the level of integration of British companies in Colombia?</h4><p>The UK is the second largest investor in Colombia after the US. These investments are concentrated in beverages (in particular SABMiller's purchase of Bavaria in 2005), mining, and the insurance sector. However, we have seen increasing diversification of British investment, one example being the arrival of Mothercare in 2011.</p><div class="quote">“We set a goal to double two-way trade from the 2009 level by 2015. We are already almost there."</div><h4>Which key trade trends and potential areas for investment can you identify for UK companies in Colombia?</h4><p>We expect trade to continue to grow, with the fastest growth likely to be in services. Infrastructure offers the greatest prize with large investments expected from the government in transport and social infrastructure—estimated to be up to $100 billion. This offers significant opportunities for UK engineering, project management and advisory firms. The UK's experience in public-private partnerships (PPPs), with 20 years of accumulated knowledge, is of particular interest to the Colombians. But there are opportunities elsewhere, including the nascent offshore oil sector, the security technology sector and traditional UK strengths in education and design.</p><h4>What makes Colombia an attractive partner for British businesses?</h4><p>Colombia has been consistently recognized as a top reformer by the World Bank in terms of improving its business environment. It now ranks, alongside Chile and Peru, as the best environment in the region. The economic regime is liberal, and following the forthcoming free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, will improve further. Colombia offers both ease of doing business, continued strong growth, and political stability.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the forthcoming FTA between Colombia and the EU, and what are its main challenges?</h4><p>The FTA will support UK exports in key sectors through lower tariffs and tackling non-tariff barriers. The spirits sector in particular—where whisky is a major UK export—will see significant improvements in the operating environment. The FTA does not pose significant economic challenges as the product mix of the EU and Colombia are broadly complementary. The FTA also contains a human-rights clause and the European Parliament has requested Colombia to provide an action plan for tackling human-rights issues, to ensure that the FTA is a force for the protection and promotion of human rights in Colombia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's economy and for UK-Colombian trade levels in the medium term?</h4><p>We set a goal to double two-way trade from the 2009 level by 2015. We are already almost there. I would expect UK exports to exceed the £1 billion mark by that stage. Colombia offers long-term growth and a population of 44 million that will be increasingly drawn into the formal economy. And with the recent announcement of a peace process to seek a end to the prolonged internal conflict, we have further reason for optimism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The three largest banking groups in Colombia, which control around 60% of the country's banking operations, are all in the hands of Colombians. What are the strengths of the Colombian financial sector, and how would you assess the interest of foreign investors in recent years?<br></h4><p>In general, Colombia's financial system has traditionally shown interesting growth and return opportunities in a stable regulatory environment. This makes it attractive for incumbent players, both local and international, and for new foreign participants alike. In particular, with regard to the Colombian financial system, there are two key points I would like to highlight. The first is strong growth. Six-year compound growth rates ranging from 15% to 20% for loans, deposits, equity, and net income are especially impressive considering this period included a global financial crisis. We expect this strong growth to continue over the medium to long term, given the positive prospects of the economy's growth, and the significant room for credit expansion in the country because of the low credit penetration of our financial system as a percentage of GDP when compared to other countries. Colombia's financial system gross loans represent 33% of GDP, lower than countries like Brazil (43%), and Chile (65%). Second, strong levels of capitalization, sound loan quality, and having gone through a mortgage crisis of our own in the late 1990s, Colombian financial institutions emerged stronger with healthy loan portfolios, with better provisioned balance sheets, and much higher levels of capitalization well above the minimums required by regulations.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind Grupo Aval's purchase of BAC Credomatic?</h4><p>Four to five years ago, Grupo Aval made the strategic decision to become a leading regional player, growing outside of Colombia. BAC Credomatic was the perfect target to launch that strategy as it provided us the leading regional player in Central America with a presence in all seven countries, in a market with strong connections to Colombia. Further, BAC Credomatic was, and continues to be, a very well-run business, with a very profitable credit card niche, and with significant growth potential both in its natural market and in new businesses arising from Colombian clients doing business in Central America. The results have proven us right. BAC's profits have grown from approximately $150 million when we acquired it in 2010, to over $260 million in 2012.</p><h4>Is Grupo Aval planning to make further acquisitions in the short term, and are there any particular markets you're looking into?</h4><p>Grupo Aval is constantly looking for acquisition opportunities to enhance and complement our financial service offerings in our current core markets of Colombia and Central America, and to expand, with a relevant presence, in new related markets. As such, under the right conditions, Grupo Aval would potentially make new acquisitions following the same rigorous process we've used successfully in the past.</p><div class="quote">“I expect the country to grow at approximately 4% in 2013."</div><h4>Colombia's financial stability has positioned it well to play a more important role nationally as well as internationally. What is your outlook for Colombia's financial sector going forward?</h4><p>Colombia's financial sector should continue to grow significantly in the medium term. The country has significant growth potential given the existing room for credit expansion to current clients and by introducing first-time users to the financial sector. Furthermore, Colombia has a strong financial regulatory environment that is constantly introducing new regulations to guarantee the strength of the bank's financial statements. This market will keep attracting new players that will increase competition and enhance value propositions to clients. Also, competition constantly makes us innovate and transform or else risk losing market share. Finally, this momentum will provide us with the resources and the competitive edge to continue the international expansion of Colombian financial institutions into relevant markets—Central America, the Caribbean, and other leading countries in South America.</p><h4>What are Grupo Aval's short-term investment plans and how do you envision the future of the group?</h4><p>In the short to medium term, Grupo Aval will be the leading regional financial player, offering, through our affiliates, the best financial services portfolio to our clients. For every financial need of a potential client in our regional markets, we strive to offer the right product and service through one of our affiliates. We will keep considering different alternatives to do so by designing those products and services in-house or by acquiring those that already provide them. In doing so, Grupo Aval's investors, both in equity and debt, will benefit as we consistently provide market-leading growth and returns. In the very short term, we will close on our latest $530 million acquisition of BBVA Horizonte, which will improve the position of our pension fund manager Porveni as the leader in Colombia.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>We are bullish about Colombia's economy. I expect the country to grow at approximately 4% in 2013 and even better in subsequent years. This growth will be accompanied by contained inflation (less than 2% in the last 12 months) moderate unemployment rates (below 10%), a positive trade balance, contained fiscal deficit, and a steady exchange rate. In the following years, Colombia will take advantage of the conditions for sustained growth it has created through macro and fiscal prudency, the Central Bank's inflation monetary policies, the reduction of our sovereign risk regaining our investment grade status, key free trade agreements (FTAs) with core markets such as the US and Europe, and improved conditions for investors. More importantly, growth will come from a diverse base involving infrastructure, oil, mining, agribusiness, services, tourism, and more. Finally, I expect that the financial sector will be a critical driver of Colombia's growth by financing infrastructure and investment projects and the needs of our consumer clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia's government approved a set of tax reforms late in 2012. How will this move the country toward prosperity and reduced inequality?<br></h4><p>MAURICIO CÁRDENAS The government has designed an innovative set of policies to achieve national prosperity by improving targeted social spending and stimulating formal job creation. This will result in a reduction of income inequality, which currently stands as one of the highest in the world. Specifically, the recently approved tax reforms generated a cut in almost half of non-wage labor costs. This will increase the competitiveness of labor-intensive sectors, which previously carried most of the burden of payroll taxes. As a result, estimates are that the reform will lead to the creation of about 1 million new formal jobs and an increase in the size of the formal sector by about 10 percentage points. Furthermore, the reforms introduced a progressive schedule for individual income taxation. The new scheme consists of the National Alternative Minimum Tax (IMAN) and the Simple Alternative Minimum Tax (IMAS). The new tax regime is designed to be paid by employees earning over $35,000 per year. At the same time, workers earning less than $17,000 per year will be exempt from paying this tax. This will generate a reduction of close to 2 percentage points in the Gini inequality index.</p><h4>At close to 10%, Colombia's unemployment rate is one of the highest in the region. How is the government addressing this issue?</h4><p>The unemployment rate has exhibited an important reduction in recent years. It currently stands at 9.6% as of December 2012, reaching the government's goal of a single-digit rate. This has been accompanied by lower unemployment rates for heads of households, which in December 2012 stood at 4.8%, the lowest level in five years. However, unemployment in Colombia is still higher than that of its Latin American peers, and informality and inequality continue to be a problem. As such, some key programs are being implemented in order to further reduce the unemployment rate and to improve the quality of existing jobs. On the one hand, the recently approved tax reform that reduces non-wage costs for firms will have a positive impact on formalization and therefore on improving the quality of jobs. On the other hand, the 2010 job creation and formalization law aims to decrease the barriers of entry into the formal sector by reducing the transaction costs of hiring workers that belong to vulnerable groups, such as unskilled workers, women above 40 years of age, displaced populations, and young workers, among others. The law gives tax incentives to firms hiring people from these groups. These measures will reduce the long-term unemployment rate and bring it closer to the regional average, which currently stands at about 7%.</p><h4>The peso jumped 10% last year and over the past decade soared 65%, more than any other emerging market currency. What measures are being taken to make it more competitive?</h4><p>Over the last few years, there has been a real appreciation of the peso as a result of improved terms of trade, a larger volume of exports, and increased FDI. It is worth mentioning that this has been a worldwide phenomenon mainly derived from the weakening of the European and US economies. Thus, the behavior of the real exchange rate has been coherent with the dynamism of the Colombian economy as well as with worldwide economic trends. The expansion in the oil and mining sector's production has been a challenge for fiscal policy in order to prevent this boom from becoming a destabilizing factor in the economy. In that sense, the contribution of the royalties system reform and the adoption of a fiscal rule on central government finances will be key. They ensure that the cyclical revenue from increased oil and mining production will be saved, both by the national and sub-national governments, thereby mitigating the real exchange rate appreciation and the risks of deindustrialization generated by the competitiveness loss in the labor-intensive tradable sectors. The main policy response could be described as increased public saving, efforts to reduce foreign borrowing, and other measures to cut production costs for the other tradable sectors in the economy to improve their competitiveness. That is how a mandatory surcharge on electricity was removed, resulting in a reduction in the average cost of production of about 5%; a tariff reform was implemented to reduce the average nominal tariff from 12.4% to 6%. This implies a reduction in the cost of raw materials for the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The government has also been working on the delicate balance of communicating adequately the different challenges the oil and mining industries face, to avoid unnecessary pessimism in a very dynamic economy but to allow agents to build informed expectations. The recent drop in coal prices is a good example of where agents should modify their expectations, which includes also the future exchange rate. On the other hand, the Central Bank recently extended the program for daily auctions to purchase foreign currency, through daily purchases of no less than $30 million until May of 2013. This represents an increase from $500 million in average monthly purchases under the previous program to no less than $750 million under the current one. In this way the country keeps cumulating international reserves to maintain the reserves-to-GDP ratio compatible with the country's financial depth and its growing participation in the global economy.</p><div class="quote">“Key programs are being implemented in order to further reduce the unemployment rate and to improve the quality of existing jobs."</div><h4>What other strategic sectors besides mining, oil, and gas will lead growth in the coming years?</h4><p>The goal of the current administration is to turn Colombia into a more competitive country with sustainable higher economic growth, while increasing the wellbeing of the population. To fully achieve this goal, the government has developed the National Development Plan based on several key areas: globalization of the economy, infrastructure development, and access to better technology. On globalization, the government has implemented measures for the modernization and diversification of the economy through the signing of free trade agreements with the US, the eurozone, and several Asian economies. These trade agreements will increase the potential market of locally produced goods and will also enhance technology adoption and thereby productivity. We have also established a master plan for infrastructure that aims at the maintenance, rehabilitation, and development of the road network. Additionally, more than $20 billion is committed through public and private-public projects, which will substantially reduce the current infrastructure gap. Regarding innovation and technology, the government has increased the amount of resources allocated for science and technology, with the earmarking of 10% of total royalties for this specific purpose. This program aims to increase exports, create jobs, and train highly qualified labor. On the basis of these three components, we expect the high contributions of the agricultural, manufacturing, and services sectors will maintain Colombia's growth rates around 5% or higher over the next five years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the milestones for Banco de la República over 2012?<br></h4><p>The primary objective of monetary policy in Colombia is to maintain price stability. The operational target of monetary policy is an annual consumer price inflation of 3%. At the same time, monetary policy is intended to keep economic growth on a sustainable path. In order to achieve these objectives, Colombia applies a countercyclical monetary policy, whereby the interest rate is raised whenever economic growth exceeds its potential or either the inflation forecast or expectations for it surpass the target. Interest rate reductions are made when the opposite conditions prevail. This helps to prevent inflationary pressures at the peak of the cycle and to avoid an excessive redundancy of resources at the bottom of it.</p><p>By the beginning of 2012, a positive output gap had been identified. Moreover, different types of credit—particularly consumer credit—were growing at a high rate. There was a risk that this situation would intensify if left unchecked and pose a risk to the achievement of the inflation target. Accordingly, during the first two months of this year, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República continued raising the policy interest rate until it attained a peak of 5.25%. This tightening started in February 2011 when the projections for both inflation and GDP growth as well as the behavior of domestic demand and consumer credit led the Board to conclude that the Colombian economy no longer needed the support of a 3% interest rate, which had been provided in the context of the international crisis of 2008-09. During the second half of 2012, economic activity started to show clear symptoms of deceleration.</p><p>The latest information shows that GDP growth in the third quarter (on an annual basis) was 2.1%, well below the economic performance observed during the first six months. Although some slowing down of the economy was expected given the previous tightening of monetary policy and the effects of the European crisis, this weakening turned out to be worse than expected. To some extent, external factors, such as weaker demand and lower prices for our commodities exports, explain this result. However, domestic factors also played an important role, with the shrinkage of public investment and private construction. Following its inherent countercyclical role, monetary policy reacted by reducing the policy interest rate to a level of 4.25% by year-end. This lower rate is expected to eventually provide a renewed stimulus to economic activity during 2013.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of the trade balance?</h4><p>We are expecting a current account deficit of around 3% of GDP in both 2012 and 2013. This is mostly explained by the moderate dynamics of Colombian exports as a result of decreasing prices and quantities due to the weak growth of the US economy—our main trading partner—and the contraction in the eurozone. Since 2004, the Colombian economy has received a substantial amount of FDI, which has increased at an average annual rate of 22% over the last six years and nowadays represents more than 4% of GDP. As a matter of fact, the strong increase in FDI is one of the main reasons behind the current account deficit in Colombia.</p><h4>What are your plans for monetary and financial policies in 2013?</h4><p>In the context of the flexible inflation targeting framework that Colombia has followed since 1999, the guidelines for monetary policy are well established and publicly known. As stated above, the Banco de la República is committed to price stability and, more precisely, to an inflation target of 3%, which the monetary authorities publicly reaffirmed for 2013. Monetary policy also seeks to maintain sustainable economic growth that is close to the potential productive capacity of the economy, which is estimated to be in a range of 4% to 5%. Accordingly, monetary policy will continue playing its key countercyclical role of avoiding situations of excess demand and providing timely support if the economy weakens. In a broader context, the recent experience of developed countries has shown that price stability is not a guarantee of financial stability. Therefore, in addition to its countercyclical role, the Banco de la República should emphasize macro-prudential issues aimed at preventing excessive risk taking by financial institutions. That is the reason the Banco de la República tries to prevent the interest rate from deviating from its “normal" level over significant and prolonged periods of time, so that it does not stimulate excessive risk taking or unsustainable increases in asset prices and in leverage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you were appointed President of Banco Caja Social, what have been your main strategic goals?<br></h4><p>I was appointed President of the bank in July 2012, and my objective is to ensure compliance with the strategic guidelines defined for the bank. This is a solid, robust institution, which for more than 100 years has focused on working for the masses through savings as a source of development and growth. In this vein of ideas, the activities for 2012 will be directed primarily toward facilitating access to banking, achieving greater penetration in the low-income segments, and providing financial solutions for SMEs.</p><h4>What were the core reasons for the rebranding exercise the bank underwent in 2011? How has this move changed your activities?</h4><p>Beyond a simple rebranding, the exercise conducted in 4Q2011 was intended to introduce to the market and clients a bank that has established itself as an indisputable leader in our country in terms of servicing its target markets, without losing its essence resulting from over 100 years of development. Hence, this change gives greater value to the defined brand attributes: the bank is friendlier; it respects and values clients; it is a good communicator; clear, consistent, transparent, and veracious; it is creative and bold; and furthermore, it makes things easier for everyone.</p><h4>How has Banco Caja Social's product portfolio evolved over the past five years, and what are your future targets?</h4><p>Our strategy is focused on consolidating our leadership in the low-income market as well as increasing our participation in housing loans, in addition to strengthening our brand attributes. In terms of products, the bank has made great efforts in the micro-enterprise and mass-client segments. We believe that savings are a driving factor in generating development. For this reason, we are experts in promoting individual savings, and we have a broad portfolio of products to meet the different needs of the Colombian people. We are focused on offering access and opportunities for growth to low-income people. Furthermore, we believe that innovation is a key element in our business.</p><div class="quote">“Banco Caja Social has increased its participation in the internet banking segment in recent years."</div><h4>What role does financial inclusion play in your overall business strategy?</h4><p>Financial inclusion is the basis of all our activities, and we are always looking at how to provide better services within this approach. We constantly strive to better understand the social and economic dynamics of the Colombian low-income segment, and believe that thanks to innovation, we can provide the social and financial tools necessary for that process. Recent studies show that only 24.6% of the adult population has a bank account in Colombia, and only 52% of them have an active bank account in urban areas. Therefore, our intent is always to provide savings tools that will promote the growth of the working class. We also have a significant presence in the housing finance business, where we have a market share of 11.5%.</p><h4>How would you assess the evolution of e-banking in Colombia?</h4><p>Banco Caja Social has increased its participation in the internet banking segment in recent years, and I believe this is a common trend within the market. E-banking contributes to reducing costs and increasing levels of so-called financial inclusion, which is very important in Colombia. For this reason, we have implemented new products and services in mobile banking and strengthened our presence in the online world through various products. Finally, banking correspondents play a key role in the penetration rates of banks in Colombia and the use of new technologies. At present, we have about 2,300 “Amigo Points," or banking correspondents, across the country, and hope to have 3,000 by the end of 2012. Nevertheless, our main objective in the medium term, in this sense, is to build a network of more than 20,000 banking correspondents.</p><h4>What are some of the key figures of your audited financials?</h4><p>In 2011, the bank's profits were around Ps160 billion. Overall, 2012 was very positive. Our portfolio is growing at an average rate of 24%. Currently, Banco Caja Social has about 4 million clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Colombian banking sector?<br></h4><p>It is a solid, competitive system and it is increasing its presence in the region. Until recently, the Colombian system has been mainly a national system. More than 70% of the sector as a whole belonged to local banks. However, in the last five years, different institutions have been entering other regions and they are now behaving as international players. The system is doing a good job dealing with the different challenges of the country in general. The economic growth that we are experiencing is a great challenge for the whole system. It is twice as big as it was five years ago. The main challenge, and maybe the main opportunity of the banking sector, is related to the fact that 40% of the population does not have any access to the system. The bancarization level of Colombia is very low, both in credit, transaction services, and insurance, which are provided by different types of non-banking institutions. Government banks are seeing this as the main challenge.</p><h4>What is Davivienda doing to bank the unbanked, and what has been your growth strategy over the past couple of years?</h4><p>This institution began as a savings and loan company in 1972, and a universal bank in 1997. It is really a young bank for the Colombian environment. Even though some banks have been here for over 100 years, we have been able to become the third largest bank in the country. We are not solely a savings and loan company anymore, but also a universal bank with a presence in Panama, the US, and Central America. We have more than 4.5 million customers in the country. Our specialization in mainly low-income mortgages allows us to be closer to the base of the pyramid. We have won a bid to participate in the dispersion of subsidies that the central government will give to close to 2.5 million families on a monthly basis. With this initiative, we could gain another 1 million customers who might be willing to make payments not just via ATMs or Davivienda branches, but also in more than 700 different cities and towns nationwide. Davivienda charges the government when it disperses money and charges companies when they pay wages, but the people who receive the money and want to use it do not get charged. The company is also working on offering people different kinds of micro insurance, micro savings, and maybe in the future micro credits.</p><h4>Davivienda plans to double the profitability of its recent acquisition of HSBC in Central America in two years. What was the strategy behind this acquisition?</h4><p>We have two different strategies. Those HSBC banks are charged by their headquarters and have expenses related to supervision and different services provided by their headquarters. We will support those operations, but without the charges. Davivienda expects growth of almost 10% in 2013. In three years we expect to be able to have maybe a 12% return on equity (ROE) for our operations in Central America.</p><div class="quote">“The system is doing a good job dealing with the different challenges of the country in general."</div><h4>What is Davivienda's position in the Colombian market?</h4><p>In personal and individual banking, we are probably the largest player. We are first in mortgages and first in the business of loans and credit cards. We are third in automobile loans and we have about an 18% market share in consumer loans. We are third in commercial banking and Davivienda is the top private bank in agricultural banking. Our operations are quite small when it comes to SMEs, but we do see an opportunity in that segment because we have a relationship with more than 65,000 different companies in the country. We have about 6% of the market and we expect to be closer to 12% soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Colombian Securities Exchange (BVC) contributed to the domestic economy over the past seven years?<br></h4><p>We are convinced that the capital markets and the stock exchange at the center of the capital markets have a very important role to play. They provide the right environment for companies to raise capital, be it through actual capital or funding in the bond market. They can also provide diversified investment alternatives to individual investors, both institutional investors and retail investors. Retail investors are very important, and we are tailoring the development of new products for all investors. We are convinced that a well functioning capital market will contribute to the competitiveness of the Colombian economy by reducing the cost of capital to Colombian corporations and making available not only liquidity, but also risk management instruments for Colombian corporations. What we have been doing over the last seven years is completing the infrastructure of the market, such as setting up clearing houses and central counterparties (CCP) and creating a derivatives market so companies can hedge their financial risks and promote retail distribution products like an electronic trading system (ETS) for investors. The Colombian Securities Exchange has promoted internet trading so that retail investors can access the market. We have promoted the creation of private equity funds in Colombia. We have a global outreach program to inform companies and make them aware of the benefits the capital markets have to offer.</p><h4>What are you doing to attract more local companies to list?</h4><p>We have an outreach program called Colombia Capital. It is an initiative in partnership with many other players that are interested in directing the capital markets such as the Association of Pension Funds, the Association of Entrepreneurs, the Chambers of Commerce, and many other groups that are interested in the capital markets. The idea of this initiative is to reach out to companies all over the country. Colombia has seven cities that are medium or large in size, and that have very large, consolidated corporate sectors. They have the size and the sophistication to be participants in the capital markets. They just need us to disseminate knowledge, let everybody know what the benefits are, what the costs are, what it entails to be an issuer in the market, what the corporate governance issues there are, what “reporting" means, and how much extra work it entails. I think that the financial crisis of 2008 —which I believe was not felt here in Colombia—was a good example of why you need to be diversified in your financing. What you are seeing here is that commercial paper funding or bank financing can shut down overnight. If you had planned to invest or grow over the next two years, then there is no working capital, not to mention long-term financing. Accessing the capital markets opens up financing alternatives.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in the medium to long term?</h4><p>Colombia is in a very fortunate position; the country has been doing things very well both on the economic front and on the investment side over the past 10 years. That has created a very good investment environment and confidence. Given that we had very limited investment over many years, there is a gap to fill—particularly in regards to infrastructure. The plan for the next 10 years is very aggressive in terms of road infrastructure, ports, and airports. That is going to draw most of the investment in the country. Mining, oil, and gas have been attracting a lot of investment over the past few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Allianz Seguros operates in over 70 countries worldwide. What does Colombia represent to the company's overall business activity?<br></h4><p>We first arrived in Colombia in 1999 through a takeover, and over a period of two years we completed the acquisition process. We decided to enter the Colombian market because we saw it as strategic for the entire region, which today shows the strongest and most sustained growth in the world. Overall, I would say that Colombia, along with Brazil, is one of the two main markets for our company in Latin America. For example, in Colombia we will close 2012 with over 20% growth if analyzed in terms of the three or four main segments in which we operate: 40% in motor, over 30% in life, and 15% in health. Our predictions show that the sector will continue to grow at a fast pace over the next five years. In addition, we can talk about a general phenomenon in the entire region, which is particularly affecting Colombia; the low penetration rate of insurance products. In Colombia, the insurance penetration rate is around 1.8% of GDP, and this figure is very low when compared to other countries in the region. For example, in Chile the figure reaches 4% of GDP. I believe this situation perfectly explains why today the region and Colombia are rapidly developing. Overall, we have to keep in mind that Colombia is among the top-three economies in the region, enjoys a very stable political and legal framework for investors—one of the highest in Latin America—and has a large population in constant demographic expansion. Colombia has changed over the last decade and Allianz sees this country as a leading economic power in the region.</p><h4>What was the business strategy behind the rebranding exercise of Colseguros, a company that today operates under the Allianz name?</h4><p>Allianz Seguros is a company highly committed to respecting the local markets where it operates or plans to enter. In this regard, we took our time to understand the cultural heritage and working culture of Colseguros as part of our process of better understanding the market in which we operate. Such a move was highly appreciated by the Colombian market, and along with our strong commitment to the development of the country, put us in a favorable position. It took us around 12 years to complete the process, and that speaks out on its own about our intentions in Colombia.</p><h4>How has the company's product portfolio evolved over the last five years, and what kind of products has Allianz brought into the Colombian market?</h4><p>It is hard to trace an evolution of our product portfolio, because we have to keep in mind that the levels of product innovation in our industry are limited. Overall, I can tell you that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our attitude. We believe that the market can expand because there is an insurance culture in Colombia that differs from what most of the people think and it is just a matter of making the products accessible to consumers and creating effective distribution, which is what we are focusing on. Therefore, I can tell you that Allianz is bringing high levels of innovation in distribution and technology in order to make products more accessible.</p><div class="quote">“We decided to enter the Colombian market because we saw it as strategic for the entire region."</div><h4>In your opinion, why does Colombia not enjoy a higher penetration rate for insurance products?</h4><p>We are convinced that it is all because of the lack of access to insurance information and insurance products, because there is an insurance culture in this country. For example, compulsory health insurance covers around 98% of the population. We just need to find alternative channels to boost accessibility, which Allianz has succeeded in thanks to its commitment to innovate in the distribution area. The industry is constantly growing, regardless of economic downturns, and I expect that the insurance sector will finish 2012 with a growth rate of 15%. We have to keep in mind that Colombia is a very dynamic economy in which the middle class sector is growing very fast. That factor is driving the growth of industries like ours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We have clients in sectors such as construction, energy, health, and education, among others.</p><h4>What is Positiva's value-added for its clients?</h4><p>During our four years of operations, we have carried out several research-oriented reports on what our customers appreciate the most from Positiva. Satisfaction with the service is among the most valued; over 85% of our clients are satisfied. In this regard, they appreciate our experience in risk prevention, the solvency levels of our company—Ps1 billion of patrimony and assets above Ps4.5 billion, the highest in the industry—the innovation and diversification of our product portfolio, and the level of new technologies.</p><h4>What role do micro insurance products play in your overall activity?</h4><p>Since we have state participation, we always aim to have a strong social character. Today, we have around 50,000 low-income families insured through micro insurance products. At the same time, we aim at continuing to improve our services in this segment, because our goal is to reach 2 million families. I honestly believe that such tools are key to contribute to the social and economic development of low-income families in Colombia. In this regard, we have to talk about the so-called periodic economic benefits; of the 20 million Colombian workers, only 8 million are insured by social security, and therefore there are 12 million people who belong to the informal labor market that cannot access pensions when they retire. Through the periodic economic benefits, we aim at increasing the access to pensions of Colombian workers through an economic effort they must commit themselves to—the government will also contributes to this—and by saving some money during their working life, they can ensure that they will get a pension when they retire. Positiva is one of the insurance companies that is taking part in the development of such a project by implementing products and strategies to achieve this goal.</p><h4>Does Positiva have any plans to internationalize its operations?</h4><p>In the short term, we do not have any plans. However, among our strategic business development plans, we aim at expanding activities abroad, and to export our expertise in fields such as risk management. In this regard, we have been looking at Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. In addition, we believe we have a huge potential to establish alliances and partnerships with already established companies in these countries, which would mean directly buying a market share and working with the insurance products already established in these markets. At the moment, we believe that we need to increase our international qualifications through different entities, and after that we will explore opportunities with reinsurance companies to develop a course of action.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to make the insurance sector even more attractive for consumers in Colombia?</h4><p>We have already started to increase efforts to make our industry more tangible for consumers, and try to make consumers understand that insurance products are very important at our stage of development. In addition, we need to strengthen financial education at the primary level, such as in schools and education centers. For example, Positiva has already started to carry out a social and anthropological analysis of its clients in order to better understand them, and to identify their behavior rather than market trends. That would also enable us to better design products to address the needs of consumers.</p><h4>In your opinion, how will the free trade agreement (FTA) with the US impact the industry?</h4><p>We have to bear in mind that today we have a strong and reliable insurance industry, where there is healthy competition among the players, which have the same goals. In this regard, we welcome foreign competition, as long as foreign players respect the same rules as local players do at all levels. Basically, it is a matter at preserving the same conditions for both local and foreign players.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There are currently 113 free trade zones (FTZs) in Colombia. What has incentivized this rapid increase?<br></h4><p>FTZs offer great benefits such as reduced taxes and logistical advantages. The first FTZs started in the main urban areas in the center of the country, in Bogotá, Cali, and Medellí­n. Now, there are more FTZs along the coast near the major ports, which reduces export and logistics costs dramatically. In the FTZs along the Pacific coast of Colombia, the major export market is Asia, obviously, whereas those along the Atlantic coast are mainly involved in trade with the EU and the US. That is why most FTZs are now based in or around Barranquilla, Santa Marta, and Cartagena. Most FTZs are along the Atlantic coast, especially the biggest.</p><h4>La Cayena FTZ is mainly used by construction materials companies. What advantages does La Cayena offer?</h4><p>It is meant to attract large industrial companies. There are only 40 or so lots in 1.5 million sqm, so it is designed for large industries. All public services are geared to this. Our slogan is “From industrials for industrials;" it is not geared so much to commercial companies. The workforce around Barranquilla is very good. La Cayena's infrastructure is very different from other FTZs. It is very modern, and it is built with the best materials, which reduces monthly maintenance costs. Logistics costs are also minimal as it is right by the port. Also, we buy energy in packages, both electricity and gas, which further reduces power costs in La Cayena FTZ. We buy gas directly from the producers. Our overall costs are quite low compared to other FTZs, and that is what differentiates us from the others.</p><h4>What advantages do FTZs provide for the overall Colombian economy and also for Barranquilla in particular?</h4><p>One advantage is that FTZs expand the production base of the economy. Instead of becoming highly centralized in the large cities, the industrial base moves to these coastal areas and cities, drawing labor, industry, and capital out to new regions. It thereby contributes to the spread of jobs and wealth in the country and also creates a skilled workforce, while also providing social and economic benefits to local areas where the FTZs are located. Industries and companies also benefit from cheaper labor and material costs in places like Barranquilla compared to Medellí­n, Cali, or Bogotá. It has social, demographic, and economic benefits for the country, both for the people and for businesses. Barranquilla in particular is a great base for various businesses, geographically speaking. You can export goods to Central America, Texas, or Florida within two days. Brazilian and various Asian companies also like to relocate to Colombia for this reason, and also to take advantage of exporting without being subject to taxes, thanks to Colombia's Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US.</p><h4>How many companies are currently located in La Cayena?</h4><p>We have 16 companies from Colombia and abroad, mainly from Venezuela, Spain, and Mexico. We are currently at 50% capacity. One Spanish construction company produces goods here using local raw materials and then exports them to Romania, for example. We are also open to other types of companies besides just the large construction firms, but generally each FTZ focuses on a specific industry and specific export market, so the other firms would also be more or less construction industry oriented, because they are the ones that would most benefit from being in this La Cayena.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of FTZs in Colombia, and for La Cayena in particular?</h4><p>We need to increase the area of FTZs in Colombia in general, and La Cayena in particular, because there is more demand than supply. We need to expand. In a normal week, we have from six to 12 companies interested in locating here. We should expand to 2 million sqm, and maybe even more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Colombian economy grows, there will be increased demand for additional insurance coverage. How would you evaluate the culture and evolution of the local insurance sector?<br></h4><p>I think that the demand for insurance is very important in Colombia. There are two kinds of insurance that you can differentiate between: individual insurance and corporate insurance. Corporate insurance depends on the growth of the country; annual growth in the insurance sector can be up to two times the GDP growth rate. However, individual insurance can grow faster depending on the base of the insurance companies. For example, you need to have channels to appropriately reach the population. You cannot grow if you do not have a way to distribute your product. Insurance companies here are developing sales forces and new ways to reach people to offer individual insurance. I think the development of corporate insurance could go well with the growth of the economy.</p><h4>What are Seguros Bolí­var's plans for 2013?</h4><p>In our case, we know that savings are very important to increase our individual businesses. We are broadening our channels to reach clients in terms of sales force, internet usage, and call centers. We will also focus on being a financial group that has different types of products, such as bancassurance. We sell many insurance policies in Davivienda's offices, and there are about 700 offices all over the country. In those locations we sell life insurance and many other kinds of products, including automobile insurance. I see a very good future for the insurance industry with the environment that we have right now. It is getting better and better for the future because we are sure that Colombia is going to grow as the political model will not change. Change depends on how to spend the budget to help the poor and to eliminate poverty, but for us it is better. As poverty decreases, our customer base will increase in the future.</p><h4>Seguros Bolí­var is an example of success. What has been your growth strategy?</h4><p>We are conscious that we have to grow; however, we want to grow in a conscious manner. If you go too fast, you can hit a wall. You have to know where your potential is, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and then manage them to find the best approach. The first strategy that is very important for us is to have synergy with our companies. There are three companies that are associated with our insurance company: Davivienda, Leasing Bolivar, and our construction company. These sources are very important for our growth. The second thing that is very important for us is technology. Without technology we cannot grow because the transactions have to be very rapid. Client contact and our promise of value have to be accomplished. At the same time, knowledge of our business is very important. We have 3,000 agents and we are always recruiting more. These agents are our ways of communicating our policies, reaching our clients, and presenting our products. We think that differentiation is more important than price. The sales force is one of the main strategies for Seguros Bolí­var. We also make great efforts in educating our personnel. In Colombia, we do not have actuarial career education; therefore, we send people to the US to study. Our company has more actuaries than any other in Colombia. We think that the most important thing is not profits; the most important thing for us is humans.</p><h4>How are your operations in the region evolving and are you looking at new markets?</h4><p>In Venezuela, the savings rate is very low. Seguros Bolí­var is a life insurance company and it is very difficult to find a specialized sales force. Labor conditions in Venezuela are very difficult right now. Ecuador is showing some very good economic results and the standard of living is increasing. In the 12 or 13 years that we have been there, we have been growing well. There is a good environment and they are very good workers. In Ecuador, as in Colombia, people like to work and they like to make a lot of effort. I think there is a market for life insurance there. We are also in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Salvador, forming a network for serving and penetrating the increasingly important market of Central America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What products is Industria Militar (INDUMIL) best known for?<br></h4><p>The main weapons we produce are small rifles. We are the main provider of weaponry for the national army. However, since we produce every part of the rifle, we also export a number of them to countries such as Israel, which designed the Galil series of rifle. Our most important business link is the export of rifle parts to Israel.</p><h4>Which of your products are in high demand abroad?</h4><p>Overall, the main items we export are bombs, grenades, mortars, and rifles. We are currently conducting extensive market research to identify more affordable raw materials for our production lines in order to be more competitive in the global market. At the same time, we are holding talks with the main international players in the sector in order to reach partnership agreements to boost country-to-country business activities; we can provide expertise and we prioritize the transfer of know-how and technology. INDUMIL aims to become the leading producer and supplier of armaments and ammunition for the entire Latin American region.</p><h4>Where are the main markets where you source your raw materials?</h4><p>In the explosive devices segment, we import raw materials from the EU and Russia, whereas in the weapons segment we tend to import them from Brazil.</p><div class="quote">“There are over 6,500 families that live, directly or indirectly, from the work they do for Industria Militar."</div><h4>What have been the main changes you have implemented and what are your plans for the short term?</h4><p>In addition to reducing costs on the raw materials side, I aim to generate more employment opportunities for local staff. At the moment, there are over 6,500 families that live, directly or indirectly, from the work they do for INDUMIL. As a state-owned company, we have to be socially committed to Colombia's society through our different business activities.</p><h4>What is INDUMIL's main competitive advantage when competing internationally?</h4><p>First of all, our experience. There is no other company in Latin America that has as much experience and expertise as we do. Also, our close ties with the Colombian army have enabled us to develop some very competitive products from an innovative and technological point of view. We have to keep in mind that the Colombian Army has always been in need of modern military weaponry and devices due to the internal conflict the country has suffered from for many years now. INDUMIL has provided several key and specific products for the Colombian Army, for whom we have a dedicated department of R&amp;D, as well as production.</p><h4>What are your expectations on the current peace process?</h4><p>I believe that there are many positive aspects to it, though this is because of the strategies of previous governments, which decimated the rebel groups. I think it is the right moment to attempt the peace process and the strategies around it are the right ones. You can sense all that in the levels of optimism among the people in Colombia, because we have suffered over the decades.</p><h4>What measures should be taken to fight the black market for guns in the country?</h4><p>The black market in arms is one of the main problems in Colombia, especially due to the many rebel groups the country has. However, the geographic features of Colombia, its jungle and mountainous borders, as well as its vast coastline, make it difficult to fight them. We believe there are far too many illegal guns in the country. Developing the poorest communities in the country, maintaining strict restrictions on acquiring and possessing guns, further promoting the hand-in campaigns for weapons and disarmament, and continuing the education of people regarding the responsibilities of owning a gun are key issues to reduce the size of the illegal market. I believe we need to keep providing economic and social alternatives to the Colombian population to reduce violence levels in the country, and this will lead to reducing the scores of weapons currently available on the black market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is the participation of the Colombian Air Force (FAC) in the overall security of the country?<br></h4><p>The FAC is one of the several departments that make up the Military Forces of Colombia (FMC). In this regard, forces like ours have played a key role in reducing insecurity, kidnappings, and crime levels across the entire country, which has strengthened our reputation and position at the international level, including that of the FAC. Our people, who are recognized for their highly qualified and technical level of preparation, are among our strongest assets. In fact, many of our pilots hold Bachelor's and Master's degree in different fields, in addition to their international certification, to perform their duties. As a result, we have a very professional body of staff. At the same time, in the last few years we have crucially increased technology levels in all areas. The FAC has gone from being considered a first-generation national force to be recognized today as a fourth-generation force at the international level, which puts us at the same level as any other superpower in the world. In fact, the FAC has taken part in major operations against terrorism in the country, which clearly speaks of our success both at the tactical and technical level. Such improvements have partly been possible thanks to the international agreements that we have with the armed forces of other countries. Also, due to our high levels of innovation and technological advancement, we have forced terrorist groups to completely change their strategies. Today, we can proudly say that Colombia has made great strides when it comes to national security.</p><h4>Which countries is the FAC closely working with?</h4><p>Due to our proximity, we work closely with the Brazilian Air Force. In fact, several aircraft and a part of our transportation fleet were produced in Brazil. Also, we are in the process of implementing a joint project, in which some ministries are involved in the design and development of future airplanes for the FAC. We plan to set up a production plant in Valle del Cauca, where we will produce different aircraft sections. In addition, we have developed our own training aircraft, and we have been displaying it around the world at several fairs. It has raised a lot of interest among other Latin American countries that could purchase it for their own air forces. Right now, we have assembled 11 of the 25 training aircraft that have to be finished by December 2013. These 11 aircraft are already in use at our Air Academy in Cali.</p><h4>What is the size of FAC operations, and what are your main strengths?</h4><p>We are the smallest unit in the FMC with 15,000 people. I would like to quote Winston Churchill, who said, “Never was so much owed by so many to so few." In this regard, we have collaborated in many humanitarian missions around the world, such as the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan. Also, we have developed our own educational programs in mechanical engineering, management, and administration. In fact, our university is the sixth most reputable and recognized in the country, with our courses leading in their fields. Young people are very avid users of technology and have a different mindset. They have played a key role in boosting R&amp;D activities in the FAC. For example, in our Arpí­a attack helicopters, our pilots have their own personalized helmets that use advanced technology to move the weapons of the helicopter to wherever the pilot is looking. The peculiarity of this helmet is that it is personalized for each pilot. We currently produce them in Colombia. This is just one example of many I could give you, for we have several such projects in terms of ammunition, weaponry, and drones, for example. All of our projects have attracted the interest of many countries that want to purchase such technology. Colombia has the only flight simulator in Latin America for UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, which is widely used not only in Colombia, but by the air forces of Brazil and Chile, among others. Our main goal is to make Colombia the regional leader in terms of innovation, technological use, production, and training facilities in the air force segment.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia has the only flight simulator in Latin America for UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the ministry's major achievements in recent years?</h4><p>Qatar's Ministry of Energy and Industry's work is focused on 2 main areas: utilizing Qatar's energy resources, and diversifying sources of income by widening the country's industrial base. These elements lie at the heart of the State of Qatar's industrial strategy.</p><p>To meet this, the Ministry of Energy and Industry is implementing robust plans to develop and capitalize on our hydrocarbon wealth, and to raise the export value of our growing industrial sector.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar has put immense efforts and investments in developing its gas exporting capacity."</div><p>Qatar's industrial sector celebrated a major milestone in 2011 with the inauguration of Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant, at Ras Laffan Industrial City. A joint venture of Qatar Petroleum and Shell, Pearl GTL represents the world's first realization of GTL technology applied on a world-scale basis and has the capacity to produce 140,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of GTL products.</p><p>Besides Pearl GTL we are building the strategic multi-faceted Barzan gas project. Expected to be fully operational by 2014, this project will help meet the country's future needs for clean burning natural gas in the power and water sectors, and provide feedstock to the Country's petrochemical and refining industries.</p><p>Another important development is the construction of the second Laffan condensate refinery, which will double Ras Laffan's total installed condensate refining capacity to about 300,000 bbl/d when it comes online in 2016. This will make it one of the largest single site facilities for condensate refining in the world. The new refinery will meet the long-term needs of the local and export markets, and pave the way for further optimizing our condensate processing, creating new opportunities, and enhancing our refining and export capacities.</p><p>Qatar's economic and industrial diversification is further boosted by the inauguration of another addition to the petrochemical industry with the completion of the QAFCO-5 project, which is the world's largest single-site producer of ammonia and urea.</p><p>Continued progress in achieving diversity in the industrial sector also saw the opening of one of the largest-ever aluminum smelters to be built in one phase. Qatalum celebrated another ambitious energy project in Qatar, with a state-of-the-art facility that includes a carbon plant and a casthouse, producing value-added aluminum products such as extrusion ingots, foundry alloys and standard ingots that meet the most stringent quality standards of the global market.</p><h4>One of the main pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 is environmental development. What steps is the ministry taking in order to achieve this?</h4><p>The State of Qatar through its industrial strategy aims to “contribute to the protection of global environment pursuant to Kyoto Protocol of 1997, and to the international economic stability by securing sizeable portion of long-term supplies of cleaner energy from liquefied natural gas."</p><p>Qatar has recently joined the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Program. We have had a major flaring reduction initiative at our Al-Shaheen oil field registered under the UN's Clean Development Mechanism. This project will generate some 2.5 million credits of Certified Emission Reductions per year.</p><p>Furthermore, the Al-Karkara Oil Field -the latest oil field to be developed in Qatar- is the first oil field in the country to be zero gas flaring.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Qatar Petroleum is active in the State Climate Change Policy Formulation and Coordination Committee. This committee was established in 2007 by His Highness the Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad. QP's representation on this committee helps it to provide direct input into domestic policy discussions, and the ability to influence the formulation of negotiating positions in international forums.</p><p>We have adopted a number of initiatives to achieve the environmental goals of QNV2030, including the establishment of a Corporate HSE &amp; Sustainable Development Directorate reporting directly to QP's Managing Director. This was an important move to stress the importance of the protection of the environment and the safety of QP's human and material assets. In addition, we have implemented HSE Management Systems (ISO-14001 &amp; 18001) in all QP Business units.</p><p>Qatar Petroleum has established a research and development program at Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park focused on many facets of its businesses, with environmental protection and sustainable development taking the lion's share of the proposed program.</p><p>The Ministry of Energy and Industry has demonstrated strong commitment to protecting the environment, be it in the environmental prerequisites of obtaining industrial licenses, or in the monitoring of industrial projects and their adherence to the requirements of environmental protection.</p><h4>How would you characterize the non-oil potential of Qatar's industries?</h4><p>We believe that small and medium scale industries are essential tools to diversify and redistribute the country's sources of wealth, and to lessen dependence on hydrocarbon resources.</p><p>In this context, the state of Qatar offers several incentives and facilities to industrial projects including soft loans at highly competitive rates, terms, and repayment periods through Qatar Development Bank (QDB) and bank associates; as well as the use of our ultra-modern and fully serviced industrial estates.</p><p>In 2011, the output of the various Non-Oil-Non-Gas (NONG) sectors grew at a steady pace, contributing almost 26% of total GDP growth at current prices.</p><p>In terms of their relative importance, the finance, insurance, real estate, and business services sectors have kept the lead among other NONG sectors, with a share reaching 27.5% in 2011, and a rapid growth rate surging to 18.2% compared to 6.9% in 2010.</p><h4>What developments need to be made in order to increase transparency in Qatar's business environment?</h4><p>We believe that transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of public and corporate governance and a pre-requisite for building a world-class economy.</p><p>Efforts are underway in building institutions and organizational capacities that are based on efficient and transparent delivery of public services, fruitful public-private cooperation and partnerships, providing a vibrant climate for business and a larger space for civil society.</p><p>The presence of central agencies like the High Committee for Transparency is a guarantor for greater transparency, accountability and governance.</p><p>As we encourage best practices in both the public and private sectors, we believe Qatar's business environment in general stands to benefit with more transparency touching areas like budgets, expenditure, procurement, delivery of services, and HR management.</p><h4>One of the main challenges in many oil rich countries is the transition from a resource-based to a knowledge-based economy. What efforts is the ministry making in order to promote this and to what extent does Qatar Petroleum strive to achieve this?</h4><p>In resource-based economies, abundant natural resources help governments maintain high living standards, strive towards people's development, and ensure the nation's prosperity.</p><p>In Qatar, we are harnessing our hydrocarbon resources and utilizing this economic wealth to help create a conducive environment for a sustainable knowledge-based economy. We have adopted a national development strategy focused on economic diversification that should position the non-hydrocarbon sector as the co-driver of future GDP growth, thus paving the way for the development of a knowledge-based economy.</p><p>Education and research play a decisive role in our efforts. This is why Qatar has invested time and resources in trying to create a world-class education system. The oil and gas industry in Qatar has supported this by promoting the National Research &amp; Development programs of the Universities in Qatar and linking them to the need of the industry.</p><p>Qatar has also instituted Education City and the Qatar Science and Technology Park, which offer a host of incentives for international investors in high priority areas like R&amp;D, knowledge transfer, and technology advancement.</p><p>Qatar Petroleum has spearheaded the development and growth of Qatar's economy for decades through a highly successful investment program in hydrocarbons. We will continue to play a central role in this effort, as well as in the effort to create a strong, diversified, and sustainable national economy. Our main purpose is very clear: to convert Qatar's hydrocarbon resources into a stream of healthy cash-flow, which could support Qatar's further development and transcend the nation into a sustainable and knowledge based economy.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Qatar's potential to become a regional energy hub and a provider of energy security to Europe? How will the ORYX and Pear GTL plants contribute to this?</h4><p>Qatar has positioned itself as a pivotal player in the energy trade, with its current position as the largest LNG producer, and home to the third largest reserves of natural gas in the world. We have the advantage of an ultra-modern fleet of LNG vessels, and the proximity to the world's main energy markets.</p><p>The world is witnessing a considerably increasing demand for natural gas as an alternative source of clean energy; forecasted to double within the next thirty years. Natural gas is a clean, safe and cheaper energy alternative compared to crude oil, which is why many countries - including oil producers- lean towards shifting to this option.</p><p>Europe is placing increasing importance on natural gas, and specifically LNG, as part of its energy mix and security. The last nuclear disaster in Japan forced many European nuclear power enthusiasts to re-assess their strategies, especially in the light of growing public opposition. Qatar has already demonstrated to be a reliable energy producer and exporter by meeting the long-term needs of several Asian energy-hungry economies.</p><p>We think Europe needs to partner with Qatar and take an urgent call to plan and secure a long-term LNG supply capable of fulfilling its future energy needs.</p><p>On the supply side Qatar has put immense efforts and investments in developing its gas exporting capacity as well as building world-class downstream projects. Pearl and Oryx plants are just two of those investments, which have succeeded in making Qatar the “Gas to Liquids Capital of the World". With a combined production averaging more than 170,000 bbl/d of high-quality GTL products, we are meeting international requirements for superior performing lubricants, and eco-friendly transportation fuels.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the Qatari energy sector in 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>The general outlook for the Qatari energy sector in 2013 and beyond is that of a driving force behind the phenomenon economic development. We have already embarked on this road leading to transformation. We are there to provide the energy back up and infrastructural needs for the mega industrial and urban projects including the developmental needs of the construction of new airport and sea port, besides the prestigious FIFA 2022 World Cup infrastructure projects.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the energy sector has tailored its strategic plans to meet the state's commitments. The Barzan gas project is a powerful step forward in Qatar's overall industrial and human development. It is project that is solely dedicated for local gas consumption needs, playing a significant role in meeting rising domestic gas demand. The project is in EPC phase and is expected to start production in 2014 with a daily output of 1.4 billion BBTU.</p><p>The second phase of Ras Laffan refinery will add 146,000 bbl/d to the current refined products capacity in Qatar. Petrochemical industries will also witness a boost in the upcoming decade; several projects with a budget exceeding $20 billion are at different stages.</p><p>Through Qatar Petroleum International, QP's International arm, the Qatari energy sector is expanding its outlook beyond the national boundaries to participate in international opportunities in several downstream and upstream projects, the latest being a refinery project in Egypt and a petrochemical complex in Vietnam.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of free trade agreements (FTAs)?<br></h4><p>Colombia's trade agreements have several goals. First, the idea is to leverage the advantages of international trade as a means toward economic growth. This includes providing clear rules for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs seeking to increase investment in our country. Additionally, FTAs give Colombia a level playing field in target markets, where competitors already enjoy the advantages that come with trade agreements. Finally, these agreements facilitate the integration of Colombian companies into global value chains. Within this framework, the trade agreements that provide the greatest impacts are those we have with our key partners: the US and the EU. These partners buy a significant portion of our exports (38% and 18%, respectively), but they are also markets where we face competition. The US and the EU are major importers of products for which Colombia already has or can develop competitive advantages. This, of course, applies to mining and energy products. However, in order to leverage the impact of these exports, we must also strengthen our higher value-added products. On this front, we should begin with processed foods, apparel, the metalworking industry, auto parts, chemicals, and business process outsourcing, among others. We have an ambitious agenda for our trade negotiations. Currently, we have 11 agreements in force, and we are aiming for 16 trade agreements with over 50 countries that will account for roughly 60% of the world's imports. In addition to the US and the EU, this group includes all the Latin American countries, as well as Canada, the EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland), South Korea, Japan, and Israel.<br></p><h4>What are the strategic advantages of the Pacific Alliance trade bloc?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is one of the most innovative integration strategies pursued by Colombia as part of its internationalization process. It is an open and flexible arrangement, with clear goals and pragmatic efforts to strengthen existing bilateral trade agreements among member countries. The aim is to develop a joint policy on trade and economic integration, so as to advance internationalization as an economic bloc. Essentially, the goal of the Pacific Alliance is to establish an area of deep integration driving higher growth, development, and competitiveness in the participating economies. This is to be realized through streamlining the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. While it is true that integration is well underway in the trading of goods, we must continue deepening and strengthening the existing relationships and agreements dealing with services and investment among the member countries. Likewise, the four Alliance members must work on maximizing the benefits of foreign investment and international trade in services in the region, so as to achieve higher growth and economic development.</p><h4>Improving the country's infrastructure is one of the government's priorities. How is the current administration channeling investment in order to address Colombia's infrastructure needs?</h4><p>As a matter of fact, this is one of our priorities, and we have been taking bold steps toward tackling this challenge with efficiency, transparency, and accountability. So far, we have doubled investment in infrastructure from $1.6 billion in 2010 to $3.3 billion by the end of 2012. This is a huge step forward; however, it's not enough. We surely need more investment, but without jeopardizing the country's finances. This is why we have invited the private sector to join us, as partners, in building the infrastructure Colombia requires to live up to its highly promising potential. In order to foster the conditions for this partnership, we have focused our efforts around two tiers. First, we set the legal framework—through the Public—Private Associations Law—to promote the birth of the strong partnerships necessary to make a real breakthrough in our country's infrastructure, which will result in building new and upgrading existing roads, ports, highways, and airports. These rules encourage companies and investors to become our allies in the design and execution of multiple ventures. And the results are forthcoming. Our National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) has already received over 15 proposals from private investors to develop projects worth $7.2 billion. Furthermore, we have also launched the most ambitious infrastructure plan in our country's history: the Fourth Generation of Concessions. It comprises 30 projects valued at more than $22 billion.</p><h4>What have been the biggest successes in your campaign against guerrilla groups in Colombia, and what are your expectations and strategies for a peaceful resolution?</h4><p>Guerrilla groups in Colombia, which sadly persist in waging a long, painful, and outdated struggle that has cost thousands of lives and resulted in thousands of victims and displaced communities, have been harshly hit, particularly over the last six years, to the point that their ranks, previously estimated at over 20,000, today are not even half that number. Since the administration of President Álvaro Uribe, under which I served as Defense Minister during its second term, our armed forces have been permanently on the offensive against the guerrillas based on joint and coordinated efforts among different components, on equipment upgrades, and—something of the utmost importance—on strengthening our intelligence capabilities. Thanks to these efforts, members of the FARC's Secretariat, its highest ranking body, started falling in 2008. And during my administration it has lost not only its number one and two leaders, but also more than 20 of its regional ringleaders. While meeting our obligation to fight the guerrillas, we have not set aside the possibility of finding a peaceful solution.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Latin America's economic future, and what role will Colombia play in shaping this trajectory?</h4><p>The world economic context has changed drastically during the past four years. The 2008 financial crisis that began in the US and later weakened the fiscal solvency of the euro zone resulted in a profound change in the main drivers of world economic activity; about three-quarters of the growth in world output is now attributable to emerging economies. Riding on this wave of growth, Latin America, which now has a GDP of about $6 trillion, will triple its size by 2050 to about $18 trillion. Colombia will play the role of regional leader along this path, consolidating its position as the third largest economy in the region, a milestone achieved during 2012. In 2050, Colombia's GDP is forecasted at $1.1 trillion, more than three times its current size of $362 billion. This will be the byproduct of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies targeted at increasing competitiveness, protecting investors' rights, and reducing inequality. Colombia, along with whole region, will be a highly integrated and dynamic economy with a diverse export sector and access to billions of consumers around the world as a result of our continued efforts in signing FTAs. Colombia's current economic strength, along with the structural fiscal reforms that have been approved during recent years, will enable the country to maintain stable growth rates in the future. High investment rates will continue to improve the country's infrastructure, making it more competitive with respect to its peers. In addition, Colombia's institutions are well prepared to cope with future external crises, as evidenced by the fact that Colombia was among just a handful of economies that managed to grow during the recent financial crisis. All these factors guarantee that Colombia will remain a leader within the region in the coming decades.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Spain is the third largest investor in Colombia. How would you assess economic relations between the two nations?<br></h4><p>I would like to start by affirming that Colombia is a strategic country for the Spanish government. Therefore, I greatly value our economic relations. As for the figures, since 1993, Spain has invested ‚¬5.79 billion in Colombia. That is a considerable investment. Spain is highly present in sectors such as finance, infrastructure, insurance, and telecommunications. However, with an increasingly improving environment, we believe this will continue to grow. For now, it represents 5% of total Spanish investment in Latin America, which amounts to ‚¬118 billion. Moreover, the entry into force of the free-trade agreement (FTA) between Colombia and the EU will allow our commercial relations to reach their full potential. In 2011, Spain exported ‚¬561 million worth of goods to Colombia, while imports from Colombia to Spain totaled ‚¬1.23 billion. These figures can be improved.</p><h4>Why is Colombia an attractive destination for Spanish investment?</h4><p>Colombia offers a privileged location at the center of the American continent, within six hours of the major Latin American capitals and the US, and with access to ports in the Caribbean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. With 47.5 million inhabitants, it is the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world, and its GDP per capita has steadily grown in recent years, from $5,826 in 2000 to $9,920. In addition to a large and growing domestic market, Colombia has free trade with a great part of the continent, including the US and Canada. Colombia has also opened up widely to Asia and Europe, which has significantly expanded the potential demand that can be met from this country. We must also underline the great potential of the Pacific Alliance, of which Colombia is a Member with Mexico, Peru, and Chile, and of which Spain is an Observer State, along with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Panama.</p><h4>How will the FTA between the EU and Colombia stimulate relations between Spain and Colombia?</h4><p>The trade agreement between Colombia and the EU will certainly encourage our trade relations and investment in both directions by offering zero tariffs for most products and a stable legal framework for investment. Beyond products and investment, the beneficial effects for the whole economy should be underlined. By promoting exports, national income increases can be redistributed throughout the population, improving social cohesion. Overall, the positive effects are major and fade into the economy, to the benefit of its citizens. Colombia is a renewed opportunity for Spain, but Spain also for Colombia. Colombian companies are ever more so international, are increasingly investing in Latin America, and willing to do so in Spain under the best conditions—the same goes for Spanish companies. Spain is its natural gateway, and the closest to the world's largest market: the EU.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is the confirmation of the emergence of middle powers."</div><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's economic future and for relations between the two nations?</h4><p>Colombia is the confirmation of the emergence of middle powers. Colombia has been identified among the new emerging economies of the 21st century. In the group of CIVETS: Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa, Colombia has adapted to globalization in an exemplary manner and is already reaping the rewards. It is showing that with strong institutions, ambition, commitment, sacrifice, and a clear course, no conflict can halt the will of freedom, peace, and progress in society. On my first trip to Latin America as Prime Minister, I went to Bogotá. I said then that I believe in Colombia, in its present, and in its future, and I say it wherever I go. Colombia and Spain are examples of continuity in foreign policy. Colombia knows that Spain understands its reality and can count on its permanent support. Our strength is our desire to define and regularly renew our level of ambition, and to offer our citizens new horizons. We believe that what is good for Colombia is good for Spain, and at the same time, what is good for Spain is good for Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the history of McDonald's in Ecuador?</h4><p>McDonald's is largest chain of quick-service hamburger restaurants in the world, serving around 68 million customers a day in 119 countries. Richard and Maurice McDonald started the company in the 1940s in the US as a small barbeque restaurant. In 1948, the McDonald's brothers restructured their business, focusing on hamburger sandwiches prepared under assembly line principles. In 1955, businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchisee, and eventually bought out the chain from the McDonald's brothers. Thanks to his business vision, he oversaw McDonald's development and worldwide expansion. Today, the company has an annual turnover of around $80 billion, China being the fastest growing market. McDonald's arrived in Ecuador in 1997, many years after entering South America. The company was looking for a local partner and I became personally interested and decided to lead this attractive venture, leaving behind more than 20 years of banking experience. In February 1997, I flew to Caracas, Venezuela, to train at a restaurant for six months. Later, I went to Chicago for further training at the McDonalds Hamburger University. With that experience, we set up our local headquarters in Guayaquil in 1997, our first restaurant opened in Quito in October, and 30 days later we opened in Guayaquil.</p><h4>How large is the McDonald's network in Ecuador today, and what growth plans do you have?</h4><p>Today, we have 21 restaurants: 11 in Guayaquil and 10 in Quito. Additionally, we have five McCafés and 16 dessert stands. Last year, our turnover reached $33 million, and we expect an increase of another $4 to $5 million for 2013. This year, we will open two restaurants in Cuenca, representing an investment budget of around $2 million. Cuenca is one of the fastest-growing markets in Ecuador, thanks in part to the large number of retired people from the US and Europe that have decided to move there in recent years. Along with local interest in the brand, our expectations for this market result are quite positive. According to the company's data and research, it takes an average of seven to eight years to consolidate operations and start generating a profit in a new country. In Ecuador, we managed to reduce this period to five years thanks to the great determination of our entire team. We are presently self-sufficient from a financial point of view, achieving sustainable growth. It is also important to keep in mind that the consolidation of our operations in Ecuador coincided with an economic crisis, before the adoption of the US dollar as the official currency. There were times when we our future looked very bleak due to the country's socio-economic instability.</p><div class="quote">“We are presently self-sufficient from a financial point of view, achieving sustainable growth."</div><h4>What other cities in Ecuador are you targeting for expansion in the near future?</h4><p>McDonald's has opened a restaurant every year since it entered the country. Ecuador currently has 21 restaurants, Peru has 26, Colombia has over 60, Venezuela has 140, Chile has more than 70, and Argentina over 100. However, many cities in Ecuador do not have a McDonald's, meaning that there is huge potential for development in this country. There are several cities that could be of interest to us. However, we have to keep in mind that when opening a new restaurant we conduct extensive market and economic research and we analyze the human capital potential. At the moment, we are very much focused on opening in Cuenca. However, I think cities such as Manta, Machala, Ambato, Ibarra, Santo Domingo de los Colorados, and Salinas are very much on our radar for expansion, and hopefully they will be the home of the golden arches in the future. This is already part of our strategic development plan.</p><h4>What role do local partners play in your activity in Ecuador?</h4><p>They are an essential part of our activity and we work with companies such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Supan Ecuador. We also have suppliers for vegetables, packaging, sauces, and other products. Over the years, we have managed to work with more national suppliers; however, we still import Russet Burbank potatoes from the US and Canada, as well as meat from Chile. We are also holding talks with a very important local poultry producer. Hopefully, in the next few years, we will not import anything but potatoes. This is very important in terms of generating indirect employment opportunities in Ecuador. McDonald's selects its suppliers very carefully so that our customers can eat the same product regardless of their location around the world.</p><h4>What are the particularities of the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>McDonald's entered the Ecuadorean market late in the game; our other competitors were already consolidated in the country when we arrived. However, due to our commitment to this country, our perseverance, and long-term vision, we have been able to become the leading company in this industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for BLOM Bank over the last year?</h4><p>Frankly speaking, this period was a difficult one for the region. The situation in Syria has been deteriorating and Lebanese banks, including BLOM, have a presence there. Also, almost all banks in Lebanon, even if they don't have a Syrian presence, have connections to Syria. Definitely, the situation there has affected Lebanon in terms of the economy and tourism because a lot of tourists, like the Jordanians, come by land, which they cannot anymore. Having said that, I would add that the banks were able to absorb the negative effects of the Syrian crisis and are still able to grow, even if only moderately. Overall, it affected the operations in terms of taking provisions due to having less growth on the balance sheets because operations in Syria shrank; however, other operations went up. We just had a lower growth rate than normal; this is the effect of Syria.</p><h4>BLOM Bank has a strong presence in other countries. How are your international operations looking?</h4><p>Our business has been improving relatively well in almost all other countries in the region, including in Egypt. We are doing better in Jordan, and recently opened operations in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, albeit with limited licenses. We have been doing well and achieving good results in Saudi Arabia in terms of investment banking, real estate, and equity funds in the market. In Qatar, our operations are also becoming profitable and growing. Our operations in Qatar revolve around corporate banking licensed under the Qatar Financial Center, where we can offer private and corporate banking. These operations are also expanding. Our asset management business, whether in Lebanon or around the region, has been expanding significantly. We have also been able to grow in all areas of lending in Lebanon, especially in retail and housing loans. This is due to the Central Bank's special stimulus package.</p><div class="quote">“If the situation improves in the country and the region, I think Lebanese banks are going to see a huge improvement."</div><h4>How does that stimulate growth, and what segments are going to benefit from this stimulus package?</h4><p>A lot of areas will benefit from this, but the biggest effect is on lower- to middle-income housing. The economy probably is going to benefit by around 1% more growth due to this package. Rather than having a growth rate of 1%-1.5%, we are going to see a growth of 2%-2.5% due to the Central Bank's package.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Our products are always expanding. We have products in all areas: private banking, asset management, and funds. The latest fund we issued is on the Saudi Arabian equity market. This is new; it was not there a year ago. That is performing very well. We also launched many new retail products, such as different types of credit cards. We have expanded our activities in all areas, and we are number one or number two in all areas. We are also active in non-traditional areas of banking, such as Islamic banking. We run BLOM Development Bank, which is our Islamic banking unit. We have one branch in Beirut, and we opened a second branch in 2012 in Tripoli. We are planning to open a third branch soon.</p><h4>How is Islamic banking developing in the country?</h4><p>It is growing. Although it is small in Lebanon, its growth is important. We see great potential for Islamic banking not only in Lebanon, but also in the region. We have a good base here, a good structure, and we can use that in other countries. Islamic banking is becoming more and more important, especially in the Arab world. About 40% of Islamic banking is in the Arab world. We see a big potential for it to grow.</p><h4>What are some of your short-term investment plans?</h4><p>We are planning to open two branches in Iraq, one in Baghdad and one in Erbil, by the end of 2013. We are also continuing to expand our network in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt—basically, in places where we have a distribution network. For example, in May 2013, I opened a branch in Jordan in the free zone. It was branch number 12 in Jordan. We are by far number one in car loans in Jordan, with 45% of the market. I think number two has 12%. Also, in Lebanon, we are number one in retail credit cards, cars, and housing. BLOM really controls the retail market. Also in Lebanon, we are opening new branches in Beirut and elsewhere. In September 2013, we will open branch number five in Tripoli. There are some areas that we avoid, but Tripoli is the second biggest city in Lebanon. Overall, our branch network is expanding reasonably well in Lebanon.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the development of electronic banking in recent years?</h4><p>We always pursue new developments in electronic banking. We have done things that nobody else has done, like e-Cash, for example; the ability to transfer electronically to people who do not have accounts at the bank. They can withdraw this money from an ATM. If you are a customer at BLOM, you can transfer money over your computer to someone who is working at your home in the mountains, for example. You can send them $500 and they can go to an ATM and withdraw it with the code that you give them, even if they don't have an account with us. In terms of phone and internet banking, we were the first to enter many different areas. We are advanced in IT, and we mostly develop our systems internally.</p><h4>Could you describe the bank's performance in 2012, and what are you expecting for 2013?</h4><p>We have already published our 1Q2013 results and it showed improvement over our 1Q2012 results. We are still maintaining the best ratios compared to our peers; we have the highest return on equity (ROE) and the lowest cost to income. Even in terms of absolute figures of profits, we had the highest level of profits among banks in Lebanon, which in turn improved our profitability ratios. We are expecting 2013 to be a good year; however, growth will be moderate.</p><h4>Where do you see banking in Lebanon standing in terms of Basel III?</h4><p>Overall, the level of capital adequacy in the banking sector is already above the 10% level. For us at BLOM, we are now around 14%. The banking sector is required to arrive at a level of 12% before 2015. I think the sector will achieve it. This is a higher level in a shorter period than other international banks have managed to achieve. Also in Lebanon, effectively,  almost all of our equity is tier one. The banks in Lebanon do not issue a lot of subordinated debt, and they mostly have tier-one equity, which is the best type of equity. I think we are okay in the banking sector, and we have tighter restrictions than have been issued by the Central Bank in terms of reaching these objectives.</p><h4>Where do you envision the banking sector evolving in the near future?</h4><p>The banks in Lebanon are very resilient. The situation of the banks is very solid. If the situation improves in the country and the region, I think Lebanese banks are going to see a huge improvement and significant growth. If the situation stays as it is now, which is a tight and difficult situation regionally and politically, then I think Lebanese banks are going to grow moderately over the next couple of years. Really, nobody can predict what will happen because it is linked to the difficult political situation. If conditions improve and we get tourism again, we can easily have growth of 6%-8%. If it stays like this, we might have 1% or 2%. Another thing is that the question of oil and gas has become very important and essential. If there is the political stability to go ahead with that, it could give a major boost to the economy. The investments that are required can definitely have a major impact on the economy, even before we get the gas. The question is if the companies will come and invest millions of dollars to explore. Hopefully, there will be a situation where we have a functional government and we can continue to go down this path.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) evolved in recent years?</h4><p>PDO has a distinguished history. The first cargo was in May 1967 from the early developments in the northern fields, which produced generally light oil. Work gradually shifted to the southern fields, moving toward infill drilling, horizontal drilling, 3D seismic work, and water floods, and more recently with enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is an area through which PDO differentiates itself from all other companies. Our geology is complex; our fields are more mature and they tend to be smaller than our neighbors. Pressure support is more limited and oil viscosities tend to be higher, with an increasing level of sour gas production. We have had to move into a significant program of EOR technologies. We are the only company in the world that has thermal, miscible, and polymer chemical injection recovery mechanisms within the same concession, all of which are in full-scale implementation.</p><h4>Which EOR technologies are the most important for PDO today?</h4><p>Polymer injection is effectively the most embedded and advanced field application; however, miscible gas is very significant and thermal processes are expanding every day. The key point is that at the moment they represent 3% or 4% of our total production, so they are relatively small. By 2020-2021, however, more than one-quarter of our production will be linked to these recovery mechanisms. There will be an exponential increase in the contributions made by EOR technologies in the future.</p><div class="quote">“Renewables are a viable opportunity, obviously starting on a smaller but sustainable scale."</div><h4>How significant is the research PDO does into EOR?</h4><p>I am a strong believer that research is about effective implementation more than just having it on the shelf. PDO is particularly strong in technology testing and deployment, with considerable experience in identifying and assessing new tools and processes and with proficient implementation practices. We have very strong technology relationships with a number of entities, with Shell as a significant partner and stakeholder. We also have partnerships with Sultan Qaboos University, alongside a number of industry projects with key service and technology providers across the world. At any one time, we have in excess of 70 different technologies being tested, simulated, modeled, or implemented in the field. In some areas, we progress to full-scale adoption, while in other areas we are in the early front-end assessment and development stages.</p><h4>What opportunities exist to market PDO's expertise elsewhere in the world?</h4><p>I think EOR technologies developed in Oman will be increasingly exported to countries that are looking to progress through similar development challenges, across the full spectrum of exploration seismic through to development applications. Oman is recognized as a center of best practice in oil and gas exploitation. Increasingly, this is focused on the well and reservoir/facility management of our operations, our water management and reservoir imaging technologies, our artificial lift experience, and so much more. This knowledge and operational experience is showcased and exported to a number of countries, principally in the GCC, but also beyond and in the same way as PDO seeks and pursues best practice from other countries. That is one of the strengths of working with our international partners such as Shell, Total, and Partex, where you are networking, capturing, and sharing best practice wherever that may be.</p><h4>What chemical and geographic complications do you face drilling in Oman?</h4><p>In general, the conditions are deeper, tougher, tighter, hotter, and high-pressure environments with additional challenges such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and so forth. As you progress through those more complex challenges, you have to step up the level of safety assurances, and associated mitigation and risk management measures. The challenge doesn't mean a higher risk. You have to deal with the challenges with appropriate safety measures and mitigation programs, lowering risks to the lowest possible level. Development costs are rising, but the economics of finding, developing, and operating these fields are competitive and very robust.</p><h4>What cost control measures does PDO implement?</h4><p>We have several strategic cost initiatives focused on activity-based cost leadership and cost management to optimize scale and efficiency. One of the most significant enablers is our Lean program. We are driving Lean increasingly across all our projects. In each area, we are developing a practice to eliminate waste, drive efficiency, optimize workflows, and employ standard operating procedures. In 2012, we received a number of awards for key Lean project accomplishments. Enablers include our high technology collaborative work environments, involving televised conference calls, and proficient sharing of common data between the head office and field operations, along with the intensive use of visual management. This allows people to understand the contribution they are making to the overall PDO targets. Waste is disrespectful to people, and as you pervasively address this, you dramatically reduce costs and more importantly increase productivity and value creation.</p><h4>What recent discoveries has PDO made?</h4><p>The most significant discovery made in 2012 was the Mabrouk deep-gas field, the largest discovery within our concession in a decade, with estimates of 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf). We were successful in the appraisal and extension of the Harmal field, with additional gas in place in excess of 1 tcf. In the past few years, we have replaced production by as much as we have extracted. Notwithstanding several decades of exploration and the maturity of the portfolio, we are proud to have secured a reserve-to-production ratio of one over several years.</p><h4>How important will the Duqm project be for PDO?</h4><p>The size of the concession that we manage is basically the size of England, so the optimization and enhancement of ports and logistics will help us dramatically in reducing costs and turnaround times, as well as in potentially distributing different grades of oil. The southern fields tend to be heavier, the northern fields are lighter, and Duqm may provide the opportunity of segregating these grades in the long term.</p><h4>How do you see the balance between oil and gas production changing in PDO?</h4><p>Gas is taking an increasing prominence locally, regionally, and globally. At the moment, gas is taking increasing prominence and is recognized as the fuel of today and the future, so you will see an increasing focus on exploration and appraisal, particularly of tight gas accumulations and steadily increasing consumption for several years. In the longer term, we envisage increasing shifts toward renewable energy sources. Oman is obviously endowed with an incredible solar potential, and what is very exciting is the progress with the Amal steam solar project we commissioned in December 2012 in proving how viable and competitive renewables can be. It is by far much more efficient and cost effective than most projects I have seen around the world, adopting a very simple concept and smart engineering using a glasshouse to protect solar panels.</p><h4>How do you regard the future of renewable energy technologies in Oman?</h4><p>Renewables are a viable opportunity, obviously starting on a smaller but sustainable scale. There is the opportunity to address the consumption side through reducing the amount of gas per megawatt required, and the amount of gas per barrel you lift. Renewably sourced steam can, for example, improve oil and gas recovery and enhance turbine power delivery.</p><h4>How does PDO work toward reducing energy consumption in the Sultanate?</h4><p>The question of energy utilization and consumption is crucial. The Nimr Reed Beds, for example, dramatically reduce the energy requirement for water treatment, while the optimization of combined-cycle power stations utilizing waste heat recovery increases efficiency in steam for EOR thermal projects. Our solar steam EOR project in the Amal West field is another example.  Over the last several years, our reduction in fuel consumption to operate our fields has equaled our exploration and improved field recovery efforts, and energy consumption management remains a key priority at PDO.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) between Colombia and Costa Rica are ongoing. How is the process evolving?<br></h4><p>We are in the final stages of closing this trade agreement. Although Costa Rica inaugurated a tradition of strong inclusion in international markets many years ago and has approved and negotiated several trade agreements, we have never carried out the process with Colombia. We haven't closed the agreement yet between Costa Rica and Colombia because there are some sensitive areas, and that is why this FTA didn't come about until now. As with any trade agreement, the benefits include the possibility for consumers to access products from the respective countries at lower tariffs, and hence lower costs. And from the perspective of producers, the opening of new markets is significant. There are some sensitive sectors, especially textiles, but we are positive we are going to be able to close the agreement very soon.</p><h4>In the last decade, bilateral trade between Colombia and Costa Rica has doubled. Which areas of bilateral trade have more potential for growth?</h4><p>Trade between Costa Rica and Colombia has doubled in the past decade, from $191 million in 2002 to $390 million in 2012. In 2012, Colombia was the second destination for Costa Rican exports in South America. Some of the areas that have more potential for growth are the exports of bullion lead, prosthetic tools, medicines, and pneumatics. In terms of the Colombian presence in Costa Rica, we have seen great diversification in textiles, food, and financial services.</p><h4>In what other areas are you cooperating, and what have been the major accomplishments in recent years?</h4><p>I would highlight the area of sea protection in particular. Obviously, we are allies in international forums in favor of measures against climate change. In these areas, Colombia and Costa Rica are on the same side of the table. However, we've been focusing our attention on the seas. We are encouraging the strengthening of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Biological Corridor, to which countries like Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador are subscribed. The idea is to move forward with joint patrolling, maritime surveillance through radar systems, and processes that enable the protection of species that migrate along this corridor. During my administration and that of President Santos, this has been the main emphasis.</p><h4>What makes Costa Rica an attractive destination for Colombian investment?</h4><p>The FTA is important because it provides instruments that grant greater legal certainty for investment. This is very important for a Colombian investor, as well as for investors from Costa Rica in Colombia. Beyond the fact that the FTA becomes an additional incentive for Costa Rica, our country already offers very attractive terms for foreign investment. We are one of the most successful countries in Latin America. Our geographical location is very convenient, equidistant from major markets around the world. This has gone hand in hand with the promotion of trade agreements that guarantee access to big markets under privileged conditions. Costa Rica has trade agreements with the US, the EU, and China, for example. The products that are exported from Costa Rica can then access markets under privileged conditions, and that is a very special condition. Also, Costa Rica has always shown conditions of stability and legal security with a recognized rule of law, and that gives a lot of confidence to investors. Another strength is the quality of our human capital, which is competitive and gives added value to the production processes that investors bring to the country.</p><p class="quote">“Trade between Costa Rica and Colombia has doubled in the past decade."</p><h4>How do you envision the future of relations between Costa Rica and Colombia?</h4><p>I have great optimism not only for our past, which speaks volumes about our friendship, appreciation, and respect, but because of new mechanisms, among them the FTA, which will bring a future of very promising relations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will Etihad Rail play in supporting Abu Dhabi's developing industrial sector?</h4><p>Modern transport infrastructure is a key element in facilitating the international competitiveness of a country's industrial sector. Etihad Rail's state-of-the-art network has been carefully designed to serve the key industrial sectors in the country as well as the new industrial zones such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD), and to link these directly with our major ports in order to provide an efficient means of transporting large volumes of raw materials, and intermediate and finished products. Our 1,200 kilometer network will be ideally located to serve, amongst others, customers in the oil and gas, metals, aggregates, cement, and waste industries. We have already signed 15 MoUs with future customers and partners as they anticipate the improvements that rail will bring to their logistics operations.</p><h4>How does Etihad Rail complement Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?</h4><p>The railway will provide direct benefits to both businesses and individuals across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, including those residing in the Western Region. The railway will mean less expensive, safer, and more consistent freight transportation. Lower costs will make products more competitive, leading to more businesses being attracted to Abu Dhabi, furthering economic growth and investment in the region. As businesses develop, grow, and prosper in such areas as Ruwais, Mirfa, and Madinat Zayed, Abu Dhabi overall will benefit through additional investment and employment opportunities in many diverse sectors such as health, education, and finance.</p><div class="quote">“The GCC railway has the full backing of the federal and local governments."</div><h4>In terms of transportation, how will Etihad Rail contribute to the shift away from oil and gas dependency?</h4><p>The railway will facilitate the diversification of economic activity by providing the non-oil industrial sector with a safe, secure, reliable, and efficient means of transporting large volumes of goods to customers within the UAE, to and from the UAE's ports, and to other GCC countries, thereby helping to reduce logistics costs and increasing the competitiveness on the world market of goods produced in the UAE. Etihad Rail has been working with the relevant authorities and port operating companies to ensure the rail network will enhance the efficiency of logistics chains, for example by connecting as close as possible to the UAE's ports to eliminate costly double handling and storage of freight.</p><h4>How will the passenger network link up other public transportation such as the Dubai Metro and Tramway?</h4><p>Etihad Rail recognizes the importance of high-quality and convenient multi-modal passenger interchanges if rail is to maximize its potential passenger usage. Etihad Rail aims to integrate its network effectively and efficiently into existing transport systems and efforts are being made to connect with existing and future public transport networks such as the Dubai Metro and Abu Dhabi Metro and Light Rail.</p><h4>What have been the challenges from an engineering perspective in developing the network?</h4><p>Challenges and technicalities are to be faced as with any rail network anywhere in the world, and in the UAE, these challenges mainly comprise those involving operating in a desert environment—topographic and climate challenges such as sand dunes, wind-blown sand, high temperatures, and humidity need to be overcome. While all of these require care as we design the system, none of these challenges are completely new to railway builders and operators. At Etihad Rail we strive not to be pioneers in our field, but to use established international best practice. In the planning stages of the network, the teams have looked to the expertise of countries also dealing with these challenges such as Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and China.</p><h4>How closely is Etihad Rail working with other governments, regulators, and operators in the GCC to plan the connection of the wider GCC network?</h4><p>The GCC railway has the full backing of the federal and local governments in the UAE as well as the governments of other GCC countries. Etihad Rail is an active participant in GCC committees and working groups, facilitated by the GCC Secretariat General, with the aim of ensuring that the GCC national networks are operationally interoperable, have similar train signaling systems, have compatible customs processes, and offer a regulatory environment that stimulates commercial growth. We have already agreed on the key common technical standards that each railway must adopt and these are already built into Etihad Rail's designs. We are now discussing the operational, institutional, and regulatory arrangements that need to be put in place at the GCC level.</p><h4>Once completed, the GCC rail network will reach from as far as Kuwait to Oman. How could a single GCC visa encourage tourists and business visitors to use the network?</h4><p>A single GCC visa would clearly make it easier for tourists and business visitors to travel throughout the GCC region and, therefore, for Etihad Rail, working with our GCC partner railways, to encourage passengers to travel in the region by rail. The time, cost, and other obstacles currently involved in obtaining visas no doubt discourage many non-GCC nationals from travelling throughout the region. It would also have other benefits such as removing the requirement to segregate domestic and international passengers at stations, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of station design and construction.</p><h4>Etihad Rail is going to enhance accessibility between Abu Dhabi and Dubai with the Western Region and Northern Emirates. How will the network encourage inter-Emirate growth?</h4><p>The Etihad Rail network will benefit the entire country, connecting key centers of trade, industry, and population, and act as a catalyst for economic growth and sustained social development. Those living in more remote areas will see a step-change improvement in connectivity and accessibility throughout the Emirates. The network will encourage inter-Emirate growth by supporting tourism growth in the Western Region and the development of industrial clusters around rail terminals supporting the Western Region. It will also encourage sustainable industrial diversification and connectivity and result in improved Western Region and UAE GDP growth and rural development. Increased accessibility throughout the Emirates will enhance the attractiveness of places outside of Abu Dhabi and Dubai for people to live and work. This, in turn, will stimulate further investment.</p><h4>Etihad Rail is currently completing Stage I, connecting Shah and Habshan to Ruwais. What is the size of this project and when is it expected to be completed?</h4><p>Trains will be used to transport granulated sulfur from the granulation plants at Habshan and Shah to the export loading facility at Ruwais. Stage I of the Etihad Rail network will extend 153 kilometers from Habshan to Ruwais and 264 kilometers from Shah to Ruwais, facilitating an efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly means to transport the sulfur. Each train will be comprised of three diesel locomotives pulling approximately 100 hopper wagons. There will be one train per day from both loading points to the port. Each hopper wagon can carry 100 tons, thus each 100 wagon train will carry about 10,000 tons per day. Each train will eliminate approximately 300 trucks from the highways. Construction on Stage I is well advanced, with the Habshan-Ruwais route on schedule to launch by the end of 2013, with the Shah-Habshan route to follow in 2014.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sasol is considered a pioneer in the GTL industry at large, and in Qatar specifically, having entered a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum on the ORYX GTL plant. How do you assess the commercial viability of such operations?</h4><p>It is no secret that the ORYX GTL plant is one of the most successful joint ventures in Qatar today. That is due to the combined resources of Qatar Petroleum, the lead partner in the joint venture, and Sasol. It is viable and it is successful. On the basis of the success that Sasol has been enjoying here in Qatar, we are now looking for other opportunities around the world. Gas conversion technology, however, has existed for over 60 years, and Sasol has been operating plants in South Africa using Fischer-Tropsch technology since 1952. What makes this one unique is that it is a low-temperature process, and therefore an economic venture.</p><h4>What future markets exist for diesel fuels that are created through the FT conversion process?</h4><p>Fuels created by gas conversion are inherently more environmentally friendly than conventional fuels created from fossil oil. There is market demand for them, especially as GTL fuels are low in sulfur, they produce lower greenhouse gas emissions, and they have a high cetane number. Functionally speaking, GTL fuels are no different from petroleum-based fuels and can be used in two ways: as a fuel or as a blendstock.</p><div class="quote">“Efficiency is core to our approach moving forward. In Qatar, we are looking at a higher level of carbon efficiency."</div><h4>Where are the products of the ORYX GTL plant exported?</h4><p>The ORYX GTL site currently produces three products. Some are for export and some are for domestic use. LPG, for example, is produced for use domestically in Qatar. Naphtha, a highly paraffinic product, is generally exported to Southern Asia and the Far East as cracker feedstock for chemical crackers and ethane crackers. The largest product by volume is diesel, which mainly goes to Europe and, more recently, to the Middle Eastern markets.</p><h4>What initiatives does Sasol undertake in order to ensure the sustainability of its operations here?</h4><p>Efficiency is core to our approach moving forward. In Qatar, we are looking at a higher level of carbon efficiency through the ORYX GTL plant. We're incorporating lessons learned in Qatar to maximize the efficiency of our next slate of projects. For example, there is an active program to reduce flaring, in line with Qatar's containment philosophy to have a lower carbon footprint. What we are learning from these modifications is that we can apply them in our new projects to lower their environmental impact and maintain the same level of production quality.</p><h4>What efforts with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) does Sasol focus on here in Qatar?</h4><p>Sasol is a company committed to the communities in which we operate. Our initiatives are aligned to support the Qatar 2030 National Vision. For example, in 2012 we launched a program to highlight the abilities of people who are disabled, called “Definitely Able." Additionally, we are actively involved in supporting environmental issues. In partnership with Friends of the Environment Center Qatar we are developing an application for smart phones and tablets that will bring the wealth of Qatar's bird and insect life to the palm of your hand. In April 2013, during the QP Environmental Fair, we brought a play from Lebanon that emphasized the importance of recycling to young people. These are just two examples of our investment in the community here in Qatar, a market to which we are committed for the long term.</p><h4>From a global perspective, how is the shale gas revolution affecting global markets, and how is that affecting Sasol specifically?</h4><p>Sasol has direct stakes in shale gas and is in a joint venture producing shale gas in Canada. We have seen in North America that shale has created a situation where there is a complete disassociation between the oil price and the gas price. The question is, what is the supply/demand balance in the future? It is very clear to us that in the long term, demand for gas will rapidly increase, and shale will assist in meeting that demand. There has been a lot of new gas found off the coast of Africa, as well as in Australia and a number of other places. It looks like there will be a tight balance between supply and demand going forward. What we don't know is what will happen in terms of shale in China and other places in Europe. There is a lot of development on shale gas in the UK and other places. Whether demand will outstrip supply, only time will tell. Whatever the outcome, there is a continued need for self-sufficiency within markets, and this is based on having sufficient hydrocarbons and not having to import. GTL is one of the solutions available to gas-rich countries such as Qatar.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in Qatar?</h4><p>For energy specifically, there is no indication that there will be an expansion of LNG production; however, there will be an expansion in refinery capacity for crude oil. That will produce growth, but it will depend on oil and gas prices. It is our understanding that the moratorium on an increased flow of gas from the North Field will be evaluated in the coming years. There is an indication that an increase of gas supply from the North Field will happen. There was a gas find that was announced in April 2013 of 2.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf). If there is an additional gas find, then in three to five years time there will be an increase in gas production. What we have found is that in Qatar it is looking at diversifying, so there are more C2, C3, and C4 going into gas treatment and chemicals. We have the two crackers with downstream production coming up, but that is petrochemicals. One of those crackers will be up and running by 2018, and that will start a different kind of increase, but not directly in energy. The energy sector depends very much on oil prices, and there is an indication that oil prices are a little bit softer, and that will impact on gas prices.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[well-diversified]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Ahlibank developed since it was formed in 2008?</h4><p>Our growth and development have come together in a very positive way due to a sound strategy and careful planning. When we first established Ahlibank we also had a vision of where we wanted to be in five years. We were fortunate to have an established regional player, Ahli United Bank (AUB), as our strategic partner. AUB and IFC Washington together have acquired around 45% of the bank. Our strength is our team. We have grown the bank from a profit of OMR2.1 million in 2008 to OMR21.7 million in 2012.</p><h4>How dynamic is Ahlibank's portfolio?</h4><p>We have a well-diversified portfolio. It is split 45-55 between retail and commercial banking. Our commercial banking portfolio is also well diversified, and there are no sectors that account for more than 10%. For that reason, our non-performing asset (NPA) ratio is just around 1%. Our corporate books have almost zero NPAs.</p><div class="quote">“We feel SME finance is very important, not just for us but for the country as a whole."</div><h4>What level of mobilized customer deposits do you have?</h4><p>Almost 60% is wholesale and 40% is high-net-worth (HNW) clients and retail. On the deposit side we are at about OMR900 million. We have increased our capital to OMR125 million, and are well capitalized. Our net worth as of June 2013 is OMR193 million.</p><h4>With regards to the retail bank, how many branches do you have around Oman?</h4><p>In total we have 12 retail branches and five Islamic banking branches. Our ATM network is also growing with 17 on-site ATMs and five off-site ATMs. We have plans to expand the branch network to a maximum of 25 branches as per our current strategy and are also looking at self-service kiosks in a number of locations around the Sultanate.</p><h4>How important do you think SME and project finance is for you at the moment?</h4><p>We feel SME finance is very important, not just for us but for the country as a whole. Right now we are in the process of completing a due-diligence exercise to acquire a finance company with the aim of growing the SME business. Under our SME model, we are targeting really small and micro enterprises. Project finance is a very competitive business. We participate in all the big projects. As we have a strategic partnership with AUB, we can underwrite transactions of more than $500 million in size.</p><h4>How would you characterize your lending strategy?</h4><p>We want to build this institution with a long-term plan in mind, so we are conservative and prudent. There is a danger that the level of competition in the banking market will force banks to become less conservative in their lending strategies. There is a lot of liquidity in the sector. Project finance is mainly done in US dollars, but the liquidity is in Omani rials. Our focus is not on the quantity but rather on the quality of the assets on our books.</p><h4>What impact do you think the rise of Islamic banking will have on the banking sector in Oman?</h4><p>I think Islamic banking will gain a share of 10% to 15%. The competition in Islamic banking will be based more on pricing than liquidity. I believe it is more about the relationship than the interest or profit earned when it comes to small depositors. Big depositors do not really care about whether it is an Islamic bank or not, and they tend to focus on the returns. I think there is growth, but I do not think it will impact heavily on traditional banking. If you look at other countries you can see growth in Islamic finance, but it is not a significant portion of the banking sector. Having said this, as one of the leading financial institutions in the country we want to be a leader in the Islamic finance sector, as we believe we can gain a huge portion of the segment and we have always believed in catering to all the needs of our customers. Islamic banking is another service we can provide to them.</p><h4>What advantage do you think you will have in the Islamic banking market as an established bank?</h4><p>I think it is an advantage and a disadvantage. We already have a good branch network and a solid reputation in the market, so some clients will happily shift their business from conventional banking to Islamic banking. Since our Islamic banking division is a window and not a full-fledged Islamic bank, some people have the wrong idea that only full-fledged Islamic banking banks are fully sharia compliant, and therefore tend to lean toward them rather than an Islamic banking window. Growth and advantages are mainly based on the strategy that you have set, and on how you communicate this strategy to the public. I do not think that being already established will guarantee success, but I do believe that educating the public about Islamic banking and its functions will be a differentiator.</p><h4>In the wider picture, are you expecting to see a sovereign sukuk issuance?</h4><p>Yes, there is a lot of liquidity in the market, so the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) may have to issue sukuk to drain this liquidity. Now, they can use government bonds, they can use treasury bills, but when it comes to Islamic banking you do not have any other option other than issuing sukuks.</p><h4>What are your overall expectations for the banking sector in Oman?</h4><p>I think the sector will continue to remain strong. The growth will not be the same as in previous years, but the bottom line will be stable and profitable. We have a strong and prudent central bank, and I do not think the banks will be allowed to take excessive risks in other markets. Overall, I am optimistic. We believe in steady and prudent growth. Our strategic partner AUB has a presence in seven countries, including the UK, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Libya, and Iraq.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to establish operations outside of Oman?</h4><p>We see ourselves as a local bank with a regional presence. Our strategic partnership with AUB means that if we have a client who wants to conduct business in Kuwait, for example, we can do so through our sister bank in the country; the same goes for Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, and the UK.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

This will complement the fact that Qatar will invest around $25 billion up until 2020 in its chemicals and petrochemicals fields with an objective to support and further grow the industry, as indicated by the Minister of Industry and Energy.</p><h4>What was the reason for breaking from the status quo as each company took care of its own marketing?</h4><p>Muntajat enables greater economies of scale for marketing and distributing Qatar's chemicals and petrochemicals than the individual producing entities could realize alone. This is good for Qatar, producing entities and customers who will benefit from investment in services. And in light of the growing global demand for chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers, it was needed. Muntajat will maximize value for our stakeholders by providing the world-class quality products and services before and after sales.</p><div class="quote">“Muntajat enables greater economies of scale for marketing and distributing Qatar's chemicals and petrochemicals."</div><h4>How have you been working with the current producing entities to ensure the best transitional plan?</h4><p>Since the consolidation effort began early this year, Muntajat has implemented a plan that makes the transition process as smooth and seamless as possible for the customers. In addition to reaching out to individual customers to inform them about the transitions, Muntajat has welcomed into its team many of the employees of the marketing and sales departments of the producing entities. These employees, who have developed strong relationships with customers, will continue to serve the clients, thus resulting in a smoother transition than one of a traditional newly established company.</p><h4>What strategic markets is Muntajat eying for further expansion?</h4><p>The market for chemical and petrochemical products is global by nature; nowhere is the growth faster than in Asia. To meet global demand and regional specificities, Muntajat is in the process of establishing a network of offices in key markets with a focus on Asia, including four offices in China and India alone, in addition to offices in Europe, the US and Latin America, South Africa, and around the Middle East and North Africa.</p><h4>How will Muntajat cement Qatar's role as a leading exporter of downstream products in the gas sector?</h4><p>With a current export portfolio of 10 million tons per annum of chemicals and petrochemicals and an investment plan of $25 billion up until 2020, Qatar has positioned itself as one of the world's rising chemical and petrochemical hubs. The establishment of Muntajat grants Qatar a more competitive position through new efficiencies and scale.</p><h4>How does Muntajat intend on aligning itself with the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>The diversification of Qatar's hydrocarbon value chain is one of the great strengths of the market as it contributes to building a knowledge-based economy in line with the National Vision 2030. As a Qatari company, we are proud to be contributing to these objectives and look to expand our support in the years ahead through community projects and employee development.</p><h4>What impact has the shale gas boom had on the business and dynamics of the market?</h4><p>The emergence of shale gas has unquestionably changed the market for certain products in the near term. The capital investment required for the downstream sector, however, has yet to fully materialize in these shale gas markets. In addition, we see increases in demand across the product range, especially in fertilizers as developing markets require these products to increase and secure their food supply. Qatar's petrochemical industry made a giant leap in 2012 by starting up two world-scale plants at Mesaieed: LDPE 3 and Qafco 6. Qatar also has two projects currently underway that are expected to be completed by 2018: the QP-QAPCO PetroChemical Complex and the QP-Shell Al-Karaana Petrochemical Project.</p><h4>What are your visions and goals for Muntajat in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>In the near term, the vision of Muntajat management is to position the company closer to its global customers through a network of offices in key markets around the globe, as well as strategically located logistics hubs and warehouses to support marketing and distribution activities. Across its global network, the company will employ a multinational workforce of more than 400 people; 250 based in its headquarters in Doha and 150 in its global marketing network. In addition to proximity to key customers, Muntajat is setting up an advanced supply chain program that will maximize efficiency, assure faster and improved customer service both before and after sales, reduce lead and delivery times, and decentralize distribution. Taken together, these developments will significantly improve efficiency in getting Qatar's chemical and petrochemical products to customers around the world now and in the years to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - June 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were instrumental in founding the gas and LNG industry in Qatar. Now, the world is talking about a global oversupply of LNG as well the shale gas revolution. What are your views on that?</h4><p>I am not concerned that shale gas will create a surplus in the gas market. A few years ago, everyone was concerned about the decline of gas, and they spent billions on R&amp;D looking for alternative energy. The shale gas revolution has injected a new trust in gas. Now, gas can serve the world for the long term. I believe that shale gas is an added value to the gas industry, creating trust that gas will be sustainable for a long time and the world will be secure in knowing that there is a sufficient supply of gas for more than 200 years. This paradigm shift will cause more countries to turn to gas as an important source of clean energy in order to fulfill their energy needs. Furthermore, whilst some countries are clearly benefitting from this boom in shale gas, many countries suffer a shortage of gas. Even in the Middle East, some countries are facing shortages to the point that they are burning crude oil to generate power. Kuwait is starting to import LNG, and Dubai is already committed, through QatarGas. Now, Abu Dhabi is also building an LNG terminal. We are noticing a decline in consumption in some parts of Europe, but it is increasing in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, so it balances out. Only in the US are LNG imports declining in favor of shale gas. However, this LNG is diverted to other markets such as Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, and India. Gas is becoming one of the main sources to generate power worldwide.</p><h4>Qatar Petroleum evolved from a simple energy E&amp;P company to being involved in the entire energy supply chain. What was your vision for this when you decided to diversify?</h4><p>I was appointed Minister of Industry &amp; Energy in 1992. At that time, Qatar was only producing 360,000 barrels a day and zero LNG. We had huge gas reserves, but we didn't know how to market it or how to create trust with customers. We had to create a market where people trusted us. We finally succeeded in signing the first contract with Japan, and even at that time there were concerns from other experts and analysts saying that there was no future for Qatar in the energy market. In 1997, we sent the first cargo to Japan and then we signed further contracts with Korea, Taiwan, and Europe. We are taking a share of the market, but we are not dominating it, because no consumer depends on one supplier.</p><div class="quote">“The shale gas revolution has injected a new trust in gas. Now, gas can serve the world for the long term."</div><h4>As President of the 18th Conference of Parties (COP18/CMP8) that was held in Doha December 2012, how do you feel Qatar's energy industry is meeting the targets set during the conference to reduce the carbon footprint?</h4><p>Qatar supported the decision to extend the Kyoto Protocol (KP). Qatar had already approved and was a part of the Kyoto Protocol 2 (KP2), and we are also committed to all the decisions made. There were big players, which are not part of the KP or KP2. Qatar played a very strong role in the research of reducing emissions and capturing CO2. We proved to the whole world that we are fully committed to resolutions and reducing emissions. The interest among the world is different when you compare developed countries, developing countries, and underdeveloped countries—all have their own problems and their own challenges. You cannot just go and push a developed country to reduce emissions dramatically—this will affect its economic growth and create problems. The world is more pragmatic, but countries have to work together to reduce emissions and make more funds available for research to help the underdeveloped countries and small islands. The COP18 was a challenge, and this is what we call “the gate" because we believe that we should create a gate to allow all the major players to join the KP2 in the future—without them it will not affect anything. All the countries that have agreed to KP2 already produce 20% of worldwide emissions. The major producers that create 80% of the emissions are not signatories to the KP2. We hope that the world will understand how to create it as a package, but you cannot just try to force it. You have to take into consideration the interests of every country. It is a challenge the world is facing, and it needs a balance. Unfortunately, I believe that the world is still making big mistakes. History can always repeat itself. I am concerned that the world will face a social revolution again, and it will be big. I hope the politicians wake up.</p><h4>Could you tell me about your role as the President of the Administrative Control and Transparency Authority?</h4><p>The Administrative Control and Transparency Authority is a pioneering organization in the region. We are trying to build a powerful organization, but for this we need a certain number of high-caliber people. Today, Qatar's rank in the International Transparency Index is 27, and we now concentrate on how to take Qatar into the top 10. This is not easy; it is a big challenge, but we are trying to take it there. We will require help from all the institutions and government organizations to match all our laws, legalizations, tendering system, and practices. There are thousands of laws and there are a lot of laws in different aspects. We have to take each law and look very carefully where the weak points are and how we can create more transparency and track the awareness of corruption. I believe very strongly that His Highness the Emir is a great supporter of this authority.</p><h4>How have the initiatives of the Administrative Control and Transparency Authority enabled Qatar to remain a haven of peace amongst all the turmoil in the Arab region?</h4><p>During the Arab Spring, people didn't revolt just because they wanted to. They revolted against corruption, joblessness, political misconduct, and mismanagement of public money. These are sensitive issues, but the world should face them, otherwise the politicians will pay the price through social revolution. When people lose their jobs, they lose their futures, they are unable to send their children to school, they lose their homes, and they will not just sit and say “thank you;" they will revolt. History repeats itself, it happened in the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece, the Middle Ages, and modern history, during the French and Russian revolutions. I always believe that the middle class is the yardstick for social and political tranquility. If you see a big and prosperous middle class, you are on the safe side, and here in Qatar, we are lucky to have a burgeoning middle class.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean to visit Abu Dhabi for business?</h4><p>In reality, there is an underlying message in where and how people meet each other. To meet in Abu Dhabi at this moment of tremendous change sends a very powerful message about the positioning of this region in relation to the rest of the world. The UAE is a success story by all measures, and this is its capital. It is also important that the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) meets in the Middle East, at a time when people are often nervous about the situation here. This is precisely why we feel it is an important meeting.</p><h4>How important is Abu Dhabi as a tourism destination?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become more important still. We have learned from experience that the most important element of the success of any destination is the existence of the political will to make it successful. It is not about what a destination has, but what its leaders do with the destination's existing resources. There is a clearly demonstrated will on the part of the government to make tourism work.</p><div class="quote">“Abu Dhabi is a very important tourism destination that is slated to become more important still."</div><h4>There are six other Emirates in the UAE. What makes Abu Dhabi different?</h4><p>To answer this question, I emphasize the leadership of Abu Dhabi. The fact that this is a resource-rich country that has enjoyed a high level of living standards and wealth, but chose to invest much of its wealth into the tourism industry, is what makes it different.</p><h4>Dubai Creek is being reviewed this year as a potential UNESCO World Heritage destination. Do you believe the site deserves this recognition?</h4><p>I am not an authority on the topic, but I do believe that the fact that they are presenting Dubai Creek for review is more interesting than whether or not in achieves the title. The nomination also shows that UNESCO's members recognize the delicate natural foundations of the city and sends the message that they are sensitive to its beginnings. If Dubai Creek becomes a World Heritage site, it would not only significantly boost tourism, but it would also send the correct message to the rest of the world about how careful the UAE is when it comes to environmental issues.</p><h4>How important is stability for tourism in the region?</h4><p>Stability is always important everywhere in the world. It is impossible to sustain a tourism industry without maintaining a minimum level of stability. However, for the Middle East, it is a long-term issue. The Earth has been shaken as a result of events in the region. Nonetheless, we prefer to look at the middle- to long-term situation, and in that sense these events have the potential to bring about positive changes.</p><h4>Do you think the UAE is benefitting from problems in Egypt?</h4><p>Egypt has been affected, but the country is doing much better than people may think. It suffered heavily in 2011, but in 2012 it regained a steady number of tourists. In 2011, there was a redistribution of tourism from some countries such as Egypt to the Gulf. Infrastructural changes that were being developed over the previous six or seven years in the Gulf were being completed, and it was logical that some tourist traffic from other destinations ended up in the Gulf region. The UAE in particular was ready for this new stream of tourism traffic.</p><h4>What effect do you think the rise of more conservative governments is having on tourism in the region?</h4><p>To reply with what I was told by the Prime Minister of Tunisia, who belongs to a party which is considered conservative, “there will never be a government in Tunisia that halts tourism, because it would have a catastrophic effect on employment for so many people." He was honest, and I believe that the benefits of tourism transcend ideology. Each country has to focus on its own strengths.</p><h4>How important would a single GCC visa be to tourism here?</h4><p>Very important. It would encourage people to travel to more than one destination in the area. For outsiders, to be able to hop between different countries would be tremendous.</p><h4>What impact do you anticipate from the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar?</h4><p>The event will be great for the region as an opportunity for millions of people to experience live in the Gulf. It will be an opportunity for the region to show what it has, and hopefully dispel some of the prejudices and ideas about the Gulf that people in the world may hold. Any country that is able to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people for an event is a country with amazing capabilities.</p><h4>How is Abu Dhabi planning accommodate the rapidly growing number of tourists predicted to arrive in the coming decades?</h4><p>Currently, 51% of tourists are traveling by air. This means that the increase in travel will lead to the expansion of the aviation industry. In turn, transportation needs will require innovative investment in airports in a more sustainable and feasible way. Environmental issues will be at the forefront of the challenges for the aviation industry, in both the construction of airports and how aircraft operate.</p><h4>Is there a chance that Europe will be left behind as the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia progress?</h4><p>In the future, we foresee that the tourism market share will be equitably divided between Europe and the rest of the world. By 2015, there will be a 50-50 balance in tourism between the developed world and the developing world, and by 2030 the balance may slide to 60-40 in favor of the developing world. We see it as a fairer distribution of tourism in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main contribution that the Hydrocarbons Secretariat of Ecuador (SHE) makes to the country?</h4><p>Since 2010, the structure and organization of the industry has welcomed the Hydrocarbons Secretariat as the entity in charge of the administration of the country's assets. We are in charge of the administration of contracts and areas that are included in our state-owned company, Petroamazonas. We encourage investments by any oil operators, whether they are NOCs or IOCs. We have to plan, subscribe, and search for contracts with new contractors, promote investment, and control investments as agreed in contracts. We are the counterpart of any investor or contractor in the state or government. That is the main role of this entity.</p><h4>How will international promotion affect SHE and its respective sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have seen the way our reserves are progressing and we are always thinking in the short term, medium term, and long term. Due to the status of our reserves, we estimate that the country will experience a decline in production. We believe that the development of the southeastern region is the most important project for long-term oil production. For that reason, we established a strategy for the development of the southeastern region in 2011. We are building a strategy of 21 blocks, 13 of which will be listed as part of a very historical bidding process. This is one of the main projects of the government in the strategic sectors.</p><div class="quote">“We have been producing for more than 40 years in the north and central area of the Amazon."</div><h4>Will this new round increase production in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been producing for more than 40 years in the north and central area of the Amazon. The area that we are implementing now for development is almost the same in size. We have production in Colombia and Peru, and in the north and center of the Amazon. We believe that the fields in the southeastern region could be as lucrative as the ones that we found in the north and in Peru. This would double our production. In the first round of studies, we discovered that about 1.6 billion barrels can be added to form a combined total of 1.8 billion barrels in proven reserves.</p><h4>What does Ecuador need to do in order to maximize its oil and gas potential?</h4><p>In the short term, we have to focus on the production fields and work on how we can help Petroamazonas and other new ventures to increase production in the mature fields. In the mid term, investments in other technology like secondary and tertiary ways of getting oil, new technical procedures that are being developed all around the world, better warehouses, chances to get more oil, and new technology in the actual fields would be helpful. However, in the long term our reserves will not yield new production and it is important to focus on exploration in the southeastern region.</p><h4>What is the main challenge in the hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>The main challenge is that we are, for first time ever, presenting a service contract for a pure exploratory region. For exploration, contracts are usually production sharing or concession funds. We are presenting a unique contract for exploration that is a service contract with a tariff system. Of course, this is a new system that represents a significant challenge because we have to understand and learn the system and assign the right technicians. We believe that the geology of the region is great, and is probably one of our strengths. One out of every three projects in exploration are successful, and operational costs are low. We have strengths for the process but, of course, the contract is a challenge as it is difficult to come again with the opening for investment after 25 years. It is also a challenge because we are coming back. We haven't been around for many years and companies need time. The model is difficult because it is new. Also, there is a minor problem of misinformation or the perception that investors have about Ecuador.</p><h4>What is your strategy when you go abroad to change the perception of Ecuador?</h4><p>We strive to present the official and correct information so at least they have two sources to compare. If they come and see what's on offer, they will enjoy the atmosphere here. It is one of our strengths. We have a lot of political stability and significant state investment in infrastructure. There are a lot of good things to say. We have very good relationships with indigenous nationalities and communities, and we provide a very secure environment for investment.</p><h4>What do you do with the local communities here in the country?</h4><p>When we started designing the strategy for oil development in Ecuador's southeastern region, we had two main challenges: how to deal with communities and how to extract oil from the area. The first issue was more important as people are the most important element of any environment. We really have to use our natural resources in the best way to fight against poverty and improve the living standards for everyone in Ecuador. We hired more than 50 people from communities in the area and then involved them in this hydrocarbons entity. We trained them to be communicators in the area. Then, we built a tool that we call “social environmental diagnosis." We went to the indigenous nationalities and told them what our policy was for the venture of oil development in the area. That took us almost six months. Once we had this feedback of what they were thinking and their concerns and needs, we were able to build a process that we called “prior consultation." It is the constitutional right of every community to have information before any decision is taken by the state that can affect the environment. The results were amazing. We signed agreements with almost everyone there in the area. This is a key part of our policy and unique to the region.</p><h4>What can foreign investors coming to Ecuador expect from SHE?</h4><p>We present ourselves as partners because we help them to make decisions. We help them understand the system and the law, our geology, our economics, and our legal issues so they can decide if it is an important investment opportunity. We want investors who we share a similar vision with. That vision is to develop the economy in a sustainable way.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Oman's banking sector in 2012?</h4><p>Overall, 2012 was the best yet for the local banking sector. The banks have been very resilient and well capitalized, far beyond the 12% we specified for our banks and outlined by the Basel committee criteria, which requires a capital adequacy of 8%. Our banking sector is capitalized at between 16% and 20%. The banks have been very profitable, with profits rising by 15.6% in 2012. We expect the banking sector will grow in 2013 and continue to record strong results. The government is spending a lot of money on infrastructure projects, and I believe the banking sector will be the main beneficiary. There is also a growing number of Omanis joining the labor workforce, and many will need personal finance. It is expected that Islamic banks will complement the current conventional banking in promoting growth in the economy, diversifying banking services, and augmenting financial inclusion. I am very optimistic that the banking system will do better in 2013. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio is very low, at around 2%. The economy is growing, driven by project finance, and the banking sector will grow with it.</p><h4>How does the trend of rapidly rising aggregate deposits in the banking sector reflect the health of the industry?</h4><p>Commercial bank deposits and credit registered significant growth over the year, as the banking system engaged in its financial intermediation role. Aggregate deposits held with commercial banks increased from OMR8.67 billion in 2008 to OMR12.57 billion in 2011, and further to OMR14.17 billion at the end of 2012. Private sector deposits, which accounted for 64% of total deposits, rose by 12.3% during 2012. In private sector deposits, the growth was broad based with savings, demand, and time deposits increasing by 17.2%, 13.3% and 7.4%, respectively. With government expenditure playing a significant role in overall GDP growth, the deposit growth in the banking sector is expected to remain buoyant.</p><div class="quote">“The Omani banking sector continues to depict optimism and resilience."</div><h4>What initiatives does the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) have to promote awareness of Islamic finance options?</h4><p>We started an Islamic banking awareness campaign in May 2011, when we got directives from the government that Islamic banking was to be introduced in the country. Since then, we started a campaign to talk to the press and hold conferences and seminars as well as training sessions for our staff and the banking community to teach this new concept. Islamic banking is well spread globally, but it is new for Oman, and we have been working very hard on all fronts to educate people. We are the regulator, but when it comes to marketing, it is down to the banks themselves to sell their products. We will have six windows and two full-fledged banks by the end of 2013. We feel this number is sufficient to cover the demand for Islamic banking in the country and to promote awareness. Awareness will spread when people do the banking themselves. They will visit the banks and the windows, learning exactly which products are being marketed.</p><h4>What share of the market do you expect Islamic finance to capture in coming years?</h4><p>I expect it to be between 10% and 15%, which is a good percentage. The balance sheets of the banks will also grow in line with these figures at 15%-20%. Two new local banks, Bank Nizwa and alizz Islamic Bank, have been granted approval, with the former commencing operations in December 2012, and the latter expects to commence business in 3Q2013. Almost all local banks have demonstrated interest in establishing windows for Islamic banking, with four of them already operational. Oman offers a large potential for the growth of Islamic banking, opening up new segments and players both from local banks and investors from abroad, thus providing opportunities for new foreign investments. The banks are optimistic that they will be in a position to significantly increase business and this will be positive for the economy as a whole. Islamic banking is expected to complement conventional banking in promoting development in the economy. In a competitive environment, the borrowers should get the benefit of choosing between both conventional and Islamic banking products. Innovative, asset-based financing such as sukuk provide immense opportunities. This will enhance product diversification in the banking system.</p><h4>What opportunities does the strength of Oman's macroeconomic indicators provide for encouraging FDI?</h4><p>The government offers many incentives for FDI. It is spending on developing infrastructure and free zone industrial areas. There is political stability in the country, the economy is growing, and we have oil and gas. All of our investment rules, regulations, and laws are tailored to attract foreign investment to the country. The government gives tax exemptions on important projects for five years, and these are extendable to up to 10 years. We have no personal income tax here, and no restrictions on the inflow or outflow of capital. We have a currency that is pegged to the US dollar, so we have no foreign currency exchange risk. All of this will attract FDI. To date, we have achieved good results. We are building new ports and airports, as well as our Duqm project, which will be the future for Oman. It will be the gateway for all of the Middle East and the GCC. I am very positive and optimistic that we will be getting more and more FDI into our country. With all of this FDI, the infrastructure megaprojects, and the development of our tourism industry, I believe we will be able to meet the challenge of providing employment opportunities for Oman's population.</p><h4>How does Oman's government promote economic resilience to oil price volatility?</h4><p>It is misleading to suggest that a hydrocarbons-based economy such as Oman cannot be affected by oil price volatility. As a matter of policy, the Sultanate takes a number of precautionary measures and builds safeguards in the form of reserve funds that have proven to be effective in fending off adverse effects on the economy during times of low crude oil prices. More importantly, the government uses conservative crude oil price assumption as part of its budget buildup, which has resulted in overall fiscal surpluses in recent years. The realized fiscal surpluses are often transferred to various reserve funds or used to finance the subsequent year's budget. As a developing economy that enjoys a strong fiscal position, it is only natural for the Sultanate's government to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy that is geared toward developing new infrastructure and modernizing the existing setup. Failure to use government revenues for this endeavor would constitute a lost opportunity, in particular given the importance of infrastructure in both domestic and foreign investments and promoting overall economic growth.</p><h4>What initiatives does the CBO have to promote the SME sector in Oman?</h4><p>The Sultanate's government is fully aware of the need to develop the SME sector as part of its integral economy. In recent years, it has taken a number of measures to develop the required infrastructure and devise the necessary policies. The strategic importance of SMEs in the government's plans is captured by an array of initiatives to promote, sustain, and make this sector competitive. The objective is to develop the sector in a manner that provides more job opportunities besides expanding it as an important source of income for startups and existing entrepreneurs. As far as the CBO is concerned, we encourage the banking sector to lend to the SME sector. Recently, it has been announced that banks should allocate 5% of their total credit to SMEs, and this target should be achieved by December 2014.</p><h4>What is the CBO's vision for the future of the local banking sector?</h4><p>The Omani banking sector continues to depict optimism and resilience, consistent with the sustained growth of the real economy. The banking system remains sound due to the appropriate regulatory and supervisory policies adopted by the CBO. Oman's banking sector comprises 16 commercial banks, two specialized banks, and one operational fully fledged Islamic bank. Healthy competition among banks strengthens the financial system and benefits the population at large with a larger reach in terms of technology, products, and services. The future of Oman's banking system remains promising given the pace of economic diversification and the role of the private sector in that process.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY talks to Mohammed Abdul Rahim Al Fahim, CEO of Paris Gallery, on working with luxury brands, international expansion, and maintaining a prestigious retail experience.</p>
<h4><span class="red">THE BUSINESS YEAR</span> How was Paris Gallery able to succeed during the global economic downturn?</h4>
<p><span class="red">MOHAMMED ABDUL RAHIM AL FAHIM</span> The recession of 2008 was short lived, contrary to the opinions of the media, which exaggerated the effects of the crisis in the UAE. Fortunately, it passed very quickly with the leadership quick to respond and taking proactive steps to protect the economy. The banking sector helped keep afloat the sectors that were hit the hardest. For any company, regardless of whether you are a corporate or family-run business, if you have a strong set of values, a good understanding of how the industry operates, a good set of internal policies and procedures in place, strong and faithful management controlling the financial flow, and a good relationship with business partners and customers, then you are on solid ground. In addition, a team of employees that acts in a highly professional manner, who are loyal and cooperative, who stand with the company through thick and thin, is equally important. Paris Gallery has a great team. We didn’t have any reason to panic. We reduced spending during the downturn. Our employees were equipped with the tools that they needed to become more productive and effective. We were well positioned to weather the storm of 2008 because we had migrated from a family-run business to a corporate one in 2006. We had introduced internationally recognized standards with regards to processes, systems, and policies touching management, the value system, and cultural environment. Culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, and this includes the organization’s values, visions, systems, beliefs, and habits. This is taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving, thinking, and feeling the Paris Gallery way. Switching to corporate governance was a major transformation for us, with changes applied to the legal structure, commercial systems, networking, distribution, and so on. It has so far prepared us to meet every challenge, helped us make good of every opportunity, and keeps us on the right course.</p>
<h4>How has the cultural environment changed compared to the one you had before, and what are the values that you gain after the change?</h4>
<p>Changing the culture was a large-scale undertaking, which began with the vision, mission, and values. We defined our strategic direction and decided what the culture should look like to succeed. We encouraged our employees to change to create the desired culture. We defined roles, and introduced measurement and control systems. We got our executives to support the cultural change. Constant training helped members of the organization understand what was expected from them and how to get used to their new behavior and roles. We practiced effective communication, keeping everyone informed about organizational changes, we reviewed the organizational structure, redesigned our approach to rewards and recognitions, and made changes to work systems that included pay practices, performance management, hiring employees, and employee promotions. We reviewed all the systems to make sure they supported the new culture that was adopted to accomplish our organizational goals. I am very proud of my team. They exceeded my expectations in understanding and accepting the new culture. Today, integrity is a fundamental value of our organization. Our employees work with passion, and they have a profound connection to the vision of the organization. They are ambitious, innovative, and great team players. The diversity is celebrated, perspectives respected, and fresh ways to address business issues are encouraged. They feel empowered. They have a passion for excellence. As a team, we are constantly thinking ahead for ways to better serve our customers, learning from our past mistakes, and making sure we continue to improve.</p><div class="quote">“Every business exists on account of its customers, and customers have specific needs that have to be satisfied.“</div>
<h4>What makes Paris Gallery attractive to international brands and how do you manage the relationship with the labels you work with?</h4>
<p>Mutual interests bring people or organizations together. Paris Gallery is a brick-and-mortar business with decades of physical presence and face-to-face customer experience. Paris Gallery is a name synonymous with luxury. We have succeeded through a strategy that combines high levels of sales assistance by our dedicated and trained staff, specialized merchandise, and a shopping environment that is viewed by our consumers as luxuriously special. We offer the best products in stores located at prime retail spaces in the region. When brands partner with us, they gain a strong market share, build a loyal customer base, and grow their overall business. They choose Paris Gallery for its opulence, its preferred-luxury-retailer status, reach, organized approach, and large customer base. Luxury brands require luxurious space, and that’s exactly what we provide in segments that include perfumes, cosmetics, watches, fashion apparel, sunglasses, and so on.</p>
<h4>Does the company change the way it interacts with partners and customers depending on the market where it operates?</h4>
<p>Every business exists on account of its customers, and customers have specific needs that have to be satisfied. And every business should satisfy those specific needs. Anyone entering Paris Gallery should receive the excellent customer service that Paris Gallery is widely known for. Though product offerings may differ in a particular area, a market or a region, the quality of service is standard. We hire people who we believe can be nurtured to accept these standards and values as their own. This is a tough task when you have people from different regions, cultures, and backgrounds, but our efforts have proven successful. Our guests enjoy the traditional Arabic hospitality that is central to how we treat our guests. Well-trained, polite, and attentive personnel make shopping at Paris Gallery meaningful and satisfying. We must understand the needs of customers in every market so that our offerings are meaningful and customers are best served. This is the primary objective of segmentation; to win and retain the customers we can serve well. It is important that potential customers in a market are identified and placed into different groups or segments with the same or comparable set of needs that can be satisfied by a distinct marketing proposition. This also helps us ensure that we meet the customer’s needs better than anyone else. We also take into account the newer or younger generations that increase by the year to cater to their needs, too.</p>
<h4>What value does Paris Gallery add to Dubai’s retail experience? Why is it so popular among tourists and visitors?</h4>
<p>Dubai is one of the most visited places in the world, and its retail experience is unlike any other. It’s so much more in one place than you could imagine. It’s a shopper’s paradise. It’s where you get high quality products and great customer service. And this is where Paris Gallery is a name to be reckoned with. Paris Gallery is synonymous with the word luxury. Our wide network of stores serves the needs of millions of tourists, expatriates, and locals. People travel from all parts of the world to Dubai for leisure and business, and they generally like to pamper themselves. We pamper our guests. We offer luxury with a distinctive, authentic Middle East flavor. We reflect the opulence of Dubai. We are a local company that meets every international standard. We are the local flavor. We are where our customers need us, and we provide what they want, and even more.</p>
<h4>Which kind of services do you provide for the clients of your creations that the competition doesn’t?</h4>
<p>Paris Gallery is a local company, and hospitality is ingrained in our culture. Our customers are our guests. One thing that’s unique to Paris Gallery is that customers can walk in, relax at the plush lounge, sip on Arabic coffee, feast on premium dates, have pleasing personnel attend to them, get information on the latest products, and have a fantastic shopping experience. Our customers receive first-class treatment in elegant, spacious, bright, and airy retail space, unlike other stores that cram up their retail space. Our customers also get to buy the most exclusive luxury products that one can only find at Paris Gallery. Many of the niche international brands are only available at Paris Gallery. Some of the world’s most expensive perfumes can only be found at Paris Gallery.</p>
<h4>What major developments can we expect at Paris Gallery in the coming year?</h4>
<p>We have plans to increase our foothold in the UAE and in GCC countries through new Paris Gallery stores and its franchises. We will inaugurate our franchise stores in Baku and Baghdad this year, with two more stores in Iraq planned for 2014. We will put more focus on fashion accessories and fine jewelry to gain a greater market share in fine jewelry, an initiative that we have just started in the UAE. Loyalty programs provide more value for our loyal customers.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Bottom Line]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-bottom-line]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind Qatargas becoming the largest LNG producer in the world?</h4><p>The North Field is the single largest non-associated gas field in the world. Qatargas was founded in order to ensure the better utilization of the field, which contains large quantities of non-associated gas—this is gas that occurs in the reservoir without a significant presence of crude oil. Under the vision of His Highness the Emir and the leadership of His Excellency the Minister of Industry and Energy, Qatar decided to utilize these gas resources as a clean energy fuel. With our fleet of LNG carriers, LNG gives the company the flexibility to access any part of the world with ease. From Qatar, we are able to ship any volumes to any part of the world, which is essential in the gas industry. The bottom line is, LNG is a form of gas that allows for many opportunities for the producer.</p><h4>How is the oversupply of LNG in the world and the recent shale-gas revolution affecting the market for LNG?</h4><p>We are an operating company, and therefore we are able to control the amount of LNG that we produce. We are not worried about the oversupply, because what we have seen in terms of the energy demand and the growth worldwide is that every single drop is important. We are currently working at full capacity in order to ensure we fulfill the agreements we have with our existing customers all over the world.</p><div class="quote">“We have a vision for 2015, which has been set out for the company. That vision is to be the world's premier LNG company."</div><h4>How would you characterize the appetite for long-term LNG buyers in Asia?</h4><p>We recently completed the first LNG shipment to Singapore, and we commissioned the first LNG terminal there. The Asian appetite is very high, and we have seen growth in China, India, and especially Japan, where there is an increase in demand for energy, specifically of gas as it diversifies away from the nuclear energy option in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. The demand in Asia is quite high; we have also seen conversions of coal-powered plants to gas-powered plants.</p><h4>What role does Qatargas play in providing energy security to Europe?</h4><p>We have been supplying Europe through our Qatar terminal, which is the Southhook Terminal in Wales. The capacity of that terminal is 15 million tons, though we do serve various other terminals. Of course, being a global supplier of LNG, we also have contracts with other European countries.</p><h4>What implications will the new gas discoveries in Block Four of the North Field have on production?</h4><p>There is a moratorium right now in place for the North Field, and indeed for any further fields that are discovered, until 2015. Obviously, future plans regarding the utilization of these resources will be discussed at the appropriate time.</p><h4>What is Qatargas doing in regard to developing courses with universities?</h4><p>We are working very closely with universities and research centers in Qatar. Regarding the universities, they supply the training courses, and we sponsor their students in specific fields related to the gas industry. There are programs set by the universities here in Qatar, and those programs cater to the demands and needs of the sector. We were also instrumental in establishing Qatar University's Gas Processing Center. There is a lot of support for programs in schools, and just recently we financed the building of a block of six additional classrooms at the Qatar Industrial School. These are examples of our corporate social responsibility, and there are many examples like this. Every April, we sponsor an annual beach cleanup event in al-Fuwairit in the north of Qatar. Since this is a prime turtle-nesting zone, we felt it appropriate as a responsible corporate citizen to do our best to ensure the turtles have a clean environment. We were also pleased to participate in the “Japan-Qatar Week" celebrations. Japan is very important to us, being a foundation customer. The first contract signed with our Japanese customers was in 1992, and we have maintained our partnership with these customers over the years. We have great respect for the Japanese. We appreciate their continuing support and trust that they appreciate our support as a reliable and flexible supplier.</p><h4>What does Qatargas do to address Qatarization?</h4><p>We have a very comprehensive localization program and have set ourselves clear targets for Qatarization, which currently stands at 26% of the company's workforce. In 2013, we are targeting to recruit around 128 Qataris, which is a challenge for the company to achieve; however, in 2012 we recruited 104 students. That is quite an accomplishment because there are so many other potential employers aiming at essentially the same talent pool. Qatar has a young labor market and there is great potential and numerous opportunities. Qatargas was one of the first companies in the country to start these initiatives to attract young people into the company. You could say we were pioneers of training and development initiatives that have now become standard throughout the employment sector in Qatar. At the same time, individuals who gained skills and experience with Qatargas found opportunities to move into very senior positions with newer, emerging organizations in the state. You could say that Qatargas continues to be in a way a major “incubator of talent" for the state's industrial enterprises.</p><h4>What efforts is Qatargas making in regard to sustainability?</h4><p>We have a vision for 2015, which has been set out for the company. That vision is to be the world's premier LNG company, known for its people, innovation, operational excellence, and corporate social responsibility.  Qatargas works closely with its employees using the skills and diversity of our workforce as a significant source of strength. We are also known globally to all of our customers that we are a reliable and secure supplier of LNG. The company is well established. We have a sustainability program and our strategy moving forward is closely linked in with State of Qatar's National Vision 2030. We have established and participated in numerous environmental projects that have positive business and environmental impacts, such as the $1 billion Jetty Boil-off Gas (JBOG) Project designed to capture gas at the loading jetties and reduce flaring during the loading of ships. Instead of flaring the gas, we capture it so it goes back into the network. In fact, there is enough energy recovered by the JBOG Project to power a small city.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in the long term?</h4><p>Currently, we produce 42 million tons of LNG. If you are asking about further expansion, then this all depends on the moratorium set for the North Field. From there, we will know which direction the government and Qatar Petroleum is heading toward and whether it will increase the LNG business and production or not. It is still too early to talk about this because the deferral will not end until 2015. Having said that, I can see that there is always room for growth. We have just signed a contract for a new Laffan Refinery to be called Laffan Refinery 2. We are operating Laffan Refinery 1, and now we are looking at expanding capacity and adding a second refinery.</p><h4>What are the medium-term strategies and targets of Qatargas?</h4><p>Our plan is to continue our efforts to be a reliable and sustainable producer of LNG and to meet global demand for this clean fuel. We aim to continue operating safely and achieve our aspiration to become the world's premier LNG company. We are not just interested in being the biggest, we want to be premier, which is about quality, class, people, innovation, and excellence. That is what we want to be in the medium term, and of course, also to meet His Highness the Emir's requirements for the 2030 vision.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the size of both the Turkish and US economies, how would you characterize the volume of trade and investment between the two?</h4><p>The US is the world's largest economy, and Turkey ranks 17th with an aim to enter the top 10 by 2023. With the importance of both economies in mind, the trade flow between the two is nowhere near where you would expect it to be. Although large multinational companies, such as TABA members Honeywell and Motorola, are familiar with the Turkish market, mid-sized companies remain uninformed about the potential that Turkey offers. For example, many US companies are importing products from Mexico, which they are likely to get for a better price and higher quality in Turkey. Although globalization has made the world smaller, we still see a lot of information gaps that prevent the right markets from finding each other. There is unrealized trade potential between many countries, but the commercial component of the Turkish-American relationship is dwarfed by the level of political and military integration between the two countries. We have been talking about developing the potential in our commercial relations for decades now, but we have finally reached a point that the size and quality of our trade is growing and we are seeing more and more bilateral investment. The commitment of the government of Turkey has been an important incentive as well in this regard. Minister of Economy Zafer Çağlayan has identified the US as a key priority, which helps us to create the right level of awareness and infrastructure needed to seize this momentum.</p><h4>What role is Turkish investment playing in the US?</h4><p>The US-Turkish economic relationship cannot be described solely by looking at trade flow anymore. Now we are seeing mutual investments back and forth, and not just in traditional areas such as textiles. For example, Eczacıbaşı has acquired a company in the US called Capintec, which is producing nuclear measurement devices. Sarkuysan, a leading producer of copper-wires in Turkey, has established Sark-USA with its headquarters in Albany, New York, and therefore now has a solid base of operation and production in the US. Similarly, there are companies like EA Havacılık that have made successful aerospace investments. These are large Turkish companies moving into the US and making sizeable investments, but there are also many Turkish-American entrepreneurs who have started their own companies in the US. There are a lot of exciting stories there. For example, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, which is involved in the aerospace and defense industry, was founded and is run by a husband and wife from Turkey who now reside in the US. The company employs more than 3,000 people and has a turnover that surpasses $2 billion. This is an amazing success story. Another example is entrepreneur and philanthropist Yalçin Ayaslı, as well as the popular yogurt company Chobani, which was founded by Hamdi Ulukaya. But there more success stories that people are unaware of, and they are taking place in aviation, aerospace, defense, and high-technology industries, and this is what is truly exciting me.</p><div class="quote">“There are many Turkish-American entrepreneurs who have started their own companies in the US. There are a lot of exciting stories there."</div><h4>To what extent should the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the EU be a priority for Turkey?</h4><p>I believe it is hugely important and thankfully the Turkish government has shown early initiative in making sure Turkey is not excluded. We would be wrong to view it as just a free trade agreement (FTA). The likelihood of a transatlantic common market happening between the EU and the US has never been this high, and if realized as envisioned it will undoubtedly have a lot of political effect as well. In a way, I compare it to the Marshall Plan because it could provide the economic spark that Europe needs to lift itself out of its current economic malaise. It is of course hugely important for Turkey as well, because the EU is our largest trading partner. It is important economically, but also politically, because we are invested in the long-term future of the EU. Whether we become an EU member state or not, we want the EU to be a successful political and economic Union. As a member of the EU Customs Union and a candidate for membership, Turkey has already harmonized its economic regulations with the EU and would be a logical component of the TTIP. The letter of the Customs Union Treaty requires Turkey to separately negotiate FTAs with third-party countries that the EU signs with. However, I believe the EU has a responsibility toward Turkey to integrate Turkey in the TTIP. To avoid a road accident, relevant Ministers such as Zafer Çağlayan and Minister of EU Affairs Egemen Bağış are taking coordinated steps to ensure parallel negotiations with the US should the EU ignore this responsibility. I think the White House, the Secretary of State, and now the Secretary of Defense all know Turkey very well, and they all understand the strategic importance of the country. My concern is that Turkey needs to invest more time and effort into reaching out to the US Congress. Congress has other reflexes beyond the executive branch, and it has the final say on FTAs. For this reason, I trust that Prime Minister Erdoğan will add Congress to his schedule during his upcoming US visit.</p><h4>Has the perception of Turkey in the US changed over the past 10 years?</h4><p>What the House of Representatives thinks about Turkey represents in great detail the way the US population thinks about Turkey. Before 9/11, it was actually, interestingly enough, more negative. This is evidenced by the resolutions that were passed. There were a higher number of negative resolutions passed about Turkey compared to positive ones prior to 9/11. Not all of these resolutions have a legal effect, but they did condemn certain actions take by Turkey, such as moving into Cyprus. After 9/11, I believe that awareness throughout the US about our region increased as well as the role that Turkey plays in NATO and fighting terrorism. This is partly thanks to the Congressional outreach of organizations like TABA, but the engagement of highly experienced diplomats in Washington has also been pivotal. Much more remains to be done but we have started walking in the right direction.</p><h4>What is the Turkish-American Business Association (TABA-AmCham) doing to influence public opinion and lobby the government in the US?</h4><p>We have to go beyond just lobbying Washington. We need to be locally present and we need to show the US that we are investors in the country. We create jobs in almost every region, and we do this by buying products and investing in the US. We are buying American products and our members are involved in the local production of jet aircraft and the national space program. We are more active participants in the US economy, and we need to be more actively involved in local US politics. The way to do that is to first make sure that people are aware of what we do, and this starts with engaging opinion and decision makers. With our new initiative in the US, called TABA-USA, we want to approach congressmen and women in their districts and show them that we are their constituents and employers in their district, and support them in their policies, where there is a mutual interest. This is not a political lobbying group. Instead, it is focusing on highlighting the importance of doing business with Turkey and Turkish-Americans at a local level. The group has no partisan agenda and we will not attempt to lobby about any contentious political issues. We already have excellent diplomats such as Namık Tan who can argue those cases in the right corridors. What we are focused on is grassroots educational activities, highlighting the incredible trade and investment opportunities that both nations can find in our respective countries. I think that if Turkey continues its current economic performance, then naturally the biggest question will be whether it can sustain the economic growth it enjoys. Turkey has shown remarkable resilience with regard to the global economic downturn. Clearly we are not entirely unaffected from the global crisis, because we are all on the same plane, but I think we are certainly flying first class. We have better security belts, and things are running more smoothly on our part of the plane. I think that if we can continue to implement a smart and calculated economic policy, our growth will continue for years to come. Furthermore, if we can pull off the new outreach that the Turkish government has initiated on the Kurdish issue, we can finally rid the country of its largest burden. If we are able to solve the issue with the PKK and free our country of terrorism, we will see a real revolution in growth in Turkey, and achieve our targets for 2023.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) taking to ensure that Turkey meets its 5% target for inflation in 2013?</h4><p>Expectations, credit, and currency are three key variables that determine price inflation. Inflation expectations are close to above our medium-term target of 5%. Measures to curb excessively rapid credit growth will be instrumental in containing any inflationary pressures in the coming months. These measures are mostly macroprudential in nature since rate hikes would be counterproductive in the global low-interest rate environment.</p><h4>To what extent is a structural reduction in the current account deficit (CAD) a priority for Turkey, and how can the country achieve its target for the CAD to GDP ratio in 2013?</h4><p>In 2012, the CBRT, jointly with other agencies responsible for financial stability, was able to attain more balanced domestic credit growth. This was instrumental in bringing the CAD from $75.1 billion at the end of 2011 to $47.5 billion at the end of 2012. The 2013 CAD forecast in the Medium Term Program (MTP) of the government is 7.1% of GDP. Structural measures listed in the MTP to boost savings and energy supply are expected to improve the outlook on the external balance, once they are implemented.</p><h4>Turkey's GDP growth has seen a sharp drop from its 2011 high. What steps is the CBRT taking to help the country to meet its GDP growth target in 2013 and achieve a sustainable growth trend?</h4><p>Price stability, financial stability, and productivity are the three essential factors that determine the growth potential of a country. The Central Bank Law, which was amended in 2001, charges the Bank with taking the necessary measures to contribute to financial stability besides its primary mandate of achieving and maintaining price stability. The CBRT will continue to support balanced growth mainly via these two channels.</p><div class="quote">“The Turkish economy has been one of the top performers during the recovery period after the Lehman crisis."</div><h4>What are the CBRT's monetary policy priorities looking forward?</h4><p>Although global risk perceptions have improved considerably as a result of the ongoing monetary expansion in advanced economies, there is still an elevated level of volatility in capital flows to emerging markets. This condition necessitates a combination of flexible monetary policy and automatic stabilizers.</p><h4>How would you characterize the medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy?</h4><p>The Turkish economy has been one of the top performers during the recovery period after the Lehman crisis. Meanwhile, employment has continued to grow rapidly and unemployment rates decreased to levels lower than pre-crisis times despite a significant rise in labor market participation rates. Moreover, the rebalancing between domestic and external demand was achieved to a large extent in 2012. Therefore, the Turkish economy is now closer to a sustainable and balanced growth path thanks to prudent macroeconomic policies and solid macroeconomic foundations.</p><h4>You were selected as the Central Bank Governor of the Year 2013 for Europe by The Banker in recognition of your apt management of foreign inflows. To what extent will this remain a policy priority in 2013?</h4><p>Monetary expansion in the developed economies has been the main factor behind the rising volatility of capital flows. Volatile capital flows pose a significant challenge for emerging market policymakers. As a result, some emerging markets have resorted to capital flow measures in order to deal with the adverse consequences of capital flow volatility. In contrast, Turkey has been using a mix of macroprudential measures along with a relatively low and yet quite flexible interest rate policy in the face of volatile short-term capital flows. The policies in place curbed the excessively rapid domestic credit growth, avoided the excessive swings in currency, and thereby rebalanced foreign and domestic demand.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azerbaijan is one of the fastest-developing economies in the region. What makes the country so interesting for foreign investors?</h4><p>Attracting foreign investment to the national economy is an integral part of the economic development strategy of Azerbaijan. What makes our country particularly interesting for FDI is the open-door policy undertaken by the government toward foreign investors. The country enjoys political stability and legal guarantees are in place to protect investments. Azerbaijan possesses rich natural resources, minerals, and fertile lands. Our advantageous strategic location provides direct access to Central Asia and the Caspian basin region, thus enabling our participation in international trade initiatives such as the Silk Route and the North-South Transport Corridor. EU enlargement is also in our national interests, and, therefore, Azerbaijan actively participates in the EU's regional programs, including the Eastern Partnership. Additionally, we have competitive local manpower in the country. We have passed important laws and regulations with regard to the protection of the rights and interests of investors. Property rights, equal opportunities for both local and foreign entrepreneurs, and the free repatriation of profits, as well as laws on investment activities and the protection of foreign investment are crucial. The government has signed agreements on the avoidance of double taxation, and on the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments with many countries. Our economic potential and advantageous geographical location foster the interest of foreign investors who seek to make long-term investments in Azerbaijan's economy. The share of foreign investments constitutes more than half of the nearly $120 billion invested in our economy over the last 17 years. This makes Azerbaijan the country with the highest FDI index per capita in the region. Nowadays, Azerbaijan accounts for 70% of the economy of the South Caucasus. Our economy is rapidly integrating into the global economy, and the country is wholly open to the import of high technology.</p><h4>Your Ministry has made several achievements in introducing modern management techniques. What can you tell us about your relationship with the other tax administrations in Europe?</h4><p>We are striving to establish a highly competitive, investment-attractive, simple, but still transparent and stable taxation system in Azerbaijan. Over the last 10 years, we have achieved significant progress in reducing the tax rate, modernizing the tax management system, and enhancing and applying new information technologies. This has helped us build effective control mechanisms as well as a flexible taxation system capable of coping with the changing and rapidly growing volume of the economy. We also make use of the experience of developed European countries in our tax system reforms. Our Ministry is an active member of the Intra-European Organization of Tax Administrations (IOTA), and we have established good relations with the OECD Center for Tax Administration. The cooperation we have undertaken with the World Bank and the EU in various projects also contributes to the modernization of our tax system. In 2012, we started establishing cooperation with the International Anti-Corruption Academy, and we're looking forward to deepening our relations. Moreover, we closely cooperate with the tax administrations of leading countries, particularly those in Europe. We have signed agreements on the avoidance of double taxation with 43 countries, as well as agreements on mutual assistance with several countries. The Ministry of Taxes has been successfully implementing the European Neighborhood Policy Action Plan for a while now. We are constantly reforming our tax laws and regulations in order to harmonize them with European standards. Our country's tax policy provides a good basis for undertaking an efficient and competitive economic policy in the region. Azerbaijan's taxation service can be compared to our European counterparts, both in terms of management systems and level of digitalization. The process of harmonizing our national legislation with European legislation is well underway. Azerbaijan was the first country in the CIS to achieve remarkable success in areas such as the digitalization of the tax administration and the introduction of taxpayer services. There are certainly several areas such as e-auditing, the taxation of e-commerce, and transfer pricing that are new for our country. Therefore, these areas are high on our reform agenda. In the medium term, we are working on the advancement of an IT-based tax administration, the improvement of the Ministry of Taxes' management system, and the establishment of a long-term strategy based on international experience and global standards. This strategy will cover the provision of a vast range of electronic services, the improvement of IT, and knowledge-based tax administration management, ensuring transparency and high efficiency.</p><div class="quote">“Attracting foreign investment to the national economy is an integral part of the economic development strategy of Azerbaijan."</div><h4>The Tax Administration is the most advanced state agency in Azerbaijan to apply IT. What has been the impact of the application of modern technology?</h4><p>The development of ICT is one of the key factors that define the level of development of a country. The government of Azerbaijan has set a strategic goal to extensively use ICT tools in all spheres of society, including public management. The establishment of e-government constitutes a fundamental part of endeavors undertaken in this regard, which are reflected in a specific state program. Serious steps are being made in the country to achieve an efficient e-government system and to integrate ICT tools into the management of state agencies. The establishment of e-government has entered an active phase in Azerbaijan. The provided e-services help to increase transparency in the activities of state agencies, reduce their direct contact with citizens and potential corruption cases, and improve citizen trust in state agencies. For the first time in Azerbaijan, a VAT deposit account was introduced enabling the full digitalization of tax controls in the VAT administration process. The application of the single VAT deposit account has prevented VAT evasion as well as reduced the administrative load on taxpayers. The one-stop shop for the registration of commercial legal entities is an integral part of our electronic services, and receives much praise from taxpayers and international organizations alike. The electronic registration of physical persons engaged in entrepreneurial activities was first introduced on July 1, 2011, followed by the registration of legal entities with domestic investments in February 2012. Meanwhile, the registration process of cash registers was applied to the cash payment process in Azerbaijan. As a whole, this technology considerably reduced costs for the tax administration. According to information from IOTA, as of late 2011, the taxation service of Azerbaijan was the most efficient tax administration in Europe and the post-Soviet region in terms of the proportion of tax administration costs to income from taxes, at 0.35%. At present, all processes related to entrepreneurial activities between the tax administration and taxpayers are largely digitalized. Entrepreneurs can simply pay their taxes on the internet, meaning they do not encounter any bureaucratic problems and transparency is assured. This all leads to time savings and cost reductions. Suffice to say, the Ministry of Taxes is the leading government agency in providing the most e-services under the “electronic government" policy in our country.</p><h4>In the World Bank's Doing Business report, Azerbaijan's tax system was described as an area with positive dynamics. Is this a green light for investors?</h4><p>The role of Azerbaijan in providing global energy security is steadily growing. The increase in oil revenues leads to an increase in the capabilities of our country in the geopolitical arena. On the other hand, it has positive impacts on the development of the non-oil sector in Azerbaijan. I would like to stress the fact that the development of the non-oil sector is the main priority direction of our state policy. Azerbaijan is striving to achieve the overall development of the country, establish a diversified economy, reduce the dependence of state income on the oil sector in the future, and increase non-oil revenues by efficiently using energy resources to invest in the non-oil sector. In the coming years, the main targets of the government's economic policy include deepening the diversification policy in the non-oil sector, raising the competitiveness of the economy, improving its structure and levels of foreign trade, reforming investment policy while developing infrastructure and innovation activities, and ensuring the development of human capital. As a key factor affecting the business environment, the number of taxes have decreased, and rates on major types of taxes are nowadays lower than the European average. Entrepreneurs involved in the agricultural production sector have been exempt from all taxes except the land tax. This foundation aims to enhance Azerbaijan's non-oil export capacity as well as attract foreign investment.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Dominican Republic placed within the region in terms of the competitiveness and maturity of the technological field?</h4><p>I believe there is a lot of potential in the Dominican Republic in terms of the evolution of ICT. One way to develop it is with enterprise companies. These companies evolved in 2011 in terms of usage of ICT as a mechanism for business development. These companies are using ICT to provide more services to their customers. Take the banking, insurance, and mining sectors, for example; they have many uses for ICT and are pushing hard to provide more services. This type of usage would be the average across the region; however, there are still many opportunities for ICT to develop across SMEs that could be used to increase services and make them more agile.</p><h4>How big an influence has piracy had on the take up of the Windows operating system in the Dominican Republic when compared to the other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America?</h4><p>The usage of Microsoft Plus! is one of the highest in the region. Although Microsoft products have a high penetration rate, piracy remains a problem. This country has one of the highest rates of pirated software use in the region, close to 74%. The problem is SMEs, because these types of companies make up the majority. We need to educate SME owners that ICT is an investment that will make their businesses more agile and prosperous. However, the government is willing to work with us and we are making progress. It is important to understand that piracy affects everyone, not only Microsoft. Piracy affects the technology industry as well as the music and film and arts industry. In the end, piracy has a negative effect on the economy as well as the knowledge economy of a country, thus hindering innovation.</p><div class="quote">“We are working with many organizations in the country to show SME organizations that ICT is an investment and not an expense."</div><h4>How are you educating small- and medium-sized organizations, and what has been the response?</h4><p>We are working with many organizations in the country to show SME organizations that ICT is an investment and not an expense. The response has been modest so far; however, I think this government is looking to focus on formalizing these organizations. I believe this kind of movement in conjunction with the industry will support development. The best way to create prosperity is to improve business for SMEs, and this is a goal that we share with the government. A huge focus we have as a company now is the cloud and how it can specifically help SMEs prosper. We have the most complete cloud solutions for SMEs to “feel and act big," while enjoying the same benefits and flexibility with ICT as the larger companies.</p><h4>The products of the year are Microsoft Office 365 and Cloud Services. What are the expectations in the Dominican Republic for these new applications?</h4><p>This is one of the most intense years for Microsoft that I have seen. I have been in this industry for more than 19 years, 15 of them with Microsoft. I have never seen such intensity in product development. The number of new products we are delivering to the market is amazing. We have already launched Office 365, and Windows 8 was launched globally on October 26, 2012. Recently, we launched the new Windows Phone through the largest operator. We will also launch additional cloud services soon. A huge amount of innovation is happening in the Dominican Republic. If you think of the savings in terms of energy and availability that cloud solutions bring, it is just amazing for this country. The government is even running its infrastructure using our Cloud services. In 2011, Microsoft grew by 24% in the Dominican Republic and the country's economy grew 4%. That Microsoft is growing by 24% shows the acceleration the country is experiencing in ICT. We are one of the fastest-growing companies in the Caribbean.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent does the Zambezi River Valley have the potential to be the food basket for Mozambique?</h4><p>The valley accounts for 27% of national GDP, and about one-quarter of the population lives there. In terms of water, mobility, and agricultural potential, it is the country's agricultural flagship and has a mission to grow. The main pillar of the valley is the Zambezi River and the resources along its banks. Currently, there are few commercial farming areas in the valley, but people are starting to do more, and the potential to grow is very apparent.</p><h4>What are your key priorities as an agency?</h4><p>Whether they are central government or provincial, to understand what our priorities are as we compile a focus on business, fisheries, the infrastructure of agricultural development, and how to support these areas. We consider the training of people and develop local entrepreneurship. Through the collaboration of the government and its ministries, we have prepared an investment plan for the next five years. Under that umbrella, we have also looked to development entities as potential partners. First, we drafted a roadmap to come up with a project called Agri-Fisheries Development Policy Operation (AFDPO). We submitted a project, appraised a budget, signed a contract, and established a project management unit. We agreed to set up seven policy areas where the government is already introducing reforms to increase development in agriculture and fisheries. As part of the agreement, our departments will receive three installments of $50 million from the World Bank. If everything goes well, we'll see our first installment of $50 million in 2013, and the other two will come in 2014 and 2015.</p><div class="quote">“The valley accounts for 27% of national GDP, and about one-quarter of the population lives there."</div><h4>When the Zambezi Valley Development Agency receives its first installment from the World Bank in 2013, to what projects will funds be allocated?</h4><p>We need to work on all the processes of creating a production base, such as irrigation schemes that will unlock places where more production is possible. A second goal is to work toward the supply side in terms of seed and fertilizer. We have other areas of activity that provide enough balance for people to buy inputs and equipment. The government has just approved the mechanization strategy, which entails the establishment of servicing centers where people can carry out entrepreneurship activities. The private sector needs support for these kinds of investment. For our fisheries, we are focused on investing in new agricultural sectors, the production of small fisheries, and the creation of infrastructure to foster this development. It is important to have the appropriate infrastructure and storage. Some of the funds will be used for the private sector to provide services and the public sector to do business—from when the fish are caught until they are sold on the market. Other funds fall into two categories: public expenditures such as power lines or services, and private sector goods such as capital or investments.</p><h4>How are you combating challenges in obtaining land, accurate statistics, and data to allow investors to make informed decisions?</h4><p>While true that it is not easy to secure land, it's also true that we have to attract serious and appropriate investors. We have received many expressions of intent, but most of them are from consultants. I alone cannot do what is needed to ensure we secure proper investors. People discuss land because they know it is an asset and they try to secure as much as they need. On the desk of the Minister of Agriculture, there are no large projects still waiting for land. We did a survey of all the main provinces, complete with zoning exercises, which reinforces our plan and shows which land is available for what and for who. The agency is also clarifying the mechanism of assessing plans to make sure investments correlate with the land certain investors seek to secure. Suppose an investor wants to establish a sugar mill; we will ask what size and capacity, and then estimate the amount of sugar cane a producer will need. From there, we can recommend the required area and investment required.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Aamal in Qatar and the scope of its operations?</h4><p>The Aamal Company was founded in Qatar in early 2001 as a private shareholding company with limited liability. In 2007, Aamal became a public shareholding company listed on the Qatar Exchange, with a paid-up capital of QAR3.45 billion, making it one of the largest public shareholding companies in Qatar. The company has since increased its paid-up capital to QAR6 billion. Aamal is widely diversified with operations across 21 business units, some of which have been operating in Qatar for more than 40 years, achieving strong, market-leading positions. We are a successful group, staffed with over 2,300 employees, and are considered to be a role model for many other companies in the region. Our 22 business units are grouped into four divisions. The first is industrial manufacturing, which includes branches and subsidiaries that are involved in the manufacturing of many products needed for the development of infrastructure, from ready-mix and cement blocks, to concrete pipes and electrical cables. This division includes our companies Aamal Readymix, Aamal Cement Industries, Advanced Pipes &amp; Casts Company, Innovative Lighting, Senyar Industries Qatar Holding, Doha Cables, Elsewedy Cables Qatar, Doha Transformers, Ci-San Trading, and Gulf Rocks. The second division is trading and distribution, which is involved in the trading and distribution of pharmaceuticals, healthcare products, medical equipment, tires, lubricants, air conditioners, and home appliances. This division includes Aamal Trading &amp; Distribution, Aamal Medical, Ebn Sina Medical, Good Life Chemist, and Foot Care Centre. The third division is property. Branches in this division are involved in retail, residential, and commercial property management and development. This division includes City Centre Doha, and Aamal Real Estate. The final division is managed services, which offers the highest quality services to the corporate sector. This division includes Aamal Travel and Tourism, Aamal Services, ECCO Gulf, Johnson Controls Qatar, and Vivantes Medical Centre.</p><h4>What strategies have allowed you to become a market leader?</h4><p>Aamal's success is the result of a strategy designed to identify key growth opportunities, capitalize on them through the deployment of capital, and partner with industry leaders, who provide the required level of expertise when necessary. We aim to be the first mover in the market, and offering innovative products and services is a key element in our strategy. Aamal's diversified approach is a source of strength; we are providing both a degree of stability and a platform to take full advantage of these opportunities. Aamal's corporate strategy is to create long-term shareholder value through the continued profitable operation and expansion of its diversified business platform. The company seeks to take advantage of the growth opportunities created by the Qatar National Vision 2030, and to leverage its position as a leading participant across various key economic sectors to achieve sustained, profitable growth in three ways: an increased focus on industrial manufacturing and related high-growth sectors to capitalize on significant demand arising from the wider industrialization of the Qatari economy; continued growth, diversification, and innovation across other existing businesses to enhance market position and optimize performance; and the continued application of clear and disciplined operational and financial principles, underpinning our strategic growth initiatives.</p><div class="quote">“The economic development of Qatar has been remarkable."</div><h4>What is the story behind Al Faisal Holding's diversification?</h4><p>Before the Emir came to power, he had a vision, and we as businesspeople have to follow suit and contribute to this vision. When the economy was booming, there were small companies with limited resources. The companies that were able to expand their resources and capabilities as well as hire more people keep up with the growth of the economy. Al Faisal was one of the companies that was able to achieve this. Now we feel comfortable that we can keep up with demand. After restructuring within the company, we were able to diversify, focusing on hospitality, trading, real estate, construction, education, and other sectors. We felt we'd outgrown the country and that we could expand regionally and globally. We're doing well with that, and we've succeeded.</p><h4>What are the advantages of having a vertically integrated strategy?</h4><p>Aamal is one of the largest, most diversified, and fastest-growing companies in Qatar, offering high-quality exposure to the Qatar growth story. We apply excellence to all of our activities by acting transparently, with integrity, and with the drive to exceed expectations. Our effective corporate decision-making and short lines of communication with operational management, along with the development of our shared services policy, allows divisional management to focus on core business. Each of Aamal's subsidiaries is managed as a stand-alone entity, optimizing the management's operational focus and transparency. Our talented and motivated managers have significant experience and strong customer relationships in their respective areas. Clear segregation between management and ownership reinforces best practice corporate guidelines. With these strategies, Aamal aims to be recognized as a leader and innovator in the industry sectors where we operate, excelling in service delivery and professionalism to meet and exceed the expectations of all stakeholders.</p><h4>Which branches and companies of your group stand out as the most dynamic?</h4><p>We try to maintain a balance and support all companies in the group so that no companies are left behind. All of the companies are on the same level, and their growth is based on the quality of their workforces and human resources. We focus heavily on manufacturing, hospitality, health, education, and charity work through the Al Faisal Without Borders Charity Foundation. In health, we just signed an MoU with a large German company, Vivantes, in the medical sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment climate in Qatar?</h4><p>Over the last few years, the economic development of Qatar has been remarkable. The country has become one of the world's fastest-growing and most successful economies as markets continue to diversify and the country's infrastructure continues to develop. The vision of HH the Emir, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, to develop Qatar into one of the region's leading economic powers, remains at the heart of our business. Aamal is as determined as ever to play a major role in the realization of this and the Qatar National Vision 2030, and to be a major beneficiary of the nation's success.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the industrial sector in Qatar?</h4><p>Aamal is successfully positioned as a predominantly industrial company. Aamal is well placed to capture the opportunities that are being afforded by the rapidly developing Qatari economy. The economy's growth is being driven by a significant infrastructure and industrial development program as part of the government's Qatar National Vision 2030 that is seeking to diversify the country away from its substantial, long-term hydrocarbon reserves into alternative and sustainable avenues of growth. Qatar is expected to spend upward of $150 billion on infrastructure alone in the next five years. Furthermore, Qatar has attractive demographics with its rapidly expanding population stimulating further economic growth. Aamal successfully repositioned itself by placing a greater emphasis on industrial manufacturing by expanding its industrial manufacturing capacity to take full advantage of Qatar's modernization and heavy capital investment in infrastructure. This strategy continues to make progress with net profits at our industrial manufacturing division rising 27.8% in 1Q2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, helping to underpin a rise in earnings per share in excess of 8%.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans for Aamal?</h4><p>Although Aamal is now principally an industrial manufacturing company, we will continue to follow our policy of diversification across a number of non-manufacturing sectors. Our strength is in our diversity, and this is what makes Aamal so distinctive. It is important that we remain market leaders in the areas we operate in as they offer significant potential growth as the Qatari economy continues to evolve. We are uniquely positioned to be able to offer comprehensive and well-balanced exposure to the Qatar growth story, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Petroamazonas contributed to the success story of Ecuador?</h4><p>Petroamazonas has been exponentially growing since it was established in 2006. We have gone from producing 88,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to around 320,000 bbl/d at the moment. In 2013, we expect to close the year with 325,000 bbl/d. After several business agreements, our company currently manages 65% of the overall oil production in Ecuador, and we are the main company managing Ecuador's oil strategy. We have to keep in mind that about 30% of the country's budget comes from oil production, which means that we are a key player in the national economy, and, therefore, we play a vital role in the development of the country.</p><h4>What is your expected investment for 2013?</h4><p>We have a $3.2 billion investment budget for 2013; this is very indicative of the level of investment we dedicate every year to consolidate and increase oil production in Ecuador. Part of the budget is designated to explore new potential oil fields that will enable Ecuador to increase its oil reserves. At the same time, we will conduct more perforation and facilities installation work in 2013 in order to keep up the oil production figures of recent years. In other respects, we have operative expenses of around $1.2 billion.</p><div class="quote">“We are a relatively young company and, therefore, our focus has been on consolidating our presence in Ecuador."</div><h4>How many fields does the company currently operate?</h4><p>We have 13 oil fields in Eastern Ecuador, plus three other fields on the coast as well as natural gas operations in the Amistad field, in the Gulf of Guayaquil.</p><h4>What roles does Petroamazonas play in the development of the Refinery of the Pacific project, and what will be the impact of the project in the industry?</h4><p>The main activity of Petroamazonas is exploration and production work in oil fields, and, therefore, we expect to become the main supplier of the new refinery plant. In this context, the main future developments are focused on opening potential oil fields in mid-2013. We have been working very hard to put together a very ambitious team with other investors in order to present attractive and ambitious proposals for the Southeastern blocks to the Hydrocarbons Secretary. Petroamazonas definitely thinks it can play a key role in the future development of the industry in the country. We foresee these processes as very relevant for the company's activity and the expansion of our business presence in the industry.</p><h4>What role can neighboring countries play in Petroamazonas' future growth strategy?</h4><p>We are a relatively young company and, therefore, our focus has been on consolidating our presence in Ecuador. In fact, this has been a period of large and sustainable growth, which made us pay special attention to our business structure. However, we have already approached some neighboring oil companies in the region, as it is the next natural step in our growth, and we have held positive conversations with companies such as Ecopetrol  Petroperu, and Enap, among others. We believe that we will become stronger as we start consolidating formal and business partnerships with other oil companies, both public and private, in other countries. We think that in the short to the medium term we could enter foreign markets.</p><h4>What challenges does the oil industry face in Ecuador to maintain its development?</h4><p>In our opinion, there are several challenges facing our operations and the industry in the country, including maintaining sustainable oil production levels in existent fields, optimizing resources and production levels in Ecuador, performing enhanced oil recovery works in mature fields using the most up-to-date technology, and strengthening exploration works, which would enable Petroamazonas to expand its operations and the country to increase its oil reserves. We have been a pioneer company in terms of applying new technologies in the sector and we will continue doing so. Also, another challenge for the company is its internationalization over the medium term, which is something we are already working on. Today, our company is already internationally recognized, and we want to expand our presence abroad.</p><h4>How would you assess the future development of the oil industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The oil industry plays a very important role in the national economy and will keep doing so in the near future. However, the government is increasing its efforts to diversify the economy by boosting industrial activity and promoting a change in the energy matrix. I believe the national economic panorama will gradually change in Ecuador; however, the oil industry will continue to play a key role overall. In this context, we will see a further technology advance in the industry and the national economy.</p><h4>What is the size of your workforce at the moment?</h4><p>In December 2012, we had 1,500 employees; however, once we finally took over Petroproduccion's activity, we increased that figure to around 5,000 people. Overall, I believe we are one of the largest employers in the country.</p><h4>Is it easy to find a qualified workforce for the industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>It is hard to find a technical and qualified work force for the industry not only in Ecuador, but worldwide. The current demand for qualified workers at the international level is very high, and Ecuador is no exception in this context.  We are working on training new, young professionals to face the future of the industry.</p><h4>How does Petroamazonas engage with local communities in the regions where it operates?</h4><p>Since our first day of operations, we have implemented social and community programs with local communities that are directly related to the areas where we operate. These programs offer support to local communities from different perspectives such as health, education, economics, and social welfare. In this context, we have to praise the government's effort, which is dedicating 12% of the industry surplus to the development of local communities.</p><h4>Could you describe your business relationship with Petroecuador?</h4><p>In 2011 we started a process of upgrading the systems and processes of the national oil companies. That initiative led to an in-depth report on both companies, which concluded that it would be better for one company to focus its activities on the upstream segment, and the other one on the downstream. Petroamazonas was named the company with the highest levels of technology in its systems and processes of infrastructure, as well as the enterprise with the most integrated and stable management system in order to take over Petroecuador's upstream activities. Overall, we have absorbed the business activities of four public companies already. So far, we have been in charge of Petroecuador's activities for several months, and we are pleased with the results. However, there is still a lot of work to do.</p><h4>What steps should the government take for the further development of the energy industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>Petroamazonas only executes oil policies adopted by the government, and we do not take part in the decision-making process. In this context, we follow the guidelines drawn up by the government, which aims at repowering the oil and energy industry so it can be the basis on which the country sustains its diversification and development in all sectors. I believe that is the right decision and the government has intelligently proven that it knows how to manage the economic resources of our industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Port of Salalah developed and grown in recent years?</h4><p>The interesting aspect of the Port of Salalah in an Omani context, and even regionally, is that it is purely market driven. Two shipping lines approached the government suggesting a world-class container port in that particular location. Because of this, it was almost a guaranteed success. If the market says there is a huge need and is willing to invest its own money, then further business will follow. Since the launch of operations in 1999 until 2012, the results are 665% growth in container volume and over 600% growth in general cargo volume. There are massive opportunities for the location and for the country. The company was formed in 1997 by a joint venture between the Omani government and two of the largest international shipping lines—Sea-Land and Maersk—and immediately listed on the Muscat Security Market. Between 1999 and 2001, A.P. Mí¸ller went through a series of acquisitions and restructuring, and what emerges today is APM Terminals, one of the world's largest terminal operators for both inland and onshore terminals. It is a 30% shareholder and manages the day-to-day operations at the port. The entire weight of the A.P. Mí¸ller group and its expertise in all areas is behind the Port of Salalah.</p><h4>How significant an advantage comes from your relationship with APM Terminals?</h4><p>We have access to expertise, training materials, and learning experiences from other ports. At the same time, there is also a major advantage for APM Terminals in having Port of Salalah in its portfolio, because it is a multi-user facility that is very focused on the market. We bring commercial connections to the table. It has been a very good relationship on both sides. Omanization in skilled jobs at the Port of Salalah is 70%, and we are very pleased that today the majority of mid-level and senior staff are indigenous. We actively train Omanis by sending them to work in other ports around the APM Terminals' network in addition to bringing in world-class expertise to train our people here in Oman. They also participate in our management training programs at international business schools like IMD or APM Terminals' internal development courses such as MAGNUM and RMDP, where the aspiring leadership travels for training at several ports over the years for development in leadership, port operations, commercial and financial skills, and more.</p><div class="quote">“The Port of Salalah provides the fastest connection times to the Indian Ocean Basin."</div><h4>How did the port perform in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012 we had a fantastic year, growing by 13% on the container side and 11% on the general cargo side. We achieved 3.62 million TEUs, which is the highest that the port has ever achieved. We also handled 7.2 million tons of general cargo, which is again the highest that the port has ever handled. Now, we are starting an expansion that is going to be completed by the end of 2013. That will give us far more capacity on the dry bulk side, but it will also triple our liquid bulk capability, which has become a very popular product. We have already essentially pre-sold around 65% of that capacity. The expansion will give us 1,200 meters more berth. However, in reality what it will do is allow us to really support local businesses, such as the mining companies in particular on the dry bulk side, to grow their volumes drastically. We expect to double our mineral dry bulk throughput by mid-2015. Right now, we have just over 2 million tons of liquids handled annually, and I expect that will be 4.5 million tons by the time the expansion is operating in its first year.</p><h4>How important is the success of the Salalah Free Zone for the port?</h4><p>It is absolutely vital. To me, it is not about how much money gets invested in an area, but about how much activity a company will see through the local economy annually. A successful free zone is in the port's interests, and vice versa. Without the ports' direct connectivity to 60 global markets by over 3,200 ships annually, the free zone customers would have a difficult time transporting their products to markets. Supporting the free zone in attracting businesses to set up in Salalah is one of the pillars of our strategy. We have grown our Commercial Department by 200% to support that.</p><h4>How important is the port's investment in technology to its operational success?</h4><p>We have millions of dollars in technology investments ongoing. We have just finished the development of a new terminal operating system for our general cargo terminal, which will add value to the port and to our customers, who will be able to receive real-time information on their commodities and vessels. This will allow the customers better efficiency out of their supply chain and improve their competitiveness. Furthermore, on the container terminal side we have had the market leader in terminal systems, NAVIS, installed for years. It uses algorithms to reduce the driving distances of the trucks at the port, positions the vessels along the berth in the best spot possible to reduce the overall cost of operations, and automatically assigns jobs to the most efficient location or staff member. The port has just signed a contract to install differential GPS units in all of our equipment to ensure the highest levels of efficiency and planning. All of these investments are just the foundation for a platform called SmartYard, which APM Terminals has developed. Now that we have optimized the ships and the trucks, SmartYard will optimize the yard cranes and allow a reduction in waste of up to 30%, which translates into cost savings for our customers. At the same time, we are also working together with the government on putting 70 yard cranes onto the electrical grid rather than having them driven by diesel engines, which will save the environment around 16,000 tons of CO2 a year, and save the government more than $2 million a year in fuel subsidies. There is further technology investment in other sections of the business that will take us closer to our goal of being the port of choice that local and global customers use to connect their businesses.</p><h4>What advantages do shipping lines stand to gain from utilizing the port?</h4><p>The shipping lines gain automatically because they utilize the Port of Salalah as a hub, making us a network that can save them time and money. The Port of Salalah provides the fastest connection times to the Indian Ocean Basin and throughout the entire East African-Indian Gulf with the main trade lanes of Asia and Europe. That is where shipping lines can save their money, by taking these huge ships that generally have great economies of scale, and using a central location to get as close to the final market locations as possible. These network savings reach into the tens of millions of US dollars annually. Additionally, local Omani businessmen can use the backbone of the network to reach their markets. Essentially, it would be like living on the telephone company's internet connection. We provide major value to the lines, and then the local businesses get to piggyback on that.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the opening of the new Khalifa Port signify for Abu Dhabi?<br></h4><p>It is a new era, and the opening signals a new phase in social and economic development. Until Mina Zayed, access to the Abu Dhabi economy was limited. There were no means of transport other than overland or by air. Mina Zayed signaled the first signs of significant economic growth because for the first time there was direct international access by sea. It served that function for close to 40 years, and then Khalifa Port came along. There were several reasons that drive its construction and opening. If you look at capacity growth and urban planning, then port infrastructure and capacity had to move to a new location. Over the last four to five years, compound growth has accelerated. Considering Abu Dhabi until 2005-2006, it moved around 250,000 TEUs a year. Over the last six years, measured annual compound growth shows more than a 20% increase per year. It is somewhat disconnected from the global economic environment, and is largely driven by successful economic policies. The different sectors that we are actively invested in—tourism, oil and gas, steel, and transport, to name a few—are driving investment into infrastructure and also into the establishment of basic industries. Previously, everything was imported and nothing was made here. Now, our industries are starting to produce steel, plastic, aluminum, and pharmaceuticals. Growth is driven by exports rather than imports.</p><h4>What can customers expect when they come to the region's first semi-automated container terminal?</h4><p>They can expect the highest standards of service. The fact that the port is automated means that a lot of the variability has been taken out of the process. If you are a shipping line and you are scheduled to call at Khalifa Port, you know it will be efficient. Our productivity is higher per crane, per unit, and per hour than that of a normal, traditional manual port. We turn around trucks much faster than any other port in the region. It takes us only 15 minutes or so to get a truck in, loaded, and out—a normal port would take around 1-2 hours. By going to Khalifa Port you can deploy a truck 10 times a day, so you can move 10 containers instead of two. For trucking companies, this means they can increase revenues and optimize their assets.</p><div class="quote">“Our productivity is higher per crane, per unit, and per hour than that of a normal, traditional manual port."</div><h4>What trends have you noticed in regard to the amount of export cargo handling in recent years?</h4><p>In 2011, we had growth of 20% in year-on-year terms. From 2012 to 2013, it has only been 4% so far, but most countries around us have contracted. The fact there is more produced here means there are fewer finished products and more raw materials being imported. We see bulk cargo increasing, and we see exports on containers increasing because more products are being made here and exported. At the same time, because of the active investment in infrastructure, you see a lot of project cargo, such as heat exchanges, pipes, and other large goods used to build factories or power plants. Another sector that is experiencing growth is the cruise business, which is related to tourism. Five years ago, there were zero cruise passengers, but now we have 170,000 cruise passengers coming to Mina Zayed every year. The growth has been huge.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi terminals recently came to an agreement to offer a direct link to India through Khalifa Port. What is the mutual benefit of the agreement, and what do you think it signifies for Khalifa Port?</h4><p>There is a lot of historic trade between the UAE and India. It is necessary for us to have direct connections there from Khalifa Port and back just to support trade here. Every time we expand the amount of destinations we reach from the port, we are enhancing the network. The bigger the network, the more attractive we are as a port. Every time we can publish we are expanding coverage here, we have a shipping line including Khalifa Port as a destination, which again increases our attractiveness.</p><h4>How would you compare Abu Dhabi to Asian and European transport hubs?</h4><p>Potentially, we can play a similar role. As a hub, we can provide a consolidation and distribution function for the region. I think that is the role we will play in the future. If the rail connection is there, it means you can get anywhere on the Arabian Peninsula from Abu Dhabi. Whether you go to Saudi Arabia or Oman, you will only have to stop in Abu Dhabi. Discharge your containers here and do the rest by rail. Hong Kong plays that role for Far East Asia and Singapore plays that role for Southeast Asia, while Rotterdam and Hamburg play that role for northern Europe. There is a limited amount of places in the world that can play that role; Abu Dhabi can be one of them.</p><h4>What is it that makes the city an attractive destination for cruise ships?</h4><p>It is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for tourists. There are more things to do; the theme parks, the hotels, the resorts, it is very similar to Dubai in that sense. You can come in winter and catch some sun, and we have Ferrari World as well. It seems to appeal to a lot of people. There are many attractions being built; Saadiyat is huge. By the time that is finished it will be a massive tourism attraction, with shopping as well. It is a very purpose-driven sector in the economy that wasn't there before. It has been created through demand. There was nothing there before.</p><h4>How will Khalifa Port contribute to Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030?</h4><p>There is a policy to diversify the economy away from oil and gas dependency. If you look at the GDP figures over 2012, non-oil GDP has been growing much faster than oil GDP, so it is working. We are growing industries that were not here before. The port was only there to serve the local market in the past. Now, we are building a business, which is not only related to Abu Dhabi, but for other destinations as well: transshipment. There is a lot of revenue that the port will drive that was not captive for Abu Dhabi before. We are building a business and an industry. We are contributing to the sector already. However, I think the most important part is that it needs to accommodate and not limit economic growth. It needs to drive it.</p><h4>What significance do environmental concerns hold in your day-to-day operations?</h4><p>The port industry is not a major polluter, but of course we monitor our emissions as well as soil and water pollution. However, most of what we do is considered to be fairly green. We analyze how we can reduce the amount of energy we consume per unit that we handle. We try to electrify as much as we can instead of using diesel-based equipment. We are looking at alternative energy resources. The difference between Khalifa Port and Mina Zayed is massive. We went from an emission of 40 kilograms of carbon per container at Mina Zayed to 16-18 kilograms per container at Khalifa Port. Of course, alternative energy is a long-term investment because the price of traditional energy here is so low. We could run the entire Khalifa Port on four or five windmills. However, we would need a combination of solar and wind power.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Japan has been a long-time partner of Mozambique in pursuing the social and economic development of the country. It is my belief that the ties between Mozambique and Japan will remain strong and that the partnership will have a significant impact not only on the two countries, but also on regional development.</p><p>The history of Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Mozambique goes back to 1975. In the ensuing decades, the priority of Japanese ODA was placed on the health and education sectors, with an aim to fulfill the basic human needs of the people of Mozambique and reduce poverty. Mozambique still faces many challenges in promoting sustainable and inclusive development, as seen in the latest Human Development Index (Human Development Report, 2011), which rates Mozambique 184th out of 187 countries. However, the country is blessed with abundant natural resources and agricultural potential, and it is crucial that they are utilized to the maximum extent to promote business activities, which will lead to sustainable economic growth, the fruits of which must be shared equitably among the people. JICA has been, and will remain, Mozambique's partner in this important challenge.</p><h4>TRIGGERING INTEGRATED REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h4><p>JICA has been playing a vital role as the comprehensive implementing body of Japanese ODA. In 2003, JICA inaugurated its Mozambique office in Maputo, which enables JICA to have even closer communication with government officials and understand the situation and needs of the people of Mozambique. JICA's cooperation has been accelerated by the introduction of concessional ODA loan operations in Mozambique in 2007, which has made possible the development of large infrastructure that is indispensable for regional connectivity and economic development.</p><p>One such example is the development of the Nacala Corridor and the Maputo Corridor, which both aim to promote integrated regional development. The Nacala Corridor development program, jointly implemented by JICA and Mozambican institutions, has the following three features: the development of Nacala Port by utilizing its natural geographical attributes, the invigoration of trade with neighboring landlocked countries, and agricultural development along the Nacala Corridor.</p><p>First of all, Nacala Port's depth of more than 14 meters makes it accessible for Post-Panamax container ships without dredging. Located inside the bay, it has the advantage of being protected from high waves as well. Its advantage stands out among the major African ports, with favorable access to Asia. For example, travel times to Asian ports such as Hong Kong and India from Nacala Port are shorter by approximately two days than the travel time from Durban Port. The development of Nacala will also greatly benefit neighboring landlocked countries, which are currently using Durban as their hub.</p><p>The second feature is a regional approach to the development of the Nacala Corridor. The development of road infrastructure linking Nacala—port city and gateway to northern Mozambique—to Malawi's capital of Lilongwe and Zambia's capital of Lusaka is expected to increase the distribution of goods, activate regional economies, improve the livelihoods of residents, and alleviate poverty. Goods from Malawi, for example, are now transported to Durban Port, some 2,300 kilometers away. Travel distance will be shortened to 950 kilometers with the development of Nacala Port. Together with the improvement of transport infrastructure such as roads and railways and the construction of a distribution center, Nacala Port's potential will be maximized to accelerate not only Mozambique's business activities, but also the economic development of the region. In addition to infrastructure development, the introduction of effective customs clearance systems is expected to shorten transportation time, thereby reducing transportation costs. Based on an agreement between the three countries—Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia—on the development of this international economic corridor, JICA is also working in close partnership with the governments of Malawi and Zambia to increase investment opportunities in the region through regional collaboration.</p><p>Thirdly, the region along the Nacala Corridor has abundant agricultural potentials. JICA has more than 30 years of experience in the agricultural development of the savannah grasslands of Brazil, which has a similar climate and geographical features of those of the Nacala Corridor region. What was once barren land in Brazil was transformed into one of the world's largest breadbaskets, the vital role of which in ensuring food security became evident in the time of serious drought in the US in 2012. Based on the experience and knowledge of Japan and Brazil, there is a potential that the farmlands alongside the Nacala Corridor will become yet another breadbasket of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On October 4, 2012, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of peace, dialogue, tolerance, and reconciliation. On this 20th anniversary, we are a people who continue to build a nation of prosperity and wellbeing in peace.<br></p><p>We continue with the promotion of dialogue within all sections of society, especially among political parties, the clergy, and business and professional organizations in seeking broad consensus to continue to build a united and prosperous nation that enjoys social harmony.</p><p>In the context of foreign policy, we successfully welcomed the 32nd Summit of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Heads of State and Government and the Comunidade dos Paí­ses de Lí­ngua Portuguesa (CPLP) to Mozambique. After hosting these events, we will assume the rotating presidency for the 2012-2013 period and the 2012-2014 period, respectively.</p><div class="quote">“Our homeland holds great potential in natural resources, with an emphasis on fishing, hydropower, forestry, and mining."</div><h4>NATURAL RESOURCES</h4><p>Our homeland holds great potential in natural resources, with an emphasis on fishing, hydropower, forestry, and mining. Resources are of great strategic importance in the fight against poverty through the impact that exploration will have on improving the quality of life of our wonderful people. The existence of natural resources does not mean, in itself, development. It does not mean instantaneous wealth. The discovery of natural resources is a promise of development. This promise still needs to be fulfilled. Indeed, it should follow a timeline that goes from discovery and identification to the preparation of technical, financial, and logistical procedures, right up until the products are placed on the market. Translating the development of natural resources into wealth can be a long process. There are as many as 23 billion tons of coal in Mozambique, but current production is only 4 million tons per year. This amount is still a long way off the 50 million tons that we intend to achieve in the medium term. The great promise of progress can catapult the Mozambican economy to new heights—heights that will bring with them the realization of collective expectations for improved standards of living. What can be said of coal is also valid for natural gas and other natural resources. In relation to natural gas, our annual capacity to produce has risen from 120 million to 183 million gigajoules (GJ). However, we are able to considerably increase this capability thanks to recent discoveries that put Mozambique among the top 10 countries in terms of reserves. The discoveries also offer the promise of development, which will impact our lives through the participation of Mozambicans. A correct identification of the structural challenges and the establishment of a proper strategy to overcome them are the real key that will enable the achievement of the better future we all seek—a Mozambique that is both free of poverty and increasingly prosperous.</p><p>Returning to the example of coal, the first challenge is to increase handling capacity at our port complexes. The current capacity for coal at Sena is 6 million tons. This is clearly below our potential. The government has drawn up an action plan aimed at increasing the flow capacity of the Sena coal line from 6 million to 25 million tons per year. For a long time, the Port of Beira has handled only 1.8 million tons, and has recently risen to 6 million. However, we want it to reach a capacity of 18 million tons per year in 2014.</p><p>The amount of discovered resources, ranging from coal to natural gas through a variety of other natural resources, including forests and water resources, are challenging the country in new ways. These areas of economic development will require huge numbers of professionals from various specialties. An important step toward addressing this challenge was the approval of a strategy to shape and build human resources capacity between 2010 and 2024, which envisages the training of technicians, especially in the geosciences. Recognizing the importance of developing human capital to sustain Mozambique's socio-economic development, we have implemented, with the participation of social partners and civil society, the broad Education Reform Program, which aims to change the current paradigm of vocational training so that it fits the current needs of the labor market. The involvement of the productive sector is also fundamental in ensuring sustainability in the system. In this regard, the government encourages the participation of companies in the finance sector through the various mechanisms established, including the development of partnerships between businesses and training institutions.</p><p>To complement the other activities of formation, we have ensured, through a strategy on employment and vocational training, the training of technicians to meet the challenges that the sustainable exploitation of natural resources raises. In this context, there have been over 30,000 beneficiaries in areas such as industrial maintenance, mechanical and electrical engineering, and metalworking.</p><p>Another challenge identified in order to facilitate the achievement of development and the promise of more wealth following the discovery of natural resources is growing the capacity of the public sector for good governance. In fact, the institutions of the state are challenged to enhance their ability in planning, direction, program implementation, and supervision of autonomous and private institutions.</p><h4>NATURAL RESOURCES &amp; MIDDLE CLASS FORMATION</h4><p>A further challenge is to realize the promise of wealth that the discovery of natural resources implies, and the creation of a flourishing Mozambican middle class. But to achieve this, we need to overcome a series of obstacles. Firstly, there is arequirement from the natural resources industry for goods and services currently absent from our market. Secondly, for a large part, the experience of our businesses is still embryonic with regards to conception, feasibility, and management. There is also a lack of capital among our businessmen to invest in projects of great scale. With the creation of ENH Logistics, we want to provide logistics services to the hydrocarbon sector with Mozambican capital, securing the training of domestic staff and the creation of local competencies. Our vision is that in the long term, Mozambicans will be the overwhelming majority in these business units. In the same framework, we will create an institution dedicated to logistical services in the mining industry, which will be the vehicle through which we ensure Mozambican participation in mining. Similarly, we have been encouraging associations and trade unions to continue to expand opportunities for social dialogue. We have also been working toward the resolution of labor disputes at all levels in the workplace, seeking harmonized solutions to day-to-day challenges. Also, during the formation of the middle class in Mozambique, we will continue to support private sector development through the consolidation and improvement of the legal and institutional framework on markets and prices.</p><h4>NATURAL RESOURCES &amp; INCOME REDISTRIBUTION</h4><p>Total state revenues in 2013 will be reflected in the recently approved state budget for the year, which represented growth of around 19%. It corresponds to around 24% of predicted GDP for 2013. The contribution to mega projects from state revenues from January to November 2012 stood at around MZN5 million, equivalent to 5.5% of total revenue collected. This is 91% higher than over the same period in the previous year. The target of the majority of these investments was the natural resources sector, including hydrocarbons and minerals. The sector was the recipient of MZN3.5 million, equivalent to 4% of the total. We forecast that in 2013 such investment will amount to 6% of total state revenues, representing a 33% increase compared to 2012. In this matrix, state contributions to the natural resources sector have risen to 4%, representing a 34% nominal increase compared to 2012. In 2004, 52% of the state budget was covered by internal resources. In 2012, we expect this figure to be 61% and to rise to 67% in 2013. This increasingly growing share of internal resources in the state budget demonstrates the successful effort that the government has been making to stimulate economic activity that forms the basis for taxation. The economic growth fueled by the exploitation of all natural resources that are being discovered generates an increased challenge to Mozambican society. The challenge is now to transform this growth factor into the constant improvement of living conditions, which depends on the adoption of mechanisms of redistribution of income criteria that integrate social justice and sustainability. The goal in this process of redistribution is to bring services closer to the citizens. At first, the redistribution of income from natural resources occurs with the ever-increasing absorption of Mozambicans into the workforce engaged in the exploration of these resources directly and indirectly through businesses that are being established to provide services. The young are the greatest beneficiaries of these jobs. Many are young entrepreneurs who, using their creative initiative, are taking advantage of the opportunities for job creation and self-employment. Additionally, redistribution occurs through tax mechanisms. Fees and taxes that the government collects from the extractive industries are applied to the provision of basic social services, for example, in education, health, the construction of economic infrastructure, public safety, and the provision of public services. The exploitation of natural resources to catalyze the growth of other economic sectors can be exemplified by looking at the tourism sector. Despite the global economic crisis, there has been an increasing number of beds. Thus, in 2011, we reached a threshold of more than 40,000 beds compared with just over 30,000 in 2010.</p><p>With satisfaction, we also note the increasing number of our fellow citizens with access to mobile phone services—from almost 8 million users in 2011 to well over 9 million in 2012. The Green Revolution and plans surrounding it also predict average annual growth of 7% and the duplication of global production in the next 10 years. Thanks to our commitment and performance, as a people, we have become self-sufficient in crops such as cassava and maize. More importantly, we used to import emergency food aid. Now, we are exporters of agrarian products that are “Made in Mozambique," such as bananas, which we export to South Africa and the Middle East, sugar, which we export to Europe, cotton, which we export to Asia and Europe, cashews, which we export to Asia, Europe, and the US, and sesame seeds, which we export to Asia.</p><p>Financial institutions present themselves as our partner in the implementation of the redistribution process. In this context, we see the expansion of the branch network inside Mozambique, the number of which has grown to 150 branches from 126 in 2010, as a success. As a result of this development, we have 18 commercial banks, seven credit cooperatives, and 191 micro finance institutions, a mesh that ensures the existence of at least one institution in all provincial capitals, in 66 of 128 districts, and in 43 municipalities, which contributes to the increase of the formal economy and higher savings.</p><h4>THE CHALLENGES FOR 2013</h4><p>The achievements made by each and all of us in the fight against poverty, until now, encourage us to continue being grounded in national unity, self-esteem, justice, peace, and multiparty democracy. We therefore reaffirm our determination to continue to develop multiple measures to streamline the implementation of our economic and social plan for 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Brazil has a special relationship with Mozambique. We are brotherly countries on account of historic and linguistic affinities that draw us close together. Today, both our governments seek economic development as a way to promote further social justice.<br></p><p>In recent years, Brazil stabilized its currency, restructured its finances, and—with the end of inflation—implemented additional measures to reduce social inequalities. We have achieved considerable success thus far. Through policies favoring revenue transfer—by means of the “Bolsa Famí­lia" program—35 million people were raised out of poverty. A new middle class flourished and began to spend more. This compelled national industry to increase production to the same extent. A virtuous cycle was created in which social investment brought along positive economic results as widespread national wealth increased.</p><p>That sense of domestic justice also pervades our action in other countries—after all, we should all be entitled to prosper and advance. Benefits ought to be mutual. Cooperation with Mozambique is conceived with this vision and sense of purpose. Our investment model focuses on its people and on the legacy to be left to the country. For example, the activity of the Brazilian company Vale at the Moatize coal mine is an eloquent example of such a beneficial type of cooperation. Indeed, another 35 companies explore ore in that region. Yet a differentiating factor of Brazilian mining is its investment in local human resources. Brazil and Mozambique are bound by the same language, which makes it easier to train workers in that sector. Vale has been investing in crucial infrastructure, particularly in establishing and expanding the railway to Nacala Port. There are billions of dollars at stake. The greatest gain, however, is that Brazil is getting even closer to Mozambique as we jointly plan solutions for the future development of our countries. For that reason, we encourage private entrepreneurship to provide investment in farming production and raise cattle   nearby the premises of the railroad up to Nacala.</p><div class="quote">“Enduring economic development requires constant evaluation and commitment to improvement with social awareness."</div><p>The Nacala Fund, a private initiative launched in July 2012 during my visit to the country, is geared toward attracting resources to finance food production projects. Brazil has come a long way to master some of those techniques. We were able to develop cultures adapted to the typical climate and soil of central Brazil. The Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa) has been responsible for producing crops in the Brazilian savannah—an area with considerable similarities to the African savannah. The cerrado is where the largest agricultural production currently takes place in Brazil—a region blessed by record harvests and exports. Likewise, Embrapa is assisting Mozambique in cultivating seed species adapted to that specific environment.</p><p>Enduring economic development requires constant evaluation and commitment to improvement with social awareness. Investments and economic projects should be the result of joint effort and partnership—always placing human needs at the heart of such endeavors. These actions should thus attempt to solve down-to-earth problems. Today, Africa is afflicted by AIDS. That is why the Brazilian government is engaged in sharing knowledge about antiretroviral medication production with other countries.</p><p>I was honored to witness the beginning of activities of the first factory for such medicines on the African continent based on Brazilian technology transfer and located in Mapula next to Maputo. By 2013 Mozambique will hopefully have the means to produce antiretroviral medicines. This factory is what might best symbolize the close cooperation between Brazil and Mozambique.</p><p>Motivated by such cooperative spirit, I foresee other inspiring projects within the framework of increased partnership. Nowadays, Brazilian technical cooperation is brought to other countries with the aim of sharing experience and improving the quality of life. Brazil has shown how to exert increasing influence in today's world mainly relying on soft power and the strength of solidarity. One way of reducing disparities worldwide is by sharing knowledge and test-proven techniques with a view to enhanced food security, health, and socioeconomic prosperity on behalf of us all. Brazil and Mozambique have deepened their ties and strengthened common action, which will benefit not only their own populations but also the spirit of cooperation underlying relations among members of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Australia's main interests in Mozambique?<br></h4><p>In recent years the Australian government has moved to step up its role in the world given the size of the country's economy and the range of our contacts across the globe. Australia has very specific interests in multilateral organizations. We're very present in the UN system, but there were some areas of the world that we had neglected a bit, especially in the non-English-speaking parts of Africa. We've now opened a few more embassies and are slated to open one in Senegal, but we needed to find a more creative way to expand our knowledge and to make contact with governments. I was asked to focus on Portuguese-speaking countries across the world, with a specific focus on those in Africa. I've spent the last year visiting and delivering our Prime Minister's message about Australia and learning what we can do for or with African nations to boost relations. Much cooperation is facilitated through scholarship programs, but also, in countries like Mozambique, we have growing commercial and investment interests. Mozambique has similarities to Australia, including the geography and the significance of natural and mineral resources, such as coal. The level of Australian FDI in Mozambique has really shot up. After a slow start, there are now about 14 Australian companies investing in Mozambique, and there are others coming all the time to have a look. We know Mozambique very well because we worked closely with its people during strife toward the end of the apartheid system, in which Mozambique was a frontline state. The level of trade is $420 million a year, but that can only increase. It's heading in the right direction.</p><h4>What commercial development assistance can Australia offer Mozambique?</h4><p>We think we can be very helpful. Our former Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering our full range of cooperation with Mozambique at the African Union (AU) Summit in Equatorial Guinea at the beginning of 2012. That document provides the priorities for our activities in Mozambique and includes aspects such as food security, which is the biggest part of our work in Africa. The bilateral agreement with Mozambique also outlines development in all sorts of areas, including water, sanitation, and mining. This is not just about helping with extraction, but building a modern mining sector. We've now sent quite a significant number of Mozambicans to do courses in Australia or on study tours. We hold a big event called “Africa Down Under" every year, which brings the African mining sector to Perth for a large conference. Mozambique has been an important participant at the conference. This is a real pillar of our relationship with Mozambique. Obviously, there is mutual interest as we want Mozambique to be an attractive place for Australian companies to invest and the authorities here also want Australian companies to invest in Mozambique. During 2012, through our support five Mozambicans attended the International Geological Congress.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Australia's relationship with Mozambique?</h4><p>When you decide to move to a deeper relationship with another country it takes a while to discover each other's priorities and how you are best suited to work together and how you might add some value to the deal. You start off thinking that you can do everything and are very ambitious, then you start to refine things and look at the details and do things that really add value. That's more than just offering 20 scholarships and saying “take your pick." We obviously offer education opportunities, but we also offer much more tailored opportunities. We'll have much more substance to what we do in the future. In an ideal world with an unlimited budget we would have a couple more embassies in Portuguese-speaking Africa. I am confident that will eventually have a bigger, permanent presence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate IDRO'S industrial development?<br></h4><p>IDRO was founded 45 years ago, and we have been inspired by Italy throughout our establishment. We studied industrial development in Italy and founded IDRO in Eni's footsteps. We have established different sectors of action such as machinery equipment for industrial and agricultural usage and the marine industry. I believe that IDRO has played a central role in Iran's industrial development. For example, among our sectors of action, we added the automotive industry after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and this sector has played an important role in Iran's industrial development. We know that we won't get to the point the large industrialized countries have reached in the short term, but for 45 years we've been trying to get closer to that level. Before the Revolution, we were investing in steel production—we had a contract with the former Soviet Union, producing in Isfahan, but the production was low. We produced less than 1 million tons per year; we switched our location, but again we had made several steps forward in the steel and cement production industry. In 1977, before the revolution, total cement production was 6.2 million tons per year; now, it is more than 70 million tons annually. Although we import steel, we are able to export steel and cement to other countries. Other fast-developing areas include the pharmaceutical, paper, sugar, packaging, and textile sectors. The food industry has also developed very rapidly in recent years.</p><h4>On which industries is your investment focused in 2012?</h4><p>Our main targets remain the oil and gas sector, railways, and transportation, as well as high-tech industries. The development of the country is based on two factors: the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) and Iran's 2025 Vision. In the FYDP, we are forecasting that $250 billion will be invested in the oil and gas sector. In that devised perspective, an organization such as IDRO, which focuses on machinery and relies on three sectors—oil and gas, railways, and high technology—can help the country develop further. Iran is a vast country that needs a functioning railway system due to its geographical location among the North-South-East-West corridor to connect and develop. This means not only trains, but also underground public transportation that will connect people within our cities. That is why we are focusing on these segments; it helps the country grow and develop. In terms of the maritime industry, Iran has extensive coastlines, and we have a duty to target the shipping industry as well. We have plans to build a servicing station and a factory for heavy machinery as part of a major port development project. Through these projects we aim to attract foreign investors and increase technology transfer between Iran and other countries.</p><h4>In the framework of the privatization program, how is IDRO supporting local private companies in the high-tech industry?</h4><p>Our organization supports companies and industrial players through an exchange of new ideas and know-how. We have contracts with universities, linking together professors, students, and entrepreneurs. If a student or a professor has an idea, we help them turn their business idea or new technology into an industrial project. We provide entrepreneurs with the machinery and equipment to realize their new projects, and this cooperation can range from a 0% to a 100% investment. In developed cities such as Tehran, our cooperation with local companies stands at a 40% or 50% maximum, but when it comes to cities that are less developed, we can invest and cooperate with local companies at up to 100% of the budget. Sometimes we need capital in order to invest and start new companies, which is why we link up with banks that offer loans with low interest rates.</p><h4>Which area of the industrial sector is in need of further investment?</h4><p>We need capital and investments in every sector. However, according to the FYDP, the target for investment in the energy sector is $250 billion, and the railway industry is slated for more than $33 billion in investment. We aim to direct capital toward the further development of power plants. In collaboration with the private sector, we are predicting progressive growth of 8% for the Iranian economy, and the industrial sector is the driver for other segments of the economy as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HEPCO represents the largest share of production, supply, and support for heavy machinery in Iran. What are some highlights from your experience in 2011, and how do they compare to overall trends in the industry?</h4><p>In comparison to 2011, we are increasing and promoting our business in the local market and are looking for new activities, while diversifying our business at the international level. HEPCO mainly focuses on the mining sector, providing machinery to mining companies. The mining sector has flourished in recent years, and the demand for machinery is very high. HEPCO is also looking seriously at opportunities arising from public sector contracts, allowing us to get more involved in the provision of machinery for the mining industry. We have also been looking at the agriculture sector, providing heavy combine harvesters and tractors. In terms of its work with municipalities, HEPCO has provided machinery to specialized affiliated enterprises, such as waste management companies. We would also like to get more involved in the petroleum sector in order to increase our market share in the industry. Our approach is to develop subsidiaries to work under this group in various sectors, while the HEPCO plant will be specialized in producing machinery for road construction.</p><h4>Which sectors is HEPCO most involved in?</h4><p>We are most heavily involved in road construction, but in the future we will concentrate more on mining. Agriculture is also increasing in significance. We will certainly be cooperating with international brands on road construction machinery, but for mining operations we need more cooperation from our international partners. In terms of constructing subways for the municipalities, we have to be more involved with constructing tunnel-boring machines (TBMs), and from this year on, we are going to be working with our partners to build some parts for TBMs in Iran. We have to increase our international cooperation with non-Iranian companies that are involved in supplying and supporting machinery for mining and TBMs. In Iran, the construction of subways is on the rise. Projects to develop subway systems have already begun in Tabriz, Ahvaz, Mashhad, and Shiraz. In addition to providing excavating machinery, HEPCO will also be engaged in manufacturing parts for subway carriages. Different varieties of TBMs are used depending on soil type. We tailor-build machinery depending on the unique conditions of each city. From now on, we are also going to specialize more and more on the design and construction of subway carriages.</p><h4>Why did you decide to specialize in this niche sector?</h4><p>We already have the necessary capacity to produce passenger carriages. HEPCO's main shareholder is Kowsar Wagon Construction Company, and we can tackle such projects together.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken by the government and the private sector to develop the local mining industry?</h4><p>The most critical element is to support exploration. The development of the mining industry depends on the exploration data available. Iran has the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), and in the near future the excavation ratio should be doubled. The FYDP outlines increased levels of investment in aluminum, copper, and iron ore. According to the FYDP, HEPCO will provide $800 million worth of machinery for this industry, which in our view is the most important element of the plan. We are interested in providing this kind of machinery, and the government is solidly supporting the private sector to be able to achieve the stated targets.</p><h4>What does HEPCO bring to the mining industry in terms of value-added compared to its competitors?</h4><p>HEPCO provides machinery to companies in order to begin excavation activities. We provide machinery for the mining of natural stone for residential use. Usually, around 30% to 40% of the stone mined is good to use, while the rest is rubble. However, we have introduced machinery that increase the usability ratio to 70% or 80%. In the past, miners used heavy loaders. Now, HEPCO has introduced more modern machinery and equipment that not only increases productivity, but also promotes value-added. Our backhoe loaders also cost one-third that of the normal heavy-duty loaders in the market. This equipment can be used in both iron ore and copper mines, reducing costs and upping productivity. With our new range of excavators and loaders, we are also looking to further decrease costs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013 and what are your expectations for the export market?</h4><p>We are optimistic. In terms of exports, the government is working to promote trade links for machinery sales. We hope that this, in turn, will improve our access to the parts that we need to import from abroad. The HEPCO team has continued developing the firm's capacity to export machinery to neighboring countries in the CIS region and also Iraq. We are currently working on an export development plan and, since the automotive industry in Iraq is flourishing, you will see a lot of Iranian cars and machinery in Iraq. We work to cater to the needs of contractors in foreign markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of Unilever's experience in 2011, and how can this market be compared to the complexity of Unilever's operations in the region?</h4><p>I cover Unilever's operations from Kazakhstan to Cyprus, and Iran joined this group in 2007. This is a rather complicated geography and each country has its own difficulties. That is why we aim to truly understand how to operate in each country. We can be flexible as long as Unilever's Code of Business Principles is strictly adhered to. Despite having a somewhat more complicated bureaucracy, we are very comfortable in Iran. It is a rewarding challenge to understand the country, the consumers, and how the market operates. I came here in 2007 and with my Sales Director I travelled throughout the country several times to better understand local consumers, their shopping habits, and the trade structure. This contributed significantly to our plans, which turned the business around to deliver profitable and sustainable growth since 2009.</p><h4>Over the past six years, how has the Iranian market changed and what trends have you observed with respect to the goods you are introducing to the local market?</h4><p>Iranian consumers are very conscious of the price-quality relationship, and they are ready to pay more for higher quality goods. Something produced abroad cannot simply be sold at any price—you have to deliver the right quality consistently. Iran has a very experienced and competitive industry in consumer goods. I can quantify the improvement in quality and the marketing skills of local businesses over the past five years. The quality of packaging has also become world class compared to other Central Asian states. Iran has a long history of trade and industry, and competition is welcomed and even encouraged. I believe the presence of multinationals not only accelerates market growth, but also the development of the local competition.</p><h4>How do you customize international brands and products to suit this unique market?</h4><p>We separate our goods into two categories: foods and home/personal care. The need for the customization of products in the second category is minimal. The same toothpaste, shampoo, or deodorant can serve the needs of the people in Korea, Iran, or Kazakhstan. However, this is less valid in the case of foods. When we launched Knorr, we developed seven different kinds of soups only for the Iranian market after months of consumer research and development. They are totally different from the soups we offer in Turkey.</p><h4>What strengths and weaknesses are you observing in the Iranian food industry?</h4><p>I see strengths, especially in the ice-cream segment. There are excellent ice-cream products; three or four local companies produce delicious ice cream at unbelievably low prices, and we are thinking about partnerships or acquisitions with these companies. The food segment here is much more advanced than anywhere else in the region.</p><h4>What strategies are you putting in place to handle the tough competition?</h4><p>We haven't perfected our strategy yet. We have a long way to go in terms of soups and bouillon, and it's hard to compete with the local producers by importing because the margins aren't huge. Partnership with local ice-cream producers could be one choice, but the market is fairly saturated and it would be a very costly battle. We aim to focus more on the home and personal care areas.</p><h4>How will you improve the presence of your personal and home care products?</h4><p>We are confident in the quality of all our products. I know it sounds cliché, but what we've been doing so far is proof of that. Unilever researches heavily and its products are well known; Iranians are aware of what's happening outside the country. The brands are known and the product is good, and we discovered how to bring the product to the consumer. On a weekly basis, we support 28 distributors operating 65,000 outlets throughout Iran. For a product such as body deodorant, there are no local competitors and people are eager to try new and different things. For home detergents, it is different; it is very expensive to import the products and we are thinking about investing locally. However, we believe in the quality of our products, and we are heavily investing and looking at the long term. We use ads and television to promote our products in order to establish our brands; our support budget this year was ‚¬15 million. Unilever will continue to invest as much as is necessary to establish its brands; growth is our priority, while profitability comes later.</p><h4>Which of your products is the most popular for the average Iranian consumer?</h4><p>Oils, deodorants, and shampoos are widely popular. Product sales in these categories have been growing steadily by 50% for the last four years. I believe that Iranians appreciate the quality of these products.</p><h4>What is your evaluation on the openness of the Iranian market with respect to international products and investors?</h4><p>I believe that the market should be more open. My advice would be to let there be competition. In terms of products, our prices are three times more expensive than the local variant, but we offer higher quality. There must be room for local producers to increase quality as well. I don't mind the exchange rate difference, but I am interested in investing more and increasing quality. I'm optimistic; I think that by the end of 2012 there will be more market activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did MM start operations in Iran?</h4><p>MM is the biggest producer of recycled carton board in the world, and the largest print and packaging group in Europe. We are going to expand our network all over the world, and we are trying to spot new areas where we can continue our business. The market is saturated in Europe and there's no room anymore to improve, expand, or make new investments. Therefore, we are looking for a new market. MM came to Iran in 2008 and started studying the market. Iran has big potential as a country and the consumption rate of all kinds of packaging is high. In 2009, the company was registered in Tehran, and by mid-2010 we were done with the bureaucracy and the construction of the plant. At the beginning of 2011, we received our first order.</p><h4>How would you list the characteristics of the packaging industry in Iran?</h4><p>The market is large and the different lines of packaging are as well. Each subsector has its own demands and levels of consumption, and so we divided our business into two areas: general packaging and tobacco packaging. We have studied the tobacco industry for a long time, and we established here to work with tobacco companies. There are some international tobacco companies present here and MM, as an international company, is a natural partner for these firms. We started with tobacco firms, but have also widened our range of companies, and also include the Iranian Tobacco Company (ITC) among our clients. Will be there expansion? Most probably in the future, and eventually we will move more into general packaging as well.</p><h4>How does the tobacco packaging sector differ from general packaging?</h4><p>If you compare it with other packaging, tobacco is very delicate and sensitive because we have to respect general laws; one is hygiene, because the cigarette directly touches your lips, so we have to strictly respect hygienic laws, such as ISO quality. And also, there are many processes a tobacco pack has to go through in our workflow. That is why we have to obey the law and, for this reason, we have invested highly in training our people. Training is not something that will finish at the end of the day or week. Every month we dedicate time to training our staff, and I think this is very important and the main difference between our kind of packaging and the others. Cigarettes are very sensitive, and there are many differences from one pack to another; if you buy a pack of cigarettes the brand and the color of the box must remain the same no matter what. If colors change, for example, the customer will notice it and he may not buy the product, incurring a loss of market share for the cigarette company. Even with one damaged pack, the company can lose its market share. It is a huge responsibility.</p><div class="quote">“We have the big international brands on our side, and that counts for 60% of the Iranian market."</div><h4>How strong is the main competition?</h4><p>We actually don't have any strong competitors in the market. We have the big international brands on our side, and that counts for 60% of the Iranian market. I think we are going to expand our production line soon, and we are getting some new machinery that will boost our output   by up to three fold. We are mainly looking for international brands and, in this sense, we have no strong competitors. MM has the biggest market share and the company is producing 20 tons of tobacco packaging per day. I don't think anyone around here can do the same. What we bring to the market that other companies don't have is our level of management. It's not a matter of managers, but a matter of systems. If I'm not here for two weeks, nothing will change or happen and our customers know that we always deliver on time.</p><h4>Where do you source your raw materials?</h4><p>We import them 100% and they come from various locations, according to the orders we have. Sometimes we import from Europe, mostly from Germany, Sweden, Finland, and from countries like China.</p><h4>How are you planning to diversify your line of production in the next few years?</h4><p>We have different phases. The next one is still going in the tobacco packaging direction, but we have projects for the next couple of years in order to develop some general packaging facilities, too. We have just bought 45,000 sqm of new land around our plant to make this possibility come true. The cigarette market is still big and we can still grow, but general packaging is something we had a look at and it was an interesting and growing market, too. For example, in Iran there's an average purchase of detergent of 5 million packs per day. If you consider the packaging, that's a big number. Plus, the detergent may be Unilever's, Nestlé's, or Henkel's, and all of these brands are affiliated and work together with MM all over the world.</p><p>The market, I think, is big enough and we just have to work to get our general packaging plant up and running in a couple of years. What we will do, though, will not be just packaging. We want to produce quality packaging because if you go to the supermarket to buy tissues, you will buy the ones with the most attractive packet. Around 10 years ago this was unconceivable, but now everybody is aware of the power of packaging, which is a thing that speaks about the quality of the brand. In this regard, I have a very positive view for the next couple of years. Demand is high and we are investing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mahan Air is the first private airline in Iran. How would you appraise the Iranian aviation environment?</h4><p>Iran is an enormous country in size. Its land area is larger than France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland combined. The country has a young population and large expatriate communities settled in Europe, North America, and Australia. Domestic passenger traffic has increased by an average of 7% over the last 10 years, and at the same time international air travel in Iran has grown by a robust 9% per year, which is far above the world average. We are optimistic that this growth trend will continue for at least the next few years.</p><h4>In 2011, 27 million travelers and businessmen passed customs. What can Mahan Air offer to the increasing number of business travelers with respect to service and quality?</h4><p>Iran is indeed a very competitive market, and many of the 37 international airlines serving Iran are among the top-ranking carriers in the world. Mahan Air tends to concentrate on quality more than price, and this strategy has been successful as our market share has increased over the years. We welcome each new international airline that will push us even harder to be competitive. We have a couple of domestic competitors as well as a few formidable ones in international markets, and we have to expand our loyalty base to stay competitive.</p><h4>What are the highlights of your airline's evolution, and how do you shape your competitive strategy vis-í -vis your main competitor?</h4><p>We were established in 1991 as the first private airline in Iran and our real growth and gaining competitive edge became possible after the acquisition of our first wide-bodied Airbus in 1998. We do believe that investing in the development of our staff to provide good services before, during, and after the flight will lead to positive feedback for us through word of mouth and generate more customer loyalty, which is a great advantage over all of our competitors.</p><div class="quote">“Mahan Air tends to concentrate on quality more than price, and this strategy has been successful."</div><h4>Mahan Air has 28 destinations in 12 countries. Where do you see the highest demand?</h4><p>In the domestic market, the demand between Tehran and Mashhad is the highest, with over 700,000 passengers carried annually. We also carried more than 330,000 passengers between Tehran and Dubai in 2012, making it the most popular international destination for us. As for growth potential, Turkey has shown strong performance with a 20% increase in traffic figures over the last few years, and we intend to focus on this important market in the near future.</p><p>In mid-August 2012, Mahan Air launched a new international route to Kuala Lumpur. What does this new route mean in terms of the business flow between the Iran and Malaysia?</p><p>There is a good relationship between these two Muslim countries. I believe that we will see huge traffic flows between Iran and Malaysia. We need at least two daily flights to Kuala Lumpur because there is huge potential on this route and our aircraft are already booked. The market is thirsty for new destinations, especially in the Far East.</p><h4>How is Mahan Air matching quality service with international safety standards?</h4><p>In close to 20 years of operations, Mahan Air has been successful in carrying close to 29 million passengers without a single fatality or injury. This is the result of our relentless safety efforts and our “safety first" policy within the entire organization. I believe that in the competitive environment of the airline industry, the development and implementation of quality services that corresponds with safety does hinder an airline's success; this is one of the challenges that we are facing on a daily basis. However, Mahan Air has been successful in this objective. This is evident in our achievement in reducing delays over the last five years. An internal audit as well as independent audits also show that our level of safety has improved substantially over the same period.</p><h4>What is your economic forecast for the medium term?</h4><p>In a balanced field and more usual circumstances, the level of economic performance depends on global economic trends. However, in Iran—a country famous for its independence from the global economy—the exchange rate and fiscal policies of oil as well as inflation will determine economic growth. We hope to see a breakthrough in Iran's relationships with the EU and others, which will result in the decreasing or lifting of sanctions. In macro-economic terms, although the reduction of energy subsidies has caused high inflation in the short term, I believe the efficiency gains will be positive in the medium term, leading to more growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are building the “perfect city." What is the aim behind this project?</h4><p>Iran is a country of 80 million people. We have a very young population, and after the Imposed War in the 1980s, it has undergone an industrial and economic reconstruction process. During this time, leisure was not a priority. We are now trying to create a new lifestyle for people. A large country like Iran needs more residential housing, sports and leisure complexes, and commercial activities. We are trying to create a destination outside of Tehran. Currently, most people go to the UAE, the Far East, or Turkey. We are therefore working to create an alternative, domestic destination. Iran's population has almost doubled over recent decades, going from 36 million to nearly 80 million people. This has created certain opportunities and implications. The implications are that urban design has lost its way. People used to live in larger houses, and now they live in apartments. This makes it difficult to develop a new town, but that's what we are doing. It will be built to very high standards and attract many residents. The government is also on board in terms of creating new towns, and four are being created outside of Tehran at the moment. The problem with these new towns is that there is no work there and residents are forced to commute to the bigger cities. Through the design of our international consultants, we created a model and a destination where a new type of living exists that includes leisure, work, and commercial activities. By binding all of these aspects together we meet the needs of all kinds of people and families. In terms of creating this space, the Iranian Cabinet of Ministers has approved it as an international leisure zone. In terms of creating work, we have been approved by the parliament to be the closest special economic zone to Tehran, the capital of Iran. We also have subdivisions that involve education, health, and sports.</p><h4>How will you avoid import/export limitations within the project's special economic zone?</h4><p>Our imports and exports will be mostly automobile oriented, although we can import and export everything else. We would like to create an area of free activity for Iranians. According to the law, new and even used foreign cars can be introduced into Iran through a special economic zone with almost no restrictions. This allows you to buy a Porsche at a cheaper rate than in the rest of the country. That is an advantage, and that is why we've designated all 1,400 hectares of the land as a special economic zone. Up until now, two automotive manufacturers have approached us. They are interested in this special economic zone since it is the closest free zone to Tehran, which is home to the largest automobile market in the country.</p><h4>How much is the average Iranian willing to spend on leisure?</h4><p>Almost 7 million Iranians traveled internationally in 2009, an increase of 130% on the previous year. We expect this number to increase to 9 million or 10 million in 2012. If every person leaving the country spends $1,000, then overall spending totals over $10 billion. This does not include domestic trips, so the potential for leisure spending is remarkable.</p><h4>TSI has many projects outside the country. How is this project different from your previous ones?</h4><p>We have 30 different sub-projects ongoing at our current project, and nowhere else in the world have they all been combined. At the project's fun park, there will be a 95-meter high rollercoaster, making it among the highest in the world. This alone will attract people in the region as well as from abroad. We will also have a water park. People are currently going to a water park in Dubai, which is only 3.5 hectares in size. Our water park will cover 12 hectares, which is a totally different scale. Our aim is to create a domestic and international attraction. Then we will have a golf course, which will be the biggest in the country. We plan to change a portion of the river passing by the site of the project into a 100-hectare manmade lake and build villas on the waterfront, overlooking this lake.</p><p>Furthermore, we have developed our healthcare offering. In Iran, health care is affordable and Iranian doctors are among the best in the world. Dentistry is highly advanced and Iran has the potential to become a medical tourism destination. The government has eased the process of developing these platforms as it sees the potential for high returns on investment thanks to the tourism potential the country possesses. As an investor who has made many investments abroad, it is nice to know that this investment is secure. However, it won't all come together at once, and through many different phases the project will be complete in just under 10 years. By the end of the Iranian calendar year, we will have finished part of the golf course and the villas overlooking that golf area. Each project that I mentioned is a different investment within this large city; different companies operating on different projects.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investors in tourism and leisure in Iran?</h4><p>As an Iranian investor, I have done business in many countries. When I work on a project in Iran, it is not because this is my home country, but because the return on investment (ROI) here is higher than anywhere else. In this project, our feasibility studies show an ROI of up to 50%. As master developer, our responsibility is to gather investors together. It was not easy to get involved. We have created a space in which all developers, whether international or domestic, can come in, start to invest, and put their expertise to use. We invite any developers or investors to come in and take part in the project because it has excellent potential. The government also helps in this process. The Ministry of Finance guarantees a yearly 10% ROI for any capital brought here by a foreign investor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights from RighTel's experience in 2011? What endogenous and exogenous factors within the ICT industry played a role in this picture?<br></h4><p>The RighTel brand was introduced in late 2011 and first launched services in Tehran and Karaj in 1Q2012. Being the third entrant in an apparently saturated mobile market is enough to make it difficult to start, let alone grow. We started our business under such conditions and are an influential player now.</p><h4>You have plans to cover 60% of the population with the 2G network and 40% with the 3G network by 2014. What is the current coverage and what strategies are you putting in place in order to achieve this goal?</h4><p>We are following our commitments, which arose from the license awarded by the regulator. In 2011 we launched our services in Tehran and Karaj, two major cities that are home to 20% of the population. Recently, we expanded our network to almost 25 cities out of 31, including all major and populated cities. We also hope to be able to roll our network out across the whole country by the end of 2012, which will exceed the commitments of the license. Eventually, we will be offering services to 100% of the country. Our focus now is on demographic coverage. That is why we are covering the highly populated cities in the first phase. After this demographic expansion, we will start a geographic extension as well.</p><h4>3G technology made its first appearance in Iran in 2011. How has it changed the dynamics of your industry?</h4><p>This new technology has provided customers with new services and quality levels. The information services have been text based so far. However, considering the new platform now available by RighTel, all other types of enhanced multimedia content could be made available for customers. We can point out the streaming services, which are very attractive to the market. Users will be able to experience live streaming of TV, video, and audio. In addition, we are now the first and only operator to provide mobile broadband based on HSPA+ technology in Iran. Soon, the tastes of the market will change, and all operators have to either provide high-quality services or lose subscribers. This will definitely lead to customer satisfaction. Data and VAS are currently giving direction to the market. The advent of smartphones and sophisticated handsets and tablets has amplified the demand for data and internet services. Apart from this, the market has already started demanding more advanced and value-added services. Therefore, our complete basket of basic and value-added services, resulting from high bandwidth, will change our current market share.</p><h4>In which direction are you planning to take your capital expenditures in 2013?</h4><p>Most of the capital expenditure will be directed toward network expansion and optimization. We have a very aggressive plan for rollout this year, with more than 50 local subcontractors all over Iran. Spending is currently focused on 70 cities in order for the roll out to be nationwide.</p><h4>How do you maintain high-quality standards in order to create a competitive edge in the market?</h4><p>The technology we are implementing provides subscribers with better quality services than those of the competition. This will empower us to offer a wide range of advanced services. We have serious plans for a local VAS ecosystem in order to deliver the relevant and localized services based on customer models and target segments. RighTel will be the pioneer in many of these services, such as mobile TV and 3G internet.</p><h4>How would you assess your position in the market and how do you differentiate RighTel from your competitors?</h4><p>Our brand is what counts. All of our efforts converge to satisfy our elite subscribers and customers, who have particular expectations. We do not intend to attract as many customers as possible. We have targeted a certain group of customers, and their acceptance and satisfaction is our objective.</p><h4>What are your expectations from 2013?</h4><p>By 2013, we will have nearly nationwide coverage, which will lead to a new phase of competition. We will continue expanding our coverage and offering our services, and the other operators will improve their products and services to make up for the technology difference. Ultimately, we are focused on being the best broadband service provider in Iran, while looking forward to opportunities in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You've been in the business of cement production for over 60 years now. What are some highlights from 2011?</h4><p>Fars &amp; Khuzestan has been in the business for 62 years—since our first plant was established in Fars. Throughout that time, we have been continuously growing. In 2011, our production grew at a rate of about 6%. In that same time, overall cement production in Iran has grown from 56 million tons to 66 million tons annually. We are still the number one cement producer in Iran, with 17 plants all over the country. Currently, we are focusing on productivity and increasing the capacity of the machinery in our plants. We are also following a strategy of focusing more on producing blended cement.</p><h4>Taking this into consideration, what are FKCC's current objectives in terms of growth?</h4><p>There are a number of companies under Fars &amp; Khuzestan Holding, some of which are active in areas such as consultancy and cement plant construction. However, the Board of Directors has now decided to sell a number of these companies so we can focus solely on cement production and trading. Many of the companies in Fars &amp; Khuzestan Holding were founded to provide specific services that were needed to support the work of our main cement business. However, in recent years, it has become easier for us to obtain these services more competitively from outside providers. Our focus now is on maintaining and growing our market share in cement production. We are also looking to increase our share of the export market. Right now, about 14% or 15% of our production is exported to other countries. We own 55% of all production plants in Iran and shares in 55% of the cement market. Our goal is to increase our market share. We are in negotiations to purchase shares in a number of other producers, which would bring our market share up to about 60%.</p><h4>How is the growth of the construction sector affecting your business?</h4><p>The construction industry is mainly divided into two sections. The first is government infrastructure projects, which are very important for the cement industry. The second is the housing industry. For the last 10 years the construction sector has been growing at about 5% to 10% annually. As a result, local cement consumption has been increasing every year—in 2011, at about 6%. Our strategy for now is to increase our exports so that we can adjust to changes in local cement consumption each year.</p><div class="quote">“Branding, packaging, and quality are the major factors that determine whether or not you will be able to compete."</div><h4>Do you work mostly with the government or the private sector?</h4><p>It varies from year to year, depending on the amount of investment from both the government and the private sector. Through 2010 and 2011, the government has been involved in housing projects all around the country, so for the past few years we have been working primarily with the government. However, in 2012, as these government projects have been completed, we have begun to work more heavily with the private sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the cement industry's future growth prospects in Iran?</h4><p>Iran is still a developing country. That means that construction and infrastructure projects are still active. This will translate into strong demand for cement for at least the next decade. With our wealth of raw materials, Iran has the capacity to easily produce more than enough cement to meet domestic demand.</p><p>That said, I don't know how much more scope there is for further expansion of the cement industry in Iran. There are 15 plants under construction right now. Once they are completed, cement production capacity in Iran will increase to 92 million tons per year, which should meet domestic consumption needs. Instead, the future may lie in blended cement, which could increase existing capacity by a further 150%, bringing our future capacity to 135 million tons. That's a huge amount of cement. Instead of building new plants, we should focus on productivity and capacity, both of which can be increased by producing blended cement. Blended cement also has environmental benefits because it saves energy. That is why it is important for us to move in this direction. Switching to blended cement production will lower costs and be more environmentally friendly. In my opinion, it is the way we should be producing all cement right now.</p><h4>You mentioned that your exports vary across different years. Which countries are the main recipients of your cement?</h4><p>Iran is in a strategic location. Not only do we benefit from oil wealth, but also neighboring countries all have massive construction plans. For example, Qatar is planning to host the World Cup in 2022, and has a 10-year construction plan in place. Iraq, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan also all have big construction plans. In addition, we are seeing increasing demand for cement in Africa, although at this point we are not in a position to export massively to that continent.</p><h4>Currently, the cement industry in Iran is dominated by local producers. Do you see room for foreign investors to enter the market?</h4><p>Holcim, which produces about 10% or 11% of the cement in Iran, is the only major foreign producer in the country. There is not necessarily room for new plants, but there is certainly the scope for foreign companies to invest in increasing the productivity of existing cement plants.</p><h4>How has the cement industry changed over the past two years, and how have you adapted in order to maintain your market share?</h4><p>Two years ago, cement demand was higher than production; Iran faced a shortage of cement. Now, supply has surpassed demand. Two years ago, there was no need to expand or diversify production. Now, you have to spend money on introducing your brand to the market. It is more difficult to sell cement now than it was two years ago. If you want to be competitive, you need to distinguish yourself from the competition with quality and variety in order to meet customer demand. That is why we are now focusing on building our brand—something that didn't mean anything three years ago. Branding, packaging, and quality are the major factors that determine whether or not you will be able to compete in the Iranian cement market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next three years?</h4><p>We are focusing on following our strategic plan. We have doubled our capacity in the past eight years, so I don't think we need to invest in more plants. Our focus now is on quality, branding, and costs, all of which will help us stay competitive and maintain our market share. Our goal is to ensure that our investors are earning more than long-term bank deposit interest rates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the agriculture sector developed over the last year?</h4><p>The agriculture sector, in recent years, has developed in substructure areas as well as in terms of private sector investment activities. The improvement of water channeling systems, irrigation, and water management are a few examples of development. Agricultural land equipped with new systems has grown to more than 1 million hectares. Subject to legislation approved in 2011 aimed at expediting the promotion of existing methods, some 85% and sometimes 100% of the costs incurred through the implementation of new methods are funded by the government, the contribution of which will be directed to Bank Keshavarzi, which extends loans to the farmers. The agricultural mechanization process is progressing and farmers are being provided with agricultural machinery to boost production. Within recent years, more advanced and diverse machinery has been utilized in agricultural activities. Agricultural research capacity has also been promoted, while impressive measures have been taken in the genetic modification of seeds and saplings. Industrial production in the poultry and livestock sub-sector has also increased. The number of farms using modified seeds is rising. The number of gardens and orchards making use of improved saplings is also going up. Bank Keshavarzi grants credit facilities to seed and sapling producers, and provides supply companies with loans to increase farmer access to proper seeds and saplings. The capacity of processing and complementary companies and that of the storing, sorting, and packaging companies have reached the highest levels as well. Moreover, Iranian producers of many kinds of foodstuffs have accessed the export markets. In that regard, the bank has been financing many installations and factories as well as abattoirs and cold storage complexes.</p><p>Another area having made remarkable progress within recent years is agricultural insurance. More than 150 types of crops and over 50% of activities in different regions are under agricultural insurance coverage. In addition to these developments, the government has initiated a comprehensive plan, namely the Agricultural Development Plan (ADP). At the first stage, allocated credit amounts to more than IR60 trillion, some of which is funded by the National Development Fund. The main agent of the plan is Bank Keshavarzi, which will use more than IR21 trillion of its resources. The launch of the plan will certainly add new capacities to the agriculture sector of Iran.</p><h4>How will agricultural development differ from region to region?</h4><p>Agricultural development in different regions is affected by climatic diversification and a variety of weather conditions. In addition, public- and private-sector investment is influenced by the capacities of each geographical region.</p><h4>What is your bank and the development fund doing to fill the gap in investment?</h4><p>The ADP has been devised separately for each sub-sector and is based on the qualifications of each geographical region. It is to be noted that all regions and sub-sectors are covered in the first stage of the plan.</p><h4>How can Iran reach agricultural optimization in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Agricultural optimization can be achieved through essential measures including the continuation of water management improvement, the development of agricultural mechanization, the increase of technology use in the promotion of quantity and quality, the development of value chain management in agricultural production, and the improvement of planting models.</p><h4>You mentioned that Iran had reached self-sufficiency in agricultural production. Where do you see room for new investments in Iran?</h4><p>There's great potential for developing modern greenhouses considering Iran's climatic conditions. There is also a good market around Iran. You could construct 5,000-hectare greenhouses in Iran, and there are large markets all around the country to which you can export those products. Also, keep in mind that Iran has very good and cheap materials for the construction and running of greenhouses, including cement, petrochemicals, aluminum, and more. There are also a lot of opportunities in the caviar sector in Iran, including caviar aquaculture and production farms on the Caspian Sea. The same goes for shrimp, which can be farmed throughout Iran.</p><h4>How do you rate the level of modernization of agricultural tools in Iran and what steps do you think can be taken to spread and enhance this modernization?</h4><p>There are three different aspects to take into consideration when we talk about agricultural modernization. The first is the mechanization of agricultural operations, such as harvesting and planting. The second aspect is genetic modification. The third aspect is training, teaching, and knowledge transfer. For the first aspect, we will reach a very high level by the end of the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP). The second aspect can be developed through academic research and educational centers and universities, where different species and types of agricultural products can be developed to suit our unique climatic conditions. Regarding training and education, engineering services are being provided in different parts of the country, and the authorities are extending these training and education opportunities throughout the whole country.</p><h4>How can Bank Keshavarzi play a role in the establishment of positive and productive synergies to emphasize the flow of Iranian expertise and know-how throughout the world?</h4><p>I think we've done what we have to do. We've introduced our specialized capacities and abilities to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), of which we are a member. Now, it's the FAO's responsibility to find a way to introduce this expertise to the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Bank Keshavarzi in the next year, and what are your expectations for the agricultural sector in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>Promotion of the bank's expertise status, while obtaining an appropriate share of banking services, are the issues Bank Keshavarzi's management and staff are thinking about.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Tavazo become the largest dried nuts retailer in Iran?<br></h4><p>We have about 70 years of experience with dried fruits and nuts. Around 13 years ago, when my father inherited the business from his father, we thought for the first time about exporting. We began sending products to Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Canada. Tavazo has now been active in the export of dried nuts for 10 years, mainly to Europe and Canada.</p><h4>What is the demand for your products in Europe and Canada?</h4><p>We receive a lot of requests for dried fruits and nuts. In Canada, there are no pistachios or almonds. In the beginning, it was very hard to introduce the product to Canadians, but little by little, through marketing, the consumers became accustomed to eating a wider variety of dried fruits and nuts, which are natural and healthy. Europe is a better market than Canada, because the population is familiar with nuts due to the presence of countries like Turkey and Spain. For example, Turkey boasts pistachios, almonds, apricots, and many other dried fruits and nuts. It has the experience to export these products to Europe. We produce more, though.</p><h4>How much do you export?</h4><p>Tavazo offers a range of over 400 products. There are dried fruits and dried nuts, as well as spicy and sweet products. We regularly send 50 containers to Canada. Some products we must send quickly, as shelf lives vary. In this instance, we use airplanes for shipments. By ship, it can take up to two months.</p><h4>How is the Canadian market different from the Iranian one, and how do you adjust your products to Canadian tastes?</h4><p>Canadians like our products because they appreciate their natural health benefits. Some countries add dioxide or sulfide to apricots, for example, yet our products are 99% natural. With preservatives, a product can be stored outside of the refrigerator. With natural products, however, they must be cooled. This is hard, but 90% of people like natural dry fruits and nuts. The Canadian market is no different, and people appreciate natural products. We dry our products naturally, and we keep them cooled and export them in cooled containers. It is very expensive, but it is better for the customers.</p><h4>What is the volume of your activity in Iran?</h4><p>It depends on the product. For example, some people in Iran prefer to use mulberries instead of sugar in tea or coffee. Mulberries are very important. They contain a lot of protein, calcium, and sodium. You can only find them in Iran and Turkey. In Iran they are a different size. They are very large, and we dry them on the tree. We then sort and put them into the cooler in special bags. Mulberries are in season just once a year, and they must be refrigerated for the rest of the year. Pistachios are the same. The same procedure is performed with almonds and apricots.</p><h4>Where are the various products grown?</h4><p>Pistachios are grown in the east of Iran, northeast of Kerman. When the pistachios come in, they are all mixed, and we buy and sort them with our machinery. The smaller ones go to China because they like that size of pistachio. We keep the bigger ones and sell them in our stores. On the other hand, saffron comes from the north of Iran, near Mashhad. It is a world-famous Iranian product. Dates come from the south of Iran. And in the northwest of Iran and Azerbaijan, there are a lot of apricots, walnuts, almonds, cherries, blackberries, and mulberries. There are many groves and the people have a lot of experience in growing and drying everything. In the Kurdistan region there are famous figs, much like the Turkish figs. The yellow Iranian fig is very famous. A lot of our customers for this product are Korean, Chinese, and Thai.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the healthcare industry in Iran?<br></h4><p>The healthcare system in Iran, as in every society, depends on the government. Since health is a major issue, it is the government's responsibility to supply and support the system. The Iranian healthcare system is based on three pillars: the public-governmental system, the private sector, and NGOs. Although the government invests and spends more on other sectors of the economy, I believe that the Iranian healthcare system is one of the most advanced in the world because of its workforce. Our medical professionals come from important universities, both local and international, and their training is very strict. My overall evaluation of the Iranian healthcare system is positive.</p><h4>How does Moheb Hospital fit into the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Moheb Hospital is the first public-private partnership (PPP) health facility in Iran. It was a successful experiment considering that we are scheduled to open two more affiliated hospitals in September 2012. One of them is especially for women and the other will be a general hospital. In this context, we don't want to limit our expansion to Tehran—we would like to export this model across the country and inspire growth in the healthcare system. Investing in this project is positive for the country and we are aiming to attract other players in the market in order to enhance this winning model.</p><h4>What does Moheb Hospital specialize in?</h4><p>There are specialties for which Moheb Hospital is famous: heart surgery, orthopedic, nephrology, kidney transplants, urology, general surgeries, cardiology, and laparoscopy surgery. On average, we see 1,600 patients per month and perform approximately 800 operations monthly. Our doctors and physicians are all members of the board and faculty members of medical schools and universities, so they are very well trained and prepared.</p><h4>How can your two new projects create a competitive edge in the local healthcare system?</h4><p>At one of the new branches, all the services provided will be conceived for female patients, employing a woman-specific approach. This has something to do with the culture we live in. According to the needs of our Islamic society, a number of ladies require to be treated by women only, and we want to meet this demand. We can fill this long-ignored gap for women that seek to follow Islamic rules. As we were the first hospital involved in a PPP project in the country, we are again the pioneers with our women's hospital, which is the first of its kind in the country and we are very proud of that.</p><h4>Do you expect the two new branches to increase medical tourism in the country?</h4><p>Definitely. I think that many women will come from neighboring countries to Tehran to be treated and cured by our female doctors. In 2011, we treated 1,500 medical tourists at Moheb Hospital, and my projection is that we will see more coming due to our professionalism and the quality of service we provide. About 50% of our foreign patients come for kidney transplants and orthopedic treatment. In order to meet this domestic and international demand, we are carefully considering our future. Our aim is to create hospital chains throughout the country with a close focus on plastic surgery. Plastic surgery is popular among Iranians. There are only a handful of other places where patients can get this type of surgery. We want to establish new centers and supply this specific demand. Another important factor is the speed at which our hospitals can be built. It can take 10 or 15 years to build a public hospital, but it takes us just 18 months. This is another record for both Moheb and the country.</p><h4>What can we expect from Moheb Hospital in the near future?</h4><p>We are going to focus on the quality of our services. We would like to increase the number of procedures we perform. The hospital carries out 110 to 120 open-heart surgeries per month, which makes us the second- or third-ranked hospital in Iran. We are highly competitive in the market and we want to link the Moheb Hospital brand with quality. We hope that in the future we can expand further. Moheb Hospital is ready to attract investments for our facilities in order to enhance the healthcare system. We are ready to cooperate with NGOs and other private institutions to increase the competitiveness of the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-timeless-passion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shafaghi is one of the oldest and best quality carpet manufacturers in Iran. What strategies have you followed in order to represent the center of carpet making in the country?<br></h4><p>We focus on the quality of our products, mass advertising, and very good prices. Every carpet is special for us, and we add value to what we produce. Despite the fact that we are in a challenging economic situation, the company is still growing by employing more Iranians, renewing our factory, and expanding our range of carpets. We are working to form partnerships with other carpet producers in order to augment the selection and variety of our carpets. Iranian and foreign consumer tastes are very different, so that is why we are trying to differentiate the selection of our products. We are studying international trends and fashion to meet the demand and partner with foreign companies. Along with partnerships, we are focusing on marketing. In 2012, we expect to participate in an exhibition in Florence to promote our culture and products to Italy and its people.</p><h4>Iran is famous for its quality carpets. How would you describe the characteristics of the carpet-manufacturing industry in Iran?</h4><p>We started in 1961 and are one of the oldest companies that manufacturers carpets in Iran. This country's carpets have their own special characteristics that mix history, the abilities of whoever makes the carpet, and the materials that we use. This is an old tradition, and it comes from the bottom of our hearts: our carpets are like the food your mother cooks in the kitchen, which cannot be compared to the food you are eating in a restaurant, even the finest one. Your mother cooks with her heart because she wants to feed her baby, but at the restaurant you are just a customer like any other. As I started this job when I was a child, I know the fine quality of the products that we use, and our carpets are different from others because our competitors are focused solely on profits. This is the love I have for my carpets—I live with them when I weave them.</p><h4>Where do you find the colors for your carpets, and how does the process work?</h4><p>All my colors are handmade, derived from natural sources. That is why the quality of our carpets is so different from others. We have harnessed a high level of expertise, and I personally select the colors for our carpets, modify them, and create a carpet according to my imagination. My passion for the craft leads to the creation of beautiful carpets.</p><h4>What steps can be taken to stop the proliferation of imitation rugs?</h4><p>This is a hard question to answer. Quality carpets are supervised by the National Council of Carpets, which is under the control of the Ministry of Trade. This agency verifies the genuineness of Iranian carpets. They supervise the quality and origin of Iranian carpets. In some parts of the world there are so-called “Iranian" carpets made in China. If asked questions, they argue that they make these carpets under the supervision of Iranian experts, which is absolutely not true and highly unlikely. We expect the authorities to take action against these false products and stop the proliferation of imitations. However, we, as a small company, cannot control the entire market. The origin of each carpet used to be certified until the Chinese began making fake certificates—now it is almost pointless to issues certificates on our carpets saying that they are made in Iran. All things considered, we cannot do much at a business level, but the authorities can. I hope they will take action in order to preserve the heritage of this ancient tradition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are the number one mobile communications provider in the region. How do you shape your competitive strategy?</h4><p>We have one national asset—we were the first operator to enter the market with the largest customer base. After the second provider entered the market, we tried to strengthen our competitive advantage against our rivals, and our main advantage was the coverage we provided. We tried to utilize and shape this competitive advantage by leveraging our coverage and providing more services to be more attractive to customers. In the last six years, we haven't increased our prices and we have tried to keep them constant. Although inflation increased the prices of goods and services, we tried to manage our tariffs, providing more high-quality services. Being a state-owned company, the government was the only shareholder and it was not looking for much profit. We tried to improve coverage in rural areas, and after being privatized, MCI increased its coverage span, offering high-quality and more competitive and innovative services.</p><h4>ICT is a fast-growing sector in Iran, with positive spillovers into the non-prime sectors of the economy. Which ICT-related areas do you consider need further investment?</h4><p>In the ICT market, broadband remains an underinvested segment. Based on our license, we are not allowed to launch our mobile broadband services yet. As part of its M&amp;A strategy, MCI acquired 40% of a broadband service provider called MobilNet, which provides wireless broadband services via WiMAX technology and has a nationwide license. The broadband world is actually the most attractive, but it is underdeveloped in Iran. If you look globally at a country level, investments in the upstream oil industry need more attention. Value-added services over mobile technology seem to be very attractive for further investments, including mobile financial services, mobile payments, mobile banking, and machine-to-machine (M2M) services. When the broadband system expands, broadband-related services grow apace. The third underinvested sector is devices; 12 million tablets have been purchased in the country, and we are planning on rolling out our chain store to provide complementary services rather than just basic connection services. The increased presence of smartphones in the mobile industry and the market for applications is explosive. One of our own strategies is to build local app stores to protect the Farsi language and meet local demand.</p><h4>How important is it to link your brand to VAS and mobile devices?</h4><p>Globally, there is a war between mobile operators and content providers. We believe that to shape the value chain and sell content and applications we should maintain a focus on content. For example, US companies such as Google and Facebook offer well-known applications such as Google Talk; the content provider sells it to the customer, and he or she can use any kind of connection for voice, video, or SMS without paying the operator the cost of the service. We, as an operator, spend money and build the network infrastructure, and someone else will use it and make revenues from our network. If we provide internet services, we can connect our users. However, if people use voice over IP, the operators are globally trying to charge customers with different models based on the content. This is a global war, and if operators do nothing they will lose market share to content providers.</p><div class="quote">“The mobile industry and the market for applications is explosive."</div><h4>How will the dynamics among the current operators change with the introduction of 4G to the market, and what major trends are you anticipating?</h4><p>The regulators considered a two-year exclusivity protection period for service providers, and this period will end in June 2013. Both MCI and MTN Irancell will be allowed to launch mobile broadband services after the approval of the operator. We are going to invest in mobile broadband technology. Therefore, MCI is going to bring 4G to the market. Globally, 4G is not as developed as 3G. This will allow MCI to think about how to be compatible with and evolve 4G technology and introduce it to the market for the people. One of the big concerns is which new technology we are going to choose to invest in and how it can increase our productivity. The company's approach is to go toward 4G because the cost per megabyte is cheaper than 3G.</p><h4>What are your plans to develop infrastructure and in which direction are you planning to take your capital expenditure in 2012 and 2013?</h4><p>The GSM network has two main types of equipment: the first is the radio network that you can see from the streets, and the second one is the core network. Starting in 2011, there were several initiatives designed to modernize the core network and replace what has been installed in the past 18 years in order to manage and prepare for the broadband connectivity of the future. By the end of 2012, the radio network will be replaced and modernized, and this requires an investment of $600 million. We are going to replace the system that we bought from Siemens; since the acquisition of Siemens by Nokia, the equipment has not been upgraded. We would like to provide more capacity for the network and increase demand.</p><p>Also, we are thinking about becoming an international operator. We have investigated many operators in the region, and our focus is on buying assets from them. The National Development Fund can invest in our international operations, helping us in this international M&amp;A process.</p><h4>MCI offers a variety of mobile services. How do you shape your services and which segment of the market are you targeting the most?</h4><p>Within MCI's strategy, customers are being defined and segmented. We identify the requirement of our high-value customers that use the network the most, and classify them as VIP users, addressing them with their own specific services. We know the age of different customers and keep track of them; for these VIPs, we offer special campaigns. Another segment is business customers—we plan to identify business customers and meet their demands with specific solutions such as VPN and discount offers. We have distinguished capabilities with these types of customers and we have a wider coverage span than the banks. MCI aims to leverage its connectivity in order offer unique services like mobile banking.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for 2013 and what do you expect from your five-year strategy 2010-2015?</h4><p>In 2011, our earnings per share (EPS) figure was $0.60, and by end-2011 it was $0.74. We had 36% net income growth in comparison with the previous year. In 2012, we project an EPS of $0.98 per share. We are focusing on reaching $6.6 billion in revenues by the end of 2012, with $6.2 billion in operational revenues. The rough estimation for 2013 is 30% growth in revenue and income.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of Irancell's business in 2011 and 2012?</h4><p>In 2011 and 2012, we achieved about a 47% share of the local mobile telecommunications sector. We managed a very stable network to satisfy subscriber requirements and offered acceptable coverage, but we are continuously working to improve our quality. Irancell has achieved all the targets set under our license with the Ministry of ICT. The company has also begun to offer several new services to send and receive e-mail, as well as develop new platforms for making bank payments. We are working on expanding our channels for sales in order to open up opportunities to everyone, particularly by providing fast access to our network and offering recharge cards and other services. Our corporate offerings are also expanding; we offer our corporate clients VPN, APN, and mobile newspaper services, which allow them to broadcast their bulletins or other documents through our system. Newspapers and other media organizations are also able to utilize this mobile technology.</p><h4>What specific approach do you have for corporate services that differentiates you from other mobile providers?</h4><p>We tailor our services to the needs of our clients. The company also offers the enterprise messaging system (EMS) to our corporate clients. This system allows companies to communicate quickly and efficiently both internally and externally. For example, EMS is useful for banks as they communicate with their customers. Companies come to us with their needs and we create total solutions for them. There are an unlimited number of solutions that we can provide to different segments of the market.</p><h4>What services are you promoting in order to attract a larger customer base and expand your market share?</h4><p>One important service is our mobile media portal, or Vitrin, which is a platform with a variety of content. Through Vitrin young customers can access wallpapers, ringtones, and music. This is one of our main data services. We also provide internet access through GPRS, which is very fast and reliable. Irancell is expanding its e-mail and media offerings for younger customers. In addition, we are trying to adapt our product offering according to the feedback we receive from the market. Every month, we analyze our subscribers' feedback in order to identify solutions and provide higher-quality customer service.</p><div class="quote">“In 2013, we aim to invest substantially to maintain a high level of quality and expand coverage."</div><h4>How are you planning to cover more cities?</h4><p>Over the last eight months, we have experienced very significant growth in terms of the number of subscribers. In 2012 and 2013, we aim to invest substantially to maintain a high level of quality and expand coverage. Our customers are used to high quality, and we are not going to change our policy because the number of subscribers is increasing. Our plan is to invest more, especially in network technology. We also plan to invest in improving the speed of data services and offer more services based on data. We want to continue to improve the services that we already offer.</p><h4>What is the current data speed, and how do you plan to increase it?</h4><p>Technology generation 2.0 and 2.5 is limited to GPRS. Technology EDGE or 2.75 is limited to less than 200 kilobytes per second (kbps). With the existing license and technology that we have, the data speed is limited to this, but we also need to have enough capacity in our network to support all the subscribers. With this technology the data speed is limited.</p><h4>What challenges do you encounter in your operations? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the local mobile sector?</h4><p>One of the challenges we face is that we do not yet have access to 3G technology. At the same time, we have better quality and coverage than other companies. The second challenge is that we sometimes face difficulties with municipalities, landlords, or operators in expanding our network sites. Despite this, the market is very good, and the demand for new services is high. This means that there is substantial incentive for operators to make significant investments.</p><h4>In 2011, the company introduced WiMAX internet service. How is this project developing, and what other internet services are you planning to offer in the near future?</h4><p>WiMAX is a new service being offered for the first time in Iran. We have tried to educate our subscribers about the benefits of this new system, and we have learned a lot from the market. We have introduced ourselves not only as a mobile operator, but also as a major telecommunications company. At Irancell, we are working to expand our internet network in the way that we have done with GSM in different provinces. Currently, Irancell has licenses in seven provinces. We have launched the VPN product on WiMAX and have given the opportunity to banks and large corporations to use our network to support their systems. We are also aiming to activate VoIP technology so as to provide this service to our customers in the near future as well. At the same time, we are planning to combine our service options such as GSM and WiMAX to offer dual plans to our clients. Furthermore, we are testing IPTV technology. Currently, internet and VPN are available, and we have both private and corporate users.</p><h4>How is Irancell integrating value-added services?</h4><p>For all of the value-added services, we employ third parties. We have a very attractive revenue-sharing system that incentivizes third-party investment and participation. For example, the Vitrin service enjoys participation from private companies. We implemented the infrastructure to create opportunities for any company that wants to get involved with value-added services. There are almost 20 companies offering content with Irancell. They're offering many new services that are controlled and managed independently. Our platform for value-added services is profitable today, and there is the potential for increased profitability in the future, as well as opportunities for any company to invest.</p><h4>Are you planning to invest heavily in this area?</h4><p>We have begun offering a banking platform through USSD, a system that offers more security through SMS verification. Now we are investing heavily to increase security and create extra opportunities for banks and subscribers to do more with mobile technology. This is the same for all of the value-added services we provide; we are aiming not only for growth, but also for increased quality.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your position in the market?</h4><p>One of our major focuses is quality. The main reason we are equipped to achieve a strong market position is because we maintain superior service quality. We are investing and we plan to invest more. For 2013 and 2014, we are planning to invest significantly in broadband technology such as 3G, 4G, and WiMAX in order to increase data speed and capacity. Another area where we excel is with corporate business. These focuses contribute to maintaining a strong market share and position in the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2013?</h4><p>We will continue on the same level of growth as in 2011 and 2012, and we expect to achieve all of the KPI targets in coverage, quality, and services. We hope to get a license to launch 3G in response to the large demand from our customers. We expect a strong market in 2013. So far, it has been a very successful joint venture, especially for the ICT sector. We believe that we set a very strong example for other sectors to follow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Stratus Group is one of the top companies in Iran with a diversified line of business. What have been the cornerstones of your group's evolution?</h4><p>Since we were first established 34 years ago, we have undertaken many projects both in Iran and abroad. We were pioneers in exporting engineering services to neighboring countries, and that is why we are recognized all around the world. Stratus Group is now the biggest contracting company in the private sector. Iran has many large companies that belong to the government, but we are a purely private-sector company. In Iran, there is a very small private sector and, in the past, we had a small stock market as well. Recently, the stock market has been enlarging very quickly, but it is still very difficult for the private sector to compete against state-owned enterprises.</p><h4>How would you assess Stratus Group's performance in 2011?</h4><p>Our financial and contracting companies, EN Bank and Stratus International Contracting, both grew very aggressively in 2011. Stratus International is working on projects worth $2 billion right now, and we will soon be taking on a few other construction projects in Venezuela worth a further $700 million. We are also planning a very large project toward the end of 2013 worth about $4 billion. EN Bank, our financial company, is worth more than $20 billion, and we are expecting a turnover of $30 billion by 2013. These sectors of our business have been very successful, but I feel strongly that for further private sector growth to take place in Iran, we need to re-examine the basics of how our economy is structured.</p><div class="numbers-box  aligncenter"></div><h4>Where do you see the most growth potential among the sectors in which Stratus Group is involved?</h4><p>The sector with the most potential is absolutely the financial sector. It has more growth potential than any other business. I also see a lot of growth potential in mass-housing production. After four years of downturn, the market has started to grow again, and we are working to develop our housing business in Iran and Iraq. I think we are going to see strong growth in this sector because people need mass housing and the market is flourishing again. We are considering doing more business in Istanbul because we have a lot friends and partners in Turkey. In terms of non-residential construction, we are currently working on the parliament building in Djibouti, and we are also planning to work in Kazakhstan.</p><div class="quote">“On one project, we made 7,000 houses in 18 months. What other company has the ability to do that?"</div><h4>Which of the countries you are involved in is Stratus Group's top priority?</h4><p>There are two things to take into consideration here. One is profit and the other is risk. Turkey is one of the lowest-risk markets we are exploring. However, it also has the least potential for profit. On the other hand, Tehran and Baghdad are both much higher-risk environments, but both have huge profit potential. We have more than 10,000 employees and it is hard to train all of them with respect to international best practices. We started the business in 1991 on the international market, and we have now been on the international market for 19 years. This has given us the chance to build experience and learn from our mistakes to develop the international expertise we need to succeed.</p><h4>What role can foreign partners and competitors play in the Iranian construction sector?</h4><p>Anyone can build a road or a bridge, but few countries have the experience and expertise to undertake more complicated projects like dams. The only two countries that have that kind of expertise are Turkey and Iran. We are building two dams right now because we have the technology that other countries do not. On one project, we built 20 14-story buildings in 195 days. On another project, we made 7,000 houses in 18 months. What other company has the ability to do that? This is the unique potential of our country and you cannot find it anywhere else. In both Turkey and Iran, our population is growing fast, and it represents a big opportunity for investors in the construction sector. On our side, we already have the technology and the expertise. We just need the money, which is the role that foreign investors can play here. If you are brave, you can invest in the oil sector, but not many investors see the real Iran. If you dig deep, you can see the whole potential of this country.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you judge the level of expertise of Iranian medical students and the quality of the medical education they receive?<br></h4><p>The government has allocated a large amount of investment into the system in order to create and expand the scope of medical education. Before the Revolution, there were too few medical graduates and we were dependent on other countries. Cultural differences and the language barrier were among the chief difficulties we were facing. From this experience on, we started to “mass produce" medical staff, from physicians to pharmacists. In order to guarantee quality, we introduced an integration system. This system allows us to connect and link health services to the education process. One of the ways to measure the quality of graduates is to evaluate their performance. Our specialties and sub-specialties for medical sciences mean we don't need foreign expertise or technology for medical purposes. This doesn't mean that we have cut off our relations with other countries. On the contrary, we are in collaboration and cooperation with other academies and universities. Another example is that the World Health Organization (WHO) has always tried to spot the best experts in the fields it requires to fulfill the needs of other countries. The WHO relies on many Iranian consultants, and at this university we have eight collaborating centers that work with the WHO on different health technology aspects. Another indicator of the quality of the Iranian healthcare system is that many people in the region come to Iran in order to receive medical care for complicated conditions. According to my impressions, with the speed of development we are going through, within the next few years many Iranian universities and centers will be ranked among the top education and health institutions in the world.</p><h4>Shahid Beheshti has 48 research centers. How is the medical university keeping up with international standards and what are the innovations your university can bring to the international stage?</h4><p>Around 15 years ago we decided to expand our research centers and allocate some of the budget the government provides to university research centers. Our aim is to reach 70 research centers. They provide strong impetus to young professionals to work hard and succeed. They are under constant supervision and create healthy competition in the sector. Rewards are also offered every year, and this encourages many researchers to work harder on developing medical instruments, for example.</p><h4>Shahid Beheshti University has an international branch. What is the purpose of this branch and how are you preparing your students to enter the international medical job market?</h4><p>We know that medical education is not very well developed in the region around Iran. Saying this, we are preparing our students to be able to do their job in the surrounding region and export expertise and know-how. Our winning card at this university is our staff. Our specialized departments are well known, and this is the base on which we collaborate internationally. The second issue is that the exchange of staff and students we have creates many bridges with countries and academies around the world, especially in Europe and the Americas. Then, we opened up room for fellowships and sub-specialties so external students can come in and gain skills. We are among the leaders in the world for kidney and heart transplants, reconstructive surgery, and other complex procedures. This kind of collaboration is vast and extensive and nationally, of course, we hold a strong position because many of the leading scientists come from this university.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you judge the level of higher education in Iran?<br></h4><p>When you survey Iranian society, one of the main features that you come across is people's eagerness to educate the younger generation. Having said that, we have an eager generation of learners. In terms of the system we are offering, it meets and even exceeds world standards, and is at the cutting edge of education. Without any hesitation, our graduates are seeking and finding great jobs all over the world. At our university, we are teaching courses that incorporate the latest findings in science and technology. In terms of quantity, we have 4.5 million students enrolled in universities in Iran, out of a total population of 75 million. We get the sense that the number of graduates is acceptable; at the moment, the overflow of students from Iran travel to other countries in the Persian Gulf or beyond, especially those working in the oil, energy, business, and telecommunications sectors.</p><h4>What is Sharif University doing in order to prepare a fertile field for students that are seeking to enter the job market?</h4><p>From the very beginning, we prepare students to network within their own discipline or in others. In order to establish an enterprise, entrepreneurs need to have a solid network to support them, and companies require trust and familiarity. From this point of view, the four years of education we offer can be a valuable asset. We recommend students to take their time, allowing a kind of incubation period. Over the past couple of years, about 100 knowledge-based companies have come about as a result of this approach. We benefit from the various technology parks in the area. Many of our graduates are setting up companies, and we are supporting them. It is a very in-depth and sound system. Based on this, I believe that the university's rate of growth should continue at a rapid pace in the future.</p><h4>How does Sharif University combine its students' entrepreneurial initiatives with the activity at local technology parks ?</h4><p>We are pushing programs in the research department so that professors get connected with the industry and are awarded grants or contracts to carry out certain jobs or projects. Then, they set up research groups with students working to obtain a PhD, Master's, or even an undergraduate BSc diploma. Shortly before graduating from the university, the students are introduced to an industry. In many cases, they continue on this trajectory or brainstorm new ideas with their professors to set up initiatives that could serve the industry. After they graduate, some students take advantage of the loans and support systems that we can offer as they work to establish their own company. We can also provide other financial support or consultation. In rarer cases, the students do not even graduate because they enter the business and forget about the certificate. I had an MSc student that left the school in his second year to start his own business in the food industry.</p><div class="quote">“The main resource for education is people—not buildings, money, or supplies."</div><h4>What are the prospects for the future of higher education in Iran, and the future of Sharif University?</h4><p>The future will be fantastic. The main resource for education is people—not buildings, money, or supplies. We have a lot of students here who are very enthusiastic and trust in higher education. When I was studying in Canada, our group was doing excellent work. People from the industry who were supporting the grant for my professor received reports from us twice per year, and each time they came to the school and saw the presentations that we delivered, they were impressed. They asked, “How could you get this much work from your students? Why are we paying our employees maybe two or three times more, just to find that they are not doing great work?" This was very important for me, and I have made it our mission to get our students working. We were presenting technology as an important research topic before, but people were not interested because they could get it from outside. Many of the grants and contracts did not come to the university before, but they are coming more frequently now—maybe 50% of the university's budget is sourced from local industry, which is fantastic. It is a good opportunity for us and we are aiming to use it very wisely.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Pars Online is the largest internet provider in Iran. How would you describe your company's experience in this sector?</h4><p>When we started Pars Online in 1999, the internet was a new concept in Iran and the market was very limited. Initially, we began offering simple dial-up connections at 33.6 kilobytes per second (kbps). At the time, 33.6 kbps was the highest connection rate due to analog telephone line limitations. Pars Online was the first company to implement 56 kbps dial-up connectivity utilizing digital telephone lines. As the internet market matured, the Ministry of ICT began to privatize many aspects of data communications by providing various licenses to qualified private companies. Originally, the Ministry issued “ISP" licenses to a large number of companies. Subsequently, as the voice over IP (VoIP) market emerged, ICT issued VoIP licenses followed by dedicated wireless connectivity licenses.</p><h4>What can value-added services bring to your company?</h4><p>Now that the data communications infrastructure has reached a point where there are several million subscribers connected to a reliable network, the time has come to create and launch various value-added services in the country. Pars Online is actively working on several projects, including video on demand (VoD), voice over broadband (VoBB), and online gaming. We are always interested in partnering with companies that have been able to deploy successful value-added service projects abroad and to customize and deploy them in the local market. I believe that one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed regarding the internet in Iran is the launch of local content delivery networks (CDNs), which can be classified as a value-added service. Currently more than 90% of all of our traffic is being routed to hosts outside the country, and what we need to do is to entice Iranian content owners to host their content in the country and create a CDN that will allow us to replicate popular foreign content within our borders. Ultimately, as more internet content becomes available in the country, we will be able to reduce our international gateway costs and offer a better service to our customers at lower prices.</p><h4>Which parts of the ICT sector do you think are under invested?</h4><p>I think there are tremendous growth opportunities in our sector and the highest growth business is e-commerce in general. Although there are many e-commerce sites for the sale of goods, there is a distinct gap in e-commerce services in many sectors, such as travel. In general, the internet lacks Farsi content. Not everybody speaks English here, and for every English website idea, there needs to be a Farsi equivalent available. Blogging is popular here. In fact, Farsi is the third largest language in the blogging world. However, we need to create more content. It does not make sense that 90% of the traffic is leaving the country. We need to create content to keep the traffic local. There are many companies that have now launched various e-commerce enterprises, and this is the key for growth in this sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define Raamtin Residence Hotel in terms of competition in the Iranian market?<br></h4><p>We've been able to create a successful niche for ourselves among foreign business travelers for a number of reasons. The hotel is strategically located at the heart of the business district with newly renovated and remodeled rooms. We also offer friendly and efficient services, especially for our corporate travelers: wireless internet, meeting centers, and conference rooms.</p><p>Furthermore, Raamtin Residence Hotel features great food and beverages, arguably the best in the country. This has allowed us to differentiate ourselves from the competition and still do fairly well, even in a poor business climate.</p><h4>Where do the majority of your business and leisure travelers originate from?</h4><p>Whereas in the past most of our travelers were from Western Europe, now more and more of the travelers seem to be coming to Iran from the neighboring countries and the Far East.</p><div class="quote">“The hotel is strategically located at the heart of the business district with newly renovated and remodeled rooms."</div><h4>What is the importance of staff training?</h4><p>The value of staff training is obvious for us, considering that the industry revolves around the notion of hospitality. At our hotel especially, where we house mostly foreign guests, we have to invest extra in staff training to overcome some cultural barriers as well. On one hand, the staff need to be trained on their specific job; and on the other hand, they need to be trained about some of the cultural differences between Iranians and foreign guests, and hence learn the adequate ways of providing great service to foreign visitors.</p><h4>How have government investments helped to change the accommodation tourism picture for the Iranian market?</h4><p>Unfortunately, government investments are far outweighed by the limitations placed on businesses in Iran. This has translated into fewer business travelers in Iran, which has lead to a drop in occupancy rates for most Iranian hotels.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the tourism sector?</h4><p>My expectations for the tourism sector in Iran are positive, but the future depends on whether or not the country can achieve more political and economic stability. Iran has all the makings of a great business and leisure destination; the sky's the limit when it comes to tourism. The only caveat is stability, which every business person in Iran is hoping for.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What Strategy led to the development of Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q)?<br></h4><p>WCMC-Q is a medical school that is a part of Cornell University. Cornell University has a medical school in New York City, and we are a branch campus. The strategy of Cornell University is to get into the global education business, and it has been quite active in that. The strategy was to come here and establish a medical school for the first time outside the US, and offer US degrees. That was very exciting for Cornell University and the leadership of Weill Cornell in New York. Their vision fitted quite nicely with the Qatar Foundation's vision, which wanted to attract top-rated US branch campuses here. They signed a contract in 2001 and our classes started in 2002. We have a very unique six-year program, including two years pre-medical, which we use to prepare students for admission to the medical school by using the Cornell granted courses, and then we prepare them for the medical school admissions so they can take the MCAT and other medical school admission tests. This process has worked out very well.</p><h4>What synergies exist between the campus here and the one in New York?</h4><p>We have the same overall governance structure in the sense that the dean here reports to the dean in New York City, who then reports to the president at Cornell University. We have a similar committee of executive and associated deans. Our entire faculty has appointments in the departments in New York City, so it is the same criteria. Students are admitted using the same criteria as the head of the admissions committee in New York. In the first two years, the dean used to take the names of the proposed students and then they would go and discuss them. The curriculum is the same. Many of the faculty from there come here for several days to teach certain parts where we don't have the expertise on the ground. It is pretty much an extension of the campus we have in New York. The only difference is that it is in Doha, it could be in Chicago, California, or wherever, and be the same thing.</p><div class="quote">“Within the next five years, Qatar will be an example for the region in terms of providing first-rate healthcare."</div><h4>How would you assess the success of the first decade here?</h4><p>Basically, one way to look at this is the objectives for the first phase, which ended in 2008. During the first phase of WCMC-Q's development, three of our major achievements included establishing the first American medical school outside the US, maintaining the same high admission and educational standards of WCMC in New York, and achieving a historic first by awarding Cornell Doctor of Medicine degrees to successful candidates in Qatar. We graduated the first class in 2008. Then, in 2010, the college entered its second phase with the institution of a new five-year strategic plan that we are going through now and will lead to the establishment of world-class translation and clinical research here, which is what I came here for from Stanford University. The strategic plan will create centers of excellence in certain areas: research, education, clinical excellence, and focus research on diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Ultimately, we want to have this as the premium medical institution in the entire region. We are already almost there. In 2013, we had about 94% of our graduates matching in their US residency programs, which is very comparable to the US grades for the medical school, compared to a matching rate of 42% for other schools outside the US. There is not another medical institution in the entire region that I know of that has close to our matching rate.</p><h4>What role does research play in your medical school?</h4><p>No medical school can be considered first rate or world class without research. It is important for students to get involved. Just after our students get admitted to medical school during the summer, selected students are sent to New York City for two months and almost every student who is here (even if they don't go to New York) participates and gets involved in research projects right from the beginning in our labs with several mentors. Qatar Foundation funds many research programs through the QNRF. It has about 10 programs. One of them is called “Undergraduate Research Experience Program." We are a large recipient of those students. Almost everybody gets training in research methodology. What research does is teaches you how to think critically, like a scientist. The natural human tendency is to think in approximations. To be precise and exact is something that has to be learned. We systematically cultivate critical thinking skills in our students. They need to ask questions, make hypotheses, test them, and discard them if they don't fit or build on them if they do. That is critical thinking, rather than just guessing. The world is changing. You have knowledge at your fingertips via the internet, but you must be trained to think for yourself and research is a big part of it. That is not only for the student training, but it is equally important for the faculty members as well. The best faculty members always get involved in research to keep current. The best teachers that I know are those who also do research because you think about the problem very differently. If I am teaching medical students, it is much easier for me to teach through real-world examples that I have dealt with recently as opposed to two or three years in the past. It is not just telling them what happened, what to do, and what medication to prescribe; you have to be emotionally with it.</p><h4>With who do you affiliate yourself on the medical side?</h4><p>Hamad Medical Corporation is our clinical affiliate; we have had a liaison since 2004. That was the year our students first started getting clinical training. It is our partner, and we work very closely with it. That is where our students go to get their clinical training and do their rotations. That happens during the third year of their medical school. They do their rotations there and get their clinical training. Hamad is the largest healthcare provider in the country. It provides around 80% of healthcare in the country, so you have a whole lot of cases that cater to many needs if you look at it from an educator's point of view. We also work very closely with the Supreme Council of Heath. We actually recently partnered with the Supreme Council of Heath and His Excellency to start a major campaign called “Your Health First," which really teaches the kids to eat healthily and families to cook healthy food. We work very closely with them on these programs and the implementation of a health strategy for the nation.</p><h4>How does Weill Cornell contribute to the national health strategy?</h4><p>We help in multiple ways. Of course, we are preparing physicians who will provide the next generation of leadership here in the country and the next generation of healthcare providers and leadership in this arena. We also give input in terms of how to implement strategy. For example, a major component of the implementation is to have very good primary care centers. We help them there. We help them in terms of assisting the primary care facilities upgrade the quality of the services they are providing by instituting some of the outcomes research programs, whereby you measure quality. If you had patients coming in there, the overall outcome is this or that. You really have to demonstrate that you are providing excellent care for people</p><h4>What is your outlook for the education and healthcare sectors in Qatar?</h4><p>I am very excited. I think Qatar has a very clear vision as to what it is doing. The Qatar National Vision 2030 lays out very clearly the Supreme Council of Health's health strategy. We are working as the Council's partner in the healthcare sector. What I see is that within the next five years Qatar will be an example for the region in terms of providing first-rate healthcare. Included in that would be research and outcome research, such as looking at patient outcomes. All of that will be here in Qatar. It will become a shining example; there is no doubt in my mind.</p><h4>What are your medium-term plans in Qatar?</h4><p>Our medium-term plans is that our second affiliate, Sidra Medical Research Center, is coming on board. We are working very closely with it at the moment. Our goal is to have US accreditation, known as ECGME-I. That is an accrediting body for what we call a residency program or post-graduate training programs. We just received accreditation for Hamad Medical Corporation with our colleagues, and now we are going to get accreditation for Sidra. That means our graduates, once they become doctors, don't necessarily have to go to the US; they can get the same standard of post-graduate residency training here. It is similar to their undergraduate training; they are getting US-style and standard undergraduate training here and that will be extended into the residency training when they become doctors. We are also working with the American Board of Medical Specialties to have the exams held here, which would be fantastic. You could train world-class physicians and have their specialty programs here. That is our plan. That is how you become the best in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Noor Islamic Bank began in 2008, in the middle of the financial crisis. How did the bank come about, and what is its importance for the Gulf region and Dubai?<br></h4><p>Noor Islamic Bank was created to bring a new face to Islamic banking in Dubai and the region. The financial crisis taught us to be resilient, and we have focused on liquidity and capital over all these years. That was the secret of our success, and we are in our second year of profitability. It started off tough, but we are doing well.</p><h4>What is the potential for Islamic banking in Dubai, and how big is the market for sharia-compliant banking?</h4><p>The market is still big and the potential is huge throughout the region. The GCC is the busiest and most developed region for Islamic finance in the world. There is still a lot to be achieved in terms of trade, cross-border trade, and long-term Islamic sukuks. I believe the market has yet to attain its full potential.</p><div class="quote">“The GCC is the busiest and most developed region for Islamic finance in the world. "</div><h4>You have stated your desire to be among the world's 100 most innovative banks by 2020. What measures are you taking to achieve those goals?</h4><p>Banks are conservative and traditional by nature, because of the risk aspects that we have to manage and deal with. However, at Noor we are firmly focused on the future and we can see future trends taking shape today among our customers. We see strong changes particularly in our young customers in the way they approach and deal with banks. I don't see other banks adapting as well yet. They rarely change their ways unless it is to catch up with new trends that prove profitable. They are by nature cautious and conservative. I really believe we need to consider innovation seriously. Innovation doesn't just mean technological innovation. It involves the way you see things, your perspectives, the way you deal with customers, your interaction, your whole business, and even philosophical outlook. Social and digital media have opened up so many horizons that need to be explored, and that is how I see the next generation of customers. They don't come to the banks anymore, so what is the use of all your branches? You need to find customers online; that is where the future generation wants to interact.</p><h4>Do you think a large portion of your customers still need to be educated in terms of online banking?</h4><p>I remember when ATMs first appeared; it was tough for people at first, and they thought it was a complicated machine. However, they all got used to ATMs with time. It is the same with online banking and banking through smartphones. People will get used to them and realize they are the way to go. They are far more convenient than traditional banking methods.</p><h4>What is your customer profile?</h4><p>We have all sorts. Our major activity is corporate, but we're looking to diversify our portfolio. I'm interested in moving into more specialized corporate niches.</p><h4>How will Dubai as a world hub in the sukuk trading market benefit Noor Islamic Bank, and what are the challenges you face?</h4><p>Yes, Sheikh Mohammed's goals mean there will be more interest and opportunities for Islamic banking to develop and flourish. But the key factor is not just the finance, because the finance always comes after trade. I think Sheikh Mohammed wants to develop production and trade around the region and the world of Islamic halal products, be they food, cosmetics, or healthcare products. There is a huge market for these products, as long as you can bring investors in and open this market. The financial market, sukuks and so on, will follow on this.</p><h4>How do you see local bonds being issued in London to come here to Dubai?</h4><p>I don't know why they are being issued in London, because for me I think the natural place for this is here in this region. We have international markets, and they can be accessed from everywhere. The brand equity of these entities that issue sukuks are from this region. They are known in their own region, and they are liked by their investors here. If you take it to London from here, you are just trying to pull investors to that market. It is more natural that these bonds are issued and traded here in this market.</p><h4>Corporate social responsibility is a major part of a bank's outlook in compliance with sharia principles. What sort of initiatives do you undertake in that regard?</h4><p>We recently announced the establishment of Noor Awqaf, an asset management company that is dedicated to charitable endowments (awqaf). It ensures that these endowments are managed efficiently and profitably in order to cater to people in need. Islamic endowment activities, one of which I chair, have suffered for years from a lack of efficient financial skills. These awqaf are run as an asset- and fund-management-type institution, or as a treasury. However, they have to be managed efficiently from a financial perspective. We have launched Noor Awqaf as a joint venture between an awqaf and a financial institution, and it is the first ever example of this. I think this will bring efficiency and financial rewards into Islamic endowments, and this will prove more beneficial in terms of addressing the actual needs of those in need, those whom the awqaf is for.</p><h4>How is Noor Islamic Bank a positive influence in Dubai?</h4><p>We are trying to redefine Islamic banking in the future, by creating a more progressive, open, tolerant, and global model of Islamic banking. We don't want to be pigeonholed into a limited audience, we want to become a global player. We want to create an Islamic icon built on those principles.</p><h4>What are the company's targets in the UAE in the coming year?</h4><p>We will keep doing what we have been doing. We will consolidate our position in debt structure with sukuks. We will continue to diversify our business, building stronger roots into our existing market. We will look for more opportunities and growth, and we'll try to tap into new areas in our market that have been underpenetrated.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011, the Mehr Housing Project produced 600,000 new units in its first phase. How has the Ministry balanced supply and demand considering the mass production of these units?</h4><p>It is the Ministry's goal to increase housing supply and create a balance between supply and demand in the housing market in order to control the trend of housing prices and provide housing to the vulnerable. By accomplishing these two objectives, the government's ability to respond to security challenges increases.</p><h4>How would you describe Iran's current infrastructure network?</h4><p>Sustainable development is fundamental in economic, social, and cultural matters. Roads, in particular, are very important in regards to the communications network, and also affect many of the activities of the country. Any new roads to be developed will be based on internal arterial roads. More than 90% of passenger transport is currently by road. The main priorities of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development are the extension of the road network and communication lines. The Mehr-Mandgar project has been developed to help achieve these priorities. The Urban Development Ministry and the government plan is to complete 745 kilometers of freeways, 5,626 kilometers of highways, and 2,970 kilometers of main roads by the end of the 10th government's term. Iran has land and sea borders with 15 countries. This reveals the growing need for the development of trade and transit in the region. There are three main transportation corridors and two main plans regarding road transport at the moment. In the north, we have transport connections with Russia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. While it is also possible to access Southern Asia and the Persian Gulf states, we also have the TRASIKA transit corridor that connects Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia. The East Transit Corridor aims at establishing relationships between the countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Indian sub-continent, as well as countries in North Africa and the EU. In development, we have the Land Transport Infrastructure Network and Asian Highways Development Plan. Iran is also considering a transit-oriented development plan for the east of the country with the aim of establishing a quick and affordable network between the north and south.</p><h4>What investments have been made over the past two years in order to improve the country's transportation routes?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Iran has made several investments in railways, highways, ports, and airports, which included   negotiations with a number of countries such as China, Ukraine, Turkey, Malaysia, India, Germany, Italy, and Spain, among others. Several Chinese companies in the field of financial resources have invested in transportation projects, such as the China Railway Engineering Corporation's (CREC) high-speed rail projects in Tehran, Qom, and Isfahan. There have also been railway project agreements with other Chinese companies including China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export (CMEC), China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), China Machinery Industry Construction Group (SINOCONST), and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) using the EPC+F method. There are also many European countries seeking to invest in transportation projects here, but due to political issues we are still in the preliminary phases. With the implementation of a targeted subsidies law, the transport sector has been affected by increased fuel and ticket prices, meaning transportation costs have increased. More than IR180 trillion has been invested in the transportation sector. Due to the lack of parts and the cost of transportation projects, negotiations with several foreign parties involved in construction projects have been carried out. In the aviation sector, investments, aircraft purchases, and passenger yields have all grown, both domestically and internationally. Due to sanctions, Iran does have a problem with an aging fleet, and the inability to buy new aircraft is affecting the quality of services. The air transport sector needs more investment and it also needs to replace inefficient aircraft. Airline mergers or liquidations will enable the sector to develop the air transport industry and thus improve quality. Despite the profitability of the commercial sector, there still needs to be much investment into sea, rail, air, and other subsectors. There needs to be incentives for private sector actors to encourage more investment. The right incentives could attract investment accordingly and in this way the internal transport sector could develop. In fact Iran, with its 980 kilometers of strategic borders, is the transportation hub for 75% of the world's oil and gas reserves. Being neighbors with Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan has provided our country with an exclusive transportation position.</p><div class="quote">“The main priorities of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development are the extension of the road network and communication lines."</div><h4>According to the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), Iran will extend 5,000 kilometers of its railway network. What is the overall strategy behind this upgrade?</h4><p>Because of the characteristics of the railway system and its compatibility with sustainable development, rail transport is considered green transport. Considering its high level of safety, demand for this type of transportation is increasing year-by-year. The Ministry of Roads and Urban Development has set the expansion of the railway system as its major priority. When the FYDP is completed, 4,683 kilometers of rail line will be added to the country's railroad system, and 1,033 kilometers of it will be in use by the end of this administration. The priority will be the completion of the railway system in order to develop the railway transportation network and its connection to important borders and ports. Some of the new projects will connect Qazvin-Rasht-Anzali-Astara, Kermanshah-Khosravi, Chabahar-Zahedan-Mashhad, and Shalamcheh-Basra. The completion of these projects will bring benefits such as increased transit revenues of about $350 million, 7,300 new jobs, lower fuel costs, and reduced pollution levels. Iran's rail network will benefit from connecting the railway systems of the Middle East and the EU, as well as Central Asia and China. The new networks will also connect to Caspian Sea countries such as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia in the north. This new network will not only benefit Iran, but will also provide international benefits. Due to its location, it will make Iran a crossroads. It will provide access for our landlocked neighbors to Iran's 3,000 kilometers of open waterways. The network will increase activity in its many ports in the north and south, which in turn will bring political stability as international trade increases. It will also provide a secure mass-transit system for imports and exports. Over the coming years, the transport sector is expected to grow higher than the GDP growth rate of 8%. The transport industry is not the only sector growing; the steel industry, for example, is expected to grow 13%. Higher oil prices have led to an increase in investment, which has been behind the country's growth. As a result of this economic growth, the transport industry is expected to double in size. The government is also planning to introduce fuel price subsidies, which I expect will increase the demand for rail. Along with the networks already mentioned, the 20-year development vision regarding railway networks plans to build an express passenger railroad in order to connect major metropolitan and tourism centers. The plan also aims to connect the country's major ports, as well as its mining, manufacturing, industrial, agricultural, and provincial centers. To eliminate bottlenecks in the system, we plan to use two lanes or electrify high-traffic lines. We will use the newest and most advanced technologies available for rail. By building these new routes, we will dramatically cut the travel time for passengers and goods. We have the best consultants and contractors who are qualified and competent to complete the projects. We have an international and unparalleled managerial and operational team. We plan to train rail experts in Iran and look into the possibility of training experts in other countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Iran ranks 68th in tourism revenues worldwide and is rated among the 10 most tourism-oriented countries. What makes Iran so attractive to international tourists?<br></h4><p>Iran is located on the Asian continent and has been the inspiration for a great deal of literature over the years. Its climatic conditions and natural landscapes are unique when compared to other countries. Since Iran has been a crossroads for many civilizations, it has made a long-lasting impact on other countries and cultures. Iran represents a mosaic of cultures and civilization. There is no other place in the world that can be compared to here. Because of these conditions, the country attracts tourists like no other country in the world; experts compare Iran only to the US when it comes to the diversity of climatic conditions and the variety of landscapes. The US has little history, though, and its background cannot be compared to that of Iran. To utilize such potential and capacity, we need sound planning. We have been doing a lot of planning to realize the government's vision to transform Iran into one of the 10 most visited tourist destinations in the world and achieve what the country deserves. What prevents the country from achieving these higher goals is the propaganda that obscures its potential. However, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit held in Tehran in August 2012 was a huge opportunity for the country and contributed to some of the goals that Iran's Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts, and Tourism Organization (ICHTO) has in mind. We treated delegates to the sights and culture of the country, giving them a taste of the historical and archeological richness Iran has to offer. Many of the missing historical and artistic links in the chain of humanity have been discovered in Iran, and these are among the attractions we offer. Hopefully, we will achieve our rightful position in the global tourism marketplace soon.</p><h4>What strategy is the ICHTO putting in place to stimulate both domestic and foreign tourism?</h4><p>In terms of domestic tourism, our figures are impressive. The number of trips made by Iranians annually is almost six times greater than the average figure in the West. During the Iranian New Year holiday, many people take the opportunity to go travelling. In 2012 alone, there were 51 million travelers over a 15-day period. The Ahmadinejad administration has given special attention to tourism-related issues, with a special focus on heritage, handicrafts, and cultural links. Many developmental projects focus on promoting tourism, including transportation development strategies and air, land, and maritime infrastructure with facilitation for cross-border transportation in terms of visa issues with neighboring countries. This administration has stimulated foreign tourism operators in order to increase their presence in Iran. Another strategy is to pursue the rapid development of accommodation and hospitality facilities and infrastructure, supporting hotels and guesthouses by providing subsidies. At ICHTO, we have also identified 1,200 model tourism areas that we wish to offer investors so they can make the necessary decisions. Our goal is to provide a fertile ground for attracting foreign investment through the support of the Ministry of Finance and the Organization for Investment, Economic, and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI). We have registered strong growth in FDI in terms of the returns provided on investor capital. Through these strategies we've been quite successful in attracting tourists from abroad. For the current Iranian calendar, we have projected a growth of 150% in tourism, although many countries in the world are facing a decline in the number of tourists. In this picture, Iran has increased its tourist volumes considerably. That considerable growth has been reached ahead of time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Iran Air become one of the leading airlines in the region?</h4><p>Iran Air is Iran's national air carrier. The airline was created by a merger of two companies before the Revolution, and our experience goes back about 70 years. We provide a benchmark and an exclusive model for air carriers domestically, regionally, and internationally. Iran Air was the first airline in Iran to operate jet aircraft. We were also the first to fly to the US with the 747-SB, from Tehran to New York (via London). We have now expanded to approximately 32 destinations internationally. We are the first airline in the region to provide training services for our personnel, including but not limited to operations, maintenance, and customer service. Iran Air has a well-organized human resources and training center, and we offer programs in two languages: Farsi and English. In 2011, the Iran Air training center was selected as one of the top 10 training centers in the region by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In terms of safety and passenger loyalty and satisfaction, Iran Air is also a leading airline in the region according to IATA audits. Iran Air has a well-planned, integrated network and has done its best under difficult conditions to expand successfully. Today, we have 52 aircraft, up from just a dozen or so at the time of the Revolution.</p><h4>Iran Air is part of a divestment project run by the government. What opportunities do you see emerging from the privatization project?</h4><p>Regarding the privatization program for Iran Air, there are two subsidiaries involved: Iran Airtour and Homa Hotel Group, which includes five hotels in Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad, and Bandar Abbas. Iran Airtour carries 2.5 million passengers per year, with about 20% on international routes. Iran Airtour previously operated Tupolevs, which have been grounded, and now all of its flights are operated by Boeing MD-83 aircraft. Iran Airtour was 100% privatized and separated from Iran Air, and it is doing very well. The Homa Hotel Group will also be privatized. About 90% of the revenue from the hotels comes to Iran Air, the owner of the company. Iran Air itself will probably remain about 15% in government hands and 80% will be held by private investors; we expect 5% to remain owned by employees. Foreign companies are legally prohibited from becoming shareholders of Iran Air unless they are approved by the government.</p><h4>How have you expanded your destinations over the last few years?</h4><p>New destinations depend on demand and company policy. In the past two years, we expanded our routes mostly to our neighbors like Iraq, where many of our citizens want to go to on holy pilgrimages. We fly to Baghdad and Najaf, two very important cities. There is a high demand for those destinations. We add destinations based on the government's needs.</p><div class="quote">“We provide a benchmark and an exclusive model for air carriers domestically, regionally, and internationally."</div><h4>How many passengers do you carry annually, and which destinations have the highest demand?</h4><p>We carry 6 million passengers per year, or about 8.7 million including Iran Airtour, but it is now a separate company. About 6.2 million passengers are domestic and the rest are international. We operate about 100 domestic flights a day to some 28 destinations. Internationally, we have 32 destinations. The highest demand is for the Tehran-Kuala Lumpur route, for which we have five or six flights a week with 747s. It is one of our longest routes, with eight hours of flight time. One factor for such a high demand is that Iranian nationals do not need visas to visit Malaysia. Domestically, Tehran-Mashhad is important, since it's a holy city. Flights between Tehran and Bandar Abbas, as well as Tabriz, Shiraz, Ahvaz, Rasht, and Isfahan see large passenger volumes. Domestic fares are regulated by the government, but this isn't the case with international fares. Due to strong competition among foreign and domestic airlines, supply and demand controls the international fares. We believe most of our international passengers prefer to fly Iranian carriers because they get a chance to communicate in their own native tongue during their flight and enjoy Iranian cuisine. When given a choice, I think Iranians prefer to travel with their national carrier.</p><h4>Which innovations would you like to see in the aviation infrastructure in Iran in the future?</h4><p>We want to expand the company, add new routes, and provide better service domestically and internationally. Until 10 years ago, we sent our aircraft abroad for maintenance and overhaul; however, we are now more self-sufficient and do 100% of the maintenance and overhaul in Iran in our own hangars, from light to heavy checks. The company is not 100% self-reliant when it comes to aircraft components, but we are working to improve our proficiency in this area. We are able to lease aircraft from abroad and operate them here, but I believe we should buy and have our own aircraft and train our own pilots and technicians as well. Leasing aircraft takes care of short-term business needs, but this isn't enough for Iran. We need to transfer technology to Iran and build up the airline industry here. Our objective should be to invest as much in the technical side as on the commercial side. Iran Air provides services to 85% of the airlines that fly to Iran. In Mashhad, there are six or seven foreign airlines operating, and they are efficiently serviced by Iran Air. Also, when you look at other smaller airline companies in Iran, you'll find that they are mostly staffed by retired and former Iran Air personnel. This is a source of pride for us, and it is a consequential result of nearly 70 years of field experience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key reforms are being carried out to enhance the healthcare system?</h4><p>Strategies taken by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education for the development of healthcare services include designing and building a clear healthcare network that will perform basic sanitary functions. Some of the fundamental principles of developing such a network include prioritizing preventative treatments, increasing services in rural areas, and better distributing resources to the vulnerable parts of society, while prioritizing and balancing services for inpatients and outpatients. It is also necessary to create a good private-public balance while also promoting decentralization in order to create independent healthcare networks. Designing and implementing basic healthcare services is in line with the Alma Ata Declaration, and the expansion of services is demanded by the public. Services demanded include dental and mental health services and preventative services for non-contagious diseases. We also aim to expand fair accessibility to service providers by choosing the right technology for maximum efficiency in the system, providing primary health care (PHC) for the majority of people, especially in rural and deprived areas, and improving living conditions in rural areas while promoting self-directed health care (SDH) in order to improve public health.</p><h4>What role does medical education play in the healthcare system?</h4><p>By combining medical education and healthcare delivery, we can create a broad context of service delivery that makes a shorter and more widespread training program possible. Due to this combination, an education system based on the community is provided that will better serve the needs of the healthcare sector. This expansive package automatically guarantees high-quality healthcare services. With the integration of medical education into service delivery complete, a number of other actions have been taken, including training manpower on the basis of the system's requirements, performing the necessary tasks for the codification of training programs, and carrying out the required interactions in order to make sure faculty members conduct research.</p><h4>How will healthcare costs evolve over the coming years?</h4><p>In line with communicated policies regarding health care and the requirement of a family practitioner in urban areas under Clauses A and D of Article 32 and Clause A of Article 35 of the Fifth Development Plan, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education is required to implement the family practitioner plan and the urban referral system, which will have a direct impact on health costs. An increase in health costs can be divided into two sections: necessary and unnecessary. For the necessary increase in costs, the required actions affecting policymaking and legislation have been taken, such as the Fifth Development Law. By managing the entrance and use of new technologies and also by implementing strategies such as the family practitioner plan, we have been trying to control the increase of costs that are unnecessary and irrational.</p><div class="quote">“We can create a broad context of service delivery that makes a shorter and more widespread training program possible."</div><h4>What steps has the Ministry of Health and Medical Education taken in order to lower the infant mortality rate?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health and Medical Education has taken many steps in order to decrease the infant mortality rate. A newborn health program covering the first 28 days will also feature preconception care for women at risk due to old age or chronic diseases, and referral mechanisms directed toward specialized care. We will also carry out the implementation of a grading program for prenatal services, which will have four key dimensions, including assessing health defects in pregnant women on a primary care level and their referral to specialized care when needed; the effective management of consultancy and transportation of endangered mothers and newborns to higher levels of health care if necessary; the standardization of beds in specialized care sections for endangered mothers and specialized care for newborns; and the enhancement of IT infrastructure and the hospital care quality improvement program. We are also working on designing and implementing service packages and several care systems to improve the quality of hospital care with a greater focus on the primary care level, including newborn resuscitation services, healthy newborn services, critical care for endangered newborns, developmental care services for newborns, prenatal care, and infection control in specialized care sections for newborns. Child health programs will also include a combined healthy child care system, comprising of efforts to reduce the risk of incidents, promote breast feeding, monitor the growth of nutritious eating programs and developmental care, and care for those with sight and hearing disorders as well as supply vaccinations and referrals when necessary. A combined care system for sick children will also feature standard controls and cures for infectious respiratory conditions as well central nervous system disorders, diarrhea, vomiting, growth and nutrition disorders, fevers, paroxysm, coma, shock, and referrals when necessary. A child mortality monitoring system will also assess the causes of death among children. The main goals of the children's health program include enhancing and promoting breast feeding in Iran, especially raising awareness and improving staff skills in case breast feeding problems arise, raising awareness and improving staff skills when it comes to caring for healthy children as well as sick children, and improving a family's ability to care for sick children and promote healthy eating. We aim to decrease the mortality rate of children under six years of age by means of controlling contagious and non-contagious diseases. The program's strategies include enhancing the continuity of breast feeding programs; expanding integrated care systems for children under six years old; providing standard healthcare services to healthy children and extending programs to the private sector; enhancing the prevention of accidents in children and raising awareness of preventable deaths; introducing a child nurturing program aimed at spiritual growth and lower crime and child abuse; enhancing the process of providing, distributing, and prescribing medical equipment; reviewing and completing programs related to enhancing and expanding the death registration for children between 0 and 59 months; and intervening based on the results. It will also focus on improving and empowering referrals and follow up systems in child healthcare programs at various network levels. Taking into account the importance of the child mortality index, for the purpose of monitoring child deaths and calculating the death index as well as analyzing the causes of death, special information systems have been developed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. With the help of this system, we can analyze child mortality rates and also assess interventions made for the improvement of child health. Through broad activities in the expansion of basic healthcare coverage during the 1980s and their continuity, as well as creating the family practitioner plan in 2005 in rural areas and urban areas with less than 2,000 people, our country has made exceptional progress in decreasing the mortality rate among children.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Health and Medical Education's plan to decrease health expenses from 50%?</h4><p>According to Clause B of Article 34 of the Fifth Development Plan, the Supreme Leader has stated that expenses paid by the public must reduce to 30%. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education, with the help of the Ministry of Cooperatives, by means of the legal context of this law has the implementation of the family practitioner plan and the referral system on its agenda. The plan is to increase the practitioner payroll on a per capita basis and increase the share of insurance in health-related expenses, thus decreasing expenses paid by people.</p><h4>What steps has the Ministry of Health and Medical Education taken in order to raise awareness of personal health?</h4><p>Based on Clauses A and C of Article 37 from the Fifth Development Plan, which forbids the advertisement of harmful products, the Ministry compiles an annual public list. We are also working on integrating medical education into primary care systems, enhancing instructors' skills in consultancy and public education, and taking a broad range of actions to gain the cooperation of other organizations in order to raise popular awareness about personal health. We also research, plan, and assess the processes, train and empower staff, carry out public relations exercises on the expansion of healthy environments, introduce new educational and electronic technologies, and use volunteer forces as health messengers to educate people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the developments that took place under your presidency in Iran?</h4><p>The approach taken to development in the ninth and 10th administrations of Iran has undergone a fundamental change in the way that justice has gained prominence. The optimal efficiency of industries has also become one of the  main components of development. Since 2004, invaluable fundamental measures have been undertaken, both in policymaking and in implementation. The overall efforts made are known as the Economic Overhaul Plan and have helped keep the country on track toward constant growth, despite the sanctions imposed by hegemonic powers and the repercussions of the global economic crisis. This has both qualitatively and quantitatively resulted in improved economic conditions across all walks of life, bridged the gap between the rich and the poor, and brought about more support for the disadvantaged in the country. Within the Economic Overhaul Plan, reforms have been undertaken to improve the way subsidies are provided to the public, the taxation system, and the banking system, as well as customs. Some of these reforms have already been enforced and others are about to come into effect. Despite the fact that most of the major economies in the world have been facing a financial crisis and recession, Iran's GDP, without taking petroleum into account, has grown at a fixed rate of 5% between 2004 and 2011. In 2011, the economic growth of Iran, without taking petroleum into account, was 5.2%. The income distribution inequality indicators in the urban and rural areas of Iran also bear witness to the fact that in recent years the economy has indeed improved. According to a report released by the Statistical Centre of Iran, the Gini coefficient, which in 2004 was 0.4061 in urban areas and 0.3896 in rural areas, reached 0.3560 in urban areas and 0.3390 in rural areas in 2011. This is the lowest it has been since 1969. The value of non-oil exports, which stood at around $10 billion in 2004, exceeded the $23 billion mark in 2011 and, on average, has seen an annual increase of 27.6%. Imports into the country during the same period rose from $40 billion to $61 billion and grew at approximately 8.2%. In line with policies aimed at boosting the capital markets, the value of the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) rose from IR325 trillion in 2004 to IR1,168 trillion in 2011 and, on average, saw an annual growth of 23.3%. Besides the economic growth in various fields and all the attention given to it by the government, we were also very mindful of our responsibility to privatize. Article 44 of the constitution makes it mandatory for the government to sell its affiliated organizations to the private sector. The government has tried its best to implement it. Brilliant achievements were made thanks to the implementation of the article, and the total value of privatizations was IR764 billion in 2004 and has now risen to IR245 trillion. Hence, privatization has become a top priority for the government and has led to a deeper market. In 2004, the revenues from tax collection, without taking petroleum into account, were about IR102 trillion, which rose to over IR259 trillion in 2011 and, on average, have experienced growth of 23% in recent years. The subsidy reform plan is yet another important and effective measure adopted by the government and once it was implemented, the consumption of fuel, as well as water and wheat, went down considerably. All in all, the reduction of fuel, water, and wheat consumption over a period of 15 months prior to 2011 was estimated to be worth $17.2 billion. The estimate is $7.7 billion dollars when the annual growth rate is not taken into account. Also, oil and gas consumption was reduced by 9% and 12%, respectively. Moreover, the consumption of mazut (without taking into consideration power plants), liquid gas, and kerosene, reduced by 40%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. The World Bank's Human Development Index report has also named Iran one of the top countries when it comes to human resources development, and this was achieved for the first time under my presidency. The Human Development Index is a succinct criterion for human development. In the 2011 report, the Human Development Index for Iran indicates a 0.707 figure, which places Iran 88th in the world and places it higher than countries like Turkey, ranked 92nd, China, ranked 101st, South Africa, ranked 123rd, and India, ranked 134th. Such changes and improvements prove that the government has always enacted a plan when it comes to human resources that has been able to promote Iran's standing in the world.</p><h4>In your view, what important opportunities and challenges does Vision 2025 represent?</h4><p>Achieving a worthy economic, scientific, and technological status in the Southwest Asian region, creating equal opportunities, forging appropriate income distribution, promoting increased per capita income, and providing jobs to everyone are just some of the objectives that the Vision 2025 plan is trying to reach. Considering the knowledge-generation indicators, Iran is way ahead of the objectives set forth by the Vision 2025 plan and has already achieved many of them. In terms of new technologies, including nanotechnology, aerospace-related technology, and the production of recombinant medicine, Iranian researchers have achieved a lot. Economically, we are in good shape in many areas. For example, in terms of GDP according to purchasing power parity (PPP), Iran is considered the second largest economy in the region and the 17th in the world. In addition, when it comes to foreign trade, the growth of the capital markets, the rise in FDI, and the production of industrial and mineral goods and certain agricultural goods, we are now ranked highly. However, in certain areas we need to achieve more; we need to pick up the pace to meet those objectives by 2025. In terms of social justice, we have registered the lowest Gini coefficient since 1347 (1969), which is indicative of the fact that the divide between the rich and the poor has become smaller, and that lower-income families are better off nowadays.</p><h4>The global economic crisis has left an impact on the government's budget. What measures has your government taken to support the Iranian economy and domestic development?</h4><p>I should first remind you that the impact of a financial crisis on an economy is directly related to the degree that the economy is integrated and linked to the global economy. The second point is that an economic crisis affects economies that are reliant on trade and financial exchanges. In the oil-rich countries, a portion of trade and financial exchange is affected by fluctuations in the oil market, and in this way global economic meltdowns may become significant. In this regard, an examination of crude oil prices over the last two years shows that despite some periodical ups and downs, oil prices have steadily gone up. This might be a result of the global crisis and the concerns that dealers may have about the disturbances in the strategic and international gateways of crude oil transportation. In other words, the aforementioned factors have caused an increase in global oil prices over the last two years. Of course, in recent years, the government has been trying its utmost to make the budget invulnerable to oil price fluctuations. In this context, the 2012 budget has been drawn up considering the price of oil at $85 per barrel, which is much lower than the actual oil prices in the market. Also, some of the revenues will go toward developing the non-public sectors through the mechanisms of the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI). Parallel to this, the government has been keen to increase its revenues coming from tax collection. This has become one of the top priorities. Another strategy is to reduce expenditures. The government has worked to be frugal since the beginning of the current Persian calendar year. The same strategy will be used in preparing the budget in 2013. With regard to the impacts of the financial crisis through international financial interactions, it doesn't seem that the current crisis will have a significant effect on the Iranian economy. The rise in stock market indices in recent years, which on some occasions coincided with the decline in stock market indices in European countries, bears witness to this.</p><div class="quote">“Since 2004, invaluable fundamental measures have been undertaken, both in policymaking and in implementation."</div><h4>In the second half of June 2012, you travelled to Latin American countries such as Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Venezuela. How are bilateral ties between Iran and South American countries playing a part in boosting the Iranian economy?</h4><p>Having a constructive and effective interaction with the rest of the world and strengthening economic, political, and cultural relations with the independent countries of the world has always been one of the foremost priorities of the foreign policy of Iran. This has also been emphasized in the Economic Overhaul Plan as well as the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP). Accordingly, the development of ties with Latin American countries has been very important to us and Iran has been focusing on the commonalities to meet our countries' needs. Iran and Latin America have a lot to cooperate on. Iran is eager to share its technical engineering capabilities and various experiences in industries such as cement, petrochemicals, housing, energy production, agriculture, the development of infrastructure, machinery, foodstuffs, mines, and so on with those countries, and wants to utilize their experiences and learn from their success stories as well. Latin America enjoys manifold potential and actualized capacities that have caught Iran's eye, and we want to engage in bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the region. That is why our relations have been steadily on the rise in recent years. Latin American countries are some of the richest in energy resources and minerals, and their total GDP is more than $5 trillion. Chile is the world's biggest copper producer and Peru is amongst the leading producers of gold and silver in the world. Bolivia has not only huge gas reserves, but also lithium mines. Venezuela is one of the major oil producers in the world. Other countries in that region are rich in minerals. According to the officially released numbers and figures, Iran exported goods worth of $173 million to the American continent and mostly to Latin American countries in 2011. In the same year, imports from the continent reached $772.9 million, which brings the total volume of trade with that part of the world to $900 million. The political developments in Latin America, and especially the developments that have happened since 2002, such as the coming to power of popular governments in many Latin American countries, are critical of injustices at the international level and have come to the attention of Iran. This is another factor in encouraging us to expand our ties with Latin America.</p><h4>The international trade climate has undergone changes during your presidency. How has your government turned these challenges into opportunities?</h4><p>Global trade, just like many other economic indicators, has been adversely affected by the global financial crisis, especially in 2009, when it faced a severe decline. The 2009 recession was the biggest plunge global trade has experienced since the Great Depression in 1929. Global trade growth was reduced from 7.75% in 2007 to 3.03% in 2008 and to -10.72% in 2009. This has been almost unprecedented in the history of the global economy. Although the crisis affected developed economies the most, the reduction in their economic growth made the emerging and developing economies lose their export markets and end up with less export revenues. Amidst all this, Iran was one of the countries that was least affected thanks to its own domestic capacity. Aside from the global financial crisis, hostile countries targeted the Iranian economy and have tried to create problems and disturb the commercial and financial system. Of course, the government has been able to remove or at least alleviate such disturbances. In order to overcome the imposed limitations and to turn these threats into opportunities, various initiatives have been launched, such as developing domestic potential to convert raw materials, and especially crude oil, into goods with higher value to be exported, expanding trade relations with neighboring countries and other regions, and developing bartering mechanisms and other alternative methods to do business with others. This way, we have been able to contain negative impacts and even make some significant advances along the way. In recent years, the emerging powers and developing countries have gained larger and larger footholds internationally. Meanwhile, developed economies have been losing their influence accordingly. Therefore, since the role of the emerging economies has been on the rise, Iran has been aiming to approach and develop ties with them. Iran is at the heart of the Middle East, both geographically and culturally. Iran's cultural, religious, and economic background, in comparison to the other countries in the Middle East, has allowed it to make a significant impact on both regional and world affairs. Iran is known as the bridge between East and West, and ever since ancient times has been featured in the considerations of every major civilization. Being a portal between continents and located on the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, which is an important transit point for much of the Middle East's oil, makes Iran an important country for the West. The most important characteristic of this land is its geographical situation, which gives Iran a significant role as a bridge between continents like Asia and Europe, and also between civilizations. For this reason, transportation routes between continents, including road, seaways, and now airways, historically had to pass through these lands. The Silk Road and other commercial activities that were essential for both the East and the West in ancient times made this country highly significant in the past. In the past century, through improvements in naval transportation and the identification of substantial sources of energy, the Persian Gulf has become an important location for naval powers around the word. And today, through improvements in air transportation and its subsequent increase in importance, Iran's skies have become an important transit route between the continents. Iran's geographical position gives it an important role in the Middle Eastern region, which means that it is central to any significant politico-economic considerations about the wider region. In addition, the discovery of vast fossil fuel reserves at the bottom of the Persian Gulf and the countries around it, and the worldwide industrial demand for these resources, means that there is a huge amount of oil tanker traffic passing through the Persian Gulf every day. This makes Iran's geopolitical and geostrategic position more important, and gives Iran even more leverage in its dealings with other countries in the region. During the Cold War, being a neighbor of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, as well as holding important oil reserves in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, made Iran a focus of Western interests. Iran is located on the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. The Persian Gulf was an important seaway in the past and it still has its own value. It has estimated reserves of 565 billion barrels of oil, which is equal to 63% of all the world's known resources of oil, as well as 30.7 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, which equals 28.5% of the world's total. This gives Iran, without a doubt, the biggest hydrocarbon deposits in the world. It is obvious that this situation is not going to change anytime soon. Another reason for the importance of Iran's energy reserves is that the West is evolving too slowly to diversify away from oil. Despite numerous oil and gas pipelines crossing the Red Sea, this area is still a vital economic and transportation center for the whole world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much growth do you expect for the Iranian economy in 2013?</h4><p>In 2013, three years after the subsidy reform package takes effect, the short-term results of the plan are expected to fade away and be replaced with medium-term and positive outcomes. Parallel to the intensification of foreign sanctions imposed on Iran, the internal capacities of the Iranian economy will be further reinforced. For example, with the reduction of oil revenues, the financial discipline of the government will become stronger. In order to be able to provide the required financing, the government will devise a more effective process to prevent tax evasion. There will also be new financial resources created by the selling of government properties. Foreign currency devaluation will become more optimal, and new markets will be created for exporting Iranian goods. Therefore, economically Iran will be in better shape in 2013 than it was in 2012. The projections of the IMF (without taking into account the fact that its figures differ from those released by the official sources inside Iran) also confirm this trend. Based on the latest report by the IMF, released in October 2012, the economic growth of 2013 will continue  into 2014 and 2015. The important point is that Iran intends to experience higher economic growth, relying more upon on its internal capacity.</p><h4>What strategies have been adopted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance to support national production and achieve self-sufficiency?</h4><p>Considering the role of this Ministry in shaping the macroeconomic climate to carry out economic activities, what it does will indeed be important. One of the foremost duties of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance is in regard to finance. The issue of promoting the financial system and changing the banking system has been taken well into consideration. In our plan to promote the financial system, the obstacles facing financing in the four areas of capital markets, banking, foreign investment, and financing have been examined by the government. The outcome of this plan has resulted in various projects the implementation of which can solve a number of problems. With regard to our efforts to change the banking system in Iran, we have concentrated on five areas: reforming the existing bodies and instruments, the creation of new bodies and instruments, legal reforms, strengthening supervision, and reforming monetary and credit policies. Moreover, we want to encourage financing methods such as PPP. We intend to integrate the capacities of different sections we have access to in financing. For example, the capacity of the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) may be combined with the capacities of specialized and commercial banks to develop the agriculture sector and guide working capital in industry, mining, and energy to infrastructure in the country. Preparation of a bill called “Changing the Taxation System of Iran" is yet another initiative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance that has already been submitted to the Parliament to be ratified, and the first part of the bill has been approved. The bill has been prepared based on our intentions to reform the financial structure of the government, reduce the reliance on oil revenues, facilitate investments, maintain transparency, counter speculation, expand upon tax foundations such as income tax and wealth tax, improve income distribution, and make use of taxes as an instrument for economic management. Some of the major approaches visible in the bill encompass the areas of production, exemption from tax, investment by all economic agencies, and support for extending their services. Of course, these exemptions will be tantamount to zero tax rates. Changing the way amortization is calculated and granting permission to economic enterprises for asset renewal are some of the most important ways to strengthen the financial structures within the economic enterprises. Moreover, direct support has been included for production by reducing tax rates and granting investment exemptions, and mechanisms have been presented for better directing liquidity. Another measure by the Ministry has been aimed at improving the business climate, creating a unified window for facilitating the licenses given for investment, examining and reviewing the regulations, bylaws, and directives related to production and investment through setting up a council to supervise the deregulation process, facilitating the issuance of economic licenses, and rendering investment services by the representative offices of the government. Paying off the debts of the government to economic enterprises through stocks and bartering mechanisms, offering financial and non-financial incentives to the enterprises sold to the private sector provided that the number of the employees rises, forming an empowerment department for the private sector in the Privatization Organization of Iran, and offering services to the private sector are some of the foremost approaches adopted to encourage the private sector and facilitate the financing structures in economic enterprises. Considering the role and importance of foreign investment in promoting financing and the transfer of technical knowledge to economic enterprises, the Organization for Investment, Economic, and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI) has devised plans to better attract foreign investment. Some of these plans include the formation of a capital coalition working group (domestic and foreign) with the participation of the relevant ministries and organizations, the introduction of new and modern financing methods to the private sector for a coalition between domestic and foreign capitals, the preparation of incentive packages for Iranian investors residing abroad so that they are encouraged to invest in various sectors inside the country, and the coordination of national organizations to make use of foreign financial resources through special arrangements such as the finance committee. This Persian calendar year has been named the year of national production by the Supreme Leader of Iran, and hence the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance has been working to deepen the capital markets both qualitatively and quantitatively through plans adopted by the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran. Some of the most important plans include expanding and developing the expert consultations on how to be accepted into the bourse, creating and developing infrastructural regulations for constant monitoring and launching national bodies, creating and launching new financial bodies in order to develop and facilitate the financing of private sector projects including the private investment funds, and launching advanced parallel transactions in the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) with the aim of facilitating the transactions of goods produced domestically. Moreover, we intend to conduct follow ups and feasibility studies for launching knowledge-based companies as off-exchange in order to show support for the creative ideas and help knowledge-based companies, promote the utilization of the capacity of the capital markets in financing companies and introducing financing methods and promoting information transparency in the capital markets, and launch the energy bourse and oil sukuks. The plan also incorporates facilitative reforms in customs to reduce the reliance of the economic enterprises on resources through granting loans in paying entry duties, clearing the goods by securing ban guarantees, clearing parts and raw materials on an installment plan, obtaining insurance guarantees, and facilitating customs formalities. In addition, coverage of commercial insurances, strengthening reinsurance, and the diversification of insurance services have been paid attention to.</p><h4>In 2011 and 2012, the subsidy reform plan was implemented, for which Iran was praised by the World Bank. What is the Ministry's assessment of this plan?</h4><p>Such an assessment becomes meaningful when its necessities and objectives are taken into consideration. Although problems that are caused by scrapping  the subsidies formerly given to fuels are so diverse and varied, the government was determined to go ahead with the plan because it sought “justice in the utilization of national wealth" and “the enhancement of productivity and competitiveness in the national economy." Since Iran is rich in natural oil and gas resources, which belong to everyone and our future generations, the importance of justice and sustainable development entail that first and foremost, each and every individual would have access to these natural riches so that poverty is alleviated and that the gap between the rich and poor is bridged, and all walks of life can enjoy the natural resources in an equal way. Secondly, the subsidy reform plan aims to prevent the wasting of natural resources and preserve them for future generations by managing energy consumption and resorting to an optimal consumption model. In the past, the price of energy and fuel was the same for all social groups, and this needs to be fixed. At the same time, the plan has the potential to drastically reduce pollution and environmental degradation. We also know that in order to achieve high and sustainable economic growth, economic enterprises need to become more competitive and energy efficient. Evidently, it will take time for this plan to become a complete success. Moreover, it needs to be accompanied by other reforms in other sectors. However, now that only one year has passed since the implementation of the plan, there are some indications such as the reduction of the Gini coefficient, the overall improvement of the economic situation of the disadvantaged in society compared to previous years, and the prevention of the rise of fuel consumption, especially petrol. We may safely assume that the plan has already been a success. To us, the subsidy reform plan is more like a national awareness-raising venture on the importance and vitality of natural resources.</p><div class="quote">“The subsidy reform plan is the most important part of a broader Iranian economic reform plan."</div><h4>How much will the implementation of the subsidy reform plan help the stability of the market?</h4><p>The subsidy reform plan was ratified by the Iranian parliament on January 5, 2010, and after being approved by the Guardian Council was communicated to the government to be implemented. On December 20, 2010, it became operational when the fuel and wheat prices were reformed. The goal of the subsidy reform plan is to replace subsidies on food and energy (80% of the total plan), with targeted social assistance in accordance with our fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plan (FYDP), and move toward free-market prices in a five-year period. The subsidy reform plan is the most important part of a broader Iranian economic reform plan. The government designed solutions to support the producers and help people maintain a sense of purchasing power. Naturally, those inefficient industries that are not able to adopt strategies to remain in the market may close down. Therefore, as long as such industries are replaced with new and more efficient ones, we have no reason to worry. However, according to Article 8 of the subsidy reform law, the government has been trying to be on the side of the producers by offering them support packages. In practice, if we compare the 5.8% economic growth of Iran in 2010 to the 5.2% economic growth in 2011, we see that despite the overall decline in global economic growth—global economic growth in 2011 was 2.9%—Iran managed to keep the wheels of its economy spinning and maintain positive and desirable growth. For the second phase, the important point for the government is to make sure that the enterprises are ready. We attach a great deal of importance to the approval and assistance of the other two branches of power in Iran. Therefore, the government has commissioned a number of expert studies in cooperation with the honorable members of the parliament, private sector pundits, and academics, to pave the way for the implementation of the second phase, bearing in mind the international and national economic situation and the tumultuous oil and gold markets. Another noteworthy point is that for the second phase we will be aiming to minimize the foreign currency rate fluctuations caused by economic sanctions imposed on us. When we were about to implement the first phase of the subsidy reform plan, there was a foreign currency shock in 3Q2010. Therefore, we had to postpone our work by a few months. When we overcame the shock, we went ahead with the first phase. We had another, more severe shock in 2012 as well, but we soon came up with a solution and launched an “exchange center" to better manage the foreign currency market in a more transparent way. Now the fluctuations have become much less frequent and we are gradually getting ready for the second phase. Sanctions have been impacting our exports as well. First, they limited our exports in areas such as petrochemicals, which resulted in lesser profits and the decline of indices, but little by little the resilient Iranian economy adapted itself according to the situation. Thanks to the rises in foreign currency prices, the proceeds from exports were higher, and the producers became more encouraged to export their goods. As a result, the profits made by the economic enterprises went up and the general index as well as the volume of transactions has increased in recent years.</p><h4>How do you assess the capital markets in 2012?</h4><p>The Iranian capital markets were growing briskly in 2012. The total index of the market hit 30,211 in October, which shows a 15.5% increase compared to the same period last year. At the end of October 2012, the market value was IR1,375 trillion, which shows an increase of 10.44% compared to the same period in 2011. The capital markets of Iran have always maintained positive growth, even when most of the international bourses were facing recession and severe price falls due to the global financial meltdown. Naturally, the growing capital markets in Iran can be the result of three factors. One is the proper use of opportunities created by the implementation of the general policies of Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution. This article stipulates modern views regarding downsizing and privatization, and has been crucial for exchange market activities in Iran. Another is the organizational and instrumental reforms that have happened in the capital markets in recent years, which have had positive impacts. In this vein, we established the required bodies in the capital markets, such as in goods, bourse, and off-exchange trading, as well as in the use of Islamic financing tools like sukuk. Finally, the managing views about financing and the methods to do it have changed and this has resulted in stronger capital markets. In the past, financing in Iran was highly dependent on the money market, but our studies showed that in order to improve the effectiveness of financing and alleviate the negative effects of inflationary financing methods, we needed to make better use of other financing sources, especially the capital markets. Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran has taken a series of measures and has not only been using new methods and organizations, but has also commenced consultations with economic activists as well as ministries and policy-making organizations, and will continue to do so in the future.</p><h4>How has privatization affected the Iranian economy?</h4><p>When the general policies of Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution started to be implemented, privatization picked up pace. Hence, in the years between 2004 and 2011, more than IR971 trillion worth of shares in state-run companies were sold. Privatization has impacted many of the dimensions and components of the national economy. For example, one may refer to the increased presence of the private sector in the economy of the country, the promotion of the efficiency of economic enterprises, and the productivity of the workforce as well as improved technology, competitiveness, and the reduction of government leadership in economic activities. In addition, thanks to the adoption of privatization-oriented policies to downsize the government, the ground was prepared to boost and reinvigorate investments made by the private sector. Attention paid to the capital markets and securities as the bedrock for the implementation of this policy resulted in considerable changes. In fact, it raised the market value, the volume of transactions, and market returns, as well as diversified companies and industries. In general, this policy made the whole market more attractive. The ratio of the securities bought and sold in terms of GDP (18% in 2004) rose to 30% in 2011. Privatization has not only led to more diverse companies, but has also raised the number of large companies present on the TSE. In other words, thanks to implementation of the general policies of Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution, both the number and the volume of transactions have been on the rise. Therefore, it can be claimed that privatization has been instrumental in deepening and elevating the capital markets. In addition, the government has approved a plan to offer shares to low-income families, starting with the poorest. Under the “Justice Shares" plan, 75% of the Iranian population has received shares in state-owned firms. The Justice Shares plan has also brought about positive results in the area of social justice. According to the Article 44 Implementation Law, the government is allowed to cede up to 40% of the total value of the privatized enterprises in every sector to low-income families. In conclusion, privatization in Iran is not solely about selling state-run companies or the government's share in them to the private sector. More importantly, it is about the creation of new enterprises by non-governmental sectors including private and cooperative ones. Today, dozens of new private banks and insurance companies have opened in Iran. Large contractors capable of exporting technical and engineering services are now operating throughout the country. Power plants, refineries, steel industries, cement manufacturers, airplane producers, and similar industries have been created. The domestic and foreign private sector is now active in finance, energy, infrastructure, large and heavy industry, and transportation; all sectors that had historically been ignored.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Export Guarantee Fund of Iran (EGFI) was first established in 1974 and re-opened in 1994. How are your operations increasing the nation's non-oil exports?</h4><p>EGFI is doing the same type of business and provides the same insurance coverage that many other export credit agencies (ECAs) around the world do. We are a member of the Prague Club and meet every six months to review all of our activities relating to export credit insurance and risk coverage. Our main duties can be divided into two parts: banking coverage, which is designed to provide export finance for Iranian exporters, and export credit insurance. We are the only Iranian organization to support non-oil exports. Exporters need to know they will get paid after delivering their goods and services outside the country, and we play a major role in these kinds of transactions. We can guarantee payment and issue an insurance policy for exporters to ensure that they will be able to receive their money after export. We work closely with companies and importers in other countries, and this is the non-banking aspect of our support. In terms of banking activities, there are a number of credit facilities offered by Iranian banks to exporters, but banks need to be sure that when they provide a loan to an exporter they will get their money back. We guarantee loans in favor of the bank so that we can help exporters be financed. We are acting as an intermediary between banks, Iranian exporters, and foreign importers.</p><h4>How do you protect your investors from foreign political risk?</h4><p>Upon assessing credit risks and export credit finance, the creditor or guarantor risk is analyzed with a model. Then a credit ceiling is allocated accordingly. In this case, the risks are both political and commercial. However, for FDI only political risks are important and this involves the study of business environments, investment climates, political stability, and investment rules and regulations in the host country. The main political risks are: war, expropriation, and acts of state. Like many ECAs, EGFI supports Iranian investors.</p><h4>How much has EGFI enhanced export volumes?</h4><p>Our role in non-oil exports is reasonable. However, we are trying to increase our involvement. We currently cover around 7% of Iran's non-oil exports, but we have a target to increase that by one percentage point every year because exports in Iran are increasing accordingly. The international average for top ECAs is around 10%, and in the MENA region it is around 4%. I believe that we will have many more active years in the future, and the number of exporters asking us for credit coverage is increasing year by year.</p><div class="quote">“Our plan is to reach $80 billion in exports by 2013. By doing this, we can reach a trade balance with less dependence on oil exports."</div><h4>What are the main Iranian products EGFI covers and what trend do you see with respect to the products exported?</h4><p>Petrochemicals, industrial goods and machinery, and pistachios are the top three, followed by carpets, dried fruit, and other agricultural products. At the moment, we are covering many techno-engineering products and services, and we cover many construction projects such as water treatment plants and hydro-power dams. We also cover non-oil related chemicals and medicines. According to statistics, the IT sector is also increasing its production and exports. As a rule, large companies do not prefer to work with EGFI, as they are already strong enough. Therefore, we are more inclined to assist SMEs that are working actively to develop Iranian markets. However, we never decline a request for coverage, as we do believe that “Made in Iran" has the capacity to expand in emerging markets.</p><h4>In which foreign markets is EGFI providing the greatest level of coverage?</h4><p>We are covering many African states, CIS countries, and Asia—especially China and India. We also cover some exports to Europe, Latin America, and even the US and North America. We don't see serious problems in our future exports because foreign importers are familiar with our products such as pistachios, caviar, and carpets. Iranian exporters trade mostly with neighboring Muslim countries, where they have stronger ties.</p><h4>How has the credit contraction due to the global economic downturn affected EGFI's operations?</h4><p>Many countries have been influenced by the global economic situation, but some of our activities have expanded because of the global credit crunch; it had a positive impact on our activities. We are working closely with other ECAs. We are also looking at helping companies obtain the machinery to manufacture products we normally import. We are acting as guarantors between the companies that manufacture this kind of equipment and Iranian producers.</p><h4>What are your medium-term expectations for export growth?</h4><p>Considering the statistics since 2005, we have seen increasing exports. I believe that in 2013 we will see a greater export volume compared, for example, to 2011, when we had $45 billion worth of non-oil exports. Our plan is to reach $80 billion in exports by 2013. By doing this, we can reach a trade balance with less dependence on oil exports.</p><h4>Recently, EGFI has focused on trying to attract tourists to Iran in order to boost the tourism sector. What is the strategy behind this new project?</h4><p>We made agreements with several local banks to allocate credits for foreign tourists to visit Iran. In other words, travel agencies can use this credit and pay it back in two or three years. We receive many pilgrims as well as normal tourists. According to our policy, we have to support them. For example, if you are Italian and you go to your travel agency, they will organize your tour and you'll pay them back in a couple of years. There's a lot of credit available and the system will be activated very soon, probably by the end of 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) recently allocated $14 billion in order to boost oil production. How can this investment enhance Iran's oil and gas sector?<br></h4><p>The NDFI's resources come from the export of oil and gas. In 2011, 20% of total oil and gas revenues were transferred to the NDFI. This figure will increase to 23% for 2012. Our aim is to reduce the country's dependency on oil and gas revenues. Following the foundation of the NDFI, the government began transferring a portion of oil and gas revenues to the fund. All of the funds should be used either for investing abroad or for enhancing local market development. Regarding the $14 billion investment, we decided to allocate a large share to the oil and gas sector. In fact, $5 billion will be used for the development of five phases of the South Pars gas field. This initial outlay is expected to herald further investments in South Pars. The next step for us is to further develop the downstream industries of the oil and gas sector, and we have plans for both greenfield and brownfield petrochemical projects. The oil and gas sector is an important pillar of development for Iran, and in 2012-2013 we will allocate a large portion of our foreign revenues to the petrochemicals industry. We aim to reduce the country's dependence on crude oil revenues. To achieve this goal, we have to substitute crude oil sales with value-added products. The NDFI provides finance for short-, medium-, and long-term projects in the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>The NDFI is one of the basic pillars of growth in the country. How would you evaluate the achievements of the fund since its establishment in 2011?</h4><p>Since its foundation, the fund has financed some 300 projects in foreign currencies. We are currently financing five refineries, 13 steel companies and aluminum production facilities, 10 power plants, 10 pharmaceutical companies, 13 petrochemical companies, and nine cement factories. In total, $13 billion has been allocated to different projects in many domestic sectors. In 2005, our cement production capacity was so small that we had to import most of what we needed. In 2012, not only are we meeting all of the domestic demand for cement, but we are also a significant exporter, and we are looking to expand into new markets. This is the result of the sufficient and successful financing of cement projects in the country. With regard to our power plant production capacity, we have the highest in the region and our electricity production is 70,000 MW. This means that we surpass Turkey and we export electricity to several other countries. Developing more power plants is our other project. We are now investing indirectly in projects to increase capacity and enhance the potential for production, aiming to fulfill the ambitious projections of the fifth Five-Year Development Plan.</p><h4>Which sectors of the Iranian economy are in need of further investment attention?</h4><p>Our main priority is the oil industry, since both upstream and downstream activities are the main pillars of the economy. There are also other sectors we believe need additional investments, such as agriculture and the steel sector. We believe that these areas have high potential, and we have foreign markets for both of them. Our other priority is to finance technical and engineering projects abroad.</p><div class="quote">“We welcome any appropriate investment opportunity either in the region or inside Iran."</div><h4>You plan is to invest a portion of your resources abroad. Which regions are you targeting?</h4><p>We provide financial services for projects and seek investment opportunities. We welcome any appropriate investment opportunity either in the region or inside Iran. Good opportunities lie in the financial markets of the region, especially in Central Asia and South Asia. We are studying these possibilities, and in the near future we will enter these markets and make investments. We aim to invest primarily in the capital markets and the oil and gas sector, both domestically and abroad. We are pursuing deeper penetration into the financial market, and by ameliorating economic relations with neighboring countries we can create a better financial environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strengths and prospects has OIETAI brought to the foreign investment climate of Iran?</h4><p>Iran's economy has considerable innate advantages. There are high capacities in hydrocarbon resources such as oil, gas, and petrochemicals, substantial mining potential, and different climatic conditions, which results in a variety of agricultural outputs. In addition, sufficient economic infrastructure to establish industries, well-trained and expert human resources, and access to free water have led to the emergence of investment growth by non-governmental economic actors in the national economy. In the field of economic operations, and regarding the revision of Article 44 of the Constitution, the private and cooperative sectors have become the main actors in Iran's economy, and they are well prepared to become the desirable partners of foreign strategic investors. Iran's capital markets also attract investors in terms of commercial operations. The performance indices of Iran's capital markets have been witnessing considerable growth, which provides for profitable investment in this sector. In the field of new policies for the attraction of foreign investors and according to the law, we have provided new incentives. For example, extending financial prizes in the form of grants to foreign investment companies and advisory companies plays a significant role in attracting FDI. In addition to incentives listed in the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) as well as its implementing regulations, the preparation and finalization of bilateral and/or multilateral foreign investment promotion and protection agreements with other countries should create a confident atmosphere for foreign investors.</p><h4>What is OIETAI doing to facilitate business for foreign investors and linking them to local partners?</h4><p>One of the considerable measures taken to link potential foreign investors to their local partners is to facilitate procedures and administrative support for issuing the necessary permits for the economic activities of foreign investors in Iran. Currently, Foreign Investment Service Centers have been formed in all provinces and are chaired by governors. These centers supervise and assist all activities and requirements related to the business of a foreign investor. This is an opportunity for each province to handle requests in a “one-stop shop" format. In order to expedite this measure, we are aiming to provide a single-window investment system through networks connected nationwide in 2013 that can make this process faster and more transparent. The implementation of these measures will lead to a reduction in the time and fees borne by foreign investors. Moreover, improving the Iran Investment Opportunity (IIO) website has led to a virtual connection network between foreign and local investors. The introduction of more than 1,000 investment projects through this website has provided the easiest and most appropriate channel for dialogue and cooperation between national and international enterprises. In addition to this virtual network, OIETAI has provided an opportunity for direct negotiations between local investors and their potential foreign partners through convening national, regional, and international seminars. This measure has improved negotiation abilities as well as the economic bargaining power of the two parties. It also fosters trust between Iranian investors and their potential partners, and paves the way for bilateral agreements. In other words, we could say that the attraction of foreign investment, with the aim of transferring technology and improving the management of investors, has become part of the behavioral culture of our local partners. There is no limitation with regard to models of cooperation. According to FIPPA, especially Article 3, foreign investors are able to participate in all fields that the local private sector works in. Thus, foreign investors can participant in greenfield projects as well as expansion plans through different schemes of FDI or contractual arrangements, which differ depending on the nature of any given project. According to the law, different schemes such as M&amp;As and NEM are also included. According to Article 214 of Iran's fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), there is an opportunity for local private sector investors to participate in developmental and infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Therefore, the presence of foreign investors in these projects will be absolutely reasonable and operational.</p><h4>In which sector do you see the biggest foreign investor appetite?</h4><p>Naturally, pioneering sectors in every national economy will have the highest attraction for investors. Iran's economy is not an exception to this case. Therefore, the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors, due to their high contribution to GDP and considerable financial return, are the focal center of interest for foreign investors. In these sectors, in addition to the presence of mega companies, we have to pave the way for the presence of SMEs in downstream industries by adopting an appropriate plan to complement the value chain. I also believe that the other real sectors of Iran's economy have sufficient attraction for foreign investors due to the high flexibility of demand. Among these sectors, industry and mining, agriculture, agro-industry, and tourism have considerable priorities. The numerous advantages of commercial and industrial free zones for economic activities, sufficient potential opportunities in the real sectors of the economy, and special financial services for foreign investors are also provided. However, I believe that, based on the new approaches mentioned in the fifth FYDP, we will witness the powerful and appropriate presence of local and foreign private sector investors in infrastructure—especially in the field of ICT—power plants, transportation, and housing in the near future.</p><div class="quote">“Extending financial prizes in the form of grants to foreign investment companies and advisory companies plays a significant role in attracting FDI."</div><h4>What role do you see for foreign investors in the industrialization process?</h4><p>Our goal to attract FDI is not solely limited to the mobilization of funds, because this minimum goal can be achieved through other foreign financing methods. According to Article 2 of FIPPA, attracting foreign investors should follow certain criteria. Improving technology, upgrading the quality of local products, and increasing capital productivity are among our goals. We expect that the linkage between national and international capital can develop the productive capacity of local enterprises, increase employment opportunities, grant access to international markets through exports, and increase the technical and managerial capacity of local enterprises. Based on this approach, we consider foreign investors as the potential partners of local capital in the industrialization process of Iran. Based on the above model, we are working to provide concessionary advantages to those foreign investors who intend to transfer technology and establish R&amp;D units along with their capital transfer to Iran. Thus, according to Article 111 of Iran's fifth FYDP, we are obliged to prepare new arrangements and incentives. We expect that this new strategy will be realized in 2013.</p><h4>Earlier in 2012 you emphasized the realization of a free trade zone (FTZ) in the region that will include Iran's neighbors. How can such FTZs be implemented in the region, and what will be the positive spillovers for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>It is assumed that by using special arrangements for industrial and commercial free zones, we can reduce the decision-making bureaucracy and provide more incentives, which can limit administrative fees and increase capital productivity. The results of an initial study indicate that Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and a number of other ECO member countries in the region have the potential to establish economic and commercial special zones to improve the flow of commodities and capital. It is crystal clear that economic interests achieved by this bilateral or multilateral measure will benefit all parties.</p><h4>What are the key factors that make Iran so attractive for investors?</h4><p>The rate of foreign investment growth has been definitively positive for the last five years. This growing trend indicates that Iran can be an appropriate host for foreign investment in its economic atmosphere. The provision of suitable economic infrastructure, sustainable access to energy, strong potential economic partners in the market, high demand flexibility, and  easy access to international markets have provided unique advantages for foreign investors. In addition to the above-mentioned economic advantages, the legal and regulatory conditions of foreign investor activity have provided a safe and low-risk atmosphere. We offer full coverage of non-commercial risks, a lack of limitation on the ratio of investment, and the acceptance of any contractual arrangements, which have improved the flexibility of negotiations between foreign investors and their local counterparts. Therefore, the easiest measure is to transparently and precisely introduce Iran as home to an economic atmosphere with diverse investment opportunities.</p><h4>Since the government is putting emphasis on investing in the non-oil sectors of the economy, how is OIETAI trying to balance FDI among these sectors?</h4><p>We are working hard to expand the network of the value chain in complementary and midstream industries. Currently, a number of expansion projects in this sector have a high internal rate of return (IRR). The volume of investment required in complementary industries is less than those upstream and it is also more profitable. Thus, this chain should be completed. We have to improve the attractiveness of other sectors by providing appropriate investment opportunities. Suitable financing structures for projects as well as the provision of financial and monetary targeted incentives and advantages can pave the way for the more appropriate participation of foreign investors in other sectors.</p><h4>How are OIETAI and the government planning to diversify the attraction of capital from national and international private finance?</h4><p>The mobilization of financial resources from the international markets is on our permanent agenda. These resources certainly contain various models of participation and lending instruments. There are different modes of financing such as pure finance, structured finance, issuing foreign exchange such as Islamic sukuks, various participation models in the form of FDI, and foreign portfolio investments (FPI), which can be utilized depending on the financial structure of any given project. What should be considered in this process is the liveliness of the local private sector. We also aim to channel existing liquidity in the country and organize more activities in the real sectors of the economy. Capacity building for the local private sector and improving the productivity of investment in Iran are prerequisites for the efficiency of foreign-sourced funds.</p><h4>What do you project for FDI in Iran in the medium term?</h4><p>Our mid-term target as well as the current year's goal is to preserve the country's rankings in the attraction of FDI. We are looking forward to attracting more contributions from international financial resources in our economic sectors. Considering the achievements made during the first six months of the Iranian year, statistics indicate a positive return. According to the existing data, the statistics of foreign investment approvals during the above-mentioned period indicated 80% growth compared to 2011. We are working to preserve and strengthen this growing trend. New approaches mentioned in the country's FYDP imply a promising future in terms of the linkage between national and international capital in our economy. Our goal is to pave the way for this win-win situation.</p><h4>What is your message to the international community and foreign investors?</h4><p>Iran has recently become one of the most influential countries in the international economic arena, and fulfilling our obligations to economic contracts has provided a positive and decisive record on an international scale. The above-mentioned roles and functions, reduction of economic inequality on an international scale, and efforts made to reduce poverty in less-developed countries have strengthened this historical background. Extending grants and developmental aid to these countries, either in the form of direct contracts or through international institutions such as the International Development Association (IDA), the OPEC Fund for International Development, and the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development (ISFD), have improved the economic rankings of our country in the international economic arena. The high technical and engineering capacities of our country in power plants, dams, irrigation networks, and transportation have led to a flourishing national economy with the participation of the private sector in the international economy. The preservation of capital is an intra-national characteristic and it thrives where there is economic security as well as suitable profitability. I believe that Iran has a unique position to attract these capital resources. Based on the strategy of inviting foreign investors to participate in joint activities at the level of the national or international economy, we can seize this opportunity to introduce ourselves as rational partners for potential foreign investors. The outlook is positive and it provides prospects of a growing future at a regional scale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the defining characteristics of the banking industry in 2011?</h4><p>We were faced with a number of challenging issues throughout 2011. However, by facing those challenges, we managed to equip ourselves with a mechanism to greatly improve our internal control system and restructure the organization with a focus on our clients. It also helped us to put more of an emphasis on corporate governance rather than just focusing on growth. That was a great opportunity for us; every change strengthens you and makes you healthier with respect to the competition. It really was a year of change.</p><h4>How can these challenges be turned into growth opportunities?</h4><p>We turned the challenges into an educational process; you must constantly study the changes that are happening to the market and its legal framework and learn from it. Then you implement a system, in order for your organization to weather it with minimum loss. That's how we develop and educate ourselves. This has helped us to strengthen our internal procedures and it was educational in terms of restructuring our organization to be more agile and responsive to the challenges of the market. When you live in a routine with few challenges, you get used to what you are doing. But when you face a challenge, you start thinking. When you get through the challenges successfully, you get to know the team better, find better solutions, and start thinking out of the box. What is better than that for an organization? Two years ago, when we developed our five-year strategic plan, we segmented it into three phases in terms of our focus: growth, internal procedures, and more growth. In 2011, our clients ranked us number one with respect to the loyalty index measured on a quarterly basis, and our deposits grew more than 39%, which was basically a record for the market. We started segmenting our clients into retail, premier, private, and corporate banking. By having a corporate banking unit, we achieved two aims: offering better services to our corporate clients, and concentrating all the large exposures of the bank into one business unit in order to better measure and supervise credit risk. Corporate banking involves not only dealing with lending, but also a comprehensive and A-Z client service. Our risks are now controlled much better and we are overwhelmed by new clients' requests, giving us the luxury of selection by running a “know your customer" (KYC) procedure at the international level. Our focus on retail banking is with a view on e-banking services, based on our historic achievement. Therefore, we are not focusing on growing the number of branches, rather we focus on increasing the number of retail clients by offering them the ease of use of e-banking services (on the transactional side), and utilizing the branches mainly for the purpose of offering new products and alternative banking solutions. By taking this direction, our client base has increased by 50% over the past two years. By implementing our CRM system, we now know the gender of each client, the category, their income, how and where they live, and basically their demography. That has helped us to introduce some new services customized for our customers' needs. In 2011, we also managed to successfully raise our capital to the new regulation stated by the Central Bank of Iran.</p><h4>Saman Bank introduced e-banking to the Iranian market. How would you assess the quality of this service and how do you create a competitive edge?</h4><p>We blend. We have access to an international knowledge base, especially in terms of e-banking products and services, and we customize them to our own needs. We mainly develop the applications ourselves. Our new website will be launched in late June and we implemented a new internet banking service in 2011 named “Saman NetBank." If you compare Saman NetBank with the internet services from other banks, you can tell the difference yourself. The usability, the interface, and the user-friendliness of the menus and toolbars are totally different from what people have experienced before in this market. And this was achieved just by bringing over the knowledge and customizing it to our own needs and culture. A local fund transfer is a very vivid example of this because the need in this market is repeat transfers to relatives, small businesses, or partners. We have a group transfer system, where you can transfer from one to many accounts. It allows timed transfers and automatic daily transfers, and these are what our customers need from us.</p><h4>In which financial sector are there opportunities for you to grow and what new financial services can be introduced to the market?</h4><p>First of all, we are going to launch our new brand and logo. Other than that, we believe that SMEs and retail are the two markets where the risk is relatively lower, and they have not been developing greatly in this market. Everybody is after major clients, but in this society small communities matter a lot. We have a beautiful culture with respect to helping each other when in need; for that, there are few banking services available. I'm not talking about micro financing; I'm talking about communities of 10, 20, or 50 people living on the same street or neighborhood. They sit down, talk, and establish small funds in which everybody participates with a small amount, and they lend the money when in need to a member. These small funds are not regulated, and they are not supervised by any bank because it is community-based action built on trust. We are working on offering a product specifically for this market and establishing small funds for these communities. They will be able to open an account with us and transfer their funds on a monthly basis, or by using whatever mechanism they agreed upon among their community.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Iranian economy going forward to 2013?</h4><p>In corporate banking, our only focus would be on facilitating and financing food commodities and pharmaceutical products, as well as working capital financing. On the retail side, we will focus more on offering credit cards with the use of our newly implemented scoring system. SME lending is fairly successful for us, especially with merchants that use our POS terminals. Moreover, on the SME side, we maintain our focus on brokerage firms that participate in both the stock and commodity markets. This growth is driven by the development of the stock market and it's becoming deeper and deeper with respect to volume, value, and frequency of transactions in those markets; the participants are becoming more sophisticated, they require a variety of services, and we offer specialized services to brokers especially. We will try to stay on the edge and specialize even more in e-banking and international banking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the privatization program changed the Iranian banking sector, and how has it affected Tejarat Bank in terms of competitiveness in the market?</h4><p>According to the principles of Article 44 of the constitution, most of the banks in the country have been privatized. In line with this, 10 banks are presently listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) and another six are traded on the Farabourse. Tejarat Bank was privatized in 2009 and at the moment only 10% of its shares belong to the government. The other 90% of the shares have been allocated to the private sector through the TSE. The banks that have listed on the Farabourse only allocated 20% of their shares to the public. In general, bank shares are highly liquid, and by granting credit, the banks are seen to play an important role in the GDP of the country. The balance of credit in the whole banking system is around 17% of GDP. In addition, the value of bank transactions is increasing and capital investments are also on the rise. The appetite for privatization in the finance sector is still very high, and the government is creating new rules to divest even more. In this framework, we try to keep Tejarat Bank competitive by providing new services such as mobile banking and e-banking. On the other hand, we are going to mix these services with others in order to provide added value. Naturally, by providing these new electronic services, we are expecting to gain more deposits, and we anticipate that digital money will soon replace cash. We have observed that people are less interested in withdrawing money, and we are focusing on this fact with new investment projects.</p><h4>How do you intend to increase the penetration rate for digital money services?</h4><p>We are focusing on several projects in order to increase the penetration of digital money services and credit cards. One of the most important aspects of this drive is the electronic money basket, and we can develop it through enhancing the POS system. This can be done in many ways, such as installing wireless POS systems on taxicabs. We also plan to provide every food delivery employee with a wireless POS system, so customers can pay for their take-out food electronically. In our program, we would like to increase the presence of ATM machines as well as introduce mobile ATM machines on vehicles that travel around the city. We already provide a similar service, which is useful when an exhibition or fair is being held. Instead of going to the ATM, the ATM comes to you.</p><h4>How does the bank aim to add value?</h4><p>We have recently introduced a new card called “Easy-Buy" to the market. It's more or less a credit card and we have signed an agreement with private companies, such as supermarkets, department stores, and malls, and people can buy specific products for less. The commission fees for these transactions are very low, and the one that is charged is from the seller, not the buyer. In the meantime, we are defining some new services on POS machines since the technology for POS systems is cheaper than for ATMs. I think within the next year we can start replacing ATMs with POS machines, but the process is ongoing. We are doing the same thing for mobile services, and we are now in Phase II of that process. We will reach the final phase in 3Q2013.</p><div class="quote">“We are focusing on several projects in order to increase the penetration of digital money services and credit cards."</div><h4>Which specific segment of your clients are you targeting for these new products?</h4><p>We are not restricted to a specific target group right now, as we are targeting the whole society. Of course, in the near future we will focus more on specific segments of our clients, for example students or corporate customers. The value of actual transactions, roughly 22 million ATM transactions a day, demonstrates that this operation will be fruitful, especially among younger customers who are more attracted to new, reliable, and advanced products.</p><h4>How would you appraise the resilience of the Iranian banking sector?</h4><p>It is clear that the banking system worldwide is facing challenges, but we have found different and interesting opportunities domestically. With the increase of the currency exchange rate we can actually increase our exports and decrease our imports, developing and strengthening industrial production within the country. The increase in exports will lead to employment growth, and our goal is to support companies within the country to grow and expand. We foster the private sector because the government is divesting and private companies want to be competitive and strong in the market. Since government revenues are reduced, non-oil exports will increase and will soon replace oil exports. In the past, when importers needed foreign currency, they had to turn to the Central Bank, which would provide foreign exchange. Now, we buy foreign exchange from non-oil exporters so they can easily make transactions in foreign currency outside the country. There's now no need to bring foreign currency into the country and sell it again. The dependency of the private sector on foreign currency is getting lower day by day, production for exports is developing, and imports are decreasing. All things considered, we would like to share our presence in the monetary market with visible changes in the ICT sector through direct investment in order to reach international standards, providing new tools in the national banking system and in the capital markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Alborz Insurance has been in the market for 52 years, with a wide portfolio. What are the cornerstones of your activity?</h4><p>Five or six years ago, insurance was mostly marine oriented, but now we insure more automobiles and motorcycles. In fact, about 50% of our portfolio is focused on this segment. Switching to cars and motorcycles was not a decision we made, but instead it was due to market forces. Currently, vehicle owners are obliged by law to obtain third-party liability insurance. In addition to that, the automotive market is growing at a rate of 1.5 million new cars every year. The main reason we have expanded our automotive portfolio is because auto production has increased dramatically over the past couple of years. Coupled with imports, we are starting to see a luxury market that has to be insured. When considering the size of the insurance market, more than 55% belongs to motorcycles and cars, with rates decreasing because of the tough competition in the market. Before privatization, there was no real competition; now we are witnessing a market undergoing expansion and we have to adjust to that trend. Every insurance company tries to maintain a balanced portfolio of risks, and Alborz Insurance has a historical advantage in marine and transportation insurance. Given that marine and travel insurance has been less popular over the past few years, our share of the auto insurance market has increased accordingly. That is how we have managed the composition of our portfolio. While the market pushes us toward auto insurance, we look to attract more business from other sectors in order to maintain a more balanced portfolio. When it comes to marine insurance, the rates are going down because of competition, not volume. We offer premiums that have been decreasing due to the greater number of competitors in the market. Transportation insurance rates have lowered as a result of the global economic downturn as well.</p><h4>What strategies are you putting in place to differentiate the company from its competitors?</h4><p>We offer a variety of policies in life insurance. Some are designed for the event of death and others are more long term in maturity. Due to the inflation rate, buying life insurance is not convenient for consumers. If someone passes away, the amount of money left is rarely considerable. What the country as a whole is lacking due to laws and regulations is incentives; we cannot make life insurance more attractive to customers and it is difficult to make insurance in general alluring. Breaking down our markets, auto insurance comprises 42% of our business, health 20%, marine 5%, construction and engineering is 5%, and 10% of our portfolio is geared toward professional liability. About 6% of the company is dedicated to life insurance, and we are working to increase this figure—the future belongs to life insurance. The premiums raised by life insurance need to be invested in programs and assets that will generate an income to be paid off in the future. However, current laws and regulations do not allow us to do that in an economically meaningful manner.</p><h4>What can be done at a legislative level to ease these laws?</h4><p>As insurers, we would like to foster an insurance culture. People are not familiar with the insurance world. It is not my duty to educate them—it is the government's role to improve the insurance environment and raise people's awareness about it.</p><div class="quote">“We want to inject the market with innovative products because we are an avant-garde insurance company that goes against the grain of more conservative competitive enterprises."</div><h4>What projects are in the pipeline to make the company more competitive and profitable?</h4><p>What distinguishes us is our service. We have been customer-oriented through the years to provide value-added services. We conduct a very rapid evaluation of claims and disperse payments quickly, which is highly attractive for our clients today. What we have done recently to increase our competitiveness is introduce new products that are exclusive to Alborz. One is coverage for cancer treatment. Patients pay premiums for a few years and are covered for the rest of their lives. We have designed this product with a team of practitioners and doctors. The other Alborz product we have recently introduced to the market is coverage for newly married couples that are struggling to have a baby. After certain conditions are met, we pay for different treatments to help them have a child.</p><h4>What do you expect from these two unique services you are bringing to the market?</h4><p>These two products have been introduced fairly recently to the market, and what we intend to have is not only customers using these products but also contributing to brand association and recognition. We want to inject the market with innovative products because we are an avant-garde insurance company that goes against the grain of more conservative competitive enterprises. We are trying to project an image of ourselves, using these products as tools to create a fresh perception.</p><h4>How has the market responded to these products?</h4><p>Couples insurance is slowly making its way into the market at a gradual pace due to cultural barriers. For cancer treatment insurance, the response has been  tremendous.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the achievements of the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP)? Has it changed the landscape of the insurance industry?</h4><p>Stable countries generally maintain programs for the insurance industry that have a good outlook for the future. Having been stable, Iran also has not only a FYDP, but also a 20-Year Outlook, both approved by our Great Leader, the Iranian Parliament, and the cabinet. Accordingly, the FYDP has been devised and, currently speaking, we are implementing Phase V. So far, we have carried out many programs through this platform in order to develop the industry, and the performance of the insurance market has been fine. Our targets in the insurance sector have been achieved, and now we are shifting our focus to long-term goals. Under the guidelines of the FYDP agenda, we have launched a new approach to the insurance sector that will make the market more competitive and increase the insurance penetration rate. In addition, through the FYDP, we are investigating strategies that will support the expansion of the sector and promote the regulatory and supervisory position of Bimeh Markazi.</p><h4>How is Bimeh Markazi expanding the Iranian insurance market by encouraging private sector participation?</h4><p>The Iranian insurance industry dates back more than 80 years. As for the Iranian civilization, that goes back 4,000 years. There have always been traces of insurance in our culture, which is why I firmly believe that our people have been accustomed to different types of insurance. As far as religious jurisprudence is concerned, insurance was backed by our Great Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, and until recently it has been completely dominated by the government. However, according to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, our country has launched a program that contributes to the privatization of many companies in the realm of the insurance industry. At present, a growing number of private players are involved in the insurance market. Insurance is a religious and legal contract that has its basis in ethics. As the regulator of the Iranian insurance market, we issue licenses and facilitate the entrance of private insurance companies into the market. There are now 25 insurance companies in Iran, and only one of them is owned by the government—the rest are non-governmental.</p><h4>How is Bimeh Markazi acting in order to increase insurance penetration rates?</h4><p>The whole market is worth approximately $10 billion. However, there are challenges that deprive people of enjoying the insurance market to its full extent. In that sense, our aim is to open up the market to allow Iranians to benefit from insurance products for the purpose of appreciating the value of their lives and belongings. We are primarily focusing on life assurance and we intend to expand it to a greater extent. Bimeh Markazi is implementing strategies in order to enhance consumers' interest in life assurance. As an example, we are in the process of developing annuity, disability insurance, housewives' annuity and insurance for artists, musicians, and national heroes, in addition to other segments that can be covered by life assurance policies. We also attempt to enhance public awareness to persuade Iranians to benefit from insurance and guarantee and secure their future. Considering our strategy, life assurance is of prime importance and our staff and team is carefully exploring the trends of life insurance in foreign markets in order to demonstrate how our people can take care of their health and wealth. Currently, various classes of insurance are growing rapidly, including life assurance, household annuity, and disability insurance. As for non-life insurance, we have made considerable efforts concerning factory workers' risks, the development of rural areas, land vehicle transportation, industry, and mining. We invest in financial services as well, which paves the way to increase penetration rates and the further expansion of the ever-increasing market. So far in 2012, the insurance market has grown by 45% in terms of total insurance portfolios, with a 100% increase in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.</p><h4>The Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade and Bimeh Markazi have announced that they will insure oil tankers traveling from abroad to Iran. What benefits will this bring to the country?</h4><p>Insurance is the messenger of peace. The challenges we are facing have a negative impact on the economy, especially if there is a spillover to insurance companies. As an insurance entity, it is typical to rely on other insurance and reinsurance companies around the world. The international relationship between insurance companies is at risk at the moment, but we are strong and peaceful and continue cooperating with our neighbors and fellow companies. That is why we are insuring oil tankers. Holding such capacity, we welcome any insurance company throughout the world to establish joint cooperation with us. International entities show ever-increasing interest in our market. We have resolved all insurance-related problems internally, and now Bimeh Markazi is able to cover international activities.</p><h4>How do you expect the insurance market to develop in the next five years? Which insurance classes will grow in particular?</h4><p>We have devised a plan for the growth of every insurance class in the market for the next five years. Moreover, we are ready and willing to help foreign companies to launch their activities in Iran, especially in the realm of life assurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Iranol in the past two years?</h4><p>Considering our vision, mission, strategies, and values, Iranol has become a leading company in producing base oils, engine oils, and industrial and automotive lubricants. We have two refineries. Tehran refinery has an annual capacity of 250 tons of various grades of base oils, and the other is Abadan refinery with an annual capacity of 50 tons. Including furfural extract (RPO) and other side products used in finished heavy oil products brings our total yearly production to over 600,000 tons per year for both domestic and overseas consumption. This equals total sales of almost $650 million per year. Our total exports equal $250 million. We produce the highest quality oil for gasoline, diesel engines, and also industrial oil including hydraulic oil, compressor oil, gear oil, circulating oil, transformers, and many other industrial lubricants that total to over 180 types of products. Some of our latest high-quality diesel and gasoline oils are Iranol Power, Iranol Top Engine, Iranol D-40000, Iranol D17000, Iranol Ronia, Iranol Royal, and Iranol Hyper. There are many others that have been approved for use in engines manufactured by Man, Volvo, and Renault, for example. We are considered one of the leading lubricant companies in Iran in terms of our R&amp;D, customer service, sales, and revenue. That's because we anticipate a bigger share of the domestic market and continue satisfying our major internal clients with quality products and outstanding service.</p><h4>How will your market share evolve?</h4><p>Our philosophy is providing good quality products, which must come with an affordable price. Therefore, our strategy is based on the best quality production for the best comparable price. That's what we're doing to increase our market share considerably. We don't produce additives, but we generally import them according to our needs. We use about 50 different types of additives, especially for industrial lubricants such as turbines and compressors. Importing additives may be costly sometimes, but it's never been a serious problem. A high-quality additive makes better final products. We're working to import those additives to keep us competitive. Our strong R&amp;D department and laboratories with 15 highly educated experts are developing new products. We also have a quality control department to make sure everything is checked and controlled for the best quality productivity. Our sales department, with its high-quality staff, can offer the best to our esteemed customers.</p><h4>How many employees do you have in total?</h4><p>We have over 520 employees at our refinery in Tehran, and 200 in Abadan. Our central office in Tehran also has around 85 people. In total, we have around 850 employees that are highly trained and skilled.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy is based on the best quality production for the best comparable price."</div><h4>What is your best-selling product internationally, and which countries do you trade with the most?</h4><p>We export base oils and recently started to export rubber process oil. Of base oils, we export around 250,000 tons a year. We export 60,000 to 70,000 tons from Abadan, and we also export the heavy base oils SN-500 and SN-650 from Tehran. This is all base oil and sometimes we have excess. In 2012, we started exporting furfural extracts, a new project for which we have a license. We mainly export to South Asia and especially India, as well as the UAE and China.</p><h4>Do you export raw materials or processed oils?</h4><p>In the past, we haven't been active in exporting finished products, but we have carried out an extensive marketing campaign for exporting finished products. We do export finished products to some of our neighboring countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, as well as other CIS countries. We are also testing a handful of markets in Africa and South America.</p><h4>What other projects are you currently working on?</h4><p>In addition to our research on new products, we have an R&amp;D committee for special products. So far, it has developed an extract for rubber processing firms and a side product that is environmentally friendly and enjoys 50,000 tons consumption annually.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the development of Iran LNG's sweetening plant progressed over the last year?<br></h4><p>A year ago we were just beginning. Now, we have received more than 70% of the equipment we need in terms of weight, and are expecting to receive the remainder soon and have everything up and running to begin the sweetening project in the 2Q2013. We are also now working on liquefaction, and will later be concentrating entirely on that side of the venture. Progress on that end has reached around 30%, and by the end of 2012 it should reach about 60% or 65%.</p><h4>To which countries are you going to deliver your products?</h4><p>We have held negotiations with around 14 countries. First, we started negotiations with European countries, and step-by-step we began to concentrate more on Asian countries. The European market has become less attractive for us due to the cost of energy there—prices in Europe are up to 30% lower than in the Far East. In our belief, Europe will never again be a focus for the LNG sector. Growth in China is at around 7%-10%, while in Europe it is around 1% and consumption is declining due to the falling demand for energy.</p><h4>Iran has huge reserves of natural gas. How are you managing to meet the increasing demand for gas in the region?</h4><p>I think that most of the demand for gas in the Middle East will be covered by pipelines from Iran or from other reserves in the Middle East. It is more economic to use pipelines as the primary export method. The government has plans to export gas to Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in this way, as well as to Turkey and Pakistan.</p><h4>What can foreign investors bring to the sector?</h4><p>The international financial crisis has changed many things in the global marketplace, and nobody can say for sure that demand will increase rapidly. For the first phase of the project, we are expecting a 30% rate of return. However, the rate we will achieve from the second phase is unknown. Foreign investors, therefore, have to consider the amount they can make, and whether it is attractive enough.</p><h4>The company is planning to decrease state ownership from 49% to 20%. How is this process proceeding?</h4><p>This is a law made by the higher council, and we have to follow it to decrease the government's ownership of Iran LNG to 20%. This is a must, and it cannot be avoided. However, progress on this issue depends on reaching some important milestones. The government is always ready to put up the money and invest, but the private sector is more concerned about doubtful investments. As we approach certain milestones in our plans, the private sector is becoming more interested in what we are doing and wants to acquire a larger slice of the company. In recent months, we have carried out negotiations with private sector companies and could soon sign some Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) in order to give investors the chance to receive shares via the privatization process.</p><h4>What are your expectations over the medium term?</h4><p>About two months ago, I was in the US at a conference. There, I noticed that US firms are also hesitant to come to the market. Following an increase in unconventional gas exploration, as well as booming production in the US, it was expected that the US would look to go back to being an exporter of LNG, rather than an importer. An LNG plant was also expected to be set up between 2015 and 2017. However, the mood has now turned. There is uncertainty in the global market. Five years ago it was easy to predict that China would import 12% more each year, Europe 2.5%, and the US 5%. Then, an average of around 4%-5% could be reached. Today, some countries are increasing their demand, while others are lowering it. Also, factories in some countries are closing down. When a factory closes, it is sad not only for the families of those that lose their jobs, but it also decreases the demand for energy exports, and that is negative for Iran's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the Iranian petrochemicals sector and how would you assess product quality?<br></h4><p>The quality of petrochemical products in Iran is fully compatible and competitive within national and international standards. Thanks to the quality of our petrochemical products, our international customers have a huge demand for our range of products. In the last six months, the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) successfully managed to meet all the requirements of the REACH Regulation—the qualification test for European standards—and now we have confirmation to export all of our products to the European market. This is proof that the quality of Iranian petrochemical products is very high, and serves as a good reason why there is such a high demand for them. In order to produce these products, we utilize state-of-the-art technology that  improves our output. Iran started producing petrochemical products more than 50 years ago, and over this time we have been able to develop a skilled workforce that is positively affecting our production.</p><h4>The value of petrochemical products is expected to reach $26 billion by 2015. What strategies is NPC following to contribute to achieving this goal?</h4><p>It is expected that petrochemical-based products will replace products made out of wood, aluminum, and metal, as well as those made out of minerals, in many sectors. Petrochemical products may also replace certain construction materials. We are looking at different markets, such as those in Asia. According to our research, the demand in that market is growing, and we have access to it. At the same time, we have experts at NPC that do market analysis, and we are directing our production capacity to be able to supply the demand of our neighboring countries and our national market. As an example, we are currently producing 5.5 million tons of urea per year, of which 2.2 million tons is used locally and the remaining 3.3 million tons is exported. Still, the demand is high, and customers often demand 10 million tons of urea—we cannot meet that level of demand yet. Another example is polypropylene output capacity, which is 600,000 tons per year, and domestic consumption actually exceeds our production capacity. This is the reason we import some products to satisfy our increasing domestic demand.</p><h4>How are NPC and the government assisting foreign investors to enter the petrochemicals industry?</h4><p>Iran possesses the world's largest reserves of oil and gas combined. In terms of feedstock diversity, Iran has the most diversified resources. We have access to natural gas, gas condensates, LNG, and naphtha. Given these resources, the strategy is to implement and avoid selling crude products, and instead create value-added products for export. We believe that creating this value-added will attract investors, both domestic and foreign. In order to attract and facilitate foreign investment, we have to protect investors by guaranteeing the highest profit margins. The benefits we offer are access to long-term feedstock supplies, the availability of cheap and abundant land, and infrastructural facilities located in special economic zones that enjoy advantages such as tax exemptions. The other available advantage is that exports can be made without limitations. The security of investments made through the National Development Fund allows investors to use the financial resources of the banking sector, which grants them the possibility to use the local capital markets. NPC and the government will offer guarantees so that investors gain access to the market. Of course, investors will benefit from a skilled workforce with managerial experience, as well as qualified companies active in the fields of engineering, manufacturing, and implementation. In addition, investors will have access to government-built infrastructure, such as the port in the South Pars Special Economic-Energy Zone. This port, for example, has facilities that allow the export of different kinds of gaseous, liquid, and solid petrochemical products.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the petrochemicals sector?</h4><p>I am very optimistic, and my optimism is based on facts and figures, as well as the 25 years of experience that I have in the petrochemicals sector. Given the potential that Iran has and the plans and efforts that the government is making to create a lucrative investment environment, I believe that Iran's petrochemicals industry will boom. Any investor looking to invest in the coming period will enjoy a fruitful return on his or her investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-expanding-range]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 1Q2012, Iran has been exporting 31% more non-oil commodities in year-on-year terms. What is driving this growth?<br></h4><p>One significant trend that our government and customs officials are following is the expansion of export activity. In our economy, our focus is on international trade. In previous years, foreign investment in Iran depended on producing a commodity that could be re-exported. The result of that investment in Iran is that our range of exports has expanded. In 2011, we exported commodities to more than 150 countries and offered more than 3,000 tariff commodities. This shows that we can offer a variety of goods to many countries—especially in Asia—and participate in a number of activities regarding exports.</p><h4>In which sector do non-oil exports have the most untapped potential?</h4><p>Our country depends on oil and petroleum. Commodities coming from this sector rely on energy products. However, two or three years ago our industrial sector also achieved higher levels of activity. We have observed good trends in car manufacturing, chocolate products, biscuits, other edible goods, and cement. Within two or three years, these industries evolved dramatically, especially in manufacturing and machinery.</p><h4>Are there countries that Iranian exporters are more interested in?</h4><p>We export goods to 150 countries, and not only in Asia. Countries in Asia have been our export partners since the beginning. Our strategic partners and the most popular destinations for Iranian goods include Iraq, China, and Turkey, which are all vital. Every year China and Turkey are first, and our activity with Iraq and Afghanistan is increasing.</p><h4>How can a company or an exporter be eligible for a tax exemption?</h4><p>We give a tax discount for commodities that are produced in Iran and exported. ExIm Bank, which is an export and import bank, is called Toseh Saderat in Iran, and it is the only bank designed to serve this segment. Other banks also offer facilities, but Toseh Saderat is specialized in export and import work. The interest rates of this bank are lower than those of other banking institutions, so in that way it also encourages potential investors and Iranian exporters.</p><h4>In 1Q2012, Iran imported 27% more than in the previous year. Which products and commodities is Iran importing the most?</h4><p>We divide imports into three sections: raw materials, investment commodities, and consumer goods. The breakdown is 70% for raw materials, 18% for investors, and 12% for ready-made consumables. These are the imported commodities that come into our country. Raw materials come to Iran from various countries and are distributed to many industries and factories. In 2011, we imported 5,000 tariff commodities. We cannot say which particular commodities come from which countries, but steel is a very important raw material that we import, especially from China and the UAE.</p><h4>Assuming that your exports and imports are mainly to and from Asian countries, how do you anticipate changes?</h4><p>Everyone in the world tries to link imports and exports, and we also think about both. For 2012, we planned a value of $75 billion for exports, and compared to 2011 it was a 30% increase. Regarding imports, we expect $70 billion, a 10% increase compared to 2011. This marks an impressive increase.</p><h4>How much of the Iranian GDP is represented by imports and exports?</h4><p>Exports and imports comprise 49% of GDP. My forecast for import and export activity is that it will increase in the coming year. Investment is dependent on exports—what we invest in and produce. I also hope that the world is going to increase the volume of international trade. I would like to add that Iran is a member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and we are also focusing on the larger aims of the organization for our program. In 2011, we changed our customs rules and regulations, and we are trying to use IT to reduce the formalities for exports and imports. With some countries, where our trade activity is frequent, we are trying to sign bilateral agreements between customs agencies. We have already signed agreements with more than 45 countries where we plan to export. Through these agreements, we can exchange information and share our facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Iranian pension system? What major reforms has the system been through?<br></h4><p>There are many different types of pension schemes in use around the world. In Iran, we have two different pension systems: one is the defined benefit (DB-PAYG) and the other is the defined contribution scheme. The DB-PAYG system is more common. The Civil Servants Pension Fund (CSPF) was established for civil servants, and also uses the DB-PAYG system. Its resources are provided in different ways, one of which is that every employee contributes 9% of his or her current income to the fund on a monthly basis. In addition, 13.5% of employees' incomes is also contributed to the fund through their employer. Currently, the CSPF has 1.1 million pensioners and 1 million public employees contributing to the fund. Due to the reduced amount of resources we gather from public employees, the system now relies more on government resources. As part of the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), the government has outlined ways to establish a multi-pillar pension system that includes social support and insurance, as well as complementary and supplementary retirement insurance. Implementing this law would mean establishing a multi-pillar system that allows the fund to become independent of government support. Seven years ago, President Ahmadinejad focused his attention on the pension funds. In doing so, the government aimed to fill the significant gaps that exist in the insurance and pension system at that time. Before President Ahmadinejad, paying pensions was the only responsibility of the Civil Servants Pension Fund (SPF) . Since his election, special attention has been paid to welfare-related issues. Furthermore, complementary insurance was revised, as were some health insurance conditions.</p><h4>Western countries are slowly switching to private pension fund models. Where is Iran's system heading?</h4><p>The pension system is headed toward a multi-pillar scheme, with three major categories: social insurance, social support, and complementary and supplementary retirement insurance. We seek to no longer rely on the government budget, and shift our focus toward a funded system. The multi-pillar system is similar to that of Western countries, and the privatization program can be supported by the government through new regulations.</p><h4>How are the fund and its investment companies shaping proactive investment strategies for pensioners?</h4><p>A part of the CSPF's revenues is provided through investments in a variety of economic affairs. Today, more than 31% of the fund's investments is allocated toward the chemical and petrochemical sectors, over 11% is invested in transportation and communications, and 17% is invested in oil and gas companies such as Iranol and Pasargad. There are also a number of tourism companies receiving investment, such as Iran Touring &amp; Tourism Company.</p><div class="quote">“We are preparing to make more investments and focus on creating innovation and bringing international best practices to Iran."</div><p>In addition, we make active investments in road and sea transportation networks. For example, we have invested in the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) company, as well as Aseman Airlines. We make a large effort to create new job opportunities in Iran. In fact, 2012 was designated the year for “National Production: Supporting Iranian Labor &amp; Capital" by our President. The CSPF is actively engaged in this field to fulfill the motto. Currently, we are preparing to make more investments and focus on creating innovation and bringing international best practices to Iran.</p><p>In general, the fund is one of the most successful projects in the country, enhancing activity in a number of economic areas. The revenues from these companies will be invested in the next generation of Iranians.</p><h4>How is the CSPF planning to prevent further public debt?</h4><p>We are launching the new multi-pillar system in Iran to stop relying on the government budget. With this implementation, the fund will decrease governmental support and build a stronger and more self-reliant pension system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have been adopted to support investment in the oil sector in the face of possible price fluctuations?<br></h4><p>Iran's Ministry of Petroleum and its subsidiaries, based on the deals signed with contractors, are doing their utmost to minimize losses inflicted on investors should the costs of project implementation increase. Normally, based on the content of the contracts, investors are bound to accept risks associated with their activities. As far as financing the projects is concerned, if the ministry and its subsidiaries face funding shortages, we would focus on several strategies: implementing projects with acceptable physical progress; developing oil and gas fields shared with neighboring countries; and providing customs, economic, financial, and taxation incentives.</p><h4>How can the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in early July 2012 strategically expand the oil industry's projects?</h4><p>The facilities envisaged in the MoU mainly apply to upstream projects, and more specifically to the shared fields, in order to enhance oil and gas production and encourage competition. Given the National Development Fund of Iran's (NDFI's) mission to finance projects operated by the private sector, contractors, manufacturers, and other private contributors will receive the required funds. Moreover, the development of upstream projects will lay the groundwork for the expansion of refining, gas, and petrochemical units, which would, in turn, expand the oil industry's value chain.</p><h4>Iran sits atop huge untapped hydrocarbon reserves. How does the government support the exploration of new reserves and what main projects are currently underway?</h4><p>More than $4.5 billion is forecast to be invested in the exploration of hydrocarbon reserves through the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) over 2010-2015. To that effect, exploration operations are already planned in Khorramabad, Garmsar, Deyr, Danan, and the Moghan II blocks. Moreover, 16 new onshore and eight offshore blocks are also expected to undergo exploration operations during this period. Articles 125 and 129 of the FYDP require the Ministry of Petroleum to support exploration operations.</p><h4>What do you expect from the development of the Yadavaran oil field?</h4><p>Sinopec is currently developing the Yadavaran oil field, the early production of which is forecast to reach 20,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). After the full implementation of the project, the field will be producing 180,000 bbl/d.</p><h4>How does your ministry facilitate foreign investment in the sector?</h4><p>Given the daily growing use of petrochemical products across the world, the countries facing shortages in feedstock, technology, infrastructure, and experienced manpower are often driven out of the loop due to high production costs. But in Iran, thanks to huge gas, gas condensate, and liquid reserves, the petrochemical industry is thriving and welcomes investment. A simple review of the country's petrochemical production under the third, fourth, and fifth FYDPs indicate that investment in the petrochemical and downstream industries has been growing at an acceptable level. To that effect, the Ministry envisages introducing new opportunities for investment, supplying feedstock to petrochemical plants, contributing to the centralization of the investment permissions procedure, establishing petrochemical towns to serve the petrochemical value chain in a complementary fashion, and preparing the necessary infrastructure for new petrochemical plants.</p><h4>How is the Ministry planning to rebalance domestic supply and demand?</h4><p>The development of refining industries is aimed at halting crude oil sales. To that effect, the Ministry envisages boosting oil product exports. If everything goes as planned, Iran will be exporting 34 million liters of gasoline a year by 2015.</p><h4>What does the Oil Bank of Iran represent and what will its primary functions be?</h4><p>Such a venture, although not yet agreed upon, is envisaged through the contribution of private contractors. However, the Energy Fund has been set up with the contribution of domestic banks to finance oil and gas projects.</p><h4>What are you expecting from Iran's oil and gas industry in 2013?</h4><p>Based on the fifth FYDP, the objectives of the oil industry in 2013 include: increasing the country's crude oil production to 4.831 million bbl/d; raising the country's natural gas production to 973 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d); lifting gas condensate production to 781,000 bbl/d; boosting natural gas exports to 125 mcm/d; upping naphtha and natural gasoline production to 106,000 bbl/d; escalating gasoline and gasoil production to 82 million liters per day (ml/d) and 97 ml/d, respectively; and finalizing decisions about the development of shared oil and gas fields.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, all of the UAE's banks performed well despite the global uncertainty. What are some of the key reasons for this performance?</h4><p>The UAE's economy is continuing to grow and it is a creditor nation. We are exporting more than we are importing. There is capital formation in the country, which is going toward infrastructure development and investment abroad, so the economic backdrop for UAE banks is relatively benign. Having said that, there have been very substantial provisions, particularly for the real estate sector. Those provisions were made during the 2008-2010 period. As we come out of that, the growth of provisions will begin to slow down. The key number to look at in the banking industry is top-line (operating) revenue. Considering top-line revenue, the banking system as a whole is growing at about 7%-10% each year. The bottom line is masked by large provisions, where there are large differences between the banks in terms of the timing, amount, and treatment of those provisions. However, if you concentrate on the top line, you will see that the good banks are growing at around 10%. That is very healthy in the context of the world, where banks earnings are relatively subdued. The challenge these days for banks is to generate top line revenue growth.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the competitiveness of this market?</h4><p>There are more than 50 banks operating in the UAE. It is a very competitive market, and more so than the other Gulf markets. Foreign banks have around one-quarter of the business. If you compare that with other Gulf markets, you will not find those sorts of percentages prevailing. In Saudi Arabia, for example, foreign banks are limited to 40% equity ownership. In the UAE, where the banks are very competitive, consumers benefit from choice and price. I would describe this as a well-developed, competitive market for financial services. Additionally, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is here. Although the DIFC banks technically do not provide services to UAE resident companies, they do provide services to large institutions and corporates, though not in UAE dirhams. This spillover affects the competitive situation in the UAE.</p><div class="quote">“Considering top-line revenue, the banking system in Abu Dhabi is growing at about 7%-10% each year."</div><h4>Do you think the market is becoming over saturated?</h4><p>There is always room for more. I am a great believer in open markets, and if people can find a way to get in and make money, they are welcome. In order to compete, you just need to be more efficient and smarter than the bank next door. If another bank can come in and take a share from the existing ones, that is good for the customer. That is why market economies work. The UAE is well positioned as a base camp for doing business in the region. Many people are coming to the UAE, not to do business in the UAE necessarily, but increasingly to do business from the UAE with the region around it, which can be described as very large. From the UAE, companies can enter countries such as Turkey, Egypt, India, as well as the east coast of Africa and most of Central Asia, making this a good location to set up a regional office. The banking market as defined is very large. As a result, it is important to look at the UAE in two ways. There is the domestic market, which is the biggest banking market in the Middle East, and the markets that banks based in the UAE serve, whether local or foreign. Regarding the latter, many new banks have entered the market and I think many more new banks will come, especially now that Abu Dhabi is setting up its own Global Marketplace. In regard to the domestic market, there are limitations set by the Central Bank as to which banks can enter the market, and much of it is based on reciprocity.</p><h4>The National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) was once again named the region's safest bank in 2012. What is NBAD doing to safeguard against future external shocks?</h4><p>We have not, for example, used our balance sheet to lend money or invest in things that we do not understand. We lend money to customers as a way of winning business from them. As a banker, I am not a great believer in lending as an end in itself. I believe that a bank lends in order to manage a company's pension fund, to do the next bond deal, to win the next advisory mandate, to advise the IPO, to get the opportunity to hedge customer interest, foreign exchange, or commodity price risks. A banker should use lending as a means to earn ancillary income. Therefore, we did not put money into structures that looked good but there was no relationship traction. When investment banks were coming here to sell special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) that seemed to promise fantastic returns with AAA ratings, we did not buy any of them—not because we were smarter than any of the other banks. We didn't do it because we could not see the relationship traction.</p><p>We have also developed a substantial asset management business. Asset management is a very good business to be in because you do not employ capital, but you earn fees from it. We have built a wealth and private banking business in Geneva and the UAE, managing private wealth and earning fees from the management of that wealth. We have built an investment advisory practice. We have advised on one or two major corporate major deals here in the UAE. Again, this is a fee-generative business as opposed to a balance sheet-based business. Our strategy is all about using our balance sheet to earn fees and build competence inside the organization. At the same time, we have been very conscious of liquidity. Banks need to be liquid. In short, by being diversified internationally and by service, earning fees, being liquid, and staying careful about how we use our balance sheet, we work hard to protect our bank from external shocks. We also maintain a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) well ahead of what the local regulator demands. That is another reason why NBAD continues to be rated amongst the 50 safest banks in the world.</p><h4>Do you believe the appetite for high-risk investments in the Middle East has returned to the UAE?</h4><p>I do not see any evidence of that returning to the UAE. We did have an asset bubble in real estate and in the equity market in the 2000s. There is a bit of a new bubble in the real estate market in Dubai, but I don't sense that across the country. Local equity markets have performed well over the past three to six months; however, they have not done what they did before, and values against earnings are generally much more measured. The banks are probably more prudent this time around, because they got burned as well. The regulator is obviously much more sensitive to this and that is why we are seeing preemptive action, such as mortgage caps. The regulator will want to spike any speculative bubble early on to avoid any systemic problems in the banking system.</p><h4>With sukuk sales expected to surpass their 2012 record in 2013, what opportunities and risks are there for growth in this area?</h4><p>There are opportunities for investors, issuers, and arrangers of deals. There are opportunities for issuers to take advantage of the growing pool of Islamic liquidity. Now, there are more opportunities for people who want to invest in sharia-compliant instruments. In the past, it was a narrow choice. I suspect more debt finance will be in the capital markets rather than on bank balance sheets. Basel III points the way. Many of these debt issues will be sharia-compliant to take advantage of Islamic liquidity, and there are opportunities for growth. The risk is that so far in the Gulf, the legal framework is still under development and the market will need clear underpinning to flourish.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>
