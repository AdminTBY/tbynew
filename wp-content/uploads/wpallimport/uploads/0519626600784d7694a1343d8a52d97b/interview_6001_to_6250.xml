		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important projects for CCIPSA in the past year?</h4><p>Our most important project has been the completion of the maritime dock of Salina Cruz in the state of Oaxaca in the southwest. That project received a federal investment of approximately MXN330 million. The dock will provide services for international maritime transport companies and will serve as an important hub for international trade. </p><h4>What is the importance of the Hilton Coatzacoalcos project for CCIPSA and what expectations do you have for future growth of the project?</h4><p>Given the location where we are constructing the hotel, it is significant not only for the regional economy, but also for our firm. This hotel is uniquely positioned near the many petroleum complexes in the Coatzacoalcos area. With this hotel, we intend to become leaders in the market for services to executives and suppliers of the more than 40 companies that process petroleum derivatives in the area. Also, it is worth mentioning that in addition to the hotel, we are constructing a residential subdivision with commercial developments in the area to house long-term workers and executives from petroleum projects. </p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of the energy reforms in terms of the level of international investment they have brought to Mexico's petroleum sector?</h4><p>The issue of the energy reform is not a simple one. It has focused on the divestment of the federal government in the sector and the concession of activities in the petroleum and electric energy sectors to private investors. With the impact of the low petroleum prices at the moment, investors have been cautious. To put it more concretely, the energy reform will see its value in the long term. </p><h4>Of the segments in which CCIPSA is present, which will be the most important source of growth for the company over the coming years?</h4><p>The projects with the most potential for profitability will be major infrastructure projects such as the mass-transport metro system, highways, toll roads, bridges, docks and piers, and industrial parks. In the long term, we are looking to expand with these same types of projects into markets in Central America. </p><h4>What are the most important goals and plans for CCIPSA over the medium term?</h4><p>We aim to conclude our private investments in residential subdivisions, hotels, and the public works projects for which we have been contracted. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Long-Term Vision]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-long-term-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since its incorporation and what role has the company played in the development of infrastructure in Mexico?</h4><p>This year we celebrate our 50th anniversary. Freyssinet was incorporated by a group of foreign engineers arriving in Mexico to help the country build the needed infrastructure. When we first arrived we were here to assist Mexican companies with equipment to build bridges. Over the last half a century, our company has supported local constructors as well as those arriving in the country to build new infrastructure with new technologies patented by us and used worldwide. We help with the construction studies and designs; we help to improve construction systems and we help to implement latest innovations. We believe that all constructors are our partners, rather than our competitors. One of our main achievements has been the investment we have made in training, knowledge, security, applications, and productivity.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges you faced when adapting new technologies to the Mexican market?</h4><p>The main challenge has been to make sure we properly and successfully apply new technologies to our partner's and customer's needs, which is why we always put together a working team in order to make each single project a complete success and better understand the needs of each of our partners and customers. We also faced some challenges when trying to change the working culture of some companies, who valued a cheaper price over quality of the final product. In the end, something that at the beginning seems cheap can turn out to be the most expensive aspect. We always promote the idea that quality is the cheapest option. Over the years, we have become more Mexican and this helped us better understand the particularities of the local market.</p><h4>How has the company been adapting to falling government spending on infrastructure projects?</h4><p>We try to diversify our operations and bring new technologies in other sectors such as anti-seismic activities, oil and gas, etc. We also put greater effort in security after the latest events in Ecuador, as Mexico also has seismically active areas in the country. Finally, we also try to import more technology and know-how from Freyssinet, creating more synergies than we have currently. We also continue to invest in our staff; we currently have over 1,000 employees. </p><h4>What major innovations do you bring to the Mexican market right now?</h4><p>Apart from the anti-seismic technology, we are bringing innovation to the infrastructure repair and maintenance works, an area in which we have also increasingly focused our efforts lately. When a country reaches that stage that no more large transport and road infrastructure is needed, such as in many Western European countries, then you need to invest in maintenance of that infrastructure. Mexico still needs to invest a great deal in infrastructure, but as this industry grows at a fast pace, we want to be one step ahead. Also, because for Mexico it is extremely important to invest in current infrastructure such as sewerage systems, roads, bridges, buildings, cement warehousing, large warehousing infrastructure, and water deposits for example. It is extremely important to make sure Mexicans have a long-term vision when it comes to infrastructure. This is about investing in the future of the country and caring about it. I truly believe this new focus will help us diversify our business activity in Mexico and find new market niches. </p><h4>What is your vision for Freyssinet in the next five years?</h4><p>We would like to see a greater business diversification of the company in Mexico. We need to increase the services we offer as well as more actively reach out to the private sector. We want to further develop our own projects through new PPPs. We have the capability to offer more integrated services to PPPs and we want to do so in the near future. We will invest even more in training our people through the school and bringing in more new technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Trading Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[trading-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Mexican market developed for DB Schenker over its time here?</h4><p>DB Schenker has undergone several different stages in Mexico. We have been in Mexico for almost 40 years, which makes it the country in Latin America with the third-longest history for DB Schenker, only behind Argentina and Brazil. In 2017, we anticipate having around 500 employees in Mexico and a revenue stream of over EUR100 million. The importance of Mexico for the organization is obvious when you consider that other major markets in Latin American are struggling. Our strategy has always been to maintain offices all over the country; we will be in close physical proximity to our customers, which will facilitate building strong relationships. </p><h4>What distinguishes DB Schenker from its competition?</h4><p>Almost 50% of our costs are related to human resources. Our biggest differentiator in this market is our staff. We take care of them, we train them, and we place them in management programs, which translate to a low turnover rate among our customers. Our customers usually work with us for a long time. For example, L'Oréal has worked with us for over 15 years. </p><h4>How has your sectorial focus changed over the past few decades, and what does that say about the Mexican economy?</h4><p>We are involved in almost every vertical market in Mexico, whether it is automotive, consumer goods, aerospace, fashion, or retail. In the past, one of our core businesses was perishable exports, exporting handicrafts, and relocation services. When it comes to industry, Mexico is on the edge of becoming a developed country, because we do business here like they do in the US or Germany.</p><h4>What have been the challenges in expanding the land transport segment?</h4><p>The first challenge is to get the transport management system (TMS), which can interface with different subcontracting carriers. My customer receives a platform where they can see their shipment moving from A to B, even though the carrier can change. That is one of the challenges, and we are working with our colleagues in the US to make a uniform platform for all of our customers. The second challenge is to get the right carriers on board. It is a segmented market, as there are hundreds of carriers that are international, local, and small. Getting a matrix of quality carriers that comply with health and safety, social security, and other laws is not easy. The third challenge is that the margins are rather low in land transport. NAFTA trucking for us represents less than 10% of our revenue, and land transport is mostly focused on trade with the US. What is interesting for us is that 80% of the trade of Mexico is with the US; if only 10% of my business represents the US, and then there is a large gap to be covered. </p><h4>How big is trade with South America and Central America for you? </h4><p>Today, our biggest markets are Europe and Asia. Asia is heavily involved in ocean freight, while Europe dominates consumer goods. On the import side, we have good business with Argentina and Chile for commodities. For example, from Argentina we bring in lemon peel, which is used to make aromas and salts. With Brazil, we work with more industrial goods. On the import side, Latin America would be our third largest market, even stronger than the US.  </p><h4>How do you integrate sustainable practices into your operations?</h4><p>Our holding company DB, has announced a strategy called “DB 2020." The project focuses on three pillars: social responsibility, financial responsibility, and ecological responsibility. It started different programs under ecological responsibility. Corporate customers tend to value sustainability; if you work with  importers of toys from China, however, it is not a high priority. There are other companies, such as SC Johnson, that value that, and even ask us what the CO2 footprint of their transport is. We are working toward developing our practices further. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is it important to have specific aerospace disciplines at the university? </h4><p>This is not always the case. Industrial sectors usually have a talent pool within which the base is mainly technical people who do the manufacturing and assembly of goods and components. This is true of the engines, landing gear, avionics, interiors, and many other components that make up an aircraft. This base of talent usually constitutes around 70% of the workforce. The skills required for this work are similar in the automotive industry, home appliances, and IT hardware sectors, but the aerospace industry is nothing like those other manufacturing sectors. It is, therefore, important to have people who are properly trained in as close as possible to a real-life environment in which they will develop competencies, such as those for the proper working of the aircraft that we usually use. Aerospace transportation services are the safest in the world, and maintaining this is a matter of regulations. Authorities in every country have defined what training conditions are required for people to have the license to perform the maintenance on a component or an aircraft, or to dispatch an aircraft as safe and ready to fly.</p><h4>What is the importance of establishing links with the private sector?</h4><p>Connecting with the private sector is the important activity we need to keep up with. Initially, the companies defined the conditions under which they would come into Mexico and Querétaro State. They wanted land to set up their workshops and manufacturing facilities, and after that they wanted technical, management, and R&amp;D people. The most important issue for us was how we could develop the necessary competencies. The only way we figured out how to develop competencies is through the technical knowledge that the companies have transferred to our trainers. This has allowed us to define and co-design a curriculum and list of competencies for that technical training and our bachelor's degree programs. Furthermore, we have done this based on the number of people the companies need for every position in their plants to set up and run their businesses. This is the main idea behind our strong links with the companies; they train our trainers, and we are then able to understand and fulfill their needs. The other reason is to have a closed cycle whereby our graduates then become eligible for employment with the companies. We view success as having our graduates appropriately employed within these companies, developing their own businesses, or being part of an R&amp;D center working in the sector.</p><h4>Where do you see the Mexican aerospace industry and UNAQ in 2020?</h4><p>We would like to be the key player in identifying what the needs are for companies in the short, medium, and long term, together with the key actors in the sector, such as the Mexican Federation of Aerospace Industries, A.C. (FEMIA). I am the President of the R&amp;D Commission within FEMIA, and we are involved in many other organizations as well. UNAQ is at the heart of the aerospace industry, as we have been able to understand the industry's needs for the past 12 years, resulting in our success in setting up training processes to further develop the industry. UNAQ is a key player for technical training, middle and top-level management, and R&amp;D activities in Mexico. This is because of the relationship we have established and will continue to build over the short, medium, and long term. West Virginia University is 112 years old and its aerospace and mechanical engineering department is ranked 22nd in the US. It looked at Mexico and UNAQ and decided to enter into a joint venture with us to offer a double degree master's program, with one year at each university. We are pursuing a similar program with Cranfield University, which is a private university in the UK. Cranfield is a top institution for developing aerospace industry R&amp;D solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Google's presence in Mexico for its global operations?</h4><p>Mexico is the second largest market in Latin America, both in revenue and number of users. Over half of the population in the country is connected to the internet, and the number is rising each year. Mexico is an emerging market with extraordinary opportunities. We can see this in the SME market, which represents 99.8% of the businesses in the country and plays a key role in the Mexican economy. The entrepreneur community is also an emerging business division that is thriving in the country and represents a new generation and a wave of innovation. Google is both aware and empathetic with Mexico's reality. We continuously create projects for SMEs to grow through digital platforms (like "Conecta tu Negocio" or "Google for Work") and empower startups with technology for them to develop and extend their reach like Google's Partner Space or its Launchpad Accelerator). We believe Mexico will lead a second wave of innovation in Latin America; it has all of what is needed.</p><h4>How much of what you do in Mexico is focused on Latin America as a whole?</h4><p>Google is not a conventional company. Teamwork and collaboration are our main principles. Teams in Google can be composed of members from all parts of the world and create projects that can be replicated globally. The Digital Skills for Vulnerable Populations project, for example, was a series of trainings for women to help them develop digital skills. We started the project in Mexico and began replicating the model in other Latin American countries. This also works the other way around; initiatives that began in Argentina, Brazil, or another country might be replicated here in Mexico, like Launchpad Accelerator. This project aims to foster the development of great ideas into successful high quality and locally relevant apps used by millions around the world by offering a financial investment and mentorship to targeted developers in emerging markets. It started in India, Brazil, and Indonesia and was launched in Mexico this past February. We do not believe in barriers, but in teamwork, creativity, and innovation.</p><h4>How has the company's presence transformed over your 11 years here?</h4><p>We have gone a long way in the past 10 years. A great example is the new six-story building we opened in 2015, which increases business opportunities and allows us to expand and give our users and clients better services and products. We are a user-driven company. We are focused on giving users relevant and useful information at the right moment. This means that we have to develop technology that fits users' needs and priorities, which is why we are a mobile-first business. We are proud to say that we are part of Mexicans' daily life, from the search engine that receives all kinds of queries every second, to Google's Public Alerts that helped when Hurricane Patricia was threatening to hit the Mexican shores. We also help businesses of all sizes grow through digital platforms, like FAMSA, a traditional Mexican company that created an innovative campaign in YouTube to engage users and get closer to their consumers. We have to stay relevant and strike for those moments when users need us.</p><h4>How does Google support SMEs in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is going through a digital transformation. We work each day to bring businesses closer to the potential of the web, especially SMEs. We have many initiatives to support small and medium companies in the country, to help them grow and simplify their processes through digital platforms.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important new developments for Ford over the past two years?</h4><p>We have had an interesting few years. We made a great deal of progress on the industrial front; in that period we had three investments for Mexico approved and they are currently being implemented. That means three new plants, two component plants, and one engine plant in Chihuahua, where we have been producing engines for 25 years. We have a transmission plant in Hermosillo beside the transmission plant of our partner in a joint venture with Getrag. At the end of 2017, it will start producing pilots and full production will begin around mid-2018. We also will build an assembly plant for vehicles at San Luis Potosi, which was announced in early 2016. It is in a state where we have never operated before as a manufacturer, although we have commercial presence. We are completing arrangements for the land with the industrial park and the government. Construction will commence in 2016 and the plant is expected to be up and running by mid-2018. </p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of Mexico to Ford's global operations?</h4><p>Mexico is extremely important because it complements our production capacity, primarily for North America as well as for other regions. That is the case for component parts; both engines and transmissions will be exported to North America, South America, Asia, and Europe to the assembly plants that we have in those regions. For the assembly plant, the primary market will be North America, though we also export to South America and Europe. We are producing up to around 350,000 units, which is the stored capacity. When the new plant is up and running we will produce around 750,000 units per year in Mexico as well as about 1 million engines and around half a million transmissions per year. This is a large figure for company that produces around 7 million units in total globally.</p><h4>What role has Ford played in developing Mexico's role as a leader in the automotive sector globally?</h4><p>We were one of the first manufacturers to come to Mexico in 1925. Then, we were the first to locate manufacturing plants south of the border to export to the US, which was when Hermosillo and Chihuahua started around 30 years ago. We were the first to see the opportunity of producing on this side of the border for export to the US and to establish a large manufacturing presence here. Then pretty much everyone followed. At the end of the day, we were the first to see the opportunity to establish a large manufacturing presence in Mexico and then to establish the relevant suppliers to make sure we not only use Mexican labor to produce our vehicles, but also benefit from material manufactured locally by local suppliers or by global suppliers established in Mexico. We maximize the benefit of producing in the country and Mexico benefits the most from the manufacturing presence of Ford, at the end of the day producing more jobs in the domestic market. That is why we are expanding that presence by building the three new manufacturing facilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did DuPont decide to split off its chemical businesses into Chemours?</h4><p>DuPont had always been recognized and was born out of developing chemical applications and chemical products for several industries. That has been the story for just over 200 years; however, as the world continues to evolve, the CEO and management of DuPont decided that the future of the company was more in nutrition, food, and biotechnology, but at the same time the chemical segment still represented a major part of the company turnover and growth. Therefore, the strategic decision was to separate the company into two. Chemours was created as a spin-off of all the chemical businesses. Today, DuPont does not have any shares or own any stock in the Chemours Company, and vice versa. They are totally separate and independent companies.</p><h4>What business areas does Chemours now have?</h4><p>We have 8,000 employees and a $6.5 billion annual turnover. Chemours' businesses were organized into three business units. One is the Titanium Technologies business unit, where we manufacture mainly a white pigment called titanium dioxide, used mostly in the coatings industry. It grows as the middle class and GDP grows, because infrastructure needs to grow and that means more roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and houses, and all of that drives the consumption of TiO2. We are the global leader in the TiO2 industry with the largest producer and the highest market share. We have the largest TiO2 manufacturing plant worldwide located in Altamira, Tamaulipas, where we are finalizing an investment of over $600 million. The second business unit is the Fluoroproducts business, where we have a number of applications; we are also a number-one global maker of Fluoroproduct. Recently, we announced an invest of $230 million over three years to construct a new facility at the Chemours Corpus Christi site in Ingleside, Texas, with start-up expected in the third quarter of 2018. The third area of business is the Chemical Solutions business, where we have six smaller business units. The market for these products was not growing; therefore, we are reviewing our strategic approach in this business and will probably divest some of these operations and concentrate on areas where we see growth. </p><h4>What is the significance of Mexico for Chemours globally?</h4><p>Mexico is a key country for Chemours. Currently, we are finishing a $600 million investment in a TiO2 plant in Mexico. This project began three years ago and construction was completed in December 2015. We target commercial production by April and now export from Mexico to Europe, South America, the US, and the rest of the world. We produce around 150,000 tons of titanium oxide, and the new line will more than double our capacity. From being one of the lowest performing manufacturing sites within our segment, we have grown to be the best performing plants, around safety, quality, consistency, and costs. The first investment that Chemours is making outside the US is also in Mexico. With all of the integration that is growing every year between North America and Mexico, it makes this plant a strategic location for us. </p><h4>Given your work with many potentially hazardous chemicals, how are environmental concerns integrated into your operations?</h4><p>Safety obsession and unshakable integrity are two of our core values. If we step back a little bit, chemistry touches our lives in many ways, and it will not go away. It would be difficult to maintain the quality of life that we have without chemistry and chemical products. What is important here and what we have identified and recognized for many years now is that chemistry serves society, chemistry serves quality of life, and it can be well used if we do it safely and in a responsible way. This is at the core of our DNA. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What first attracted Famosa Group to Mexico in 2010?</h4><p>The company was founded in Spain in 1957, and Fábricas Agrupadas de Muñecas de Onil, S.A. (FAMOSA) was born from the alliance of a number of toymakers in Toy Valley, Alicante. More than 50 years later, we remain Spain's premiere toy manufacturer, leading the industry in Spain and Portugal and firmly establishing ourselves in more than 50 countries, including France, Italy, Mexico, and the US. In Mexico, we had solid numbers with our distributors but importing bulky products from Spain was expensive due to transportation costs and considering that the potential business in the US and Mexico was huge, we decided to open a factory in Monterrey. We saw this not only as a base to expand in Mexico, but as a way to reach the US market. </p><h4>How much of your production in Mexico is for export?</h4><p>About 30% of the volume manufactured in Mexico is  currently exported. The problem that we have been facing is that we do not have enough capacity, which is a good problem to have. The factory has more than doubled in volume over the last two years. We are evaluating other possibilities for investments or partnerships that can help us meet the needs of the Mexican and North American markets. </p><h4>Has the rise in computer games and new devices for kids changed your approach to product development?</h4><p>The time kids spend playing is now shared with TV and computer games, so this is changing the way the toy industry moves, as more products now have to be made around other forms of entertainment. That is why at Famosa we are developing a new TV series, “PINY" and “Mutant Busters," which will be  launched in 2016 accompanied by apps that kids can play after watching  the series. There will also be licensed products such as clothes, bedding, school supplies, and of course a complete toy line. Famosa will continue creating products that foster children's imagination. </p><h4>What is the importance of your facility for Nuevo León?</h4><p>We have more than 120 employees there. We are located in Parque Industrial Kalos in Apodaca, where we have been working closely with the community. We try to ensure that most of our employees live around the area and we work constantly with the authorities to ensure they know we are investing and creating jobs in the region. Apodaca was ranked the happiest city in Mexico last year, and we believe that Famosa had a part to play in it. </p><h4>Has the government been supportive in terms of setting up your operation there?</h4><p>Since we opened the factory, we have been growing without any issues. Our decision was to create more jobs in an easy way where we can react faster, because in this industry you have to take the momentum and for that we need to react quickly. Flexibility has been one of the strengths for setting up the business here. The industry in Mexico is developed and the country has the talent to manufacture what we need</p><h4>What are your goals for the near future as International General Manager?</h4><p>My objective for the next two to three years is to develop our subsidiaries and grow in new markets. Our expansion plans are going in the right direction. The idea is to develop products, keeping in mind that they must have an international appeal. We must be able to launch products that can be equally successful, in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, or Spain. We need a truly international marketing team that fully understands and gathers feedback from all the countries in which we are present. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In The Right Direction]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[in-the-right-direction]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mazda increased its sales by 40% in 2015. How did you achieve that?</h4><p>The first reason is the products we are offering. At the beginning of 2015, we introduced the Mazda6 and the Mazda CX-5, and that helped us increase our pull in those segments. In March, we introduced the completely new Mazda2, which is produced at Mazda's new assembly plant in Salamanca. With the previous generation we sold 150 units of the Mazda2, and with the new generation we sell around 600 units per month. In September, we introduced a new MX-5, the Roadster. With the old generation, we sold around 15 cars per month and with the new generation we are selling around 100. In December, we also launched the new CX-3, which is a small SUV that generated an increase in volume. The increase is firstly because of the introduction of new models and the second factor is that brand positioning in the country is aspirational, and customers love and want to buy a Mazda because of the design and the technology that we have. In 2015, our repurchase ratio was 47%, which is high. We are the third non-premium brand with the highest repurchase rate in the country. That is thanks to the quality of the service that we give our customers, as well as the car and many other things that we provide. </p><h4>What is the significance of Mexico to Mazda globally?</h4><p>We follow the Japanese fiscal year from April to March. In the 2015/2016 fiscal year ending in March, we hope to be in sixth place in Mazda globally. At this time one year ago, we were in eighth place. Our Japanese bosses pay a great deal of attention to our operations here, because Mexico now has much more relevance in Mazda's global operations, and we, of course, also have the Salamanca assembly plant, which is important for the company.</p><h4>Did you reach last year's target of producing 230,000 units at the Salamanca plant?</h4><p>Our final production total from 2015 met our target. Capacity at the plant is 250,000 units, and this fiscal year we will reach 230,000 units. We are taking care with the quality of the product because it is the most important part of the business, which means producing good quality cars that will help us in the long term. Mazda cars are well received in markets around the world, including Central and South America, the US, Canada, and, of course, the domestic market in Mexico. </p><h4>What is the role that Mazda plays in the community in Salamanca?</h4><p>The Salamanca plant currently employs 5,200 people. Experts say that for every employee there are three or four indirect employees; therefore, our real impact on employment is more than 20,000 people. The best way to measure this is to look back about five years ago before the Salamanca plant when there was nothing there. Today, the city is full of hotels, restaurants, schools, and hospitals; the community has been developing with the plant. </p><h4>Mexico is currently experiencing an air pollution issue. What role do you see the automotive industry playing in dealing with that problem?</h4><p>That is an important question. In 2013 and 2014, Mexico established a new rule on reaching certain standards of emissions to reduce pollution and all manufacturers are now working toward this goal. In 2013, Mazda introduced the new SKYACTIV technology, which has had a positive effect on reducing emissions. The engines that we offer in Mazda cars today are efficient in cutting pollution and have greater fuel efficiency. In Mexico, we have an old stock of cars that are six or seven years old and emit pollution. The aging infrastructure, such as public buses, also contributes to the pollution problem, and that is the issue today, not the new cars that are being produced. The industry is working with new technologies, but the problem is with the older stock of vehicles in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mexico for Shell following the country's reforms to its oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Before the reforms, Mexico was not a part of our global portfolio in terms of hydrocarbons E&amp;P because the law did not allow it. Now that the law has changed, Mexico is definitely part of that mix. When Shell looks for opportunities to invest across the globe, Mexico will now be one of those opportunities. Shell has been present in Mexico for 62 years even though exploration and commercialization of oil was not permitted for private companies in the past. We have specifically allocated work teams for Mexico, and we firmly believe in the country; however, we still assess all markets we work in before placing any investment at all. Mexico is important for Shell, which is why we are here and have been for so long. In the end, projects have to make sense. It is difficult to say where Shell will be in Mexico in the short term before we know the actual opportunities and put in a bid; however, we are here for the long run. This is just one bid round of many to come.  </p><h4>What factors does Shell consider when assessing whether Mexico is a competitive place to do business?</h4><p>There are several factors that we examine. The first has to do with the reality, which means knowing what lies in the subsoil and evaluating the opportunities. Mexico has been a closed market for oil companies for many years; we still have to learn much and evaluate what is in its subsoil. Another factor is that terms and conditions ultimately need to be competitive—they have to be in accordance with global regulations and ensure an even playing field. The country needs to allow all companies to come here and participate transparently, which so far has been happening. All this has to match up with the funds we are able to invest here given the market conditions.</p><h4>Has the fall in the price of oil changed the attractiveness of Mexico for Shell?</h4><p>We evaluate all our projects for the long term. The fall in oil prices has a short-term impact in the sense of significantly reducing revenues. We do believe the long-term projects in deep water in Mexico and elsewhere make sense. However, there is an impact in the short term because we have less revenue to finance such long and expensive projects. This industry is highly cyclical, and the current downturn is nothing new to us. However, we have learned to take something positive out of it. It is an opportunity for us to reduce costs and spend wisely. </p><h4>Shell is the second largest player in the world in the energy sector. What role can Shell play in building more capacity in Mexico? </h4><p>It goes through stages. Local content is something we feel strongly about, and in Mexico, we have had a huge interest in local content even before the reforms were approved. We decided Mexico was competitive enough to participate in our projects globally, and we opened a strategic sourcing office here. Mexico already has significant advantages because of the quality and competitiveness of its workforce and its proximity to the US market. We expect to attract some of our partners abroad to come and establish themselves in Mexico, expanding the supply chain here and gradually progressing into more manufacturing and technological activities with great added value. </p><h4>Where do you think Shell Mexico will be in 10 years?</h4><p>My personal goal is to make Mexico a kind of heartland for Shell. I would like us to be successful and partner with the country and make sure we establish a long-term relationship here. Also, we want to help Mexico develop and deliver its own energy needs. We would like to be a force for good. We want to create well-paid jobs, increase the supply of oil in the country, and help Mexico develop further. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Petrogas' current role in the market?</h4><p>Petrogas is now a full service provider of design, construction, compliance consulting, environmental services, equipment sales, and electric and fuel technical services to meet any client need. Recently, we began expanding our business in the US, starting in Texas. Currently, our company specializes in equipment for service stations, image and building design, construction of fuel terminals and gas stations, POS and payment management systems, preventive and corrective maintenance, oils, and derivatives. We have learned over the years how to become better, growing our business from Monterrey to a national-level presence. </p><h4>What is the average profile of Petrogas' customers?</h4><p>We have a wide variety of customers, from large corporations with a network of over 300 gas stations to companies with just one or two stations. At the moment, we have a 65% market share in terms of providing these services to the retail gas industry. We were able to reach this point of consolidation thanks to the trust our customers have in us and our trustworthiness. Our current customers include independent gas stations, gas distributors, major oil companies, convenience stores, supermarkets, local governments, general contractors, and commercial end users.</p><h4>What has helped Petrogas expand so successfully over the past 25 years?</h4><p>One of our main advantages is that we know the market well, which helped us benefit from regulatory changes implemented by the Mexican government in the sector to increase safety standards. Changes in the safety framework and an increasing level of safety-consciousness in the sector drove the modernization of the industry and many players invested in new equipment. One of the main things we brought is innovation and business strategies; we introduced a certain change in the way the industry operates, making a commitment to the future of our customers. This meant a great deal of investment at the beginning in order to have the inventory needed to reach the national market with full capacity to serve it. In the early 2000s, we held the leading position in the industry at the Latin American level as well. Currently, we are the number one distributor at the global level for certain companies. The other element is that we are close to our customers and they value this greatly; we offer personalized services with high levels of proximity and transparency—something other players in the market lack. My clients know how to reach me directly at any time. Our success is built on trust and reliability. </p><h4>In which foreign markets are you active?</h4><p>We work in the US as well as other Latin American countries. We do the same type of business activities everywhere. In the US, we cover the area around Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Because of high competition in the US, many Mexican companies have faced some challenges. However, through strong effort and dedication we have been able to succeed in the US market. At the moment, we sell a lot of fuel tanks in both Mexico and the US, where companies value our delivery schedules and terms; on average it takes approximately eight to 10 weeks for most companies to deliver fuel tanks in the US. For us, it takes between eight and 10 days.</p><h4>What is your vision for Petrogas for the future?</h4><p>Our goal is to open more offices and locations in the US—Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. There are plenty of opportunities in the US. Due to our competitive advantages, we have a privileged position there. We are a disciplined company and will continue to further consolidate the strength of our operations everywhere. We will continue to expand our activities in the Mexican market as foreign companies demonstrate more interest in this market, especially midstream and downstream fuel companies. Finally, we have diversified our portfolio over the years and it is important to continue those efforts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors explain the growth of your domestic client base in Mexico?</h4><p>This growth is driven by a combination of factors. Some companies did not have a presence in Mexico; they were fulfilling their markets elsewhere, and we filled the gaps in their supply chain. In the past, most of what we produced was exported, but increasingly, we have been working with our clients in the local market and it has been a success. We developed the market, designed the product bearing in mind the specifications for the Mexican market, and we produced a Mexican product. Previously, there were customers that did not have a presence here with Mexican companies fulfilling some needs in the market. But, Sanmina was able to develop innovative supply chain solutions here in order to consolidate our position in the market.</p><h4>How has the Mexican market changed and in what ways has Sanmina contributed to it?</h4><p>During the past few years, many companies have adopted a regional manufacturing strategy. The Americas represent a huge market for large, multinational companies. Mexico is an excellent manufacturing location for products, enabling quick and efficient shipment to markets in the Americas. Determining the right manufacturing location depends on many factors, including the region where the product will be sold, logistics, and total landed cost. For example, for heavy and complex industrial or medical systems, Mexico is often a better choice for markets in the Americas. If built offshore, ocean freight might add another three weeks to the supply chain and increase inventory size and capital costs. Another important factor is maturity of the product design. Some of our customers prefer working with Sanmina in a similar time zone during the launch phase for complex products in order to decrease their overall time to market. For complex products in new product introduction (NPI), you may process 10 or more product changes per week. If prototypes or early production units are being shipped across the ocean, a significant number of ECOs may be processed before these units arrive in the Americas.</p><h4>What motivates Sanmina to invest in Mexico and what investment plans do you have for the coming years?</h4><p>Mexico is growing increasingly relevant to the market. As a country we have major opportunities for growth because Mexico sells products to the NAFTA market in an efficient and cost-effective way. We build unique solutions for specific customers within 24 hours. That it is a value proposition we offer to customers from our plants in Mexico, which plants in Asia and Europe cannot offer. Distance and logistics play a crucial role in our business today; it has been fueling our growth for the last few years, and it will continue to do so. Sanmina invests heavily in our Mexico facilities, and our factories have state-of-the-art surface mount and manufacturing automation equipment.</p><h4>What is the importance of Sanmina for Guadalajara in particular, and Jalisco in general?</h4><p>We are one of the largest companies in Jalisco, employing around 12,000 people in the state, plus an additional 4,000 throughout the rest of the country. We have created a cluster around the company, so that it is not only the 16,000 people who are directly employed in Mexico by Sanmina—we influence three or four times that number through indirect employment. We are also proud of the ways we help build our community with many programs related to social responsibility. One example is Sanmina offering jobs and a bright professional future to disabled people in our country. We also support different non-profit associations through activities such as Sanmina soccer, golf, and basketball tournaments. Sanmina works closely with different organizations to support education in Mexico and provide a better future for our kids. During 2015, we worked with 28 non-profit organizations in order to improve our community. Sanmina is committed to this region, and we want to help promote a stronger community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Geo Procesos founded?</h4><p>Geo Procesos officially started doing cartography for the federal government in 1997. In 2013, the company moved from exploration services to extraction services, as the government started to carry out its own exploration, and the number of contracts given to private companies was substantially reduced.</p><h4>How would you characterize the extent to which Mexico has developed its mining resources?</h4><p>Mexico has an enormous amount of resources, yet only about 30% of them have been explored and exploited up until now. Many factors have contributed to this shortage in the resources taken, such as the increase in environmental friendly policies, stricter laws in the exploration of mines, and so on. Mining is still significant in the Mexican economy, but it lags behind other local sectors as well as its role compared to what it represents in other Latin American countries. </p><h4>How have the recent amendments to the mining tax regime affected the sector?</h4><p>It has profoundly impacted us due to the tax applied to mining companies, which is comparatively higher than taxes applied to our peers in other emerging countries. This tax is necessary, but setting it up at 4% rather than 7.5% would be beneficial for both parties, mainly because it reduces employment and it has been applied during a time when the prices of commodities are low, affecting the market even more. Being a large multinational with high-tech devices pushes us to compete at a disadvantage compared to other mining companies, and this tax only widens that gap.</p><h4>Would you say this tax is the biggest challenge that you currently face?</h4><p>The 7.5% tax is the biggest challenge, and I would reduce that to 4%. The other challenge is security; we need to improve the rule of law in many parts of Mexico to propel economic benefits. A third obstacle is the mismatch between the mining and ecological laws; they need to be harmonized without one negatively affecting the other. </p><h4>What distinguishes Geo Procesos from its competition?</h4><p>We have a deep knowledge of the sector; we comply with the regulations in terms of both legislation and social responsibility and we also know the country extensively. When someone wants to invest here, we know how to provide them with what they need. We are a safe bet in terms of mining investments and services. </p><h4>In what direction do you see the growth of Geo Procesos in the upcoming years?</h4><p>We are exploring the field of clean energies in deserted regions in Mexico and we plan to stick to those projects and follow the resulting developments. The current situation for mining services is not especially positive, as growth is not coming in big numbers, but at least it has been stable and will remain so in the following years. There are also great investments in wind power fields going on at the moment and we are going to keep an eye on those projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Going Further]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[going-further]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you found IDAMEX, and how has the company grown since then?</h4><p>I began working in an aluminum industry in Mexico City, where I also had the opportunity to study engineering through a scholarship granted by my employer at the time. I was later selected to work for an aluminum company in Guadalajara that required a specialist in the area of expertise I developed over the previous year. After 12 years of working for that company, I decided to start my own business, which I have operated successfully for more than 36 years  now. Our business has since grown by 15 times that of our original operation, mostly because of the highly developed level of technology that we integrate, which matches that of industrial competitors in countries such as the US, Canada, or Italy.</p><h4>What are your biggest markets in today?</h4><p>Mexico is our largest market, with 60% of our production remaining in the country. We also export to Central and South America and the US, where we are planning to set up an office to drive growth in North America through our in-field expertise. One of the advantages that we offer is that we manage the whole production chain from beginning-to-end with a certification of Quality Assurance ISO9012015 that provides confidence to all our customers. We always try to acquire the most advanced machinery, replacing existing capital assets when they become outdated or obsolete. We have traveled to Germany, Turkey, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, the US, and China to inspect equipment, steel, and technology by some of the world's best companies before purchasing new components. </p><h4>How would you characterize Guadalajara as a region for doing business?</h4><p>We are privileged in Guadalajara as we are between Mexico City and the north of the country. We find it easy to reach international providers and clients. We recently purchased 360 tons of steel from Turkey, and we are about to receive new machinery from Germany. Our international supply chain is much easier to manage operating in Guadalajara compared to other parts of the country. Foreign companies have realized how serious we are when it comes to doing business and we receive plenty of cooperation in our efforts to grow.</p><h4>How would you characterize the availability of qualified technicians and engineers?</h4><p>We have highly qualified engineers whom we have trained in order to adapt them to our machinery. However, we have had difficulty expanding our technical labor force, as there is a shortage of specialized workers. We currently have around 220 employees here in our Guadalajara plant and 50 more in our other production center. Our human capital is fundamental to the sustainability of IDAMEX.</p><h4>Do you think that Mexico's international trade agreements are beneficial for your exports?</h4><p>The international trade agreements that Mexico has signed are indeed beneficial. Even though we have found some markets difficult to penetrate, such as Brazil, the provisions of these trade agreements have enabled us to open up a path to other markets, such as the US, Argentina, and Colombia. Even though one of our main competitors from Canada recently invested in Colombia and Colombian companies can now purchase their products locally, it still opts to get its components from us, as it trusts the reliable quality of our products.</p><h4>What are your top priorities for the growth of IDAMEX in the future?</h4><p>Our immediate goals involved setting up branches in other countries, as we can track the high level of acceptance we have enjoyed in those markets where we have launched local operations. We are planning to set up a plant in Tijuana to facilitate moving our products more easily to the US, as American companies have stringent expectations regarding supply-chain efficiency all the way to the foot of their doorstep. By continuing along this trajectory, it is our main goal to become the undisputed leader in our sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The percentage of Mexican states without a company listed on the stock exchange is currently 69%. What can be done to change this?</h4><p>Many companies around the country are not willing to participate in the Mexican stock exchange and go public. Many businesses are family businesses, and they may want to keep things in the family for security or cultural reasons or to simply maintain tradition. If Mexico is to keep growing, however, companies will need financing in order to expand and grow. Our task is to help bring these companies into the stock exchange, both the old and new ones. It is not just about being listed in equities, but also about the debt market. We are collaborating with the Mexican Association of Securities Intermediaries (AMIB) to visit every state in Mexico to speak with companies and convince them of the benefits of listing and participating in the stock exchange, not just in terms of equities but also in terms of debt. We want to show them how easy and beneficial the process is. The BMV is not as big as other stock exchanges around the world; our total value in terms of equities is only 40% of the Mexican GDP. We are preparing to launch a new instrument named FIBRA E that is expected to help increase the size and value of the BMV, and it is designed to attract companies from the energy sector in particular.</p><h4>How important are SMEs for the economic development of the country and how can BMV assist them?</h4><p>Small businesses account for 95% of employment in Mexico, making it the most important sector in terms of employment and possibly GDP. Historically, the use of banking and other financing sources in Mexico have been low compared to other countries. But that has been changing over the past five years, as such kinds of finance have gone up from 22% to 28%, which is mainly due to banks lending more to small companies. Low interest rates have also helped recently. Banking finance is expected to continue growing, mainly based on credit to small businesses, and we want this positive development to also translate into the stock market, both in terms of debt and equity. The aim is to provide companies with liquidity, and we need to find ways to make this more available to a greater portion of companies.</p><h4>How has the integration of Mexico into MILA evolved and what is its significance for BMV? </h4><p>Integration has been slow, because we have to convince investors in those countries to buy shares of a Mexican company, and also educate them as to what MILA is. This is why we are putting a strong emphasis on publicity, because investors need to understand and become acquainted with investment opportunities in countries other than their own. We are also promoting MILA worldwide; we visited Frankfurt and London recently to promote the union. MILA has a bright future considering the size of the economies involved and the large market the four create once united. Mexico is the second largest market in Latin America after Brazil, and by working together with Chile, Colombia, and Peru, it is a huge market on a global scale. We are also integrated with those countries in the Pacific Alliance. If we are to realize the potential that MILA and the Pacific Alliance offer, however, we need to ensure that all of these countries' stock markets have growth potential in order to be able to finance the companies operating in them. In these countries, there are many truly multinational Latin American companies, operating in a region with similar historical, cultural, social, and political environments. These types of alliances and initiatives can help deepen that integration and facilitate business further across borders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Will the fall in petroleum prices make Mexico's energy reform less effective in promoting economic growth?</h4><p>Mexico's energy reform established a whole new legal and institutional framework, setting the basis for the development of open and competitive markets throughout the energy sector. In the hydrocarbons sector, companies can participate in upstream activities through competitive bidding rounds or in partnerships with Pemex (farm-outs). Current oil prices restrict the investment capacity of all companies in the industry; however, it is important to acknowledge that E&amp;P projects are evaluated based on wider time frames in which current oil prices are not as fundamental. Additionally, a company's long-term profitability depends on its capacity to add new reserves and maintain its exploratory activity to sustain their business. Mexico has a wide range of oil resources, and the energy reform was carefully designed to improve exploitation. In general, the proceedings of hydrocarbon biddings have distinguished themselves worldwide as being public, transparent, and open to national and international participation, all being streamed live. Clarity in these rules and the new institutional framework have created interest in foreign and Mexican private oil companies, which in return has generated 24 awarded contracts. We are starting to observe the creation of a new ecosystem of companies that have placed their trust in our country, and we expect many more will come.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance and potential of electricity co-generation for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>Co-generation, a procedure to obtain both electric and thermal energy, contributes to saving fuel consumption and increasing economic efficiency of production processes. Additionally, it plays an important role in Mexico's transition to a cleaner and more sustainable economy. The energy reform encourages the development of efficient co-generation projects through incorporating these technologies into the wholesale electricity market, where generators can compete to sell power at lower costs. Efficient co-generation producers can obtain clean energy certificates, which are financial instruments to promote clean power. Through these financial instruments, Mexico will increase the use of clean energy to reach the national goal of clean generation.</p><h4>What is the significance of International Energy Agency (IEA) membership for Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico's energy reform has brought to date the legal framework to adopt best international practices as well as the shared goals that the IEA drives. In November 2015, Mexico formally applied for full membership to this autonomous organization. For our country, it is highly relevant to have a voice in this forum where major economies participate and outstanding collective actions on energy are decided. As a member of the IEA, Mexico would have access to key information systems for decision making in energy security and sustainability. The IEA is going through a transition process that underlies proactive attitudes and has assumed the leadership in global issues such as energy security, data and statistics, energy policies, transparency of markets, energy efficiency, technology, and renewable resources. Those are the subjects in which Mexico would like to contribute within the IEA.</p><h4>What are your key plans and goals for the coming three years?</h4><p>In the next three years, we expect to build a more diversified industrial energy system. Our aim is that hydrocarbon and electric enterprises—either state owned or privately owned—may compete in order to offer competitive prices, higher quality, and reliability in the supply of energy. We will also increase and update the fuel storage and transportation infrastructure, and we expect to install additional power generation capacity as well as build new transmission and distribution grids. The current strategy for power generation is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and boost the transition to clean energy. By 2019, we will have expanded the natural gas pipelines to 84%, which will allow us to gradually substitute pollutant fuels. Our goal for 2018 is that 25% of power generation will be obtained via cleaner energies. To reach this goal, we are encouraging new private investments, mainly through long-term electricity auctions and clean energy certificates. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-humble-beginnings]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has UNIFIN grown over the past two decades?</h4><p>UNIFIN was established in 1993, prior to the Tequila Crisis. The crisis of 1994-95 affected the country's people and the companies, and UNIFIN was no exception. This period, nevertheless, allowed Mexico to build a future that would set in motion important changes. It was then that UNIFIN entered its second evolutionary stage; we institutionalized the company and provided it with formality to propel its success. We entered the stock market in 2002, issuing bonds for MXN20 million. In 2006, we created the securities based on our lease contracts—the first time leases had been securitized in Mexico. Today we have issued a total of MXN30 billion in bonds, which represents a growth of 1,500%. We have three main products: leasing, which is our core product and accounts for 80% of our business, factoring, and automotive credit. In 2015, we were voted as the best place to work in Mexico, as a socially responsible company and as the largest leasing company in Latin America. </p><h4>To what do you attribute the remarkable growth of UNIFIN?</h4><p>To achieve a strong level of growth in this business, there are a series of necessary factors  that must be taken into account, such as capital, financial flexibility, a capable technological and human resource structure, and most importantly, a high level of risk analysis and portfolio management. UNIFIN has all of these factors. Mexico has a low level of banking penetration compared to its Latin American peers and this also contributes to our success, because there are still big spaces to fill. Our business model allows us to move MXN2 billion monthly, by far the largest such figure amongst leasing companies in Mexico.</p><h4>Has UNIFIN's growth contributed more generally to the growth of Sociedades Financieras de Objeto Múltiple (SOFOMs) in Mexico's financial system?</h4><p>We were one of the first SOFOMs when the system was created in 2006. This system has strengthened the country's economy and plays a strategic role in the financial system today that is distinct from that of traditional entities such as banks or brokerage houses. We have focused instead on SMEs, providing them with capital and pushing them to grow. This is particularly important, given that SMEs represent a significant part of the Mexican economy. In May 2015, UNIFIN was publicly traded, and people across North America, South America, and Europe all became familiar with us. Six out of the world's 10 major institutional investors hold UNIFIN shares.</p><h4>What makes the Mexican financial sector attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>At the macroeconomic level, the banking sector in Mexico is perfectly capitalized and its non-performing loan portfolio is low. Foreign investors come to us because we know the market and we guarantee profits for our clients, we know how Mexico works, and we contribute to the country's financial strengths through our good practices. Mexico has a diversified economy, a large manufacturing sector, and a vast export base that incentivizes investors to establish a presence here. This country faces significant challenges, yet it also offers comparative advantages that render it attractive for people abroad.</p><h4>Do you think the challenges that Mexico faces will dissuade investors from coming to the country?</h4><p>There are many types of foreign investors and they all see the country's challenges differently, according to their specific needs. Those who come with noteworthy investments aim to stay here for a long time and they are less perturbed by the current situations in Mexico. The country is indeed interesting, and we have important problems to solve, yet investors see beyond that. </p><h4>What are your plans for the future of UNIFIN?</h4><p>We want to keep growing in Mexico. We have 11 offices in the national territory and our goal is to reach 20 in the next two years. We have strong growth targets and we are confident in our future success because we leverage our experience and know-how. We will maintain our business line and our future lies there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What could be done differently in this sector?</h4><p>Antonio Nacif Kuri We are finance savvy entrepreneurs. We look at acquisitions as a whole and try to understand the company to its core. Being entrepreneurs, we have a different approach to finance; we are into solid business and good management. We focus on companies that can generate free cash flow with low debt, even if the stock is not as significant or well known. We make private acquisitions, which give us an edge over finance people. </p><h4>What is the main profile of investors in the fund?</h4><p>ANK Our clients mostly represent private money. We currently have access to university endowment funds in the US that are interested, and we are far along with some of those processes. However, most of our investors are Mexican. Capital markets in Mexico are still underdeveloped, meaning there is a lot of surplus of money and people want to receive more than the 4-5% returns that they can get putting their money in the bank. </p><h4>Is there a disconnect between investors and companies in Mexico?</h4><p>ANK There is a difference between finance in Latin America and in the US. People are more cautious with regard to debt in Latin America because we are used to devaluations and recessions. In the US, investors are happy if they get 5-6% returns on their money, which is considered a safe bet. However, in Latin America you need to have higher returns than that, even in dollars. People in Latin America prefer higher returns over safer bets. We have achieved excellent returns with major companies with little risk. </p><h4>Do you think having a higher return-low risk investment is only possible in a place without deep capital markets?</h4><p>ANK It is easier to find an opportunity right now in Europe and Latin America than in US. The finance structure of medium and large companies in the US is far more sophisticated, so they are getting closer to a perfect structure; in Latin America and Europe we find profitable companies with growth expectations and low debt levels in need of a little change in their capital structure to propel their investment opportunities.</p><h4>What is a permanent business impairment in your sector?</h4><p>Francisco Carrillo The oil industry is a good example of permanent impairment. We use about 94-95 million barrels of oil everyday, roughly half of which is used for gasoline. It is possible that within the next twenty years the percentage of electric and hybrid cars reaches 30-40 of the total automobile market. At that time, the oil industry as we know it will have become permanently impaired, which would imply the multiples at which big oil companies trade dropping reduced significantly, and rightly so. As a long-term investor, we need to think of all possible risks that a company might face, weigh the chances of that actually happening, and determine how the company or industry will look like if conditions do play out in that way. We have to focus on skillfully measuring risk versus reward when making an investment decision.</p><h4>How are investors evaluating the conditions for investing in Mexico at this time?</h4><p>FC In our opinion there is no right or wrong time to invest. If we are able to find a great business for a reasonable price, then we should invest, regardless of market conditions. The country's strongest asset is our demographic makeup; I cannot think of another country in the world that has a better age composition today than Mexico. The combination of excellent demographics with Mexico's tradition of well-run family-owned businesses makes it a highly attractive market for investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Nieto expressed his support for your projects on inclusive development in the region. How can Mexico contribute to greater integration of the region?</h4><p>Mexico has already played a key role in advancing integration in the hemisphere, and we are sure it will continue to do so. Mexico has led many initiatives that had contributed to greater advancement of the region, mainly in the areas of strengthening security and fostering education. Mexico is supporting the OAS School of Government, which is one of our main projects to expand citizens' access to their rights. In 2017, Mexico will host the 10th Americas Competitiveness Forum, for which the OAS serves as technical secretariat; within that framework, over the next two years, Mexico will work closely with countries in the region to foster a dialogue on public policies and the exchange of experiences on the key structural reforms needed to drive competitiveness and entrepreneurship in our hemisphere. Mexico and AMEXCID have provided more than 1,200 scholarships for graduate students from more than 25 OAS member states to earn master's degrees and doctorates in science and engineering in Mexico over the last three years. </p><h4>The OAS has promoted the creation of an Inter-American System of Education. How can this initiative complement the recent education reforms approved in Mexico? </h4><p>This initiative is aimed at strengthening country's capacity to develop policies ensuring that all children and youth of the Americas have access to high quality, inclusive, and relevant education to achieve expected learning outcomes as well as to complete the basic education cycle. The Inter-American Education System will seek to create a mechanism that showcases promising practices in the field carried-out by different institutions and organizations at a national, sub-regional, and regional level, improves their articulation, and fosters international and South-South cooperation. Considering the leadership and capacity of Mexico in the educational field, the Inter-American Education System provides an opportunity for the country to showcase its good practices, all its resources and experiences, and provide technical cooperation to other countries that are interested in adapting those good practices to their own context.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the country's progress in terms of government transparency and fighting corruption, and what are OAS's recommendations for improvement?</h4><p>Over the last 15 years, Mexico has made progress in areas such as access to public information, the establishment of a system of social comptrollership in public entities, and the adoption of ethical standards of conduct for its public servants, most of which result from its participation in the OAS Mechanism for Follow-Up on the Implementation of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption (MESICIC). Among the areas that the MESICIC has made recommendations for improvement include providing protection for those that report acts of corruption, the prevention of bribery of national and foreign public servants, and the investigation and punishment of acts of corruption.</p><h4>How do the goals of the Summit of the Americas align with those of OAS, and what is your assessment of the most recent gathering?</h4><p>The seventh Summit of the Americas was a watershed moment in Inter-American relations and once again provided an example of how relations among the states of the Americas are evolving. The heads of state and governments of the region held frank and open discussions about the common challenges they faced. It marked the first time that the Republic of Cuba was participating in the highest-level dialogue held in our hemisphere. That milestone unquestionably marked a new era in Inter-American relations. The OAS is now working toward the objective to have Cuba back as an active member of the organization. To that end, we have proposed a positive work agenda with Cuba that seeks to reestablish the confidence and start drawing the route for its reintegration. We will continue to strengthen frank dialogue between social actors and governments, with the aim of making this process more participatory, inclusive, and open. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Denmark and Mexico will celebrate 190 years of bilateral relations in 2017, one of the longest bilateral relationships Mexico has held since its independence. How would you assess the state of this relationship?</h4><p>The bilateral relationship between Denmark and Mexico is a uniquely strong one. At first glance, one might not expect Denmark and Mexico to have much in common. We are vastly different countries in many aspects, such as culture and geography. Yet in spite of that, the relationship that Denmark enjoys with Mexico is strong and benefits both our countries. When I welcomed President Enrique Peña Nieto and his delegation in Copenhagen, we had some inspiring discussions, and I am delighted with the many bilateral agreements signed between Mexico and Denmark in the areas of health, energy, and climate change. On global issues, Denmark has for a long time found a reliable partner in Mexico. It is reassuring to us to know that on critical issues such as combating climate change and supporting indigenous peoples' rights, Mexico is a standard-bearer and a trusted partner. </p><h4>Where do you see the biggest potential for deepening trade ties between Mexico and Denmark?</h4><p>Denmark is a small country with a long tradition of innovation and focus on increasing productivity, efficiency, and constantly moving toward greener and more sustainable solutions. Mexico on the other hand is a large country with an enormous labor force and good conditions to host production with global perspectives. It is my ambition that Danish companies sell more solutions and share more know-how with large Mexican companies to improve their competitiveness and market strength. In energy efficiency, for example, Denmark has developed world-class technologies and knowhow and Mexican companies with high-energy consumption could harvest major economic advantages by adopting Danish solutions. Denmark is also at the forefront of health and welfare technology. Mexico is building and renovating a large number of hospitals over the next years, and its government has a strong focus on increasing the quality of health services. The food and agricultural sector is also important in our trade ties. Denmark has great experience and world-class solutions when it comes to improving the efficiency and quality of meat and dairy production.</p><h4>In 2015, Mexico and Denmark cooperated closely on the adoption of the new Sustainable Development Goals and signed a bilateral agreement to help Mexico meet its commitments to reduce carbon emissions. What are the major lessons that Mexico can learn from Denmark in this matter?</h4><p>The simple fact is that necessity is the mother of invention. The Danish energy transition took off in the 1970s in response to surging oil prices. Today, it is not oil prices but the future of the entire planet that forces the world to change. The good news is that the transition is a sound business initiative. It eliminates the downsides and dilemmas of energy consumption and production, leaving us with a more viable long-term source of energy. By 2050, Denmark aims to be independent of fossil fuels. Danish exports of green energy technology almost tripled from $4.5 billion in 2000 to $15.5 billion in 2013. Green energy pays off, and as the international commitments become realized, the future of green energy business looks bright. In early 2016, we concluded a global climate agreement in Paris, where Mexico was one of the major players in realizing the commitments made in this agreement. Denmark has accumulated a significant volume of lessons learned that we now share in an Energy Partnership Program that includes a well-established Danish-Mexican energy cooperation for several years. Through this cooperation we supported the Mexican contribution to the COP21 negotiations, the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, which is now set to be implemented. In Denmark, we have a solid basis for long-term holistic energy planning and these experiences can be used in Mexico to ensure a cost-efficient green transition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the significance of the Mexican market developed during your time here?</h4><p>When we first came to this market, it was not very mature; hence, the challenge was one that most big international companies faced—to increase our presence despite the lack of a formal security sector. At that time, security was just seen as labor. Most companies just hired a few security guards without any larger strategy. Since we acquired Pinkerton in 1999, we have expanded a great deal. We have at least doubled our size in that time. And the market and industry have evolved as well. In some segments, clients have more knowledge and more ideas about how to deal with security.</p><h4>What role has Securitas played in transforming the private security sector here?</h4><p>We want to educate our clients in order to change the way they look at the security industry. In the end, we need to reinforce our efforts to send the right message to the clients to change their idea on how to implement proper security services. The current challenge is to make security an established profession in Mexico. In many countries, being a security guard is a profession and a formal job, but in Mexico, that is still a challenge. We need to inform the public about the specialized nature of our services. Many of our competition still comes from the informal sector, so one of our challenges is to demonstrate the benefits of working with a formal security company.</p><h4>What distinguishes Securitas from other international security companies?</h4><p>Our biggest differentiator is our business model. We call it “the Toolbox." That business model is oriented toward our clients and our people. With that model, we are not improvising anything. Our vision also distinguishes us—the vision we have for our industry and our people. We want to transform the current services in security solutions. That is not a minor vision; it is a huge vision, and we need to do a lot of things for that. The way we provide our services is what differentiates our services from our competitors. In Mexico, we have serious competition. Securitas takes all of its internal processes very seriously. Of these, one of the most important is our hiring and selection process, which is unique in the industry. There are rigorous exams that must be passed in order to become a Securitas guard. That ensures we are hiring a professional person with a background check, who our clients can rely on for security.</p><h4>What is the biggest challenges right now for Securitas?</h4><p>The base of our services is still people. The labor force can be the biggest challenge right now, especially in the northern part of the country near the border, where the manufacturing industry often gets first choice of the most qualified employees. Our other challenge is getting into new segments of the market. The majority of our clients are currently in a few sectors: automotive, manufacturing, education, and logistics. There is a lot of potential in airports, healthcare, logistics, and high rises. The challenge is to convince our clients that we have the specialized training to meet the specific needs of their sector. We have expertise from our work in other countries and can deliver the best practices as a result.</p><h4>What are your goals for Securitas in the next few years?</h4><p>We still have potential segments for our market. We want to expand our footprint around the country in areas such as airports, the healthcare sector, high-rises, and logistics. We will not lose our vision to approach those segments. We will maintain our focus to transform the current services into real security solutions in line with the global vision of our CEO Alf Göransson. These are the next steps for us—trying to educate the market in that way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Bancomext for Mexico?</h4><p>Over the last 20 years, Mexico has changed the scope and scale of its involvement with the global economy. The country has taken the decision to switch from being a relatively closed economy to an open one. NAFTA changed significantly the way we interact economically with the world and the type of trade we do. Within the context of this transformation, Bancomext plays a key role. We are a development bank that has been involved in Mexico's international trade for a long time with different priorities. We will celebrate 80 years in 2017, and during the last 25 years, our focus has been how we can foster more international links with our main trading partners. As a result, today Mexico has FTAs with more than 40 countries due to an open and integrated economy with trade and financial flows. On that regard, Bancomext plays a key role financing Mexican companies that export goods and services around the world.  We support different companies from many sectors to help them meet their financial needs, boost their businesses, capacity and investment in general. This is our main mandate to support different sectors and provide financial services to meet the needs of those sectors. </p><h4>What is the biggest challenge for Bancomext in fulfilling that role?</h4><p>To provide some perspective, over the last 40 years, there have been two significant changes to the structure of the Mexican economy.  The first was with the FTAs and consolidating macroeconomics that followed in the early 1990s while the second was the structural reforms that have been approved in the last three years. Together, these two transformations play an important role in different sectors and projects. We want to make the most out of these reforms and the FTAs that we have with more than 40 countries. We have prioritized seven key sectors: energy, tourism, manufacturing, logistics, electronics, automotive, and mining. Bancomext has been operating under two types of financial services: direct lending, and second-tier lending. For larger projects, we directly manage the financials. Bancomext plays an important role in the implementation of the structural reforms. For example, energy has been the fastest growing component in our portfolio. We support different sectors such as electronic, hydrocarbons, upstream, and downstream, for example.  We have also focused on renewables projects. We have been financing many photo-voltaic and wind farms. There is a great deal of potential in Mexico for such energy projects and Bancomext plays an active role, making the most of the reforms.</p><h4>What level of interest in Mexico have you seen from international private equity investors?</h4><p>In terms of overall investment, it was more fixed-income products in the past, but the way forward is more equity investment. This change is clearly a result of the reforms which are opening new projects, sectors, and business opportunities. The combination of the old reforms with the FTAs with the new reforms in energy and services provides a great opportunity for investment. Some places have also become volatile; however, Mexico is perceived as an economy with strong fundamentals, good management, and huge potential with our openness and our strategy. We see substantial interest from private equity companies from the US, Canada, and even the Middle East. They have already invested in tourism and want to increase their exposure in that sector. This is an opportunity for equity-type investment. We want to take a step further. Bancomext announced it will play a larger role in terms of bridging the financing gap between institutional investors and the pipeline of potential projects. We will put together an effort to provide more information about greenfield and brownfield projects, trying to make it easier to search for great investment opportunities. We know that different investors have different risk appetites and we need to bridge that gap better. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sectors are most important right now in terms of promoting investment, and where are you seeing interest from international investors?</h4><p>Since 1999, we have had $436 billion in investments in Mexico. From that total, $209 billion has gone to manufacturing, in advanced areas such as automotive, aerospace and electric-electronic, among others. The next portion of investments was made in the services area, including finance and insurance, which puts Mexico in an interesting level in terms of investments. Other relevant sectors are trade and logistics, as well as mining and telecom. Indeed, we are developing the telecom sector rapidly, as it holds many opportunities, since Mexico has recently opened up the sector, and we are developing interesting new aspects in it; for example, if you have a US phone number, you can now call from Mexico to the US using your data package without paying any extra fees. We are also looking forward to implement this strategy in Latin America. </p><h4>Given the relative economic size of its four members, is the Pacific Alliance less important for Mexico than it is for Chile, Colombia, and Peru?</h4><p>According to UNCTAD, Mexico has cumulative investments (investment stock) over $9 billion in Pacific Alliance countries; therefore, the interest of businesspeople in these countries is noticeable. We started first with large companies, but SMEs are now also going to those countries. For example, we have the River Trade project that we started with Chile. We import berries from Chile and fly them to China through Mexican ports. Mexico is an important logistic hub. Our country is the only Spanish speaking nation with direct flights to China, which strengthens our position as a logistic hub in the Americas. Our next step is fostering our integration in the global value chains of the Pacific Alliance. Another example is consumer goods, where Mabe is a great success story because it is already producing refrigerators in Ecuador and Colombia. </p><h4>How important will the growth of the aerospace sector be for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The aerospace sector means excellent news for our country. If you analyze the growth rate of 17% in the past 10 years, you will see it is an important figure. It is one of the sectors that has been achieving great things. In addition, there are many highly qualified employees and technicians that are studying in Baja California, Chihuahua Sonora, or Querétaro; developing skills for this specific industry is really worth noticing. This is not only how ProMéxico sees the aerospace industry, but it is also how Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, and other OEMs are looking toward our country. These companies are interested in bringing suppliers from all over the world to produce in Mexico for them. Airbus, for example, is highly committed to Mexico that the CEO Frederic Garcia is now the President of the board of the transnational company in Mexico. Bombardier is our best promoter worldwide and is continuing to produce in Mexico. This is a well-organized sector; it is new and still growing in the sense that, although there is growth, it is not as large as the automotive value chain. There are 300 aerospace companies in Mexico, and we are expecting another 300 in the next 10 years. We want to be in the top 10 countries in the aerospace sector in the near future. </p><h4>Mexico has a negative reputation internationally around issues of security, transparency, and rule-of-law. Is this merited, and does it impede investment?</h4><p>Regarding security, we have to differentiate facts from perception. The facts are that homicide, kidnapping, and armed robbery have dropped by half over the last three years. In terms of rule of law, we are implementing a new system that will bring more transparency. These are the facts. The perception used to be bad, but now tourist and businesspeople numbers are booming, so the perception of insecurity is changing in a positive way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How successful have Mexico's recent structural reforms been in stimulating economic growth?</h4><p>The structural reforms have been far reaching, not just in energy and telecoms but also in labor and education as well as anti-trust laws and reforms, which is more within the mandate of Banxico. All reforms have led to positive results, although it might not be that obvious in all cases, especially considering the effect of adverse external scenarios and factors. The economic growth that was expected and hoped for has not necessarily materialized to the extent we hoped. But of course, it is hard to estimate and measure what the effects would have been without those reforms. The reforms have been productive and positive. The other side of the coin in terms of increased production is lower prices, and we have seen some substantial decrease in prices, at least in telecoms, electricity, and gasoline. Important progress has been made in that sense. </p><h4>Should investors be worried about the recent decline in the value of the peso?</h4><p>The behavior of the peso is a result of Mexico having a flexible exchange rate system in which the peso can adjust to how the international environment performs. At the same time you want strong fundamentals to also serve as an anchor. When you anchor a ship, it can still move, without drifting aimlessly. That is a good way to look at the peso now. Unfortunately we are facing an adverse international scenario. In 2015, we saw low growth globally, with low commodity prices and incomplete recovery in the US economy, along with additional measures by the Fed in the way of normalizing its unconventional monetary policy. Add to that various other geopolitical issues like Brexit and the US presidential election, and those issues create jitters in markets, which affect the exchange rate. To a large extent, however, there is confidence in the strength of the macro framework in Mexico. We recently received an important vote of confidence from the IMF that granted an extension in flexible credit lines. The IMF has a flexible credit line with which it helps countries prevent a crisis rather than resolving one. It basically extends the credit line for well-performing countries. This shows the country is evaluated highly and that it supports our policy framework. It also means the IMF puts money behind its words, in this case to the tune of $88 billion, which is a substantial amount. That is an important vote of confidence. As time passes and as some of these unknowns are clarified with progress in terms of implementing structural reforms, and as the US grows more robustly, this will play in Mexico's favor.</p><h4>Why is the Sistema de Pagos Interbancarios en Dólares (SPID) being implemented and how is it beneficial for the economy? </h4><p>In Mexico in different sectors we have important production chains that have developed, and often they have to make payments among themselves in dollars. We know these transactions take place, and often these payments take a long time, sometimes days or even weeks. Sometimes they are also subjected to issues relating to the regulatory environment in the US. Mexico has one of the best large- and small-scale payment systems in pesos, which is an important platform. You can make retail payments from one account to another account in a matter of seconds. That was facilitated by the fact that participating banks have accounts in Mexico and the Central Bank can give intraday credit and so on. Now, we cannot give intraday credit in dollars, because we are not the issuer of dollars, but we can complete the transaction in minutes in some cases, or in a few hours at the latest, but certainly during the day. That diminishes the transaction costs of many businesses in Mexico and this is something built on existing infrastructure. We basically adjusted the peso system for dollar transactions, with the obvious limitation that we are not the issuer of the currency. There are strict regulations concerning who can open a dollar account; individuals cannot open a dollar account, for example. The only thing we promote is the ability to make payments in a more efficient way between dollar accounts that already exist. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Enrique Peña Nieto was born on July 20, 1966 and holds a BA in law from the Universidad Panamericana and an MA in business administration from the Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM). Nieto joined public service at an early age, occupying several positions in the government of the State of Mexico. From 2000 to 2002, he was Secretary of Administration and from 2003 to 2004, he was elected Representative of the 13th District in the 65th Session of the State of Mexico. In 2005, Nieto ran for the governorship of the State of Mexico and was elected governor of the State of Mexico for September 16, 2005 to September 15, 2011. During his term as governor, he achieved significant progress in infrastructure and public services, particularly in health, and reduced public debt whilst increasing expenditure targeting works and programs without increasing taxes. In 2011, at the end of his term as governor, he campaigned for the position of President of Mexico and won the elections on July 1, 2012. ]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the significance of the recently signed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The agreement will allow Mexico to bolster its economic and commercial presence in 11 markets of one of the most dynamic regions in the world. The TPP will give us access to trade and business preferences with six new partners in the Asia Pacific region, namely Australia, Brunei, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. The TPP also allows for better integration of our businesses in the productive chains with our most important partners in the US and Canada, contributing to the goal of turning North America into the most competitive region in the world. With our main partners in Latin America, the TPP will consolidate preferential access of Mexico to the countries of the Pacific Alliance in Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Once the TPP and the Pacific Alliance come into effect, Mexico will have a total of 13 FTAs with 52 countries and preferential access to a market of 1.3 billion people. I am convinced that the TPP will strengthen the commercial history of Mexico, consolidating us as an export platform to the world.</p><h4>Mexico made a historic sale of 100-year euro-denominated bonds in 2015. Given the country's mixed history with foreign creditors over the last century, why should investors feel confident about this sale?</h4><p>Around 10 or 15 years ago, it would have been unthinkable for Mexico to issue a 100-year bond. We have succeeded now because we have taken multiple prudential measures against the international economic situation, including preventive adjustment of public spending and the implementation of a hedging program against oil prices. In an environment of uncertainty and financial volatility, Mexico has maintained economic growth, macroeconomic stability, and implemented at least three reforms that have given us the best shield against the challenges we are experiencing, namely in the energy, telecommunications, and finance sectors. This has generated great confidence in the growth potential of Mexico among investors, both now and in the long run. Proof of this was the issuance of bonds in the euro market for a period of 100 years in April 2015, with which the Mexican government became the first sovereign issuer in a euro transaction to that term at such a historically low cost.</p><h4>Education reform, a key part of your reform package, has faced a number of obstacles in its implementation, particularly with resistance from teachers' unions. Do you consider this reform a success?</h4><p>The purpose of the Education Reform is to make quality education a real factor in personal development, providing every young Mexican with the necessary tools to write their own success story and contribute to the greatness of the country, making it more productive and competitive. We are working tirelessly to bring this reform to every school and student in Mexico. We are making regular teacher evaluations, as well promoting a culture where the best teachers are rewarded for their accomplishments. The reform is designed to support teachers, train them, and encourage them to better convey their knowledge. Currently, the performance evaluations have been implemented by almost 96% of the teachers in Mexico, including teachers in states such as Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, where some groups of teachers are still resistant to this important transformation. Thus, during 2015, more than 360,000 participants were evaluated either for entry, promotion, and evaluation and/or performance assessment in both primary and middle education. My government has always been open to dialogue with those who oppose reform in order to improve it overall. This dialogue has been premised that there is no turning back in its execution. Dialogue is key to finding points of agreement in order to improve the quality of education and improve policy evaluation tools. In addition, we have initiated the issuance of Certificates of National Education Infrastructure, which will provide up to MXN50 billion ($2.7 billion) over the next three years. We have already started investing in the “Escuelas al Cien" program for the rehabilitation of educational spaces. This effort will allow us to provide the right educational conditions to support learning at the highest standards, including better infrastructure, educational materials, and computers with internet access to more than 33,000 educational institutions.</p><h4>What are your most important goals for the second half of your term?</h4><p>For the second half of my term, my government will continue working on the implementation of structural reforms. Beyond the current low oil prices, we are committed and determined to implement energy reform in a timely manner. The current environment of low oil prices does not stop or limit the implementation of energy reform in whatever step needs to be enacted. Proof of this is that in the third international public tender of contracts for hydrocarbon extraction, which was held on December 15, 2015, wherein 25 contracts were allocated within Round One with 100% allocation. We will also continue to work on strengthening the rule of law and access to justice for all. We are currently involved in the transformation of the traditional writing and inquisitorial system to a more oral and accusatory one. By the middle of 2016, the new penal system for all entities in the country will have to be implemented, which will make the application of justice in Mexico more expeditious and efficient. Along with this, we have initiated a profound insight into the current laws and the means to achieve greater efficiency in everyday justice and access to justice, which affects common citizens. We remain committed to macroeconomic stability to protect the heritage of Mexican families. To achieve this, we will continue applying a disciplined approach to public spending that is sensitive to the priorities of the population and focused on assisting the most vulnerable of the country. My government will remain committed to implementing an austerity budget that reduces government spending rather than transfers costs to the pockets of Mexicans. We will do more with less, investing public resources in strategic areas that are useful and bring the most social benefit. We will also speed up the phases of the National Infrastructure Program and apply innovative financial instruments such as the Fiber E Program or Certified Investment Projects that allow us to attract more private capital flows. We will also work to spur growth and economic development of the states that are lagging behind. For the first time in the history of Mexico, special economic zones will be created in states that have low human development but high production and logistics potential. Once the law for this is approved, I will propose the creation of the first special economic zones in Puerto Chiapas, Puerto Lázaro Cárdenas, in neighboring municipalities of Michoacán and Guerrero, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and from Salina Cruz (Oaxaca) to Coatzacoalcos (Veracruz). This measure will generate new poles of industrial development that will increase productivity, generate quality jobs, and reduce poverty. We will continue to face challenges, both internal and from abroad. To overcome them, instead of backtracking, we must continue with determination, commitment, and transparency in the way that we have set. My government is aware that we do not only work for the Mexicans of today, but for those of tomorrow so that they have the necessary tools to stand out among nations, having taken advantage of the conditions that allow us to reach our full potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>While Mexico has made several structural reforms that may transform the economy, many investors still lack confidence in the rule of law. How is the government building confidence?</h4><p>The governmental policy for tackling insecurity and corruption has advanced significantly in recent years. President Peña Nieto instructed the creation of the National Gendarmerie for providing protection to those areas of the country lacking an effective police presence, especially those in which economic and industrial activities take place. A prime example of this is how we are working closely with the mining sector and the automotive assemblers to provide security for the transportation of vehicles and parts from their plants to the export ports. To assist the National Gendarmerie in protecting businesses from bribes and extortions, we are carrying out a regulatory improvement process and working on increasing the government accountability and transparency in order to reduce the space for corruption. To bolster that process, President Peña Nieto sent a bill to Congress to establish the National Anti-Corruption System, which will strengthen the mechanisms for preventing corruption and hardening its sanctions. The nearly $110 billion of FDI received during the first three years of the administration of President Peña Nieto shows that investors themselves recognize governmental efforts for tackling insecurity, as well as the complexities of the Mexican territory, in which insecurity problems are concentrated in some zones of just two or three federal states, out of the total 32 federal entities.</p><h4>Mexico recently signed the landmark TPP. What is the significance of this agreement for the future of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The TPP is the FTA with the highest ambition, depth, and standards ever negotiated in the history of our nation. It is of great importance to Mexico for several reasons. In the current international scenario in which economic recovery remains fragile, the TPP can contribute to its revival thanks to the long-term increases in trade that it aims to promote. The 12 members of the TPP represent one-fifth of global trade, more than one-third of global GDP (37%), and capture more than one-quarter (28%) of FDI worldwide. For Mexico, the 11 other countries that are also part of TPP account for nearly three-quarters (72%) of foreign trade in Mexico, and are the source of more than half (55%) of the total investments received by the country from 1999 through June 2015. Therefore, the incorporation of Mexico into this negotiation was a strategic step forward for our country. The configuration of the TPP, which includes economies throughout the Pacific Rim, provides a unique opportunity to establish a single instrument, strengthen productive integration with our NAFTA partners, consolidate trade preferences with the Pacific Alliance, deepen access to the Japanese market, and open new opportunities in six economies of the Asia Pacific region, where Mexican exports grew by an average 62% over the last five years. Thus, the TPP will increase our foreign trade, expand the protection of Mexican flagship products that have designation of origin, and increase market alternatives and supply capacity of SMEs that, incidentally, are the big winners of this agreement, as it is the first to include a chapter with measures to facilitate their integration into global value chains. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define CEEG's role in the Mexican economy?</h4><p>CEEG was created in 2004 and now represents 47 CEOs of companies that are in Mexico's aeronautics, agribusiness and biotechnology, food and beverages, electronics, automotive, transport, banking and finance, consultancy and outsourcing, energy, pharmaceutical and healthcare, industrial estate, infrastructure, building materials, chemicals, insurance, steel and mining, information technology, telecommunications, and retail sales sectors. Our aim is to contribute to the development of business in Mexico, and to make the country more competitive within the global economy. Our aim is to convince corporations of the benefits of investing in Mexico and be strong partners for investing in the economy. In 2012, CEEG published an agenda on the competitiveness of the country, with more than 100 recommended changes that would make Mexico more competitive. This has had a direct impact on improving the business and policy landscape of the country, because we saw subsequently that part of the reforms that the government undertook were based on some of our recommendations. The public authorities recognize us as an entity that supports and helps create public policies that are geared toward furthering the Mexican economy. We represent about 2 million jobs and 10% of the GDP of the country. We have a broad and direct impact and view of what happens in Mexico.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges still facing Mexico in terms of competitiveness?</h4><p>To move forward with these global targets as a country, we need to have a global view on where we want to go. We can go far, but we need to know where we are going, what our objectives are, and show the will to attain those objectives. A clear long-term strategy is important. Second, we need a stronger state of law. Sustainable growth is impossible without the rule of law. The government's energy reforms are expected to add 1.5% to Mexico's GDP annually; however, the cost of security in Mexico comes to 1.6% of GDP per year. That gives an idea of how much money is spent on problems related to rule of law. Of the 18,000 complaints of impunities relating to oil theft from Pemex, only 700 complaints have been processed, which indicates a 95% impunity rate for losses suffered by Pemex. That means we need to address this crucial issue if we are going to attract investment to Mexico and ensure sustainable growth. A third priority is to be able to implement reforms. Making laws is easy, while implementing them is a tougher task. For reforms to be effective, they must be implemented permanently and sustainably. Education is another important challenge. We need the right, skilled people at all levels if Mexico is to be competitive in an increasingly technological and specialized global market in all sectors. We need to have an education system that is prepared to meet our needs in the future. The aim is to have in the global supply chain more Mexican manufacturing companies that mostly employ and are managed by Mexicans. We are working closely with the government on all of these matters, especially compliance with rule of law in Mexico. </p><h4>What is CEEG's role specifically in achieving those goals?</h4><p>We have been invited by the government to work in an important organization called the Comité Nacional de Productividad (National Committee of Productivity) that includes various government ministers, heads of top universities, heads of various economic and trade organizations, top CEOs, and major labor unions. We are working with them to develop the competitiveness of the country. </p><h4>What will CEEG try to achieve in the coming years?</h4><p>We will work closely with the government, the private sector, and civil society so that Mexico can be among the top five procurement and production players in the global economy within 15 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2008, what have been the main achievements of the company?</h4><p>Proforce was established in 2008 as a defense solutions provider. It has grown from strength to strength and we have continuously collaborated with the public sector as our main client. We have been able to export our services to other governments such as Rwanda, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Our vehicles are of international standard, and we have a wide range of armored vehicles. One of our strengths is our partnership with experts all over the world in Israel, South Africa, and the US. With all this knowledge we built our own facility in Nigeria to produce armored personnel carriers and other military-grade apparatus. We recently signed an MoU with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to start producing fighter jets, warships, drones, armored aerial vehicles, and mine resistant ambush personnel carriers, too. We started with mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, which have a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 19 tons each. In the area of ammunitions, we are partnering with companies from South Africa to assemble those ones in Nigeria, too. President Muhammadu Buhari wants the military industry to take off immediately; hence, Proforce is partnering with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to push that forward.</p><h4>What would you say have been the main factors behind your rapid growth?</h4><p>There is insecurity all over the world, not only in Nigeria, and our role is to make this country a safer place. In Nigeria, there is the Niger Delta Avengers group that has recently come up, Boko Haram, and other militant groups that are forming. Our country, as any other, needs to have a strong military manufacturing base to ensure a safe environment for its people.</p><h4>How would you describe Proforce Defense manufacturing facilities?</h4><p>We have a facility where we build armored personnel carriers (APCs) in Ogun State, and we produce about 40 vehicles per month or a total of around 480 vehicles a year. A second facility in Port Harcourt produces about 15 vehicles per month. Then, we have another facility that we are putting together in Abuja and we have another one in Katsina with which we are collaborating with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria to produce about 20 vehicles per month.</p><h4>All of your manufacturing is done in Nigeria. What role are you playing in supporting the local content development strategy of the federal government?</h4><p>There is no doubt we are adding value. We have done a lot of backward integration, for example, acquiring a steel rolling mill, and we provide jobs to over 2,000 people directly and around 5,000 indirectly. When you look at our group we have a direct workforce of about 8,000. The government is encouraging us to use materials that are made in Nigeria and integrate backward and improve the foreign exchange aspect.</p><h4>How do you train and keep you human resources skill base high and foster innovation?</h4><p>We send some of our staff abroad for training. We have a challenge with human capital but all you need to do is keep on changing hands until you get the right set of people. Expatriates should not be the solution because after having them for two years they may want to go. Also, if you are paying in dollars the cost compared to our Nigerian workforce is high. Instead, we prefer to train Nigerians well and bring down costs. In terms of R&amp;D, this is the backbone of the company. We have an R&amp;D unit and that is completely devoted to innovation. For example, we looked at new designs for APCs and we keep on investing a certain percentage of our profit every year in R&amp;D.</p><h4>How is Proforce Defence contributing to the modernization of Nigeria's armed forces?</h4><p>We are a versatile company and have worked hard to include the armed forces of Nigeria in the majority of the things we do. We interact regularly; for example, recently a lot of students from the Nigeria Defence Academy made up of colonels and other ranks came to the facility and we exchanged ideas. We incorporate a number of the things from their own practical experiences, because if you do not listen to their experience, you cannot bring in an APC from a different country and expects it to serve the forces and their environment. For example, Nigerian armed forces are at risk of overheating due to the high temperature in the northeast; APCs from abroad cannot cope with the heat and run into problems with their tires. We have been able to incorporate solutions to these challenges into our own vehicles and come up with a truly Nigerian vehicle.</p><h4>You have partners all over the world. What do you look for in a partner?</h4><p>There is a specific company in France that we are partnering with called Nexter, which produces blast-resistant seats. Blast-resistant seats absorb the force pressure of a blast in such a way that it will not destroy the backbone of the person sitting on the seat. This is a perfect example of the innovation and developments that we can incorporate in our vehicles.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment for international investors looking to come to Nigeria?</h4><p>The business environment in Nigeria is encouraging. Sometimes what you see and read on the news is only one side of the coin. Most Nigerians understand that the news from this country is often bad news and the opportunities and advantages are never publicized. From my point of view, Nigeria is a very secure country. Of course, there are some parts that are not safe, but on a whole, when you look at the whole 923,768sqkm of Nigeria, it's the place to be. It is our job to make sure that security is not an issue.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Since we have signed an MoU with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria we want to see Nigeria producing fighter jets, drones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We want to see a country that is safe but that at the same time has a well-equipped military in place for when the inevitable happens. We want a peaceful country; that is what we look forward to.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the intent and achievements of the National Transformation Program (NTP)?</h4><p>We plan to transform Malaysia from a middle-income to a high-income nation by 2020. The creation of wealth, inclusivity, and sustainability are the three pillars, with quality of life at the center of these pillars. We are currently on track and are overcoming the middle-income trap. Our actual GNI per capita had a gap of 33% and was not closing for five years. Since we started the transformation programs in 2010, we have narrowed it to 13%. The key factor of becoming a high-income state is to have the private sector as the biggest investor. Government investment is currently 40% versus 60% private investment. Secondly, we wanted to address inclusivity, making sure that we lift the bottom 40%. We changed the way we work here, reducing subsidies and instead providing cash transfers to those whose income is below MYR3,000 per month. Furthermore, we have introduced a minimum wage. We have lifted 2.9 million people out of poverty. Many of our rural living population did not have access to electricity, water, and basic infrastructure. We have touched the lives of 6.1 million people here. The third component is sustainability, where the shifting of the investment balance also plays an important role. Another aspect is diversifying our economy to ensure we do not rely heavily on income from natural resources and become more service oriented. Sustainability is often associated with the environment, and here we are making progress. We have invested heavily in urban public transportation, especially on the MRT project—our greenest project.</p><h4>Does becoming a more service-oriented economy mean increased collaboration with Singapore?</h4><p>The key to collaborating with Singapore in the coming years is the development of the High-Speed Rail. Having the two countries connected means an easy flow of talent and capital, and a general boost of the relationship. We already collaborate with it on other issues; for example, on the construction of our new oil and gas hub in Pengerang, Johor. Singapore has a similar hub just across the border; hence, we will find ways of working together rather than competing with each other.</p><h4>How does PEMANDU work to push the NTP agenda forward?</h4><p>Our first role is to promote a new way of working, for which we have designed labs. For example, we ran a series of labs, amongst which was the oil and gas sector, where we invited people from the public sector, as well as the private sector like Shell, Chevron, Exxon, and Talisman. For eight weeks, their representatives are locked inside the lab together with our team from the government service to collectively move the agenda of their industry forward. This is how the plans for Pengerang came along. We also introduce transparency. We want to show the public what we try to establish as greater transparency creates support. The third thing is the introduction of dashboards. Every Friday we have evaluation moments where we measure our progress by means of a traffic light: green for completed, yellow for partially done, and red for incomplete. This helps us institute a new way of working and creates discipline. If an item is red for two consecutive weeks, there is something wrong. Every month, we have committee meetings with the responsible minister. At the end of the year, we publish a report of what has been delivered and what has not. Ministers and the other responsible agents receive scores; the ownership is clear.</p><h4>As a former Shell executive, what do you envision for the future of the oil and gas industry in Malaysia?</h4><p>During my 23 years with Shell, the oil price never went over $80; on average the price was $20 a barrel, once even falling to $10. The world must remember that prices are cyclical. People celebrated when the price hit $100 and thought it would stay there. The world is resilient. When prices go down, some countries have to take painful measures to adapt; however, they will readjust to the new situation. All emerging countries have been forced to diversify, to find smarter ways. In Malaysia, we knew this was going to happen. High prices are great for upstream and low prices are great for downstream; you buy cheap and you add value and still maintain a great price, it is natural hedging. That is why we started the petrochemical industrial complex in Pengerang, fully focusing on downstream. Malaysia is well poised to handle this, partly because we managed to anticipate well. The first oil terminal in Pengerang was delivered already in 2014 with Dutch company Vopak. Oil prices then fell and all the capacity was sold out immediately. We are growing at 5% steadily; we could grow at 10%, though that would require taking on government debts for infrastructural projects and we do not want that. We have a mildly expanding economy and we cut our fiscal deficit every year. We want the private sector to invest, to limit the government's borrowing, grow at a mild rate, and gradually cut the fiscal deficit. We want Malaysia to grow sustainably and inclusively.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the TPP on the Malaysian economy?</h4><p>As we move toward a high-income economy, we cannot close our doors—we must open them to trade, imports, and exports. We are completely exposed, and the more exposed one is, the more one must embrace the TPP. We are the second-largest producer of palm oil in the world after Indonesia. Becoming a signatory to the TPP means we can sell our products, without paying duties, in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. The leverage is large. People object to the TPP because they want protectionism. However, we are already an open economy and we are a small nation. This makes us completely dependent on trade. We should not be intimidated by external competition and instead, we should have confidence in promoting our products as the modern-day world demands the best performances. Take the example of Scandinavian countries, which have only small domestic markets; they have however managed to become high-income economies because of their open policies. I am a great believer in the TPP and in liberalizing global trade in general. Prices for medicines will come down and access to medical facilities will be broader. Vaccination will be cheaper. We could greatly reduce mortality. The Copenhagen Consensus Centre did an analysis on the UNDP work, stating that of all activities, the greatest impact on sustainability in governments comes from free trade.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for PEMANDU?</h4><p>The next five years will be key to ensuring that these new ways of working becomes institutionalized. We want the private sector to take up responsibilities to continue catalyzing growth, and have government agencies adopt the lab technologies and rigor in dashboard monitoring. Once this is achieved, PEMANDU's role will naturally diminish and have served its purpose.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Nieto expressed his support for your projects on inclusive development in the region. How can Mexico contribute to greater integration of the region?</h4><p>Mexico has already played a key role in advancing integration in the hemisphere, and we are sure it will continue to do so. Mexico has led many initiatives that had contributed to greater advancement of the region, mainly in the areas of strengthening security and fostering education. Mexico is supporting the OAS School of Government, which is one of our main projects to expand citizens' access to their rights. In 2017, Mexico will host the 10th Americas Competitiveness Forum, for which the OAS serves as technical secretariat; within that framework, over the next two years, Mexico will work closely with countries in the region to foster a dialogue on public policies and the exchange of experiences on the key structural reforms needed to drive competitiveness and entrepreneurship in our hemisphere. Mexico and AMEXCID have provided more than 1,200 scholarships for graduate students from more than 25 OAS member states to earn master's degrees and doctorates in science and engineering in Mexico over the last three years. </p><h4>The OAS has promoted the creation of an Inter-American System of Education. How can this initiative complement the recent education reforms approved in Mexico? </h4><p>This initiative is aimed at strengthening country's capacity to develop policies ensuring that all children and youth of the Americas have access to high quality, inclusive, and relevant education to achieve expected learning outcomes as well as to complete the basic education cycle. The Inter-American Education System will seek to create a mechanism that showcases promising practices in the field carried-out by different institutions and organizations at a national, sub-regional, and regional level, improves their articulation, and fosters international and South-South cooperation. Considering the leadership and capacity of Mexico in the educational field, the Inter-American Education System provides an opportunity for the country to showcase its good practices, all its resources and experiences, and provide technical cooperation to other countries that are interested in adapting those good practices to their own context.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the country's progress in terms of government transparency and fighting corruption, and what are OAS's recommendations for improvement?</h4><p>Over the last 15 years, Mexico has made progress in areas such as access to public information, the establishment of a system of social comptrollership in public entities, and the adoption of ethical standards of conduct for its public servants, most of which result from its participation in the OAS Mechanism for Follow-Up on the Implementation of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption (MESICIC). Among the areas that the MESICIC has made recommendations for improvement include providing protection for those that report acts of corruption, the prevention of bribery of national and foreign public servants, and the investigation and punishment of acts of corruption.</p><h4>How do the goals of the Summit of the Americas align with those of OAS, and what is your assessment of the most recent gathering?</h4><p>The seventh Summit of the Americas was a watershed moment in Inter-American relations and once again provided an example of how relations among the states of the Americas are evolving. The heads of state and governments of the region held frank and open discussions about the common challenges they faced. It marked the first time that the Republic of Cuba was participating in the highest-level dialogue held in our hemisphere. That milestone unquestionably marked a new era in Inter-American relations. The OAS is now working toward the objective to have Cuba back as an active member of the organization. To that end, we have proposed a positive work agenda with Cuba that seeks to reestablish the confidence and start drawing the route for its reintegration. We will continue to strengthen frank dialogue between social actors and governments, with the aim of making this process more participatory, inclusive, and open.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What unique value does Mubadala Real Estate &amp; Infrastructure bring to developing Al Maryah Island in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Mubadala is an active investor focused in areas that drive both financial and social benefits to Abu Dhabi in line with government priorities. Real estate and infrastructure projects are among those priorities, and Mubadala develops strategic commercial, residential, and leisure districts that are central to Abu Dhabi's long term development plans. Our major projects are part of the government's 2030 plan, a comprehensive strategy to develop the capital into an environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable, world-class city. A true success story for us has been the development of Al Maryah Island as Abu Dhabi's business and lifestyle destination. The hub is now home to Abu Dhabi Global Market, the world's newest international financial center, as well as five-star hotels, luxury shopping, fine dining, and world-class healthcare. Another area would be our role in delivering pioneering education infrastructure projects including the UAE University, Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, and Zayed University Abu Dhabi's new campus. Mubadala's investment philosophy is centered on world-class partnerships, and because we work to international standards of quality, functionality, and sustainability, we have been able to attract partners like Gulf Related and Paris-Sorbonne to be part of our vision for Abu Dhabi. Collectively, these investments remain true to the Mubadala mandate by generating long-term financial returns and providing strong social benefit for the community.</p><h4>How do you view the impact of the global macroeconomic situation on real estate?</h4><p>The real estate industry is cyclical in nature, and we are accustomed to the periodic fluctuations caused by macroeconomics. Mubadala takes a long-term view with our investments and we project a continued rise in Abu Dhabi's population. Therefore, our strategy remains rooted in our vision to be a catalyst for the development of Abu Dhabi's economy. While we monitor the current markets closely and remain watchful, we do not lose sight of the bigger picture. Having said that, we strategize in the same way as all real estate developers do: we evaluate our portfolio, analyze the performance of our yielding assets, and plan future investments.</p><h4>What is the impact of Abu Dhabi Global Market on Al Maryah Island?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Global Market, which officially opened for business in October 2015, is a broad-based international financial center for local, regional, and international institutions. It is a cornerstone of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision, as it acts as a catalyst for the growth of the capital's dynamic financial services sector. As an international financial center operating in Abu Dhabi's financial free zone, which offers 100% ownership and zero tax for 50 years, Abu Dhabi Global Market plays a central role in attracting financial services firms to Al Maryah Island. It has three independent authorities, namely the Registration Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and ADGM Courts, which ensure its business-friendly environment operates in line with international best practices that are recognized by major financial centers across the world. Abu Dhabi Global Market complements Al Maryah Island's broader offer for businesses, which includes Grade-A office space, world-class residential, leisure, retail, and dining options, and exceptional connectivity to other parts of the capital. We are proud of Al Maryah Island's success—its growth has been nothing less than impressive. Six years ago, it was an empty plot of land. Today, it is a vibrant business and lifestyle destination that has some of the capital's most popular events, finest hotels and dining, luxury shopping, and world-class healthcare. Al Maryah Island is ever-evolving, and there are opportunities available for all kinds of third-party developers to invest in land-plots, which are ready for development, and be a part of the vision that we have for the island and Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key developments have characterized the past year for Insha'a Holding?</h4><p>Projects in Kuwait have been postponed for a while because of the relationship between parliament and the government. Until 2013, when HH the Amir changed the voting procedure, a new parliament came to be with a cooperative and integrative relationship with the government, meaning a variety of projects restarted. In 2014, the construction sector counted high profits because of the new rules, and 2015 also turned out to be a good year. However, by the end of 2015, oil prices went down and the government initiated new fiscal policies and cut costs to avoid a budget deficit, which led to a fair amount of projects having been cancelled or postponed. In 2016, the move of the wheel has slowed down. So far, compared to our neighbors like the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Kuwait is still doing well. As a construction company, we feel that lots of Emirati or Saudi companies try to enter the Kuwaiti market to compete. From last year to this year, most of our projects have been with the government, including the oil and gas sector. Just recently, we finished the Kuwait Oil Sector Hospital and the head quorate Kuwait Authority for Investment, and we ran several projects with the Ministry of Public Works, General Authority of Housing, the oil sector, and the private sector. So far, we have seven subsidiaries in Kuwait and three associated in Oman. In Kuwait we have SandCo Company and Bayan Company, supplying the market with sand and other gatch and agricultural soils. These two companies have about a 50% market share in Kuwait. We also have Boubiyan Ready Mix. It is a landmark factory producing concrete for most high-tech projects in Kuwait. This company is the one that received an award from American Society for Concrete. Boubiyan Aggregate imports aggregate from the UAE and conducts aggregate trades in the Kuwait market. In addition to that, Tasheed owns the Kuwait Tower factory, which produces interlock, pavement tiles, concrete tiles, and cement blocks. We produce additives for concrete and all chemical for construction materials at our company, EPO Gulf Company. We have a good market share even though we only recently established the company in 2010. In 2015, we established Insha'a Ahliyah Real Estate Company. This company is specializing in investing and managing industrial real estates.</p><h4>There are many Saudi and Emirati construction companies entering the Kuwaiti market. To what markets are you looking to expand?</h4><p>We currently have three companies in Oman with a share of about 25%. Our main Omani subsidiary is a company called Global Mining, producing raw gypsum. We also started a company called Global Gypsum, which takes the raw material to produce gypsum powder. Then, in 2010, we established Global Gypsum Board, which produces all kinds and type of gypsum boards. Now we are in the process of establishing new factory in order to manufacture artificial stones and marble and this belongs to a new company recently been established called Global for Marble. We have already ordered the production lines for the factory and hopefully by early 2017 we will start production. However, it should be mentioned that most of our material is merely produced in Oman and then exported to Indian, African, and Asian markets. We utilize Salalah Port, one of the biggest regional ports with excellent facilities to export our products.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the real estate and construction sector in the year ahead?</h4><p>Recently, the government announced a new plan depend on other sectors rather than only oil and gas. We have seen lots of movement recently. Hopefully, this gives an indication that the government is serious about this, and it is not only a matter of propaganda. Recently, the state has applied a reduction of subsidies program from the consumption of water and electricity for most sectors except for industrial ones. In my opinion, this is a message that the government is still supporting these sectors. Next year, we will have an election and nobody knows what will happen next. We have had three good, stable years, wherein relations were good, integrative, and cooperative. We can see the results in the market and the economy. Hopefully, the new elections will be positive, but I cannot give a solid answer and I am encouraged to invest into the non-oil sector. But let's see about politics first.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, the UAE has delivered nearly half of the foreign aid budget to developing projects in Egypt. How crucial has UAE aid been in stabilizing Egypt and promoting development?</h4><p>Egypt and the UAE have always shared special and close relations at both official and popular levels. Today, ties between the two Arab nations are developing on all fronts at an unprecedented rate and are considered a model upon which inter-Arab relations should be styled. Strong bonds of friendship with the UAE's leaders, HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed have reflected on the growing political and economic ties between both countries, as a result UAE ranks high among Arab and foreign countries investing in Egypt. Cultural ties between both nations are also reaching new horizons, in light of the common social and cultural heritage both peoples share. In this context, I would like to commend the appreciated efforts of Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad al-Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah, aimed at supporting various cultural activities as well as restoring a number of historic institutions in Egypt.<br>During recent years, the UAE has become one of Egypt's most important strategic allies as well as a key development partner. This was demonstrated by the stance taken by the UAE following the developments in Egypt in the past few years and the support it has pledged to Egypt's stability.</p><p>Following the revolution on June 30, 2013, a framework agreement was signed between the two countries by virtue of which the UAE supported the implementation of development projects in vital sectors including energy, housing, education, healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, and food security, in addition to industrial staff training and strategic studies. Talks are also underway with the UAE to finance projects implemented under the Sinai Peninsula Development Project. The UAE's support of Egypt's development plans has been very useful and we look forward to continued collaboration between and witness the implementation of a number of megaprojects aiming at boosting the economy and fostering Egypt's stability.</p><h4>How would you welcome collaboration between the two countries to help boost employment in Egypt, particularly among the younger population?</h4><p>The welfare of the Egyptian citizen is the principle objective of our development strategy. Development projects across the various sectors contribute to easing the problem of unemployment by accommodating thousands of people, primarily young people, into the job market. The UAE government has supported the implementation of many projects in various sectors in Egypt, which helped reduce unemployment by creating hundreds of thousands of job opportunities. Other UAE-funded projects, which are currently being implemented in various fields, generate thousands of jobs as well. Egypt is also focusing on enhancing the SME sector and strengthening entrepreneurship, bearing in mind how vital this sector is for addressing unemployment and providing the youth with job opportunities. We are also exchanging experiences with the UAE in this crucial field and have launched joint-training programs to empower human capital and prepare young Egyptian men and women to enable them to find jobs and build their own careers. This is in addition to joint efforts to employ 10,000 young Egyptian people in the ICT sector. The ongoing economic cooperation between Egypt and the UAE has definitely contributed positively to national efforts aimed at creating jobs and improving the livelihoods of many Egyptians.</p><h4>The New Suez Canal opened last year. Has Egypt seen interest from the UAE to develop special economic zones near the canal, like Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, which have developed efficient business-friendly centers for industry?</h4><p>The Suez Canal corridor is one of the most prominent projects in Egypt. In November 2015, we launched the first phase of the Suez Canal Area Development Project. The project envisages the promotion of special economic zones and industrial areas. Work is now underway on the infrastructure in the area to turn it into an international investment destination, a global logistics hub, and an industrial center for the new Egypt. As an integral part of this vision, the government is currently reviewing the special economic zones law to improve the tax and investment incentives offered to investors in these zones. The UAE was at the forefront of countries showing interest in this ambitious project, given its commitment to supporting Egypt's comprehensive economic and social development process as well as its successful experience in managing special economic zones. The Emirati interest in the Suez Canal project started early in phase one, where Abu Dhabi's National Marine Dredging Company was instrumental in delivering the New Suez Canal on time, leading a consortium of four of the world's largest dredging contractors. Momentum has now switched to phase two of the project, the new special economic zones, which offer a huge opportunity for the UAE, particularly the private sector, to set up industrial parks and logistics hub. I met with several groups of Emirati businessmen and investors over past years and discussed with them the diverse business and investment opportunities offered by Egypt as well as steps and measures undertaken by the government to offer an environment conducive to more investment and to eliminate bureaucratic impediments. They showed great interest and commitment to increasing their investments in Egypt, and we are currently cooperating with them in order to translate this interest into tangible actions and projects that would be of mutual benefit for both sides.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the Egyptian government and how can the UAE assist in measures taken to improve the economic situation?</h4><p>It is important to point out that the UAE has been a major supporter of Egypt at some of the most critical junctures in Egyptian history. Egypt will always remember with much appreciation the honorable positions taken by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan during the 1973 war and its aftermath. This support demonstrates that the UAE views Egypt's political and economic stability and viability as an integral part of the region's stability. The UAE's support to the Egyptian economy over the past few years has contributed to national efforts aimed at restoring confidence in our economy. Nevertheless, the economy faces many challenges, which the Egyptian government is vigorously addressing through adopting an ambitious plan to restructure subsidies and introduce further structural reforms. We also aim at boosting investment opportunities by adopting a series of measures to combat bureaucracy and encourage investors to do business and take advantage of various business opportunities Egypt has to offer given its considerable market size, human capital, strategic location as well as the many preferential trade agreements it has concluded with its European, African, and Arab partners that provide preferential access rates to Egyptian exports. Our aim is to eventually see our economy get back on its feet, realize sustainable development, and achieve higher growth rates. This will serve both Egypt and the region's economic interests.</p><h4>How do you envision future relations between Egypt and the UAE? </h4><p>At the bilateral level, Egypt and the UAE will continue to strengthen the political, economic, cultural, and social ties that have been established since the UAE's independence in 1971. There is a large Egyptian expatriate community in the UAE, which has positively contributed to its development and modernization process during the past decades, and many Emiratis have a strong affinity to Egypt, where they have received their education at Egyptian universities and enjoyed some of Egypt's most attractive tourist destinations. The political leadership in both countries is interested in seeing these relations further prosper and flourish to serve their mutual and regional interests.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Bulk of It]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-bulk-of-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2010 all the ports in RAK were brought under the umbrella of the Saqr Port Authority. What was the reasoning behind this?</h4><p>All the ports came together under Saqr Port Authority and are collectively known as RAK Ports, but they operate under the authority of Saqr Port. This was to streamline the management and increase efficiency and profitability. Saqr Port and RAK Maritime City were already profitable but the other ports needed to be improved.</p><h4>What is the importance of Saqr Port for RAK and the wider region?</h4><p>The port was constructed in 1975 to serve RAK's quarries. Today, it is the biggest bulk port in the MENA region by far and throughput is about 55 million tons per year. Around 80% of that is composed of aggregate products and the remaining 20% falls into the other products category. These are being exported to various parts of the world, including the Gulf, but mainly to areas with a high level of ongoing infrastructure projects, like Kuwait, Qatar for the World Cup, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and India, amongst others. We also import products, such as coal, to serve the industries here in the northern Emirates, and all the fuel for the northern Emirates' petrol stations. Our business is predominantly the export of commodities derived primarily from the quarries here in RAK.</p><h4>Do you think there should be any regulatory changes to boost RAK's maritime industry?</h4><p>RAK's maritime industry already has a bright future. I do not see any need to change the regulatory procedures as everything runs smoothly. Saqr Port, RAK Maritime City, and the other ports are operating profitably but obviously we are examining various diversification options, especially in light of the downturn in oil prices.</p><h4>Can you outline the Emirate's port facilities and their expansion prospects?</h4><p>We have five ports. Next door to Saqr Port we have RAK Maritime City, a free zone that is predominantly a landlord port from which we lease parcels of land to major companies. Then we have Ras Al Khaimah Port as an extension of RAK Maritime City, which is for vessel repairs, warehouse storage, and part of it is a free trade zone. Al Jazeera Port is predominantly for shipyard repair, cargo, and cross key work. Then we have Al Jeer Port, which is currently dormant but we expect to be opening within the next couple of months for marine, leisure, and small cargo vessels. With Al Jeer Port, we have just embarked upon an AED300 expansion program to develop one or two deepwater berths. The output of the quarries justifies expanding the capacity and catering to much larger ships. We are also looking at revitalizing the container industry by bringing the import and export of containers back to RAK and hope that is going to come to fruition within the next 12 months. At RAK Maritime City we have made an agreement with a company to construct a large fertilizer plant. It will import the product, manufacture, and then export. We are also looking at the possibility of a refinery and a large tank farm with various partners at the moment. RAK Maritime City sits on 6 million sqm of land, and 3 million sqm of that land is surrounded by exclusive access to the quayside, which is full, and the other 3 million is earmarked for large projects, tank farms, refineries, fertilizer plants, and a power station. These are the kinds of things we are looking at for RAK Maritime City. Moving further down to Ras Al Khaimah Port, one of the visions of RAK in general is to bring more tourists to the area so we are looking at providing a cruise terminal at Ras Al Khaimah Port. Feasibility studies are ongoing in that regard. With regards to Al Jazeera Port, we are looking at various options and one of them is luxury craft boat building.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>As far as RAK Ports is concerned, it will be another successful year and we will achieve the targets that we have set for ourselves. We predict growth this year to be 3 or 4% higher than 2015. Over the last 10 years growth at this particular port has more than doubled, but we can only grow within the current constraints. When we complete our new berths and boost capacity, growth will speed up again.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Island Life]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[island-life]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Al Marjan Island's unique investment environment?</h4><p>At the moment there is a diverse portfolio of hotels, hospitality, and leisure assets in Al Marjan. We have ambitious growth figures, one of those being 8,000 total keys for the full Al Marjan. So far we have around 1,500 operational hotel rooms between three hotels; Hilton Double Tree, Rixos Bab Al Nahr, and Al Marjan Island Resort and Spa, which is managed by Accor. That figure, by itself, is already very impressive considering that we have been operational for only two years. An example of investor confidence is the Hilton Double Tree. Only one year after its opening in January 2014, it decided to open another piece of land to develop an additional 240 hotel keys in order to reach 700, meaning a 44 % increase in just one year. No international brand will undergo this expansion unless it is sure about the destination in which it is investing. International brands believe that they have to be early birds in the Al Marjan development before someone else catches it.</p><h4>What is the length of time before investors will see a return on investment?</h4><p>The payback is within five years. That, in itself, is one of the competitive advantages of Al Marjan Island. We are doing our own studies by Colliers, Mackenzie, and CBRE to ensure that what we are doing is completely right. At the moment we are achieving a good result compared to Palm Jumeirah and Saadiyat Island. Colliers International concluded that a similar RoI in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah can be achieved despite it being an emerging destination. Whatever you can achieve in Dubai you can achieve it similarly and with less investment. When compared to the other two islands, although our occupancy is the lowest, we are achieving a similar RoI to Palm Jumeirah, even though construction costs are significantly higher in Palm Jumeirah. However, we do not believe that we are competing with these other islands as we are creating a unique brand in Ras Al Khaimah. We are adding our own unique advantage, which is a value proposition of Ras Al Khaimah as an authentic Arab gateway to the region, where we are investing in our own culture, mountains, desert, and landscape. Al Marjan is designed in a coral shape that allows each plot to have its own different sea view. In this way, each plot is either looking toward the west, the east, the city, or the Gulf. Therefore, the design of Al Marjan Island gives a lot of opportunities to investors. You have to offer something unique, otherwise you will be seen as an imitation development.</p><h4>How are you attracting foreign investment to Al Marjan Island?</h4><p>We have our own simple and clear strategy for attracting investors. We are transparent in everything we do and say in order to enable investors to make sound decisions. We adopt this transparent strategy towards our potential investors so that they know exactly what the rate of return is. However, we also believe that we need to drive the market ourselves, and for this reason we also develop our own products. This way, we can also lead by example. We have a good business model that can make investors trust us; they can visit our products and they can feel confident about Ras Al Khaimah as a whole. The strategy is simple; we create value for the existing investors and they demonstrate this generated revenue value to other potential investors. We believe that the strategy we are working with is the best and we are focusing more on roadshows in China, Russia, and Europe, so we seek investors from those areas to enhance the existing ones. Currently, on Al Marjan Island, we have different types of investors. We have investors from the UAE, the GCC, India, Pakistan, the UK, and the Czech Republic, amongst others. We would like to enhance this mix and show them the long-term investment opportunities on Al Marjan Island.</p><h4>How will Al Marjan Island complement the future of RAK's tourism industry?</h4><p>In Ras Al Khaimah, we do not promote ourselves to an investor as a short-term cash flow generator; we promote ourselves as a long-term value creator. We invest in the full master plan of Ras Al Khaimah and not just on Al Marjan Island as a development, so that is why we are selling a business opportunity in the Emirate and not just Al Marjan Island. There is a strong direction from HH Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, to create Ras Al Khaimah as the leading destination for authentic culture, tradition, and adventure. Ras Al Khaimah aims to attract around 2.5 to 2.9 million visitors by 2025 and, in order to do so, it needs around 15,000 hotel keys to be developed and 8,000 of them have to be in Al Marjan Island.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>There is a lot of potential to expand projects. A lot of eyes are focused on Al Marjan Island, not only from the UAE but from abroad, too. We noticed that there is demand from prestigious international hotel and hospitality brands in Al Marjan Island, and they are asking us to enhance the interaction with the international stakeholders and investors in order to create partnerships with them. This way they can both benefit whether it is as an international hotel brand or a foreign direct investor. There is potential for real estate although we are seeing some corrections to match the best price with both the investors and the end users.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It is really remarkable, and fortunately we are now also one of the most preferred destinations not only in the UAE, but also in the entire Middle East, for students who want to pursue the health sciences profession.</p><h4>How are you looking to develop and what aspects are the university focusing on?</h4><p>The main focus is to stabilize our academic programs, such as the curriculum, exams, and assessments, in addition to infrastructure. Initially we were in a temporary building, and in 2009 we moved to this building, and since then we have added two new blocks; one is the academic block and the other is a large sports complex. RAK College of Dental Sciences has its own state-of-the-art building. At RAKMHSU we believe that research is an important part of the whole spectrum of student and faculty life in order to get global recognition. Research is a must if a university wants to be recognized among top-ranking universities. In UAE, it is an area that is growing with more and more people recognizing its importance, even though the funding is one of the important requirements. We still make efforts to engage in research based on our budget and by establishing associations with other universities.</p><h4>What impact will the ministerial changes have on higher education?</h4><p>Fortunately, the UAE government has recognized the need for quality education that meets international standards. There is no confusion in that respect, so naturally whatever it is doing is in line with the strategy of maintaining quality of education.</p><h4>How would you evaluate RAK's current higher education regulatory environment?</h4><p>The Commission for Academic Accreditation is under the Minister for Education, which implements the accreditation process across the Emirates. There are some institutions that are outside the parameters of this Commission, for example institutions operating within the free zones. But in Dubai, for example, the authorities have come up with their own regulations for institutions in the free zones. All academic institutions outside the free zones must go through a process called the Licensing &amp; Accreditating process. We apply to the Commission, it sends a team of international experts to undertake an assessment, and then it gives its approval to start the program. We welcome all of these processes as they maintain international standards. </p><h4>Looking ahead, how do you see higher education developing in the next five years?</h4><p>Even in times of recession there are two things that tend to remain unaffected; one is education and the other is health. That is for the simple reason that parents know that they have to educate their children, even if they are struggling financially. No country is willing to allow either sector to fail, as both are vital to the functioning of society. Higher education has become a necessity and education is considered as the most important tool to empower society.</p><h4>Considering the high level of competition that exists among universities in the UAE, what can RAKMHSU offer students?</h4><p>If you take into consideration that someone coming from Dubai bypasses three medical colleges, four pharmacy colleges, and three dental colleges, and still comes to our university, that means that we have something special. Our management is unique, honest, and transparent; there are no compromises. The students from 48 nationalities &amp; faculty from 26 nationalities are living harmoniously and focusing on delivering quality education.</p><h4>Do you see a positive future for Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>The main philosophy of His Highness Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member &amp; Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, who is also the chancellor of the university, is that unless you bring in expertise and quality education, the country cannot progress and the easiest and most effective way of empowering people is through education. He wanted to establish educational institutions that deliver quality education, which will also ensure that students do not leave the country seeking quality institutions elsewhere. These institutions are now available in RAK and, in fact, they attract students from abroad, too. This, in turn, has a highly positive effect on tourism and economy. For the last 10 years, tourism has increased considerably, and education is playing an important role in that. For example, once a student joins us from another country, eventually all the members of their family will visit. The scholarships from the Sheikh Saqr Program for Government Excellence (SSPGE), under the patronage of HH Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr al Qasimi, to the nationals to study in dental, medical, and the pharmacy programs and the full scholarship for nursing from the Ministry of Health also helping to attract nationals to RAKMHSU. Thus, RAKMHSU is not just an academic institution; it is also playing an important role in social change, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of SEP and how has the company evolved since you established the industrial park in 1992?</h4><p>To start at the beginning, with my industrial business background I recognized early on that Thailand had the potential to be the center of the region's growth, particularly in the industrial, logistics, and agricultural sectors. Looking broader, I saw that with our geographic location, there was potential to build industrial park because of location near deep sea ports in Thailand. We also have the opportunity to be come a key hub across all of Asia. I have long worked in the industrial sector and have experience as the Chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, Samutprakarn Province, so with this background I established SEP to answer this growing potential. SEP is not the largest industrial park on the eastern seaboard, but from the very beginning we focused on providing an all-in-one service to our clients, from facilitating their manufacturing operations, aftersales services, logistical support, as well as dealing with environmental issues, such as providing waste management and water supply solutions. Actually, on the last point, we have further developed our environmental management services by catering to our industrial park and beyond. However, with soaring demand in this area, and encouragement from the government to provide waste water management in particular, we will be expanding this field at SEP and by next year hope to double our capacity to be able to serve more industries in Rayong and beyond. One final development to note, concerning our core business line, is that we are expanding SEP to our second phase; our new project is called Siam Green City. We are currently expanding our industrial park to a new location, not far from our original base, which sits on 2000 rai of land and will be able to accommodate new investors making use of the growing opportunities on Thailand's eastern seaboard.</p><h4>What are some of the key incentives that investors can expect if they establish their operations in SEP?</h4><p>There are many benefits but the most important is that our tenants are 100% exempt from corporate tax for a period of eight years, followed by 50% exemption for the next five years. This is the most important attraction for the foreign investor but there are many others such as import tax breaks for machinery used for production of export products, and others that come with operating from a Zone 3 Board of Investment (BOI) location, as we are at SEP. However, beside these tax benefits, I would say our main pull factor lies in the full range of services that we offer. Not only do we provide the land and help our clients settle with all necessary logistical support, we provide consultation services, which is often crucial for companies investing in Thailand for the first time. Sometimes in many industrial parks there are labor relations problems but in our industrial park there have been no labor protests or demonstrations because we have several mechanisms, like monthly HR club meetings; there are talks and there are very good relationships so there are no hiccups in the operations of our tenants. We have some very reputable producers here at SEP, including Nippon Steel, Mitsubishi, and more. With a total of 37 factories in our first park, and over 40,000 workers here, it is important to make sure everything is constantly running smoothly for all parties. Often in Thailand such industrial areas encounter labor concerns, or even protests, so we ensure we regularly sit with all parties and conduct HR consultations.</p><h4>With the government prioritizing the development of Thailand's eastern seaboard as the country's key industrial hub, how will such developments impact the future growth of the company?</h4><p>We see that the government is trying to improve and develop the eastern seaboard, and most importantly the infrastructure and logistics in the area, such as the new airport at U-Tapao and the deep sea port projects. We recognize that the government is serious about developing this region so we are establishing a new company, Siam Eastern Logistic Terminal, which is going to focus on developing our sea transportation with other countries, and regions as well. We are launching a new, breakthrough service called K-City; a sea port and high-speed ferry that will accommodate tourists, locals, and businesses in the region. We are connecting three ports on the eastern, western and northern side of the Gulf of Thailand, a project which has never been done before and which will revolutionize travel and logistics in the region. Most importantly it will cut transportation time and costs by between a half to two-thirds, which is crucial for investment in the region. Aside from this, we are growing and expanding in line with the government's plans, so I would say the ongoing eastern seaboard development project will be very useful for the future growth of this country, and we are well positioned and excited to play an active role in this.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Once again, I would say that the eastern seaboard signals very strong vision from the government, and indeed is one of the brightest opportunities that this country has at this point. The economy in Thailand has been slow for a long while and the government is trying to solve the problem through infrastructure development, so by next year I am confident we will see a full recovery. Above all, we expect that over the next 12 months the industrial sector will pick-up and exports will be improving, which is very important for our line of business. I think that the market recovery is coming and right now is the perfect time for investors to come in. Currently the land prices are low on the eastern seaboard as the development is in an early stage, so I would say it is a good chance for investors to enter the market and buy land or build facilities in order to do business next year before the economy picks up and prices begin to grow again. In line with this, and the ongoing expansion of several of our projects, I would say this is a very exciting time for Thailand, and for SEP.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is you assessment of the solid minerals sector contribution to the country's GDP and how do you expect it to evolve in the near future?</h4><p>The mining sector is not a new sector; it is as old as Nigeria itself. Nigeria used to be one of the most prominent exporters of tin, columbite, and coal in the early 1900s. In the late 1950s to early 1960s, when we discovered hydrocarbons, mining fell down the priority list. It moved from around 4% of GDP pre-oil to what now passes for about 0.33% of GDP. The challenge for the new administration is to revive the sector and boost its contribution to Nigeria's economic development. The way the president seeks to do that is by reorganizing the sector and ensuring that it serves both its domestic role in terms of industrial manufacturing, after which we then focus on its export potential. Import substitution is critical to Nigeria, and the president's vision will enable us to achieve the twin objectives of job creation and revenue generation.</p><h4>What strategies will you follow in the coming years to achieve import substitution in the mining sector?</h4><p>Planning is central. One of the first things I did as Minister was to put in place a road map for the development of the sector, which lays out the short-, medium- and long-term objectives for the next 25 years. Mining does not yield quick results or immediate benefits; it requires long-term investment and foresight. If you look at the standard Fraser Index of Mining, Nigeria features in the lower rung of the ladder as a mining destination; however, when you look at the geology of the country and the rock formation, it sits almost exactly on the same plane as Ghana, Burkina Faso, and the Ivory Coast, and Nigeria is bigger than all of those. There are a range of mineral types; therefore, once we overcome the perception challenge, we then need to provide investors with the evidence. Data is the second challenge. Mining is a science and our geological data gives an indication of the resources that we have in bitumen, coal, iron ore, and so on. The previous governments have done work on the geological map, particularly the aerial map, but we need more in-depth exploration to give investors accurate information and we expect that data to be available in 18 months. In terms of regulation, we have one of the best mining codes in the world. The previous governments, starting with the Obasanjo administration, did a lot of work in that respect.</p><h4>What types of incentives are provided for solid mineral investors?</h4><p>In Nigeria, investors have a tax holiday for five years, allowing free importation of mining equipment and 100% ownership of the mining operation; however, law enforcement is key. We are looking to ensure an autonomous regulatory agency that would be exclusively focused on managing the regulatory functions of the Ministry. We believe that there is a wide range of opportunities to incorporate informal mining into the economy, help them to create cooperatives, and give them access to low-interest funding to improve their capacity and technology to exploit what is on their ancestral land. Smaller operators can also act as pathfinders.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Nigeria as a destination for solid minerals investment? </h4><p>Our competitive advantage is first that Nigeria is pristine and almost a green field in mining. There are a lot of opportunities for exploring these green fields. So, we want to move from being a mineral nation to a mining nation. Two, Nigeria is a good destination for beneficiation and processing of proven reserves in bitumen, granite, marble, lead and zinc just to mention a few. So, investors interested in setting up smelters, cutting and polishing factories, and mineral processing plants have a lot to gain. We aim to replicate our success story in limestone processing and cement production. We are prepared to support companies ready to help add value to our mineral resources instead of just exporting them raw material; however, now we want professional cutters and polishers of marble that can be available to the local construction industry. These are the areas that we are focusing on. We look for success stories for inspiration such as that of the cement industry, which has developed into a net exporter. Nigeria was an importer of cement up until the early 2000s and today Nigerian companies are producing cement in other countries. That is just one mineral, but it shows the potential the sector holds.</p><h4>You have been very much involved in female empowerment. What strategies should be followed to empower and unleash the potential of women in Africa?</h4><p>As someone who worked on the policies and the manifesto of the party before we won the election, I know that we see women as a trigger for change. If you give women more advantages, the multiplier effect on communities is higher, because women by nature think beyond themselves. Women are more grounded, which is why when you look at our social investment program it is more directed at women. When you look at our cash transfer scheme, you will see that it is aimed at encouraging women to send their children to school to increase school enrollment and get an incentive on that basis. When I was governor, the bulk of the people that benefited from our social security program where we used to give NGN5,000 to elderly citizens, the bulk of them were women. Women were running our food banks in the streets and distributing the materials that we have, which is something that we are replicating under our social program now. It is not a favor to women, it is a benefit to us on a larger scale. Women have a way of managing things a lot better and have coping mechanisms that are a lot more sustainable in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the insurance industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>The insurance sector has been growing effectively in the past years, and at a quicker pace than most industries in Lebanon. It is undeniable that growth has slowed down in comparison to the numbers it presented a few years ago, but this responds to instability and political stagnation rather than deficiencies in the sector itself. If we look at the numbers, they are positive. They look promising, and we cannot deny that Lebanese insurance companies have found a way to remain resilient no matter how dark the panorama is. Industry wise, we have seen a steep decrease in the marine insurance segment due to the Syrian conflict, which has hindered export activity to Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and other markets. With the evaporation of this trade route and the position of Lebanon as a hub, insurance companies have lost an important part of their business in the local market.</p><h4>What have been the major challenges Al Mashrek has faced, and how have you come up with innovative solutions to counter them?</h4><p>We have pushed hard over the past four years to increase the percentage of collection of our premiums and to lower the deficit of collection to maintain a good client portfolio. Some of our clients have been with us for years, and paying their premiums has become increasingly tougher; therefore, we have shifted to adapt to these needs. All the international compliance regulations, such as Basel III, that have been recently applied have also taken their toll on how the sector operates; insurer banks minimize their shares in their own insurance companies, pushing them to have a more aggressive approach to the market. The fact that we are not connected to any banking institution leaves us in a more vulnerable position to counter these effects; hence, we came up with those solutions.</p><h4>How has this policy of mandatory insurance from the banking sector shifted the needs of regular insurance companies?</h4><p>An increasing trend in the Lebanese insurance market is the ability of banks to incorporate mandatory insurance policies into their loans, which has indirectly affected all players in the insurance sector. Due to the monetary situation, many businesses are shifting from traditional insurance to bank insurance, which is why when you look at the top-10 insurance companies they are dominated by bank insurers. We have been challenging this situation for the past few years, and have been able to maintain a fair level of the market share. We use our cash reserves to stay alive in this stagnant market. The challenge now is how much longer can we sustain this trend and remain competitive.</p><h4>Al Mashrek has always been identified by its personalized customer service. How does this give you an advantage in the market?</h4><p>We believe our services are good, and we have a strong level of satisfaction among out clients, and so do other insurance companies with high-quality services. However, I doubt customer service adds much to client portfolio numbers; these days, in Lebanon, most clients are looking for the cheapest option when getting a premium and do not foresee what will happen when they have a complaint or what service will they get in case they need to use their coverage. At the end of the day, we are a service company and we must offer the best services to our clients, particularly to those that are paying their premiums. We operate in a small market where public relations and connections have a major impact on a company's expansion; therfore, we cannot make mistakes when it comes to offering services. It is a burden, yes, but it is also a load we must bear in order to survive.</p><h4>Many insurance companies have ventured into the microinsurance segment in order to increase their profits. Have you tried this business line?</h4><p>Microinsurance is an interesting segment, but it is a numbers game. This business works in markets with more than 10 million in population and where microinsurance may be profitable. It is also highly oriented to life insurance, since this is the most profitable line of business. For us in a market the size of Lebanon, microinsurance does not represent a safe bet to increase out numbers or profits.</p><h4>Have you incorporated any technological application to your product portfolio?</h4><p>As a businessman with a background in technology, I can tell it is still too early to invest in technological applications for the insurance industry in Lebanon. The bulk of customers purchasing premiums in Lebanon come from the heads of families, who tend to be older and usually not involved in technological applications and novelties. Also, the implementation of mobile applications and technological advances requires a fair level of internet speed at an affordable cost, which we do not have in Lebanon for the time being. The percentage of potential customers to cater through technological applications remains too low for us to have a big incursion in this segment.</p><h4>How has your venture in Egypt worked out so far?</h4><p>Al Mashrek invested in a new company in Egypt called United General Insurance as a major shareholder. It has been a year since we started this operation, and it has been positive. It is a business that looks promising, and we plan to build up on it. Of course, the Egyptian market is completely different from the Lebanese market; it is a huge market with lots of potential. Microinsurance, for instance, can be successfully applied in Egypt. The major challenge we have faced so far is related to transferring money out of Egypt, but I believe this will be solved soon. Overall, our business in Egypt is growing well and I have a very positive outlook for the future of this market for Al Mashrek.</p><h4>What do you see for the future of Al Mashrek in the next couple of years?</h4><p>We will remain stable. We are witnessing a small growth in our business through the operations we have in Lebanon and Egypt. I do not think we will perform any expansion to other markets for the time being, and we already have enough branches to cater to the Lebanese market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some key milestones that the company has achieved over its 102 years of activity, particularly during the past year since its incorporation?</h4><p>Banco Nacional is a century-old bank, created with a vision of supporting the sector of micro and small businesses at the time, particularly those of the agricultural sector and the key activity of coffee plantations. President Alfredo Gonzalez Flores, who was the founder of the bank, visualized the bank taking workers and turning them into small entrepreneurs. The bank's mission was always to assist in the economic and social development of the country by focusing on micro and small enterprises. However, by the movement of the economies and changes in the global environment, the bank has prospered in encouraging the development of other activities, namely industry, trade, services, and the financial sector. In the last decade the focus has been keen on the part of services, which has led the country level for companies, mainly services (call centers and others), as they come to set up here in Costa Rica. The strong performances boosted GDP, thanks to the weight of its impact, to an expected growth of 4.2%. In 2000-2001, we returned to a successful program approaching micro and small business. Around 20% of our portfolio is focused on these micro and small businesses, and within that 20% there is an arm that specifically for the women bank that we give a lot of emphasis to, as it involves 25,000 women. We have a sales force of 300 people dedicated to those micro and small businesses. We have not neglected the agricultural sector, but today it represents just a small part of our economy. We nonetheless remain a country with an agricultural vocation, and our bank is actively involved in traditional products such as bananas and coffee as well as others like pineapple and similarly sophisticated products.</p><h4>What areas is Banco Nacional investing in most at the moment?</h4><p>Our main focus has been on clean energy generation projects, specifically hydroelectric and wind projects, as these both require large investments. We began in the early 2000s with some important projects, and we have moved out a bit from traditional credit into generating investment banking. Two important projects were the Peñas Blancas and Cariblanco hydroelectric plants, which were both made with a figure of securitization that was delivered to the ICE, where it won 15 years of funding, all of which was paid to investors at that time. These were both successful projects; however, in the last four to five years we have had a strong evolution using conventional credit even in the portfolio of mainly wind and hydroelectric projects in the country. The Reventazón project is the largest project at the moment in Central America. After the Panama Canal it is probably one of the greatest undertakings to come online, and the bank actively participated in it. That was incidentally what has allowed us to issue green credits worth about $500 million, not only for the sustainability of our portfolio of ongoing projects, but also of other projects in the pipeline, which are all environmentally friendly.</p><h4>How has the bank succeeded in decreasing the cost of its credit and what opportunities does this bring to the economy?</h4><p>Rates have dropped. A number of important factors came together during 2015 in the country's economy that helped us including oil and the decrease of imports like corn or soybeans. These greatly helped stabilize the economy, but the Central Bank also took a number of good measures that leveled the exchange rate and inflation while transferring a positive effect in the form of reduced taxes, which fell on average by 3.71%. Some sectors were down more than others, but we were one of the institutions that lowered them the most. These fundamental factors that helped at that time are perhaps now more stable; hence, we do not foresee economic growth in the country exceeding the projected 4.2%. Costa Rica needs an economic growth of closer to 6-6.5% in order to move the economy to where we need to be. We want to play a more dynamic role in the economy.</p><h4>How would you rate the bank's overall performance in 2016 compared with the results achieved in 2015, and what are your expectations for next year?</h4><p>In 1H2016, we have been far superior to what we had projected. We have been working on a strategic plan that we started in February of 2015. We made a proposal to the board, and this served to take a quick action in 2015. There were no serious concerns that we addressed, but rather many smaller corrective actions, mainly at the level of organizational climate due to the momentum of the bank's growth. In addition to slightly changing the organizational structure of our institution, we hired McKinsey to make a three-point consultation, which gave good results since being put into practice in January 2016. The approach we had was to improve productivity with the same resources that we had. We reactivated all parts of the organization, and we focused on some important aspects aimed at increasing our productivity and efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Fenicia Bank and how did your restructuration process contribute to a better identification within the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Fenicia Bank first started in in 1959 as Bank of Kuwait and the Arab World. After the Civil War ended, I joined a group of Lebanese businessmen to acquire the bank in 1992, As we took over the bank, in 1992, we started the restructuring process through enhancing the management by injecting new expertise in the first and second line of management, we introduced new standard operational procedures to streamline all processes and set clearance on job descriptions and reporting channels at all levels. Equipped with a fully Lebanese workforce, in 2010 we made a major leap in changing the Bank's headquarters, name, and logo in order to reflect our identity and our Lebanese roots. We also pushed the bank's assets, we succeeded to increase the bank's assets from $10 million dollars to $1.5 Billion dollars, since we needed a solid platform to build on the new strategy we had planned. The challenge we faced in late year 2000 was when we decided to compete with other mid- size banks in Lebanon. We made it clear to our stakeholders that it was not our utmost endeavor to become one of the big players in the market, but to become the firmest and the strongest one. After the new management was implemented, we were able to achieve the best ratios in the market in terms of liquidity and return on equity; our shareholders has even been referred to as the happiest shareholder in the Lebanese banking sector. </p><h4>Fenicia Bank has become increasingly inclined towards corporate governance practices. How has this asset helped you raise your level of competition in the market? </h4><p>Introducing international best practices into the bank's day-to-day procedures was the main purpose why we injected new blood into the management that emerged after we ended the first phase of bank's restructuring. Applying corporate governance principles, as per Basel II requirements and Banque Du Liban regulations with the help of a consultancy firm, was a smooth transitional process to us. We are now in the process of finalizing the implementation process in collaboration with an American firm in the field, which will imply the constant revision of our manuals and procedures to remain accountable. As we carry out cross-border transactions, we are committed to international financial standards and regulations, especially those applicable in Europe and the United States. We are actually in an on-going process to update our financial crimes compliance (FCC) policy to remain abreast with the new international regulations that fight corruption, tax evasion, money laundering, and any illicit transaction where the financial sector is susceptible of being harmed. We consider ourselves directly responsible of taking whatever measures to protect the banking sector in this regard.</p><h4>As a mid-size bank operating in the oversaturated Lebanese banking industry, how do you fare with the fierce local competition? </h4><p>We have strong customer-oriented approach that allows us to know and understand the client's needs. This is our niche expertise to build a solid and long-term relationship with our clients, which enables us to attract new customers and enlarge our customer base. Part of our DNA is to offer prime and quality service rather than piling up big number of customers; in other words, our focus is to become stronger rather than bigger. We share our accomplishments with our clients because their success is our success as well. We concentrate our business on the conventional banking transactions, and we're actually competing with the top- five alpha banks in Lebanon in terms of service quality and prices, despite the fact that we are a medium-size bank. Moreover, we have always been highly capitalized as our board's direction demands. We play it safe and we manage risks to mitigate their impact without sacrificing the satisfactory level of profit. This might seem to most players in the market as a moderate role, however, we have experienced success stories based on such strategy. </p><h4>The diaspora is one of Lebanon's major assets in terms of capital inflows. What channels do you use to attract them to Fenicia Bank? </h4><p>The majority of our shareholders are part of this Lebanese diaspora. As such, we understand our Lebanese expatriate needs and requirements. We maintain good and long-term relationships with eminent Lebanese businessmen abroad and this kind of relationships ordain wide and large channels to meet the requirements of Lebanese diaspora and reach out to their business fields, mainly in the GCC and western African countries where the Lebanese presence is vast. We have teams that regularly visit those countries and return with new relationships. We try to be next to the Lebanese expatriates side by side to help them meet their goals and succeed wherever they are. The diaspora trusts the Lebanese banking sector, because they are aware of the high caliber of the players here; they know we are accountable, compliant, and that we offer the best services in the market. Most banks in Lebanon are family owned, so this also plays in the favor of good accountability.</p><h4>What are your biggest markets outside of Lebanon?</h4><p>Our main markets are West Africa and the GCC countries. Then come Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. In my view, an important advantage of serving for the diaspora around the world is to maintain this vital link between the resident and non- resident Lebanese people.  In addition, we maintain and enhance the current capital inflows, which are a major source of funding for local businesses. </p><h4>What do you see for the future of Fenicia Bank, and what would you like to achieve in the next two years?</h4><p>Dynamism is a key factor to success and that is why our management has always been keen to invigorate the bank's structure and to adopt best global standards. At the beginning of 2015, we signed up an engagement with Financial Integrity Network (FIN), a reputable consulting firm,  to further enhance our compliance practices and materialize them into actual facts. A sizable team from the bank was involved in the process and the primary results were very encouraging in terms of updating Fenicia Bank's practices in combating and preventing illicit financing.  We have reached many achievements that led to regional and international recognitions that have certainly marked Fenicia Bank with success. In April 2015, the bank was awarded by Standard Chartered Bank with the "STP Excellence Award". Moreover, the bank was granted the Golden Medallion of Honor from the Tatweej Organization in the United Arab Emirates for its distinction and quality in the Arab region. And more recently, we received the "Excellence in Brand and Trademark" award from the World Union of Arab Bankers in May 2016. These awards are a big honor for us not only for its regional impact, but because they reflect our successful implementation of global standards. We will continue expanding our network on that same track by starting new branches in various regions and we will also work intensively to become an alpha bank in the near future. We currently have a great business model that has produced good figures and remarkable financial ratios. What we need now is a convenient market place and a dynamic working environment in Lebanon to play at a much larger scale, and to attract new potential businesses and investments into the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main developments in the capital markets of Azerbaijan over the past year?</h4><p>The capital market situation in Azerbaijan underwent substantial changes. There has been pressure generated by the state of the commodities market, which naturally led to the decrease of traded value on the BSE. There has been a substantial capitalization of existing players, coming partially from the state and partially from commercial enterprises taking out loans at the BSE, as well as companies simply expanding their businesses. The state continues to play the role of the main investor. It is clear that the companies are unable to play this role at the moment; the state invested its fixed assets in the economy, particularly in the country's infrastructure, and this financial redistribution transpired through the tools of the capital market. The decrease in state profits lead to fiscal consolidation and a decrease in state expenditures, putting pressure on the national currency. Adding to this is militarization and unrest in the region. All of these factors lead to cautious behavior from internal and external players. Nevertheless, our year-end report shows the traded volume on the BSE decreased only by 10-12%, a result of a replacement in the product structure. Along with the traditional instruments, such as stocks and bonds, investors redirected their attention toward hedging their risks with currency tools. The currency tools began to play a larger role in the BSE product structure and comprise around 70% of the total traded volume at present. In 2015, 2016, and partially into 2017, we are going to pay close attention to infrastructure projects that have to do with the market, the institutions, and the tools of the capital market.</p><h4>In May 2015, the President signed a law calling for reconstruction of the stock market. In what ways will this new law affect the BSE?</h4><p>The law “On the Securities Market Law" was enacted this summer. It is a central part of what we at the BSE call a three-step normative reform. The first step is the legislative act itself, which includes provisions for almost all aspects of the capital market development. The second step is about 30 regulatory acts that cover the professional activities of all the participants in the capital market. The licensing in the securities market is becoming much more transparent. The key points of this legal reform also include the protection of the investor's rights through special funds and more disclosure of information. The third step is the operating rules for the BSE and the National Depositary Center, the two central institutions. The process of subscription and placement, including IPO, is being aligned with international standards following the law's pragmatic approach. The law cements new listing rules and requirements for the BSE and creates conditions for developing new markets and tools within all three markets: the specially regulated government security market, the corporate instruments market, and the derivatives market. This strengthens the trade, post-trade, and intermediary infrastructure.</p><h4>How can the capital markets become more appealing to the companies in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Over the next decade, the capital market will somewhat change its main function. The previous 10 years saw the intensive growth of state and corporate revenues made during an era of booming commodities prices and the capital market had the function of offering a fair redistribution of revenues and channeling them into the economy. Now, the capital market and all its institutions will have a new function. The key mission for the next decade will be boosting growth in the non-oil sector, attracting more savings of companies and households, and transforming them into investments on the BSE. For the last three consecutive years, the non-oil GDP of the country has been growing two times as fast as the oil sector, and we see it as having big potential for the capital market institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Iran aims to become a land bridge connecting Asia and Europe. What is the importance of developing an extensive railway network to boost trade with foreign countries?</h4><p>Iran has in an excellent position geographically whereby it can connect Asia with Europe, but also the CIS countries, with the Persian Gulf. We are focusing on using our location as a bridge to connect all sides. We have some connections already running from north to south. We have a rail connection from Bandar Abbas going into Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. In 2015, we added a new connection from Sarakhs in the east of Iran that goes through Turkmenistan and directly into Kazakhstan. We have one rail connection with Turkey from Razi border. Now, we are constructing a new line to link Iran to Azerbaijan and Russia called the North-South Rail Corridor. We are also constructing a new line to Herat in Afghanistan. We have completed the work up to the border and we are now doing the construction work on the Afghan side, which Iran is also paying for. By 2016, the work will be done and then we have major plans to develop the railway further to connect to other countries. We are planning to connect with Iraq on two sides, one on the southewst of Iran through Khorramshahr to Basra, with only 35km still missing to complete this line. We have signed an MoU with the government of Iraq to build a bridge to complete that connection. We have another plan to connect with Iraq through Khosravi border, which is in the west of Iran and from the border to Baghdad it is more than 70km. Therefore, we have a plan to link up with all the surrounding countries as a bridge, and then we can play a better role in this network of connections.</p><h4>What is the importance of the railway sector as a pillar for the Iranian economy?</h4><p>The railways are potentially extremely important for Iran's economy. However, the reality is that for now the railways are not as strong as our road transportation network. Around 88% of our inland transport is done by road, with only 12% by rail. The new government wants to focus on developing railways and has allocated a large budget for it. As a result, for the last two years we have increased the rail transport share versus road. Rail transport has gone up from 10.5% in 2014 to 11.7% in 2015 and is now growing to 12% in 2016.</p><h4>Iran is planning to develop a 12,000km rail network. What is your strategy to attract foreign investment for this project?</h4><p>We have some different strategies. For the infrastructure, we are looking at using finance through tenders, not direct investment, as it is difficult to engage foreign investors in infrastructure projects. Our usual strategy is to use loans from foreign countries to finance projects. Of the intended $25 billion we plan that a maximum of $10 billion will come from foreign investors as a direct investment for operational activities and the rail fleet. For this reason, we plan to have attractive packages for the investors on the fleet. For example, we would give free infrastructure to all the operators for a number of years. This means that right now if a company invests in freight cars, it would not pay any taxes for using any of the rail infrastructures for four years. Similarly, if investors bring locomotives here to use on our lines, Railways of Iran (RAI) will give them a guarantee to buy their services. However, there are some exceptions. For example, for the Rasht-Astara railway project, which is part of North-South Corridor to link Iran and Azerbaijan, we are looking to invite foreign investors, as it is more useful for transit, and they can use foreign currency income.</p><h4>What is the importance of connecting the Persian Gulf and the CIS to boost trade between these regions?</h4><p>The lines connecting the ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas with the CIS countries are important because these countries are landlocked and need to connect with the international waters. Now, we have that good rail connection between Bandar Abbas and the CIS countries, and we are also planning to add one more connection from Chabahar Port to the region. This new line will also be used to transport goods through Afghanistan and India and vice versa. There are currently big investments being made in iron ore mining in Afghanistan and that ore can be exported via Chabahar Port. For the Rasht-Astara rail line, we have signed an MoU with the government of Azerbaijan and have started construction of a rail bridge, which is required to cross the Astarachay river on the border between both countries. The Rasht-Astara line will take around five years to finish. We are constructing a large terminal in the Iranian part; therefore, road freight can be delivered to the terminal, and from there we can put it on the railway and send it to Russia and Georgia. We are currently in negotiations with Azerbaijan and Russia to complete Rasht-Astara missing link, which is around 175km. This is an important transit route from Russia, Europe, and the Black Sea countries that will bring in a good foreign currency income when it is finished.</p><h4>In February, the first train on the Silk Road arrived from China. What is the importance of this project for Iran?</h4><p>This new corridor is important because Iran has a good relationship with China. Our businessmen in Iran import a substantial number of goods from China. Currently, they are using the shipping lines for it, usually from Shanghai to Bandar Abbas Port. This new railway line is important because it will reduce the transportation costs, which will attract traders to use rails to transport goods from China to Iran and on to Europe. The first train was successful, and it took around 14 days from Yiwu (China) to Tehran. We are hoping to have more trains and expand this service in the future, for example with more trains to Turkey and directly to Europe. Turkey is constructing new bridges across the Bosporus that it can be used for both road and rail. This would create a complete railway line from China to Iran and then to Turkey and Europe.</p><h4>Transit traffic has risen by 100% over the last year. What are your expectations for the growth in transit traffic in 2016?</h4><p>We hoped to increase transit by rail by around 100% again in 2016. Unfortunately, we are not on target to reach this goal at the moment because the price of sulfur is falling, and that particular piece of cargo makes up a substantial part of our transit business. Sulfur is transported from Turkmenistan to be exported via Bandar Abbas, but the first quarter of 2016 was not positive because Turkmenistan's sulfur sales were down. Now, the price has been regulated, and we hope to increase sulfur exports to reach our target. While sulfur is the most important, there are other transit cargoes we hope will increase in volume too. For example, goods from Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, and heavy fuel exports that started in May from Turkmenistan. Wheat and iron ore are other products we hope will be transited through Iran from Kazakhstan for being exported through the Persian Gulf.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the decision by INS to forego the price war, and how are you protecting your profits?</h4><p>In the insurance business it's important to make a good profit, but our main goal is to offer trust and the best services in the market. Over the past year our strategy has been a trifold, to improve services, reduce costs, and manage our assets more efficiently, and those changes ultimately have benefited our customers. Even before 2008 when the monopoly was broken we were facing illegal competition. Therefore, we have become a more competitive and stronger insurance company, because of the challenges we knew were coming. We continue to assess the market needs and to work on meeting the needs and wants of our customers. Consequently, so far this semester we have doubled our profits compared to last year.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your investment in public works and other projects that you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>In 2015, we announced that we would invest $25 million on a road from San José to San Ramón; however, work on the road has not even started yet. This road has to be built by a trust subscribed by Conavi and the Bank of Costa Rica; they have signed an agreement and we expect them to be ready to start building the road soon. We also just announced that we are ready to invest $35 million in a road to Cartago, which will probably start in March 2017. Another project is the Mega Firemen Station, which consists of two large buildings that will cost around $25 million. It is a small project but we are excited to be part of it. These two buildings for the metropolitan area have to be ready by next year.</p><h4>What steps are necessary to raise national awareness of insurance?</h4><p>Developing and implementing financial education is a key strategy for us. We have a plan that involves different targets with educational resources and channels designed according to different customer segments to meet their specific needs and wants. It's imperative to start educating children at young ages. That's why this year we started a project working with schools to teach children and parents about insurance, risks, and the ways they could prevent and manage them. We are trying to develop a culture based on learning to identify, prevent, and handle risks and the intrinsic relationship between risks and insurance. This is very important because the young generation will be better protected and they will understand and pass their knowledge to future generations.</p><h4>What do you identify as the main challenge here in Costa Rica?<br></h4><p>The first challenge is education, especially for the elderly because they have not received this type of education and information. In other words, some of them don't understand that when they buy insurance they are buying protection for their  future. The other important challenge in Costa Rica is health. That's why we are strengthening our health services conglomerate, especially for those sectors of the population that depend on public services. That is key because in doing so we also help the Department of Social Insurance, which is an important institution for everyone in Costa Rica. As the health system in Costa Rica is relevant in terms of social stability, we believe it is extremely imperative for us because we are a public institution and we could have a big impact in our society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the development of fish production in Mozambique over the past year and what are your expectations for the upcoming year?</h4><p>In 2015, Mozambique had an annual production of 287,720 tons of fisheries products, comprising shallow and deep-water prawns, tuna, and a variety of demersal and pelagic finfish, crustaceans, and cephalopods from both marine and fresh water environments. This represents a slight growth of 13% when compared to 2014. Looking at the segmental contribution to overall production, around 90% was harvested by small-scale fisheries, while aquaculture accounts for less than 1%. Currently, the country exports nearly 5% of the production (12,877 tons), but there is potential to increase all those figures and maximize the economic benefits for the country. In 2016, the government will continue providing special attention to promoting national and foreign private investments mainly for two underutilized segments—tuna exploitation and mariculture both at industrial and small-scale levels. Investments in aquaculture parks to increase fresh water fish farming capacity and the processing industry are amongst our top priorities. Special attention will also be given to the development of fisheries-supporting infrastructure, thus creating an enabling environment for either long distance or national fishing fleet operations.</p><h4>What action is the ministry taking to promote both local and foreign investments in the fishing and aquaculture industry?</h4><p>A sound institutional and legal framework is in place. We have a new Fisheries Act and legislation on investment in Mozambique (Law on Investment, Regulations and Code of Fiscal Benefits for Investment). These instruments provide incentives for the entry of foreign capital for fishing and aquaculture. We have completed the first stage of mapping of potential areas for mariculture and the same exercise is being done for fresh water/inland aquaculture. In addition, we are reviewing a plan of action for aquaculture development both industrial and small-scale. Complementary to the legal framework abovementioned, the sector is undertaking other interventions toward disseminating the unique environmental potential of the country to encourage private sector investments in tuna fisheries and mariculture.</p><h4>Are fishers conscious of the consequences that climate change, overfishing, pollution, or illegal fishing can have on the industry?</h4><p>One of the main role of the Ministry of Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries is to ensure the monitoring, control, and surveillance of fishing activity. Our interventions in this field, especially in the form of educational campaigns, have been useful for raising community awareness with regard to illegal fishing, overfishing, and pollution. Additionally, the implementation of specific external co-funded development programs with focus on socioeconomic development helps us strengthen and raise community awareness on issues related to best practices, responsible fishing, environmental sustainability, the importance of preserving ecosystems, as well as the impacts of climate change in fisheries. Currently, the Ministry, in collaboration with relevant sectors, is in the process of drafting an action plan to help minimize the impact of climate change and build resilience in the fisheries sector.</p><h4>The Fisheries Museum opened recently. What is the main goal behind this initiative?</h4><p>The main goal behind this initiative is to disseminate and protect the fisheries cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations. This strategic development objective will be accomplished through a combination of several interventions in the field of research, collection, preservation, maintenance, and disclosure/propagation of fishery cultural heritage. The fisheries museum will have a twofold perspective—science and public education.</p><h4>What are your goals for the Ministry for the next three years?</h4><p>Priority will be given to dissemination of the country's natural and environmental potential for fishing industry development. National and foreign private-sector investors will be given due attention and recommended to consider investment in tuna fisheries, mariculture, and fresh water aquaculture. The processing industry, using artisanal production as raw materials, could also be attractive for the establishment of processing plants. The construction and/or rehabilitation of fishing support infrastructures will be a top priority line of intervention.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RAK Ceramics realized solid growth in 2015, accounting for a 10.2% increase in annual profits at AED310.3 million. What were the key highlights of 2015?</h4><p>It was our 25-year anniversary in 2015 and we have much to be proud of; over the last 25 years we have helped to create icons, build marvels, and our products have featured in some of the most iconic buildings in the world. In 2014 the board approved a value creation plan (VCP) designed to streamline our business and unlock hidden value for our shareholders. In 2015 we continued with our implementation of the VCP and have started to see positive results. We invested in our core businesses through capacity expansions for sanitary ware in the UAE and Bangladesh, and by doing so we have strengthened our focus markets of the UAE, GCC, India, and Bangladesh. We have also increased our stake in a number of our subsidiaries and strengthened our leadership team. </p><h4>What is the role of your non-core businesses within your strategy?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the leading ceramics lifestyle solutions provider in the world and our Value Creation Plan was implemented to support this vision. The VCP is aimed at streamlining the business by investing in core businesses and exiting from non-core and non-performing businesses. Throughout 2015 we continued to divest non-core businesses such as RAK Logistics, we sold non-performing operations such as Sudan, and we also ceased manufacturing in China. The continued implementation of the plan is our immediate focus, with a strong emphasis on revenue growth, capacity expansions, and ongoing acquisitions in core businesses.</p><h4>What strategy do you use to strengthen the control of the group over its subsidiaries?</h4><p>In 2015 we acquired 100% of our subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Iran, and India, and these acquisitions will strengthen the RAK Ceramics' brand, giving us greater control over our global operations. By working in a more cohesive and joined up way globally, we can improve the way we operate and add value to the business. In 2012 we invested in SAP in order to have the same IT infrastructure available across the organization. Last year we rolled it out in Bangladesh and India and we are now implementing SAP in Europe. It is challenging but it is something that will help the group and will take us further.</p><h4>Do you still feel there are any untapped markets around the globe?</h4><p>The focus markets for us are the GCC, India, and Bangladesh followed by value markets such as Europe, MENA, and North Western Africa. Other markets where we see opportunities are the Americas and Russia. These are important markets where we are selling but do not yet have a strong presence. We are already available in more than 150 countries but we will always continue to seek out new opportunities.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Iran?</h4><p>We invested in Iran before the sanctions were imposed and the investment was financed by The World Bank. Iran has an abundance of raw materials, energy, and manpower, and is the fourth-largest ceramics market in the world. Since the sanctions have been imposed, we have scaled down operations to adhere to the required regulations. However, we have a long-term vision for the Iranian market both domestically and as an export center once the sanctions get lifted.</p><h4>How can the ceramics industry implement innovative practices and how is RAK Ceramics doing so?</h4><p>From the beginning we aspired to have the best machinery, the latest technology, and produce the best products for sale in the world. During the 2008 crisis RAK Ceramics were among the least affected and we continued to invest in new technology and were the first factory in the region to introduce digital printing. This allowed us to enter into many new segments at the time such as marble, stone, and different surfaces. Technology and innovation are at the heart of our philosophy and we have continuously led the way in terms of product innovation. We are now one of the largest ceramics manufacturers in the world and have evolved from being a manufacturer of functional ceramics' products to becoming a comprehensive producer of ceramics lifestyle solutions. Two years ago RAK Ceramics was the first manufacturer in the GCC to introduce Continua+ technology enabling us to manufacture super-sized slabs such as Maximus Mega Slab. We have also introduced environmentally friendly innovations that have allowed us to use less gas and energy during production. It is this commitment to innovation that has been fundamental to our success and something I plan to continue as part of our long-term strategy.</p><h4>What mechanisms are RAK Ceramics using to mitigate the current economic and geopolitical situation in the region?</h4><p>In 2015, we experienced a 10.2% growth in annual profits and in 1Q2016 we have also grown by another 10.8%. However, there is no doubt that the geopolitical conditions are not the best. As a company, we have always followed market diversification. Our strong presence in the UAE is driven by innovation, new products, reliability and quality and we are gaining an increase in market share over our competitors. As a global company we have to work harder to maintain our strong worldwide distribution network to mitigate the potential impact of a downturn in one particular region. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the ceramics industry?</h4><p>The global ceramic tiles market is projected to reach $125.32 billion by 2020 with a growth from 12.3 billion sqm in 2013 to 21.8 billion sqm by 2020. Traditionally, ceramics was only used in kitchens and bathrooms, but today ceramics is used everywhere; whether it is for cladding, indoor or outdoor, or substituting the use of natural wood, marble, stone, granite, and cement. The outlook is positive because ceramics is a superior product and the industry is continuing to see new investment.</p><h4>How has RAK ceramics contributed to Ras Al Khaimah's economic development?</h4><p>We are raising the flag of the UAE all over the world. We employ 15,000 employees globally and over 8,500 of these are living in Ras Al Khaimah, therefore contributing to the local economy.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>In the short term we will remain focused on the VCP and will continue to exit from non-core and non-strategic assets such as contracting activities and non-profitable businesses. We have already successfully completed many initiatives and the VCP is unlocking value across the business. We will continue to focus on expanding our core businesses and streamlining operations. In particular, expanding our high-margin sanitary ware and tiles businesses in focus markets of the UAE, India, Bangladesh, and Europe, developing improved integration across the business, streamlining our distribution networks, and unifying our brand positioning globally. It will be a challenging year, but I am confident that we have all the right plans in place to make it a successful one.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fresh Funds]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fresh-funds]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you start with a short introduction into the NSIA?</h4><p>The NSIA was established following the passage of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority Act 2011, an act passed by the National Assembly in May 26, 2011. The following year, the Minister of Finance at the time recruited the management team and facilitated the appointment of the Board, which was subsequently inaugurated in October 2012. The idea behind the NSIA was to have a governmental entity that manages excess revenues from crude oil sales in a manner that is transparent and directed at certain areas of the economy. The initiative was driven by the success of other sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Europe.</p><h4>How did you adapt the sovereign wealth fund structure to suit the specific needs of Nigeria?</h4><p>We got inspiration from Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kuwait, Norway, and Singapore, and from some states within the US; New Mexico, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas. Typically, these sovereign wealth funds have only two mandates, stabilization and savings for the future. The NSIA has three mandates. The first is to create a fund for stabilization, to act as a buffer against short-term macro-economic instability. The second is to create intangible equity for when crude oil does not exist anymore, a fund for the future generations. And the third is for investment in domestic infrastructure. We decided to include investment in domestic infrastructure to ensure that money was spent locally, because it seems counterintuitive to invest abroad when you have significant infrastructure challenges domestically. Right now, there are 87 sovereign wealth funds in the world and many more in the pipeline. In Africa, we have about eight functioning and more than 10 are being planned, from Kenya to Uganda, to Mozambique and so on. For us, it is important to show that we are fiscally disciplined, that we have a mechanism for managing the risk, and that we can also act as a catalytic investor to also bring other pools of capital into the country.</p><h4>We have seen very good results in the financial records of 2015; what investments did you make to generate that outcome?</h4><p>A significant portion of the returns are attributable to the Future Generations Fund (FGF). At the onset, the Board approved a Fund allocation ratio of  20% in the stabilization fund, 40% in the future generations fund, and 40% in the Nigeria infrastructure fund. We took the strategic decision to leave the stabilization portion at the minimum 20%, bearing in mind that the economy is so big that for the stabilization fund to be meaningful, it has to be in the range of north of $5 billion. As fresh funds come in, we will build up all three, but at the moment, we will make more of an impact today with the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund and the Future Generations Fund. For the Future Generations Fund, we decided to allocate the assets in the following manner, a quarter in global public equities, of which, a third is in developed markets, such as the US, Japan, Europe and two thirds are in developing markets, from Brazil to China. The second thing that we did was private equity, and we also split that roughly two thirds into secondary private equity and a third in primary private equity. In total, we have invested directly and indirectly 17 different currencies in 17 countries. </p><h4>In an environment like this where revenues from the government have been very much affected by the low oil prices, what roles is the stabilization fund playing?</h4><p>The stabilization fund is still too small. There is a tendency to expect too much too quickly. For example, most of the funds in the Middle East did nothing for 10 or 20 years, and likewise the Norwegian fund did not make any impact from stabilization perspective until recently. The NSIA fund has just started and it will take a long time before it will have a meaningful impact in this regard. The good news is that the current administration realizes this fact, and so in spite of the challenging environment it is looking at more assets for the sovereign wealth fund, and in 1H2016 it will invest $250 million more. The most important thing that a sovereign wealth fund needs to do is prove that it is run by capable managers and that it can add value to the economy.</p><h4>What projects will benefit the most from the infrastructure fund?</h4><p>We always dedicate a lot of time to decide which areas to invest in. Our investments are governed by a strategic framework. The framework is anchored on four pillars. Firstly, we only invest in projects that have a nationwide strategic impact. The second is that such investments must have the potential to attract other core investors, especially institutional investors. The third criteria is the ability of the investment to generate attract social and commercial returns. Lastly, our investments are made only when we ascertain that the legal and regulatory environment is adequate. The forth pillar is crucial because you do not want to make an investment and then the regulatory infrastructure changes. We narrowed the investable sectors down to five sectors namely; real estate, roads, power, agriculture, and healthcare. In the agriculture sector, the Fund for Agriculture Finance (FAFIN), one of the funds in which the NSIA is invested, made its first investment in a dairy farm in Kano. This year you will see us being more active in agriculture. In 2015, we signed a MoU with the Ogun State government and Lafarge to reforest 8,000ha of land that has been destroyed through deforestation. In real estate, we have been looking at housing and are developing a real estate co-investment fund with other investors and that should be completed by 2017. One of the things with housing is that there is a lack of mortgages in Nigeria, which makes it a challenging sub-sector. We are the largest shareholder in Nigeria Mortgage Refinancing Company. You will see us being a bit more active in 2016 in tourism real estate, an area that is massively underexplored in Nigeria. The NSIA was also part of the power sector privatization and we are waiting for completion of certain aspects of that process. In the coming weeks, we will announce one or two of our proposed investments in power. There are also things that we are doing in renewables, off-grid and imbedded power, but these things take time to develop, three or four years, and even seven in some cases. We are also involved with a few bridge projects such as the second Niger Bridge. That project is a capital-intensive investment of $750 million and is not due for completion until 2020. We are also involved in the Lagos Expressway. In healthcare, we have signed up 14 teaching hospitals and 13 medical centers to build PPP stations and the first three have already gotten off the ground with the execution of the necessary agreements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you anticipate growth to continue to come from Indonesia or are you also tapping into new markets?</h4><p>In becoming a regional destination, we cannot rely on just one country, despite the fact that typically about 60% of all medical travellers come from Indonesia. Indonesia has itself embarked on a path for national health insurance and we should therefore grow other markets such as the Middle East and CIS countries, as well as China, Bangladesh, Australia, and New Zealand. In each of these countries, we focus on offering niche treatments whereas in Indonesia we offer all treatments. Singapore is another country where we believe we can grow, as medical costs there are sky high. Singaporeans can utilize their Medisave in Malaysia, and are already doing so in hospitals like Regency and the IHH group of hospitals (Pantai and Gleneagles hospitals). For treatments that are not covered by Medisave, costs remain a push factor. On top of that we have medical travellers from the UK, Japan, Korea, India, and the US; however, these are often expats working in the region. We have offices abroad in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Dhaka, Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Yangon and we are also looking to set up in the Middle East, most likely in Saudi Arabia or the UAE. In healthcare, trust is important and therefore our physical presence overseas is necessary. In terms of numbers, we had 850,000 medical travellers last year, and we target 1 million for 2016. Total revenue in 2015 was more than MYR900 million, and for 2016, we target MYR1.3 billion. We want to drive the industry forward and aim high to push our boundaries.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about halal treatment, a new trend in medical tourism that is targeted at patients from the Gulf?</h4><p>Our value proposition in Malaysia is threefold: world-class quality, real time accessibility, and affordability. In addition, we have distinctive propositions that consider shared cultural values. Halal treatment is one such proposition, and fits into our tagline “quality care for your peace of mind." Food is the main issue here; however, it also entails halal medicine and halal service. All our hospitals focus on providing halal services, which include halal dietary provisions, halal services and halal medical products.</p><h4>How will the medical corridors Penang, Johor, and Malacca drive the industry forward?</h4><p>Penang has been a destination for medical travellers for many decades and is ahead in terms of promotion. The state is responsible for 50 to 60% of the total number of medical travellers coming into Malaysia; half of the patients in Penang hospitals are medical tourists. Penang has the whole ecosystem in place: excellent hospitals, an end-to-end service, and an active medical tourism association. We can learn from Penang and want to create similar hubs in other states. Malacca has experience with tourism influx. There is the Mahkota Medical Centre, which has been attracting medical travellers for some years. Malacca also has The Orchard, a unique healing hotel that provides preventive and recuperative healthcare and wellness treatments. These elements together give Malacca a strong value proposition for medical tourism. Johor Bahru is also a natural destination because of its proximity to Singapore and Indonesia. Our challenge in Johor was that we did not have hospitals with capacity previously. In the recent years, we have seen significant developments there, particularly with the opening of Gleneagles Medini and the growth of the Regency and KPJ hospitals. In general, when we choose areas to promote, we look at availability, existing hospitals and their capacity, and the overall tourism infrastructure. Our next destination would be Sabah and Sarawak, starting with Kota Kinabalu, where there is a strong appeal from China, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><h4>What does the MHTC offer its members?</h4><p>Our core function is promoting and facilitating medical travel in Malaysia. We are the point of contact for medical travellers selecting a destination. We only work with ISQUA-accredited hospitals and have in-depth knowledge of the expertise of our members on which we can advise objectively. Currently, we have 74 member facilities, of which we have selected 22 elite members. These facilities have the highest quality healthcare, are willing to invest in promotional activities, and often have a certain niche treatment to offer. We then promote accordingly. For example, Tropicana has a 66% success rate in IVF treatments compared to the world average of 50%. European countries have great healthcare; however, there we focus on treatments that are not covered by insurance or those with long waiting lists.</p><h4>You recently signed an agreement with Malaysian Airlines; what does this initiative entail?</h4><p>It is important to deliver end-to-end services for medical travellers and this includes as little transits as possible. We are exploring partnerships with providers along our value chain, which includes airlines as well as taxi services providers, like Uber and GrabCar. We believe Malaysia Airlines is a great fit as it is the national airline and also provides the Malaysian hospitality on which we pride ourselves. Within the agreement with Malaysia Airlines, we can offer preferential rates for medical travellers, have concierges ready at KLIA who wait for patients at the aerobridge, and arrange for patients to wait in transit lounges in several airports. We are also in talks with travel agencies to develop package deals that include dental treatment, city tour, and a few nights at five-star hotels. We have also signed an agreement with AirAsia for its excellent connectivity within the region, e.g. China, including direct flights into Penang from key major travel hubs in Asia. In addition, we are currently running a campaign called “Malaysia Loves You," bearing the tagline “Experience Malaysia Healthcare, embrace Malaysian hospitality," where we will give lucky winners and opportunity to experience world-class Malaysian healthcare and travel services for themselves. The grand prize for this campaign includes a full Malaysia Healthcare experience package that will feature top services from MHTC industry partners, including fully-sponsored round-trip flight tickets and a 5-day-4-night health holiday at one of Malaysia's leading health and wellness resorts for two.</p><h4>Is it difficult for medical centers in Malaysia to retain qualified staff?</h4><p>It is a natural movement of talent, and also means that medical staff from Malaysia are internationally recognized. Singapore has always been the traditional destination, where many of our Malaysian doctors practice. The industry is growing fast and creating a pull factor for medical staff, practitioners, and doctors. In Malaysia, we spend about 4.6% of our GDP—2.2% private and 2.4% public—on healthcare, and that is great. Ultimately, movement of talent is a fact of life, particularly in healthy economies, and as part of that spirit of competitiveness, Malaysia invests heavily in nurturing our domestic talent to ensure a sustainable supply of highly qualified healthcare professionals. As it stands, we have plenty of doctors; what we need are more specialists and as such, have implemented programs to re-attract Malaysians who went abroad, to some success.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the growth of the medical equipment industry?</h4><p>Medical equipment is indeed one of the fastest-growing industries in Malaysia. Both medical devices and consumables, such as rubber gloves, are major contributors to the sustainability of the health sector at large. The fact that these goods are produced locally has a spillover effect in that our medical centers do not need to import them, which supports our affordability factor. The industry is not under our mandate; however, when we travel abroad to promote our healthcare, we often discover potential new markets and collaborations for this industry.</p><h4>What are your goals for this year?</h4><p>We continue to drive promotion to become the number one medical travel destination in the region. The immediate objective here is to create awareness. We have been a hidden gem for too long and need to become more vocal about our expertise. One of the ways of doing this is to further enhance our digital marketing strategy. We want to become the top-of-mind medical travel destination by 2020. Another objective is international engagement. We want to increase our global presence in all of our target markets. We want not just “touch and go" engagement, but to promote ourselves and be more constantly visible. In countries like Bangladesh, we typically target high-end treatments; at the same time, we want to engage in CSR programs and support local hospitals with expertise and manpower. Such engagements help us build trust. Conversion is our ultimate objective. By 2020, we want total revenues of MYR4 billion in the sector as a whole, including the wellness and preventative healthcare, alternative healthcare, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We seek to grow the whole ecosystem, encompassing all peripheral industries and supporting services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas is MICITT currently focusing, and what is the role MICITT plays in Costa Rica's human capital and socio-economic development?</h4><p>The Ministry was created in 1990, and at the time we did not include the Telecommunication Vice-Ministry in our structure. That was created in 2009 and was then moved into this Ministry; so now we have science, technology, and telecommunications. Although we are not the regulator of telecommunications, we have important relationships with telecoms operators. We administer the use of the spectrum for wireless telecommunications, including radio, TV, cellular, and other types of communications in the country. Hence, we make policies on how that is used and administered. We also try to define public policy and investments in telecommunications, providing guidance for operators and other actors, guiding their investments in the country. The amount of resources the country has invested in science and technology has increased considerably. There are three main areas: R&amp;D, human capital development, and innovation. Those three areas work in synergy to enhance how Costa Rica can actually develop its R&amp;D ecosystem. In terms of developing human capital, we support programs and scholarships abroad for Costa Ricans. Right now, we have invested $35 million in scholarships for graduate degrees abroad, and those people will come back to Costa Rica to develop the R&amp;D ecosystem. The other area that R&amp;D serves is to develop the necessary ingredients for the ecosystem, from working with international companies to enhance the R&amp;D centers they already have in Costa Rica, to attracting FDI into Costa Rica's R&amp;D centers. The innovation aspect is crucial. Our innovation division works with SMEs to develop technology-based small companies, with entrepreneurs to develop SMEs based on science, technology, and innovation, trying to coach them, and in some cases scale them up so they can actually export. It is a successful program, because we invest in young entrepreneurs who provide ideas on how to develop SMEs based on science and technology; it is not just in ICT, but also in biotechnology and other areas.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the Science, Technology, and Innovation National Plan 2015-2021?</h4><p>That is a plan we developed in 2014 and part of 2015, and it was unveiled last year, covering 2015 to 2021. It is based on three pillars. The first pillar and main objective is to become a knowledge-based country. This involves human capital development, the creation of R&amp;D clusters, and the provision of a mature innovation system that can foster more entrepreneurship in the country. The R&amp;D part we have defined five priority areas: energy, agriculture and food, health, the environment, and education. We want to develop research projects that can solve Costa Rican problems in those five areas, things like climate change and water supply in the northwest part of the country. Hence, we are now investing our resources in five research projects worth $100,000 each in that part of the country. The idea is to direct and focus the investment we do in research projects so they can be used in applied research to solve specific problems the country is facing. We will eventually move into human health or energy.</p><h4>What is the status of internet access in the country affected by frozen rates, and how are MICITT and SUTEL cooperating?</h4><p>We work hand-to-hand with SUTEL, because it is the regulator and we are the directors of the industry. Therefore, we have to coordinate several actions in both directions. We are now auctioning part of the spectrum, for example, which is a combined effort between the two institutions. The investment has to go to universalizing the service in areas where the operators are not providing service, and that is being jointly coordinated with both institutions. So the relationship is very good, and we are investing that money in several projects around the country, while also coordinating other initiatives, like the transition to digital TV. The analog turn-off is set for December 15, 2017, and we are working with SUTEL on that too. As for frozen rates, it depends what kind of internet access. What are frozen are the tariffs on wireless communications in mobile, but not the fixed rates. The fixed-internet service with coaxial cables and fiber optics rate is not fixed. We are trying to foster competition so rates actually go down for the user, while SUTEL will fixes the rates for mobile. Many people in Costa Rica use the internet through their mobile; however, they can also access it through wired sources, and those rates are not fixed.</p><h4>The ICT sector currently contributes roughly 12.5% of the country's GDP. Do you expect this to grow?</h4><p>Yes, the auction we are doing now will help that figure grow, and public policy will enhance the amount of investment operators undertake to develop the 4G network or provide better bandwidth and service for users. Between 2011 and 2014, it grew quickly because of the opening of the market in 2008. It will still grow, but now that the market has stabilized it will not grow as fast, but will grow nevertheless. </p><h4>How would the Ministry assess the opportunities for private investment, both domestic and foreign, in the ICT sector?</h4><p>Costa Rica is a great destination for foreign investment in IT and ICT in general. Many software and IT companies, such as Intel, HP, and IBM, have done well in Costa Rica and their operations have been successful, employing thousands of people. We hope and expect that other companies and brands will come to Costa Rica to hire our engineers. We hope to attract more companies from Europe and Asia to invest in Costa Rica. We are talking with authorities in other countries to attract them here, working hand to hand with the Ministry of Economics and Foreign Trade, going to countries that are interested in investing here, setting up services and R&amp;D centers here in Costa Rica, and asking them what they need from us for them to do this. We have one of the best public education systems in the world, and perhaps the best in Latin America, including universities. So we have the quality engineers and talent. But what we lack is the number of engineers to bring to big companies that employ 1,000 people or over. We are a small country after all. So we have to see how we can provide more engineers for that particular sector. We work closely with universities to achieve this goal and address these issues. We meet with the rectors of all universities almost on a weekly basis to discuss this.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's top priorities for 2017?</h4><p>We want to see how we could work with local operators and foreign investors to enhance the broadband network in Costa Rica. The opening of the market in 2008 has been successful in terms of providing wireless services mostly to mobile phones. Most people access the internet from their phones. But a fiber optic-based, countrywide broadband network at affordable prices could give people broadband internet connections in people's homes. That is what we want to push forward in the coming year: providing accessible and affordable service for all homes in Costa Rica. In terms of internet speed, we are ranked 104 in the world right now; that should not be the case. South Korea is number one, and they did it by bringing fiber optics to homes at affordable prices, which is what we want to do here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the capital markets in Lebanon over the last year?</h4><p>There are many highlights worth mentioning. First, we are ready to launch a new set of regulations that include the license and registration, business conduct, market conduct, collective investment schemes, listing requirements, and more core regulations for the proper functioning of the system. Another major thing that happened since the last time we met was that the government decided to move forward on the much delayed privatization process of the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE). Should the cabinet approve this within a month as we expect it to, we should have a new board for the BSE with new functions to ensure that the transfer of the existing stock exchange to the new stock exchange is smooth and without major obstacles when moving forward with the privatization process. As members of the newly formed transitional stock exchange board, the CMA will closely cooperate on due diligence efforts, evaluation, the RFP, and overseeing the bidding for privatization. In a parallel endeavor, we also moved ahead to launch an electronic trading platform (ETP) to attract SMEs, startups, bond traders, currency exchange managers, and the like to this platform. With these two things coming at the same time, we are sure that the ETP could be a service within the BSE to make things much more efficient.</p><h4>The BSE has one of the lowest penetration rates in the region and is also one of the least diverse. How will privatization change this?</h4><p>The success of any stock exchange is in its depth and breadth. We do not have that today. We haven't listed a company for the past 15 years since there is no excitement about it; the BSE is not dynamic, and the younger generations are unaware of the possibilities to list their companies. This trend happened mainly due to the outdated regulatory system we had and the small level of capitalization of the stock exchange, which deterred investors from coming. That is the reason why we gave priority to creating a proper regulatory framework that reflects a solid and promising system. On the supply side, we believe that there are many companies out there that can be attracted to the BSE and we have solid family businesses and great SMEs performing even at regional levels. Also on the supply side, there are a few government-owned entities such the telecoms operators, Middle East Airlines, and the Casino Du Liban to name a few, that could create a major shift in the capitalization of the BSE once listed. On the demand side, entities interested in bidding for ownership of the new exchange should be able to ensure the ability to become market makers. The license will require that bidders show substantial financial capabilities and a successful track record in the business. Local banks and financial institutions alike have showed interest in participating in the bid for both the BSE and the ETP. Furthermore, we are hoping that the government will participate in the success of the new BSE, first by listing some state-owned institutions and by considering to offer some tax incentive packages to encourage listing and investing in the stock market.</p><h4>Would the lack of awareness about the capital markets explain the underdevelopment of this sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Absolutely. The privatization of the BSE has been long due, and that would have prompted awareness about the capital markets. Today we have created the ecosystem and regulatory framework. Companies and institutions are more confident now that we have a regulatory system that will work. We are building on the potential of a fully fledged stock exchange that will be attractive enough for any Lebanese company to be interested in being listed. Globally, research has estimated that the stock market growth and the long-term real growth rate in GDP is a one-to-one relationship, i.e., stock market growth of one-third would increase real economic growth by one-third. Through a successful usage of the stock exchange we can achieve a reduction in the government's debt-to-GDP ratio from 140% to a more acceptable figure. It is common knowledge that Lebanon has a strong, healthy financial system where banks, insurance, and financial corporations perform well even during adverse moments. Now we have the opportunity to complement our financial system with a well-functioning stock exchange. The long-term objective of the CMA would be to grow and develop the capital markets in order to strike a healthy balance between a debt-based financial system and capital markets-based financial system. </p><h4>Many Lebanese companies are listed on foreign stock exchanges but are not traded in Lebanon. Is there a strategy to bring them back?</h4><p>This is exactly what we are trying to do. First, from a supply-side perspective, the number of active financial brokerage firms was limited as there are certain barriers, one of them being the minimum capital required to license a financial intermediary, which is $1.6 million for the lowest tier and goes up to $5 million. Our new regulations have dissected the activities of capital markets into five categories: dealing, managing, advising, custody, and arranging. This move will reduce the minimum capital requirement from $1.6 million to as little as $100,000 depending on the category selected. We are confident that this will create an infrastructure of focused professional financial institutions that could help increase the appetite of local firms to trade and list on the BSE. I am also confident that this new procedure will attract many of the high caliber Lebanese diaspora financial professionals to set up base back in the country.</p><h4>Most people look to commercial banks rather than the capital markets. Will an increase in the latter be detrimental to the activities of the former?</h4><p>As mentioned earlier, we have a financial system that is purely debt based. And while banks today have reached close to 100% of GDP in terms of lending, capital adequacy ratios are on the rise. As such, lending through banks will become more expensive and thus contribute negatively to the economy in the longer term. A viable source of accessing capital would have to be through the capital markets, therefore shifting the current financial system from a debt-based to a capital markets-based system. And to answer your question, as to whether flourishing capital markets are detrimental to the banks, the answer is no; it is the banks themselves that are better positioned to champion such a shift in the system.</p><h4>Do you see privatization coming in a certain time frame?</h4><p>Seeing and hoping are two different things. We hope it will come soon, and we are very close to that. I can firmly say the BSE will be subsequently privatized, so change is imminent. My guess is that I will happen within the next 12 months or even less. I am very positive about the future of capital markets in the country; you have at one hand a solid regulator, banks and financial institutions that are ready to play an active role in the capital markets, and companies that have so much to benefit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In Mozambique, agriculture provides a livelihood to 81% of the population, but less than 10% of households sell their surpluses. In your opinion, what initiatives could be implemented to bring smallholder farmers into the value chain?</h4><p>The Mozambique picture is actually representative of the large majority of sub-Saharan African countries. Throughout the region, smallholder producers are facing major obstacles that prevent them from integrating into value chains. The most important reason for this is the small size of their farms and their low level of productivity. For example, the average size of most smallholder family farms is 1ha or less, while their average crop yields are less than one-third of similar smallholders in Southeast Asia. This small-scale production does not lead to significant surpluses for marketing beyond home consumption. Furthermore, even when farmers do produce surpluses, the high transaction costs and the challenge to comply with strict requirements and standards demanded by modern agricultural value chains limits access to the market. African smallholder farmers that sell surpluses from their harvest typically receive less than 20% of the consumer price, largely due to high transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and the profit margins charged by middlemen. This in turn reduces farmer incentives to grow more food for the market. Governments can help bridge this gap by investing in and maintaining the infrastructure and logistics that would help to reduce these transaction costs. They can also remove trade barriers and adopt price policies that do not unfairly penalize small farmers in order to benefit urban consumers. There is an urgent need for adaptive research aimed at improving agricultural productivity and production, and to build capacity and infrastructure throughout the value chain.</p><h4>Infrastructure such as power, transport links, and storage facilities are key pillars of food security. What role can the private sector play in developing this infrastructure?</h4><p>Africa's vast infrastructure deficit is a major constraint on its economic growth and seriously impacts food and nutrition security. Governments do have a crucial role to play, establishing and maintaining critical infrastructure and providing appropriate regulatory frameworks. Where the private sector can help address infrastructure related constraints is through complementary innovative financing and public private partnerships. Many countries have set up investment agencies that help facilitate private investment in infrastructure projects. In partnership with governments, businesses can build feeder roads to reduce transportation costs, improve storage facilities to enable aggregation of farm produce, and invest in processing equipment that helps smallholders achieve quality standards and improve their market access. Companies must understand that creating value for the countries and communities in which they operate is in their own long-term business interest.</p><h4>Mobile and digital technologies have become increasingly available across sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in Tanzania there are over 34 million active SIMs out of a population of 47 million, according to the latest census, and likewise in Ghana mobile data penetration almost doubled to 16.1 million from March 2013 to March 2015. What role can this technology play in empowering farmers?</h4><p>In addition to the Tanzania and Ghana experiences mentioned, it is also worthwhile to refer to the M-Pesa mobile banking system in Kenya and the E-Wallet for supply and distribution of subsidized inputs in Nigeria. Digital technologies are rapidly changing the face of African agriculture. They provide great opportunities to integrate previously isolated smallholders into food systems. Through mobile devices and apps, African farmers can access up-to-date knowledge and information that is vital to their business, including weather forecasts, advice on best agronomic practices, and market prices for crops. Digital solutions should play a greater role in helping smallholders access critical inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, credit, and insurance to help raise their productivity and improve food and nutrition security.</p><h4>In Nigeria, there are big local players such as Dangote and BUA Group, which are strengthening local food production capacity in rice, sugar, and flour, industrializing the sector, and reducing the country's food import bill. Do you forecast a trend of more big industrialists going into the business of farming? </h4><p>The size of the food and agribusiness sector is growing rapidly in Africa and could grow to a trillion-dollar market by 2030. It is expected that this expanding market opportunity will encourage more of the large local and international players to go into agriculture-related businesses. What is important though is that larger companies develop partnerships with smallholder farmers, as they are the key to unlocking Africa's agricultural potential. In addition to making significant contribution to national socio-economic development, it makes good business sense for big companies to share access to markets, technology, and knowledge to help smallholder farmers turn their subsistence farms into profitable businesses. This is exactly what the Kofi Annan Foundation is promoting through its African Food Systems Initiative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[moving-swiftly]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do banks play in attracting foreign investment into national projects?</h4><p>This year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Bank of Industry &amp; Mine, as in 1956 we were the first development bank in Iran to be established. Although we have experienced a lot of challenges during these years, we have always stuck to the vision of progress and development of the country. In this regard, we are not a commercial bank; we mainly participate in the financing of different projects. We have the human capital, the knowledge, and the experience to conduct projects in all types of industries, except agriculture and housing. We are experts in a wide range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, textiles, food processing, the auto industry, home appliances, mining, steel mills, cement, and tile manufacturing. Moreover, Iran is famous for its oil and gas resources. We are among the top-three countries in the world reserve wise, production wise, and, hopefully, after sanctions, export wise. We would like to focus on those areas where Iran has a competitive advantage, and the energy sector is definitely one of the areas we can rely on. Our portfolio is quite strong in financing projects in the petrochemicals field.</p><h4>Which are the most important projects you have financed?</h4><p>In the past two-and-a-half years, we have focused on infrastructure with the expansion of the rail network. The first high-speed train developed in Iran between Tehran and Isfahan was financed by the Bank of Industry &amp; Mine. We have also been awarded with a contract to finance another high-speed train between Tehran and Mashhad. We have been involved in power generation as well, the first bank to financing power plants in Iran. This is a very good market for foreign investors, as we need to develop 3,000 MW in power generation annually. Moreover, we have financed desalination plants in the Persian Gulf. That sort of megaproject could be duplicated in the coming years, and we welcome other banks to join us to form a syndication for financing. Ports like Jask or Chabahar would be export terminals for the globe and neighboring countries. We want to be considered the developers of the country, and that is why the market share in the industry and mining sector is over 16%.</p><h4>What is the position of the bank to resume relations with European banks?</h4><p>After sanctions, the door has been opened but not as fast as we expected. The bank was prepared to meet the international standards of the world's banking system even before sanctions, which makes me believe we are pioneers in this sense. At the same day of the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016, we were the first bank to be reconnected to the SWIFT network. We have resumed correspondent banking relations with 38 different banks from 18 different countries, and other 22 banks are in the pipeline. Among European banks, Italy took the lead, and Germany will surpass it within the next two months. We are doing normal business with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. We are a major shareholder of the European-Iranian Bank (EiH), a strong bank based in Hamburg, which since the first day started to reestablish relations with Iranian banks. This is a good tool to facilitate relations with European firms. After being forced to be out of the market, we are back to contribute to the business of Iran and the region, as there are a lot of opportunities in neighboring countries to cooperate with European companies. We can play a great role in connecting those firms to these countries, and Iran could be a platform for doing business and helping in the prosperity of the region and the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for this year?</h4><p>It is a must for any bank in Iran to meet Basel III standards, and this means achieving a capital adequacy ratio over 12%. In this regard, we have a plan for increasing capital, and today the first phase of $330 million has been concluded. I am looking for another $1 billion capital increase, which will be reached at the beginning of 2017. As the main source for development bank is the capital, this will encourage a lot of banks in the world banking community to rely on our financial statements and join us in syndicated projects. I have good signs from Japanese and Chinese banks to enter the Iranian market, but also from Italians and Germans. We have a revolving three-year strategy plan, and every year we review it so it gives us a realistic picture for the future. We have learned from our failures and we are not going to give up.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What developments have characterized the last year for KAMCO?</h4><p>A key issue for KAMCO was to maintain operational growth and profitability in a difficult operating environment. It has been a tough year for us, but we are proud to have been able to grow our core activities and maintain our profitability during a tough time. Our asset management activities in terms of portfolios and funds are beating benchmarks and growing in size. Despite losses in the markets and falling values, we have been able to raise new money and expand our products regionally, which has added more diversification to our return portfolio. We have also been cautious on the equity markets and that has helped us weather the volatility. On the investment banking side, we have been quite successful in winning announced mandates, especially on the debt side, which has helped us position KAMCO among the top regional lead managers and book runners in GCC and MENA Bonds.</p><h4>Do you see an increasing role in debt markets and issuances in Kuwait, and how do you see the spread in your advisory activities?</h4><p>When we look at debt markets, we see that the financial institutions are looking at strengthening their capital base. Accordingly, our investment banking team continues to lead in this space on every transaction announced in Kuwait. The time comes with a wealth of expertise and track record, managing to successfully execute over 87 transactions since inception as of March 31, 2016, valued at over $12.5 billion. We have been active and closed the first investment grade rated Tier 2 private bond in the last quarter of 2015 for NBK and during the first quarter of 2016, we acted as one of the joint lead managers (JLMs) for Burgan Bank's KWD100 million, subordinated Tier 2, Basel III-compliant bonds. KAMCO was also one of the lead managers in Kuveyt Türk's Tier 2 capital-boosting sukuk, $350 million issuance, and we were one of the few JLMs on it. During the second quarter, KAMCO also acted as Joint Lead Managers for Gulf Bank's successful issuance of its first public issuance, a 10 years non-callable before 5 years, Tier 2 Basel III - compliant subordinated bond for a total of KD 100 million. We consider ourselves leaders in the debt capital markets and are involved in a number of restructurings, debt restructurings, and capital restructurings for private-sector clients. We see the debt market continuing to grow and we are also looking at possibilities with sovereigns looking at the debt market and how we can be involved with the private sector in Kuwait regionally and internationally. On the advisory side, we are looking at increased activity on the M&amp;A side, increased activity on the advisory side, and with advisory, I am referring to considerations for privatizations and restructurings within the private sector. On the capital market side there will be a variety of activities, especially on the debt capital markets. Liquidity is available in the market; however, poor investor sentiment has reduced activity, which implies that activity and interest has gone down in capital markets. Therefore, while there is liquidity, there is also a lack of confidence and poor investor sentiment at present. The reason behind poor investor sentiment is the fear impact from low oil prices affecting future revenue growth while putting pressure on a yet oil based economy. With highly oil-dependent economies, falling revenues are expected, which has incited the government to expedite a diversification of its investment activities and structure into other areas. What will help investor sentiment is actually a push in much-needed infrastructure spending and expenditure in sectors such as in healthcare, education, housing, transportation, and logistics. In addition, there remains a strong consumer base and sector, which will help improve as sentiments go up. There are two stories there, the first being the negative impact on revenue and expense control, and the second on developing and spending in the country. Kuwait is placed in a strong position in terms of liquidity, which has been reflected by the country maintaining its high credit ratings. The negative outlook is based on the premise that we will have to see what happens with this reform and spending the government intends to undertake in clarity. In addition, we are in a transitional phase with the markets because Kuwait intends to shift the capital market from a frontier to an emerging market within the coming two years. Now, for that to be done, a national effort is needed with significant collaborative work between the public and private sector, which is already underway. That transitional phase will result in a better market, new instruments, foreign money inflows, more possibilities for listing of companies, and new instruments in the capital market with better growth and positive prospects. This transitional phase is a crucial phase given that the Kuwaiti market is an older market with now outdated systems and traditional ways of doing business, which is transitioning into a newer model at par with international standards. The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has done a great job in changing this, even though there is more work to be done and collaborations, and we are proud to be a part of that in different capacities.</p><h4>How do you approach business around the region and how do you plan to diversify out of Kuwait?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we were focused on Kuwait, and since the past post-financial crisis years we have extended our product line and services further within the region, investing more into regional areas, real estate, fixed income, and equities. In addition, we obtained our license to open and operate an office in the DIFC area in Dubai, UAE. We believe that the DIFC's solid growth and stable platform make it the ideal hub for KAMCO to access emerging markets in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA). We are also looking at other areas in the region, currently focusing on the MENA region in particular. However, we will also venture into international markets and real estate, looking actively at real estate opportunities internationally. In addition to that, we are also about to launch an international sharia-compliant product. For example, the KAMCO Real Estate Yield Fund (KREYF) recently acquired approximately 16,500sqm of commercial real estate in the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The property consists of storage space rented by one of the leading retail companies in the region, is a key element in KREYF's core strategy to increase revenue while achieving the best returns for investors in the fund. The Fund reached a weighted average occupancy rate of 93% and has grown in size by 195% since inception, which demonstrates the market demand for such income-generating products despite the negative sentiment and poor economic conditions. In addition to that, the Fund managed to increase its rate of return since inception to 7.4% and continues to strongly give returns above the highest deposit rates on a quarterly basis.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>It will be a better year than 2016. We had a tough 2015 and a tougher 2016 than expected. Yet, we expect 2017 to be a better year as companies become more efficient and focused on their activities. As the oil sector stabilizes, investor sentiments are likely to bounce back. Moreover, when you instigate privatization, you allow the private sector to have a larger role in performing business activities more efficient and modern way. Privatization in Kuwait will need to have a consensus in regulatory framework on the governmental side. Thus, the parliament and Kuwaiti government will have to build a consensus evolving the plan for privatization and set key objectives while creating a win-win situation for society and business in general. The gridlock between the government and parliament is being addressed successfully, allowing for more efficient privatizations moving forward. The entities to be privatized have to be properly regulated and organized under fair parameters to achieve a win-win situation for all, with companies achieving profits in the long run while improving efficiency and user satisfaction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent do you highlight the investment potential in Malaysia's agricultural sector?</h4><p>When we started in 1969, the economy was more oriented toward agriculture and less toward manufacturing. Currently, the manufacturing sector has a much larger contribution to the economy. Nonetheless, we have consolidated our strengths, which include the plantation and commodity-based industries. We want to be an enabler for investments in the downstream area, and are creating a number of facilities to foster investment in this area. We cooperate with universities and R&amp;D centres to develop biomass and biofuel, for example. All in all, the net worth of private investments after 2011 was MYR802.5 billion, in current value. On average, it was MYR160.5 billion per annum, surpassing our MYR148 billion target.</p><h4>How will MIDA participate in enacting the plans proposed by the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, and “re-engineering growth for greater prosperity" in particular?</h4><p>We are very much involved in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and have identified our so-called “3+2 formula." The first three are the catalytic sub-sectors—chemical, electrical and electronics, and machinery and equipment industry. The other two areas with high-growth potential are aerospace and medical devices. These sub-sectors were selected due to their strong inter-linkages to other sub-sectors and will support the overall growth of the manufacturing sector in the country. We also look at the services sector—ICT, oil and gas, healthcare, higher education, tourism, halal, as well as construction and professional services. Another focus is on smart manufacturing. Industries must adopt smart manufacturing as quickly as possible because we believe the future is all about connectivity. This will require using software, devices, and smart machines. Our manufacturing sector is transforming to embark on this path. We work with relevant agencies and form strategic thrusts to advance them. We cannot continue the old patterns. Every country has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we study the competitive advantages of Malaysia in every sector. The three sectors i.e. electrical and electronics, machinery and equipment, and chemicals have helped us as the products from these areas cut across sectors. Integrated Circuit Design crosses sectors from electronics to aviation, and such multi-purpose segments are crucial for us. Machinery cuts across all sectors, but the machines that are built today must be smart and must be usable through the Internet of Things. In terms of chemicals, Malaysia is still a net oil and gas exporter. We pump more than 600,000 barrels of oil a day, and this will last us another 25 years or so. For gas, we have around 80 tcf for another 35 years. In terms of downstream, there are tremendous opportunities for many industries using raw materials, for example the packaging and plastics industries. These three are the core, and we want to focus on them. We do not just visit companies and encourage them to get involved but we come up with the right and attractive incentives to entice them further.</p><h4>What is MIDA's perspective and goals for aerospace?</h4><p>We have the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint, and it is also further reinforced in the 11th Malaysia Plan. This hinges on the demand for future aeroplanes in Asia and the Pacific. We expect to see a great deal of manufacturing and service providers; therefore, we have to be closer to the market. Malaysia is well positioned in terms of new infrastructure and facilities that we have developed over the years. We see aerospace as a growth sector in Malaysia and have been successful at attracting MRO, for example. Malaysia is presently a home to global aerospace players such as Spirit AeroSystems, GE Engine, Aerospace Composite, Honeywell, Hamilton Sundstrand, Airbus Helicopters, and Messier-Bugatti-Dowty. Not lagging behind are Malaysian companies like SME Aerospace, CTRM Aero Composite, Sepang Aircraft Engineering, Airod, and Asia Aero-Technic, which have demonstrated their capabilities in meeting the stringent demands of OEMs.</p><h4>Is the medical equipment industry becoming more technical?</h4><p>Traditionally, it focuses on the manufacturing of medical gloves. However, today the industry has evolved with latest technologies whereby we see development in new products such as cardiovascular devices, orthopaedic devices, and imaging equipment with a growing number of facilities in Penang and Selangor.  We have big names like B. Braun, St. Jude, Boston Scientific, and Abbott in Malaysia and have been receiving interest from local and foreign companies. Some will invest in greenfield projects, others look for Malaysian companies to outsource their production or to undertake joint-venture projects.</p><h4>How do you assess the impact of the recently signed TPP Agreement on the Malaysian manufacturing industry? Do you adapt your strategy accordingly?</h4><p>We have been building these ecosystems not only through Malaysia's supply chain and infrastructure but our trading network expands to many other countries. Our manufacturers need to upgrade themselves and prepare for a potential increase in trade volume and investments. As such, we are already intensifying efforts to improve our facilitation, our rules and regulations, as well as the infrastructure and talent pool. Malaysia has 30 million people, a relatively small figure. Most foreign investors that come here look at bigger perspectives; ASEAN has 620 million people. Malaysia is a good start for further growth into Southeast Asia, or the larger Asia Pacific region. In terms of agreements between countries, we have the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and the TPP; therefore, the business environment is only getting better. It is the right moment to put your cards on Malaysia.</p><h4>Malaysia is taking the driver's seat in the halal industry, especially in terms of Islamic finance. What is MIDA's strategy?</h4><p>Malaysia is a reference point for the halal industry. It started with our Islamic finance many years ago, and we have been promoting the World Halal platforms for many years. At the World Halal Summit in 2016, Malaysia attracted quite a bit of attention for its halal investments and we even discussed some investment proposals. In 2017, we will mark 50 years of Malaysia providing infrastructure development such as industrial estate services. Malaysia can be a growth catalyst for the halal industry in the region. The halal supply chain can be extended to other countries, to source for raw materials, for example.</p><h4>Do the fluctuations of the ringgit affect your strategy?</h4><p>Predicting currency volatility is beyond anyone's control. Either way someone stands to gain from these fluctuations. Malaysia's gross national income has seen a 50% increase between 2009 and 2015. We created 1.8 million jobs in the country. FDI grew by 22% per annum. The exports sector is also doing well at 6.7%. The trade surplus widened to MYR7.5 billion in January, making it the 220th consecutive month of trade surplus since November 1997. These are good factors, reflecting the vibrant capital markets of the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Malaysia is in a good position; our economy is resilient. Last year was a tough year. China still shows no signs of recovery, and Japan basically has a 0% growth rate. Singapore is somewhere between 1 and 2%, and plans to approach 3% in its new budget. Malaysia is at 4-4.5%, the US at 2.3%, and Europe less than 1%—globally there are challenges. Commodity prices are volatile but fortunately they play a relatively small part in the Malaysian economy, representing just 11-12% of total exports. Manufacturing is a larger component and it depends on how much companies can withstand the drop in oil prices. I am more optimistic about the manufacturing sector particularly aerospace and medical devices. The Malaysian ringgit has strengthened, which is a positive sign. We have taken the necessary steps to put the country on the right footing. We implemented the necessary policies in times of challenging economic volatilities. We achieved 5% growth in 2015 and this year, we expect it to be between 4 and 4.5%. So far, investment interest in Malaysia's economy has not diminished, so we will have another good year. Taking into account the global economic environment, we have a good chance of achieving our growth target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tigo has more than 30 years in operation under different brand names. How has the company evolved over time?</h4><p>Amnet—as Tigo was previously known—and now Tigo have always been at the forefront of telecommunications in Costa Rica. It was one of the first major pay-TV companies here and one of the first to provide a broadband service when the market opened up in 2009. Our parent company, Millicom, came into the picture in 2008 when it acquired Amnet in the region. At that time, Millicom was just a mobile telephone company; however, it realized the market would switch in terms of products. Millicom thus looked at opportunities and realized Amnet was a strong company in the region. Since the acquisition in 2008, we have really pushed our business, especially in Costa Rica, to start incorporating higher broadband speeds and take the lead in the market. We have been the leaders in terms of broadband speeds for the last six or seven years. In 2010, we opened our B2B unit and improved our internet and data services in the region. For Millicom, this move was a strong bid in terms of how the market would evolve and we have seen our investment grow well in the region, especially in Costa Rica. We see Costa Rica as the most advanced and developed market in the region. We test new fixed products and developments as well as higher speeds and services in Costa Rica and then roll those out to the rest of the region.</p><h4>What strategy do you follow to achieve successful results?</h4><p>We always look to provide more value to our customers. We are always the first service provider to bring in new developments, like we did with digital television and high-definition television. We have the strongest offering in digital channels. Now, we are moving toward multiple screen products in the region with Tigo Play and other developments to come in a few months. We also recognized that the end game is basically broadband; therefore, we invested a great deal in high-speed broadband and bringing the best quality service to our customers. We design our products and approach the various areas of our business not just to sell, but also to first find out what the need is. We look at what the best fit is between what we have to offer and what our customers need. Our main aim, especially in B2B, is to become our clients' business partner, not a service provider. In this way, we can provide services in addition to the traditional internet and data services. We can provide solutions for different needs to all industries.</p><h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica to the whole group?</h4><p>For us, Costa Rica has the particular characteristic of being our only operation where we do not have mobile services. Therefore, it is a testing ground where we can try new services and products. Costa Rica also has the most advanced telecommunications market. There are a whole range of competitors here, including a strong state-owned company, strong local players, and large telecommunications companies. You also have other companies that have not traditionally been part of the telecommunications business; for example, they were mainly in electricity, though they are now developing products. Therefore, it is a highly competitive market where you find all kinds of products, making it a great market to try new things in.</p><h4>What can you tell us about your social responsibility initiatives?</h4><p>We work to be a great partner to the government and the country to close the digital gap. Hence, in everything we do we try to leverage our abilities to close that gap. We know from our experience in other countries that great internet services and penetration are directly linked to social development. Everything we do in terms of CSR is driven by our goal of closing that gap to improve the quality of life for Costa Ricans. We are fully involved in Child Online Protection programs and we also do some social service work every few months where our own staff go to schools and help out. In line with what we do in our business, we are aggressive in terms of providing great services that are leveraged and linked to our Internet services. We strongly believe that a well-connected country and society will have an improved quality of life.</p><h4>How do you foresee the company evolving in the medium term?</h4><p>We aim to keep leading the market in our residential products as well as in our B2B unit. B2B is a market that is still young in the sense that it was served by the state-owned company for decades. It is now in a transition to move toward private services as well. Tigo will be a stronger player there. We have a number of innovations in the pipeline that will help us grow as we are planning to. We will also become a stronger ally of the government in terms of closing that digital gap.</p><h4>What goals would Tigo like to achieve over the next year and beyond?</h4><p>We want to continue incorporating more broadband services into our customer base. We also want to grow our digital television base. This is a market that has traditionally had analog television products and we are now trying to show the market that digital products have many benefits. Costa Rica has one of the highest smartphone penetration rates in the region. This makes the country fertile ground for multiple-screen products. In terms of cable television, we have a strong base in our Direct-To-Home (DTH) product that will basically bring services to rural areas. That will increase our market share.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the biggest challenges facing Thailand's fishing industry?</h4><p>We are reforming the entire fishery industry, namely not just traditional fishing, but aquaculture, inland fishing, and fisheries outside of Thai waters. We oversee and reform the entire industry, including imports and exports, which are crucial to Thailand's output. For example, although Thailand is the biggest exporter of canned tuna, we in fact import most of our tuna and there is a whole process there to manage, which eventually has a great impact on global seafood stockpiles. Lately our industry has been under fire from some key markets, such as the EU, which threatens to ban fish imports from us if we do not properly regulate the industry and stamp out illegal fishing practices. For us the reforms are not purely about regulating the market; it is about the concept behind the regulation and our philosophy. This is important because it is not just the structure that needs to be changed, but also the way we approach our work and support our people. For example, one issue that has been frequently raised is licensing and ensuring that all fishing activities are approved with the necessary licenses. While this is a crucial aspect to regulating the industry, it is very important to remember that across Thailand we have millions of subsistence farmers who go out fishing simply to feed their families or their immediate communities. It is impossible to force these people to abide by the same, strict regulatory process that was designed for big businesses. We therefore need to change the way we understand and better utilize our fisheries' potential rather than just throwing regulations at the problem.</p><h4>What will these reforms include?</h4><p>With the new law, under the Royal Ordinance on Fisheries, we have made it clear we need to use the best scientific information to manage our industry, such as the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), which is a reference point to calculate how much fish can be collected from the sea every year. From that, we can accurately decide how to approach the issue and how many fishing licenses to issue each year. This is the new concept and the way forward, and from there we can build on our new system. There will be more transparency because, right now, one of the biggest issues is simply accounting for all the vessels, the number of workers they have onboard, the gear they use, and so on. Then there is the second stage of the process, which involves permission to go to the port and sell fish at landing sites. We will have a new system to report how much and the types of fish that are collected from each trip and, after that, a system to track whether the fish makes its way to the market, the factory, or is intended straight for export; we want to track everything in what we call the traceability system. We also consider equipment such as fingerprints and face scanners, which will help us monitor the labor situation. In recent years, issues such as labor abuses and migrant workers have drawn a great deal of criticism for Thailand's fishing industry and we are determined to stamp out all illegal activity. However, it is important to note this issue does not necessarily fall under our scope and is more relevant to the Ministry of Labor or the Department of Immigration.</p><h4>Has this become an issue of national importance?</h4><p>Yes, it has. We have two problems—the illegal unreported unregulated (IUU) issue and the labor issue—that everyone keeps conflating. These are in fact two different issues with different regulations but most often people assume that if you are doing IUU fishing you also do human trafficking or forced labor. We know we have problems in the fishery sector so we try to solve both problems together although they require different kinds of regulations, enforcements, and so on. As mentioned, the aim is not to throw red tape and regulations at the industry until businesses cannot survive anymore. We regulate to support our businesses and make sure they are doing a better job, which will help them reach new heights in the world. There are many key players who in fact do things by the book and this is all about eliminating the ones who cheat the system, undercut their workers, and bring down the reputation of our country. Right now we try to promote the new system and concept for smaller companies and independent fishermen and get them to understand that it is good to be in the system as it is clean, efficient, and protects people from exploiting the market. In the system if they have good accessibility, they will also benefit from marketing their products properly as today the average consumer is involved with the origins of their food, i.e., how safe it is and so on. As such this issue is definitely of vital national importance as a significant contributor to Thailand's exports and with millions of livelihoods at stake.</p><h4>What is your expectation for the fishing industry and do you think Thailand will overcome these challenges?</h4><p>The quicker we move with enacting and implementing these reforms, the better it will be. If you look at history, many countries, including Japan and Europe, have struggled to reform their fishery industries and it was a very gradual process. We do not have that luxury; we do not have time to do it and we also do not have much money to do it. Thailand is a diverse economy so we simultaneously need to invest and develop many sectors, and not just fisheries. However, the government sees the significance of the fishery sector so it gives us attention and as much resources as it can allocate so we try to move as fast as we can and in the most efficient way. We have outlined our strategy and plans to restructure the way things are done, both here in the department, and out at sea. If we succeed in doing this in an effective timeframe, I am more than confident that Thailand will continue to boast one of the biggest fishing industries in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-a-mission]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of the government's main goals this year is to diversify the economy. What role could the NEPC play in this objective?</h4><p>We are at a very critical period in Nigeria's history. In 2014 our revenue from oil was $70 billion, while in 2015 it was $40 billion. We know we need to diversify the economy. NEPC is the agency of the federal government with a mandate to do this. Our mission is to spearhead the diversification of the Nigerian economy by expanding and increasing non-oil exports for sustainable and inclusive growth. Our vision is to make the world a marketplace for Nigerian non-oil products. The Council's strategic objective is to diversify the productive base of the Nigerian economy away from oil and foster a market-oriented, private sector-driven economy. Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa and we are a resilient people with the strength to endure these hardships, but to do this we also need to prepare for the future by reducing reliance on oil. The change is already underway.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the Zero Oil Plan?</h4><p>We have identified national strategic export sectors to replace oil revenue. We had certain criteria in choosing those sectors: the size of that sector globally needed to be traded at a volume above $20 billion; the degree of complexity involved in the sector; and our own natural ability and comparative advantage as a country. Petrochemicals and methanol is a $150 billion business annually, and despite Nigeria being an oil-producing country, we import these refined petrochemical products. We need to build modular refineries and small petrochemical plants all over the country to take advantage of this export potential. We also looked at soya beans and soya milk and oil, which represents a $100 billion market annually. We looked at sugar; raw, cane, and confectionary. We looked at cotton and yams. Once we had the best textiles in the world and our leather and hides are internationally renowned. We export over $800 million annually to Italy. Palm oil is another huge market, globally generating $30 billion annually. Kenya, Indonesia, and Malaysia used our palm 50 years ago to create their own industries, and now they have developed the whole palm oil value chain. Rice is another huge market, a $25 billion industry, and Nigeria is the number-one importer of rice in the world, importing over 4 million metric tons annually. But rice could be grown here, bringing both employment and increased health benefits. Cocoa is similarly under developed here. And then of course gold, which is traded annually at up to $400 billion. In the northern states there is an old wives tale that on a hot afternoon, when you kick at the sand, you raise gold dust. We have identified all these sectors and products, parallel to the Nigerian Industrial Development Plan, which seeks to industrialize Nigeria by 2020. We need to scale up the production in many of these sectors. The first stage is to increase export volumes and production volumes. We have identified 22 export countries looking to buy these products. Our major trading partner is expected to be the EU for most of those products that we have identified. In cement, we went from being a net importer to a net exporter. We want to see the same results in these new sectors. Our plans are large, ambitious, and perhaps even audacious, but it's time to be that way.</p><h4>What states in Nigeria stand out in terms of manufacturing and export potential?</h4><p>We are developing a “One State, One Product" policy, so each state specializes in a particular export product. Enugu exported pineapples last year with a Mexican farming partner. Ebonyi, for example, is focusing on rice. Katsina produces cotton and leather and is the largest producer of hibiscus flowers as well, which are used for our traditional Hausa drink, zobo. Mexico is the biggest importer of hibiscus; people use it for teas, drinks, medicine, and more. This country really is blessed in terms of agricultural products. When you add the value addition potential to all these raw materials, the list is even more impressive.</p><h4>How would you assess the current legal framework to promote exports?</h4><p>The export framework is not bad. We are an incentive agency, and our aim is to promote our products as best as we can. When we identify countries that are interested in our products, we try and get into buyers' exhibitions and fairs there and build partnerships and networks. Our role is business matchmaking, taking exporters to these exhibitions, and doing everything we can to promote Nigerian goods.</p><h4>What are the main concerns of export companies?</h4><p>We are working on building capacity among exporters. You need to develop capacity so they are well trained, well groomed, well prepared, and professional. Most important is the ability to fill out the right documentation and all the right forms for markets like the US and EU. They have to meet standards in quality, packaging, and labeling. That is crucial if you're going to crack those developed and well-regulated markets. This is especially important for SMEs, and they are the ones we're focusing on.</p><h4>What major trade agreements have been signed or are expected to facilitate trade?</h4><p>We are signatories to the WTO and Nigeria is committed to free trade. Having said that, we are going to be looking at ones that are advantageous for us, and then push on those markets. We should not be afraid of trade agreements. It's trade barriers that are killers. We are also signatories of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS) and the CET (Common External Tariff) for the ECOWAS sub-region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the rest of 2016?</h4><p>This will be a foundation year, getting our plans finished and getting everyone on board for the plan. The results will take a long time to be seen, but this year we want to lay the foundations, raise production, build factories, plants, and manufacturing capabilities, lay the infrastructure, and by 2018 generate about $7-8 billion in non-oil revenues, and then by 2025 to reach $30 billion in revenues. Right now we're at $1.6 billion without liquefied natural gas. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't attain those targets as we are already on the way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the performance of SoftManagement S.A. in 2015?</h4><p>For SoftManagement S.A. 2015 was a year of change. We started an internal consolidation process, restructuring the organization into business units. SoftManagement S.A. has a strong business line; software development, and we work on improving productivity and international exposure. At the moment, we have specialized teams in different tasks and we started to have a system in which we buy services within the organization. Now, we have performance indicators by units rather than processes, which makes us more efficient. It was an arduous task, but we have already seen results. In regard to customers, we have started a process to start changing the image of SoftManagement S.A. from a company that develops software to a company that provides services. We do not put aside software development because this is our main business line; however, we try to diversify our portfolio by becoming a company that provides software-based services.</p><h4>What services of those you recently incorporated are developing faster?</h4><p>Our strength is operation and manufacturing software, and we believe this trend will continue in the same line for the near future. With the recent changes, we intended to boost consulting and services. Our experience and knowledge enabled us to start offering services of supervision and auditing, enterprise architecture, and cloud. Up until now, our main customers were government and large corporations and, through the new services, we intend to reach to SMEs, widening our portfolio of customers. We believe that all the services we have recently started to provide have great potential; however, since our main strength is in software development, we understand that supervision and auditing services are those with the greatest potential, because large companies are the ones requiring these kinds of services.</p><h4>What is the makeup of your portfolio?</h4><p>We have many customers; for example, Caracol Television, the US Embassy, and the Ministry of Defense, to name a few. One of our main sectors is the public one, meaning that the government is one of our main customers and one of the most active players in the sector when it comes to software development. Large finance companies make up another chunk of our main customers, such as Banco Caja Social, Citibank, and JP Morgan. One of our main strengths is our experience within the social sphere of the country; for example, we are currently involved in a project led by an important country's embassy in Colombia for the peace process.</p><h4>What is the role of R&amp;D within your overall business activity?</h4><p>R&amp;D and innovation are key elements of our business. We have a dedicated group of people developing this activity and we have a particular methodology. This group works on a full-time basis to develop new tools as well as the application of these tools. These people also work alongside our quality department to develop and improve our current procedures. Thanks to that group of people, we apply innovation to our products and services. We also invest a great deal of effort in the development of pilot projects alongside our customers, where innovation is key in this context.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>We have received several awards in the last few years. For example, the Ingenio Award is for the IT sector and is judged on the IT solutions presented by a customer and has to be technologically innovative. In 2014, we presented a joint project with the Ministry of Culture as part of the Read Again project, whereby we tried to boost reading culture, especially among children. We developed a strategy to link all the public libraries in the country as part of the virtual libraries network of Colombia, and we received the award in the category of education. In 2015, we participated in another joint project with Certicamara, a nationwide leading entity when it comes to digital certificates, and presented a solution in the field of dematerialized securities from a digital perspective. One of our strongest points with these projects is that we always try to understand the structure behind the problem and generate value from that.</p><h4>Have you thought about exporting your products and services abroad?</h4><p>Five years ago we started to implement our international strategy and we currently have a commercial office in Panama, which serves Central America and Peru. Since we are working as a supplier for the World Bank, we focus on the internationalization of projects from these offices. We have increased our focus on Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Peru. SoftManagement S.A. has developed projects in all these countries, mainly alongside the Central Bank of these countries. At the moment, we are in a process of moving forward with our international strategy. Peru will be the first country to host a SoftManagement S.A. office, and we will continue to have development services based in Colombia, but we plan to have several stages of the projects in those respective countries.</p><h4>How would you assess the current investment environment within the IT sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The IT sector in Colombia is one of the most attractive sectors in our economy for foreign investors. This is due to the fact that we have become a key sector for the economy and we have an aligned political strategy from the government in order to strengthen the investment environment. The government has perfectly understood that IT is one of the country's greatest assets in terms of potential. There is a public strategy to diversify our economy, which in the past used to be based on traditional sectors such as mining and coffee. One of our main challenges is the lack of enough qualified human resources; however, the country also has a nationwide strategy supported by the government to develop more IT professionals. Colombian IT professionals are extremely innovative and creative. We always say that our work force is our most valuable asset.</p><h4>What are your expectations for SoftManagement S.A. for 2016?</h4><p>This is a year full of challenges, and we have targeted 24% growth; however, this goal has to be put into context because the country expects to grow at a 7% rate. Furthermore, from now until 2020 we expect to grow by 200% and we expect to have operations in two other countries, consolidating our brand and company as a leading provider of IT solutions and services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main opportunities of the bilateral relationship between Canada and Lebanon?</h4><p>Canada and Lebanon enjoy a close relationship built on the strength of 62 years of diplomatic relations, reinforced by close cultural ties and participation in La Francophonie. Given the significant challenges the country faces today, in terms of the security, political, and socio-economic situation, there is much to do to partner with Lebanon in ensuring its stability, and there are plenty of opportunities to increase our bilateral ties on that basis. We announced, in February 2016, Canada's increased support over the next three years in terms of security, stabilization, and humanitarian and development assistance, as well as enhanced diplomatic engagement to respond to the crises in the region. Lebanon will benefit from this assistance. I would like to thank our Lebanese counterparts on the ground with whom we have had excellent cooperation, further forged through Operation Syrian Refugees. Our joint intervention has created more opportunities to widen our collaboration to other sectors. I would also like to underscore Canada's commercial relations with Lebanon, where bilateral trade increased in 2015 over the previous years and we are very keen to engage with the Lebanese public and private sector on ways to expand bilateral commercial relations.</p><h4>The Lebanese diaspora represents the largest Arab diaspora in Canada. What have been the major contributions of the diaspora to Canadian society?</h4><p>As Member of Parliament for Saint-Laurent in Montreal, I can attest €Žthat the Lebanese community is growing steadily. The Lebanese-Canadian community is estimated at over 165,000 people. We also have a large Canadian diaspora in Lebanon, estimated at over 40,000 people. This significant diaspora provides a competitive advantage to developing economic, cultural, and academic links. We are very happy to see the Canadian market growing in Lebanon, with the presence of Canadian companies, either directly or through agents, representatives, franchises, and partnerships that include Blackberry, Intelcan, Raytheon, La Senza, Second Cup, and HEC Montreal.</p><h4>Canada has made significant contributions to Lebanon in light of the Syrian refugee crisis. How has this assistance strengthened Lebanon's resiliency to face this challenge?</h4><p>Despite these close ties between our two countries, I remain gravely concerned about the significant challenges that Lebanon is facing today, mostly with hosting an immense number of Syrian refugees. We commend the Lebanese people for welcoming and hosting civilians fleeing the conflict in Syria. Along with other Canadian governmental departments, and with the assistance of our embassies, we were able to meet our commitment of welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of February 2016, of which over 14,000 came from Lebanon. We have renewed our commitment, and we look forward to welcoming more Syrian refugees throughout 2016. Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, we have contributed over $1 billion in humanitarian, development, stabilization, and security assistance to the broader region to help neighboring states deal with the Syria refugee crisis. I am very pleased to see such a coordinated effort to provide support on the ground. Through our funds, we support activities implemented by UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement. However, I am concerned about the growing presence of armed extremist groups, and Canada has firmly condemned their attacks inside the country. For example, we are supporting the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces, countering violent extremism in Lebanon, countering the financing of terrorism in the region, and enhancing judicial and regional cooperation to counter the threat of foreign terrorist fighters.</p><h4>What will be the highlights in your agenda as head of the Canadian Foreign Affairs Ministry to strengthen the relationship with Lebanon?</h4><p>Last February, alongside our Prime Minister, we announced our new policy. We committed $1.6 billion in humanitarian, development, stabilization, and security assistance to the region over the next three years, from which Lebanon will benefit. We will also work with our international partners to deliver $840 million in humanitarian assistance, $270 million in bilateral development programming, and $145 million to security and stabilization programming, from which Lebanon will benefit, including in responding to internal challenges related to the crisis in Syria. I was pleased to see that in light of our commitment, on April 15, 2016, Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie, announced a contribution of $20 million to the multi-donor Concessional Financing Facility, which will play an important role in helping strengthen Lebanon's ability to manage the crisis and provide crucial services for refugees and host communities. I would like to conclude by reiterating my earlier statement that, throughout the recent months and going forward, Canadian officials are conducting assessments to determine how we can best direct our assistance to ensure that our efforts support Lebanon's objectives for stability and prosperity. We commend the Lebanese government's dedication to keeping Lebanon stable and disassociated from regional conflicts, and encourage all parties to adhere to this commitment. We continue to encourage and support the country's efforts to end its political deadlock, and to both elect a new President and hold parliamentary elections as soon as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>THAI posted positive profits for 1Q2016. Is this a sign that the restructuring program initiated in 2014 is on the right track?</h4><p>We are moving in the right direction and we increased the amount of passengers by 11% last year, from 19 million to over 21 million with seven fewer aircraft and four fewer major stations. Earlier, we also cut some routes, such as LA, Madrid, and Johannesburg. Those expenses have been reduced, efficiency has been improved, and fuel prices have been low. In 2015, our cabin factor was at 73.3%, which meant 27% of seats were empty. In 2016, our cabin factor should be around 80%, so approximately a 7% increase. Filling empty seats is crucial, because it is necessary to fill the seats on each flight. We have also made staff reductions in various departments, such as catering and ground handling. We have put a system in place to do better network planning. With such systems in place, we are able to conduct better fleet planning. In terms of pricing, we will have the ability to change and set prices more quickly and in line with our competitors, so once that system is in place it will have a major effect on improving efficiency. The fleet will be better, our pricing will be better, and operations will run more efficiently and smoother. Every little bit helps.</p><h4>How do you also seek to grow and tackle the market?</h4><p>Last year, we realized that the airline would have to shrink in terms of capacity. Once we resume efficiency and are free of some routes and aircraft, it may be possible to expand again. In line with those plans, THAI will open new routes to Tehran and THAI Smile will offer service to Cebu in the Philippines. We have also increased flight frequency on some routes. We have better planning overall, and can take on new growth as a leaner and more efficient company. In terms of the most promising markets going forward, China is high as always, and Japan, India, Australia, and the UK also have their own growth patterns. Europe overall seems to be doing much better. We work closely with the Ministry of Transport and the airport authority to increase the number of visitors to the country. We want to make Thailand an international hub, and this is at a time when competition is fierce in the region and worldwide, especially with Middle Eastern airlines, not to mention low-cost airlines, now shining on the international stage. Those factors and players pushed us to go through the intensive restructuring, which is making us more competitive overall. THAI Smile is one of the initiatives we developed for short-haul flights to compete with low-cost carriers. For long-haul flights, we could improve our network management and planning, with new systems to help in that field; however, we are certainly on the right path. We also look closely at the integration of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), and envisage huge opportunities in this field. THAI should be the key player in terms of connecting this region with the rest of the world, and THAI Smile is one of the initiatives that will help us do so.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We are moving according to plan and that should help us attain a reasonable level of efficiency that will bring us closer to our competitors. We have cut the gap significantly, which is what we are aiming for. We have been improving services in the meantime in order to become one of the top-five carriers worldwide. We have a new business class service, which was launched in November 2015, and currently half of THAI's European routes offer that service. The new business class service is individual on-demand service, focused on individual passenger needs. We have also introduced all sorts of new cuisine and food selections, including Japanese, Thai curries, and Thai street foods, for example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>UMW has a broad portfolio but is new to the aerospace industry. Why did you decide to enter this new business line?</h4><p>At present, we have four divisions: automotive, oil and gas, equipment, and manufacturing and engineering (M&amp;E). As with any other organisation, we consistently scan the horizon for new business opportunities and seek to address any gaps within the group. To cut it short, one of the things we realized was the need to expand the global reach of our M&amp;E division by upgrading its skill set and products. We have relatively good engineering skills. We wanted to continue building on this engineering base but move beyond producing somewhat commoditized products, as such products tend to lead to lower profit margins. The aerospace industry is a good fit for our ambitions. Aircraft manufacturers require strong lean manufacturing competency in order to handle increasing volumes of production and we have existing capabilities that can be adapted to the industry. This business will allow us to migrate from labor-intensive manufacturing to high-value manufacturing and will also allow us to reposition our core competencies, embarking upon precision machining and assembly of crucial aerospace components.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your partnership with Rolls-Royce?</h4><p>Back in 2014, we were scanning the market for new opportunities when we heared that  Rolls-Royce was on the lookout for a co-producer for its Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 aircraft engines. It has been developing Southeast Asia as part of its supply chain for a number of years, and has a large assembly facility in Seletar Aerospace Park in Singapore. Naturally, it made sense for Rolls-Royce to look to Malaysia to source its components and that was where we came in. We are known for our expertise in the automotive sector because of our long-standing partnership with Toyota; therefore, excellence in engineering has always been a big part of the Group's DNA. We realized, however, that we needed to further develop this capability to be ready for the rapid developments in technology. This would allow us to move up the value chain and stay globally competitive. We are truly honored by Rolls-Royce's confidence in UMW. It took two years of due diligence and demonstrating our capacities and commitment to finalize this partnership, and to become its tier one supplier.</p><h4>How do you envision your new manufacturing park project materializing? </h4><p>We have a land bank in Serendah, where PERODUA is located, that spans over 861 acres. We have identified 30 acres of that land for the fan case project and our vision is to develop the Aerospace Hard Metal Manufacturing Park there. We hope to subsequently invite other aerospace industry players to set up operations at our park, and we will work and discuss this opportunity with MIDA. Hopefully, in the next five to ten years, our park can function as a platform for second and third-tier businesses and vendor communities. It is a great way to unlock the value of our asset, with Rolls-Royce as the catalyst.</p><h4>How do you manage talent development within your company? </h4><p>Our people are our most valuable asset; human capital is a critical enabler to drive and sustain our growth. The same is true for the Rolls-Royce project; we can have the best hardware and the best manufacturing plant; however, without the right mix of talent we would not be able to operate it. We knew we needed a partner to be ready for the job, which is why we are collaborating with MARA. MARA has a strong base of vocational colleges around the country, and we will contribute our knowledge and expertise to ensure that its graduates have the right skills to meet industry standards and expectations.  To further ensure a consistent supply of highly skilled, quality workers, we established the UMW Training Centre. The Centre will leverage on the aerospace platform to provide cutting edge training programs catering to niche industrial needs.</p><h4>How well developed is cooperation among the government agencies that are involved in aerospace, and where does UMW fit into the Aerospace Blueprint 2030?</h4><p>As you are probably aware, component manufacturing is one of the four key areas that was identified under the blueprint as the driver for growth of the aerospace industry. The Economic Transformation Plan (ETP) also outlined it as a key driver for the industrial sector and for sustainable and inclusive growth of the country's economy. The support from the government definitely cemented our position in the deal with Rolls-Royce. In the context of this project, we have collaborated well with M-Aerotech, the brains behind the Asia Aerospace City parks and the aerospace division of MARA. It assisted us with consulting services on our engineering capacities, knowledge building, and negotiations with Rolls-Royce. It played a role in UMW winning this project and is still involved in the execution phase of our partnership.</p><h4>How do you balance your activities in light of commodity price volatility?</h4><p>Heavy industries might benefit from lower oil prices because their operational costs will come down; however, that is just one side of the story. Looking at the overall economy of Malaysia, it mostly represents a challenge. The disposable income of many have fallen due to the rising cost of living, which in turn makes people cautious about spending, especially on big-ticket items like cars. The same goes for the construction sector, where we supply heavy equipment and machinery. Developers will wait until the economy picks up again before they start. With that attitude, the grass gets tall. There is strong interdependency between all these sectors and the differential question is to discover the benefactor and to balance accordingly. Market trends, such as the price of oil, are unpredictable. You can have the best strategies in place, but they still might not work the very next day. The volatility of external factors is large and significant.</p><h4>What are your plans to increase your regional and global footprint?</h4><p>We currently operate in 13 countries and we have been aggressively penetrating the Southern Asian market. We see plenty of potential for future growth in Myanmar and Vietnam, where our equipment division already has a strong presence. We have operations in lubricants in China and we continue to invest there, as well as in India. The Gulf remains an interesting region for us, and we continue our upstream activities in Oman. Expansion plans for our oil and gas division will take place when prices stabilize. In the meantime, we strive to ensure that our existing assets have contracts. Ultimately, we understand that, to be a global company, we need to continuously expand our horizons in terms of products, services, and markets.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for other companies to invest in the aerospace industry?</h4><p>The opportunities are abundant. The Asia Aerospace City is a good outfit to have. M-Aerotech is already working with world-class OEMs like Airbus and Boeing; therefore, it has what it takes to deliver to global players. Malaysia has friendly government policies in place that promote the industry. The infrastructure is good, the ecosystem of supporting industries is there, and the workforce is skilled. We are looking forward to other players coming in, and to potentially partner with us. Singapore and Malaysia complement each other in the aerospace industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Everyone's talking about low oil prices. Instead of seeing it as a drawback, how can investors like you take advantage of the environment?</h4><p>Just as the oil prices have gone down, so have the costs, at least the negotiated costs of services. What used to cost $100,000 a day has gone down to about $60,000 a day; therefore, you get more done for the same amount of money than you did say a year and a half ago when oil was $110 a barrel. That means that you can put more wells in the field to get more oil out. Equally important is that the value of assets is lower, meaning this is the best time to buy assets if you have the capital. Prices are expected to rebound, so if you bought an asset six weeks or two months ago, you have gained almost 20% value on that asset. The companies that will survive will know how to rationalize, cut costs, and become more efficient.</p><h4>The government is working on a new petroleum regulatory framework. How do you expect that regulation to influence the future of the sector?</h4><p>I'm hoping that their new approach to handling the PIB will be more successful. If it is more successful, then we will see a huge influx of capital investments in the industry. If the government establishes a more user friendly fiscal regime, then the IOCs and other investors will be eager to come in and take on new blocks, conduct new seismic studies, and discover more oil. If the government has a better approach than the one that was applied in the past, we are going to see a real turnaround in the influx of investments in the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>How has your production of crude oil and gas evolved since we talked last year?</h4><p>On the barrel equivalent we have more gas than oil. We have had a decline of production, which is why we are drilling additional wells to increase or at least plateau our production. We also have a new asset, OML52, which we are going to start developing once we are able to come to an agreement for the operation. By the end of 2017, it will produce about 20,000bpd. But more important for us is the gas. We have more than 3 TCF of gas and are looking more aggressively at LNG. The irony is that you actually have a healthy gas market along the West African corridor. Ghana's requirement is almost 3 million tons of LNG/annum and we have not even explored other countries along the West African corridor. Beyond that, you have the Indian market, which is aggressively building its infrastructure. It is talking about adding another 20 million tons of LNG into its system by 2020. We are trying to see whether we can get into the market to supply them with LNG. We are aggressively seeking ways to monetize our gas, and of course the easiest was seems to be the LNG. Right now, in the Gulf Coast, LNG is selling for maybe $3 or $4 per ton or even less; the market is saturated right now. However, we are hoping that as the world economy expands, the demand for energy will grow. The East African corridor could probably service most of the Asian market but India is right around the corner for us. Even within Nigeria, we have a large market, particularly the power sector. If we can create the demand we would not have to export at all.</p><h4>How have your operations in Ghana evolved since you acquired the Central Tano offshore block in 2014?</h4><p>Oil and gas exploration has a long gestation period, particularly in the deep water. We are in the exploration phase still, and unfortunately 80% of our block is in the area under discussion in the Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana boundary dispute. We hope that is resolved soon so that we can push ahead with our exploration commitments.</p><h4>Do you see more women participating in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>In the schools you already see more women than men. We are seeing more and more women working for IOCs; however, within the indigenous companies there may be a couple of women, which is not as impressive as we would like.</p><h4>In your opinion, what should the government do to further support the industry?</h4><p>Passing the PIB is the most important issue. Secondly, it should make more affordable assets available to indigenous companies. Mega billion-dollar blocks can only be acquired by few. It needs to open to the public assets that can increase production by 10,000bpd, not 200,000bpd. We need to grow at a sustainable pace. There are a lot of marginal, small fields out there. If the government does not make them available we cannot get our hands on additional assets to develop or grow as companies.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are very bullish on what we are doing. Within the next three months, we will put together almost $500 million in loans to develop our existing assets. We will probably be looking at close to a billion dollars in the next two years for growing the gas projects. In 2016, we think the oil price will stabilize and we feel things will definitely get better for the industry. I'm hoping that the OPEC will get their act together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>On the back of your experience as Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), what was the idea behind creating a private bank in 2005?</h4><p>Pasargad is the most honored and respectful name in Iran, as it means the center of Iranians. Every single word in the bank has a special meaning and has been carefully selected. Before establishing Bank Pasargad in 2005, it took more than eight years to study how to set up a bank that could be different from other banks and respected by the people. At the time when I was the Governor of the CBI between 1986 and 1989, we had nine state-owned banks, and many entrepreneurs and investors in Iran were interested in establishing a private bank. The experience at the Central Bank helped me see all the strengths and weaknesses of the banking system. Being the CEO of Bank Melli was also a beneficial experience because state-owned banks work differently from private banks. Unlike many other banks, Bank Pasargad's distinctive culture considers and treats all our employees as bankers.</p><h4>How would you assess the rapid growth of the bank during its first decade?</h4><p>I am pleased to state that we have achieved all of the goals and objectives foreseen in our original business plan with the exception of only one issue: our international expansion. From the outset, my main aim was to establish Iran's first global bank. I foresee a day when Bank Pasargad shall be referred to as the premier bank and a benchmark in the Middle East. Without a doubt, we have the best human capital among all Iranian banks. This is why young people refer to Bank Pasargad as the Bank of Love. When we established the bank, the IPO sold out in two hours. On that day we had queues all night in front of the bank. Unfortunately because of the sanctions we were not able to realize our original business plan and become a global bank. However, as a result we concentrated our attention on our domestic network and became the fastest growing bank in Iran. In 2012, Bank Pasargad was recognized as the fastest-growing bank in the Middle East in terms of return on assets. Today, in terms of paid-up capital, Bank Pasargad is Iran's largest private bank with $1.8 billion and we plan to double this amount, reaching a base capital of $4 billion within five years. We have been internationally recognized as Iran's best bank, having received: the Bank of the Year Award by The Banker magazine in years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015; The Islamic Bank of the Year Award by The Banker magazine for four consecutive years over 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016; and Euromoney's Best Bank in Iran Award for two successive years in 2015 and 2016. Domestically, we have won the prestigious European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Award and the Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise (MAKE) Award for four successive years, in2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.</p><h4>The bank plans to double its capital in the next five years. What is your strategy to meet this goal?</h4><p>At Bank Pasargad we make things happen. We know what to do to achieve that goal and become a modern global bank. For this reason, being such a big bank with a capital adequacy ratio of 19% is very important. Today, as I stated previously, the paid-up capital of the bank is $1.8 billion, but the General Assembly has approved that this capital will be raised to $4 billion within a five-year period. This year alone we are going to increase our capital base by 20%. As we are going to expand internationally, we are going to need more capital to invest in the banks that we are going to establish abroad.</p><h4>To what countries are you looking to expand?</h4><p>At this stage, the corresponding relationship with foreign banks is of primary importance to us. However, premier European banks are still hesitant to resume relations, as they are looking for more clarifications and assurance by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). A few of the large European banks have already visited us but have yet to establish full correspondent banking relations with our bank. Generally speaking, due to our past success and market share in Iran, all foreign delegations visiting Iran come to meet us at Bank Pasargad. In parallel, we are keen to establish a presence in the countries that have a high level of trade volume with Iran, such as China, India, Turkey, and a number of European countries. As a base principal, Bank Pasargad shall develop its global expansion plan concurrent to Iran's international level of trade and in the countries with which it trades. This expansion plan will be either through representative offices, branches, joint venture banks to be established with foreign local banks, or acquisitions. The choice will depend on the laws and regulations of each country. For instance, right now most countries prefer us to establish subsidiaries in order to give more supervisory power to the local regulatory authority. But, the natural and organic way for banks to grow internationally is through establishing a network composed of branches.</p><h4>What is the role of private banks in promoting trade with Iran?</h4><p>Having a high respect for state-owned banks, I must say that private banks have been quite successful in the country and have steadily gained market share from state-owned banks. Because of our superior level of service, our corporate culture, our dynamic decision-making process, and our more diversified financial products, people prefer to bank with Iran's private banks. Today, private banks hold a 60% share of all deposits. Traditionally, Iranian private banks have handled a significant portion of the country's trade volume mainly because of their well-trained staff and the high quality of their documentary credits. This has been recognized by all international banks. I personally believe that during this post-sanctions' era, Iranian private banks will even gain more market share from state-owned banks because we will be able to truly compete and display our skills and expertise. I also foresee a market consolidation in the Iranian banking sector with considerable mergers and acquisition activity. There is an excellent opportunity for all foreign investors at this point to purchase the shares of Iran's leading private banks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[as-a-team]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Ministry of Environment and Energy cooperate with other ministries to ensure that environmental issues are addressed?</h4><p>Our President has instructed us to work together as a team. This directive is not just empty rhetoric, as it has been formalized by an executive decree whereby, among other things, the environment, energy, and land-planning sector was created, which has the Minster of Environment as a rector. Other ministers, beyond the Ministry of Environment and Energy, as well as public institutions, which have in their competences environmental topics or themes, also participate in this sector for coordination purposes. That structure makes it much easier to actually work with the other ministries, which has not always been the case. In the past, I saw that sometimes it was difficult to bring together leading organizations like the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Ministry of Finance. Thankfully, we no longer have much trouble in coordinating activities and overcoming problems that we face. There is always a willingness to overcome difficulties, which has to do with the nature of the Governing Council. We are a group of people that has a national agenda, and don't just think about the next election. Of course we have disagreements, but there are always ways to overcome these.</p><h4>Costa Rica is known as a global leader for environmental protection and clean energy. What are the main highlights for the coming year of the National Energy Plan 2015-2030?</h4><p>This plan was the first made by promoting the participation of different actors in society. We decided to establish a process that ensures the participation of different actors in order for us to get to know what they are expecting from the energy sector in the near future. The second feature is that after hearing what the participants had to say we decided to work on the main pillars that synthesize what we wanted to do during the next 15 years: energy efficiency; optimal distributed generation; a sustainable energy matrix; an environmentally friendly vehicle fleet; sustainable power development; sustainable public transport systems; and cleaner fossil fuels. For example, when we talk about diversification of the energy matrix, we do not want to put all of our eggs into just one basket. In 2015 Costa Rica's energy was generated 75.3% by hydro, 12.8% by geothermal methods, tapping volcanoes, 10.08% by the wind, 0.77% from an alternative energy known as biomass, 0.01% from solar, and 1.04% from other fuels. We now have about a 70% participation rate of hydro generation in our matrix, and on the other hand, we know, from climate change models, that water is going to be a scare resource in the a few decades; therefore, there is a must to diversify the energy matrix in order to build the needed resilience to provide electricity for the generations to come. Hydro will of course remain the main source; however, we need to bring new sources such as solar and biomass online, as we have a lot of agricultural residue that could be used for generating electricity. The other way of reducing the electricity bill by companies is if we embrace efficiency by adopting new technology, which we are supporting in order to help the private sector become more efficient in its use of electricity. The main objective underlying the energy plan is a national development model low in emissions orientated toward the de-carbonization of our economy. The plan then complies with the Costa Rican goal of carbon neutrality for 2021.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in Costa Rica's energy sector and what steps are being taken to attract FDI?</h4><p>It is not easy to invest in the energy sector per se in Costa Rica. Even if foreign companies come to produce solar energy, electricity is owned by the state, which means that every kilowatt produced has to be sold to the state. The way that we have set up the market is that only 15% of the state-owned capacity we have in place to generate electricity can be placed for private generation. The market for fossil fuels is roughly the same, as there is only one state-owned company that imports all fossil fuels in Costa Rica to be distributed by private distributors. On the other hand, oil exploration in Costa Rica has been forbidden until 2021 by an executive decree signed by the President and myself, which, again, complies with our commitment in the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><h4>How is the ministry working with local authorities to combat the illegal trafficking of protected species?</h4><p>We have addressed the problem of illegal trafficking of protected species by establishing different mechanisms to prevent and combat it. The most recent one is the agreement I signed with the Minister of Public Security and the President of the Supreme Court to establish a National Commission on Environmental Security with the mandate to fight criminal organizations that are trafficking wildlife species. With this we are now capable of working with international security bodies such as Interpol, which is helping to identify these groups. We have been able to capture some criminals that were trafficking rosewood, which is a precious wood that is placed in foreign markets by kilograms. It is so precious that foreign markets will pay whatever is needed to obtain just a kilogram. As you know, at the moment we are facing an important fiscal crisis, but ultimately when there are more resources available, all of these institutional arrangements will provide the required muscle for the government to combat the illegal trade of wildlife species.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities as Minister of Environment and Energy for 2017?</h4><p>I would like to see more electric vehicles in our streets and a better and more environmentally friendly public transport system in place, along with much better quality fossil fuels in the market. With better fossil fuels we are going to have cars that are less pollutant and more fuel efficient, which would mean less imported fossil fuels. I would also like to see a more diverse energy matrix, including more solar and biomass and more resources employed in our protected wildlife areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

From that total, $209 billion has gone to manufacturing, in advanced areas such as automotive, aerospace and electric-electronic, among others. The next portion of investments was made in the services area, including finance and insurance, which puts Mexico in an interesting level in terms of investments. Other relevant sectors are trade and logistics, as well as mining and telecom. Indeed, we are developing the telecom sector rapidly, as it holds a lot of opportunities since Mexico has recently opened up the sector and we are developing interesting new aspects in it; for example, if you have a US phone number, you can now call from Mexico to the US using your data package without paying any extra fare. We are also looking forward to implement this strategy in Latin America. </p><h4>Mexico already has trade agreements with many TPP signatories. Is the agreement redundant?</h4><p>TPP has been a milestone for Mexico. In the G20 in 2012, it evolved from a P9 to the TPP when Canada and Japan were included in the negotiations, along with Mexico. We are also evolving in many ways; for example, when we signed the NAFTA treaty in 1994, the Internet was just starting; there were no smartphones and intellectual property was not a main issue. Now, with the TPP, we are setting the basic principles to be able to trade in the e-commerce world. With this trade agreement, we are updating as well the NAFTA treaty and our FTA's with Chile and Peru. We are facilitating the way of doing trade with those countries, and with Japan we are increasing the scope of our trade. This FTA represents new opportunities with six other countries that will bring even more business to Mexico. </p><h4>Given the relative economic size of its four members, is the Pacific Alliance less important for Mexico than it is for Chile, Colombia, and Peru?</h4><p>According to the UNCTAD, Mexico has cumulative investments (investment stock) over $9 billion in the Pacific Alliance countries, therefore the interest of businesspeople in these countries is noticeable. We started first with large companies, but SMEs are now also going to those countries. For instance, we have the River Trade project that we started with Chile. We import berries from Chile and fly them to China through Mexican ports. Mexico is an important logistic hub. Our country is the only Spanish-speaking nation with direct flights to China, which strengthens our position as a logistic hub in the Americas. Our next step is fostering our integration in the global value chains of the Pacific Alliance. Another example is consumer goods, where Mabe is a great success story because it is already producing refrigerators in Ecuador and Colombia. </p><h4>How important will the growth of the aerospace sector be for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The aerospace sector means excellent news for our country. If you analyze the growth rate of 17% in the past 10 years, you will see it is a very important figure. It is one of the sectors that has been achieving great goals. Also, if you see the number of highly qualified employees, and technicians who are studying in Baja California, Chihuahua Sonora or Querétaro, developing skills for this specific industry is really worth noticing. This is not only how ProMéxico sees the aerospace industry, but it is also how Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and other OEM's are looking towards our country. These companies are interested in bringing suppliers from all over the world to produce in Mexico for them. Airbus, for example, is so highly committed to Mexico that the CEO Frederic Garcia is now the President of the board of the transnational company in Mexico. Bombardier is our best promoter worldwide and is continuing to produce in Mexico. This is a well-organized sector; it is new and still growing in the sense that, although there is growth, it is not as large as the automotive value chain. There are 300 aerospace companies in Mexico, and we are expecting another 300 in the next 10 years. We want to be in the top 10 countries in the aerospace sector in the near future. </p><h4>Mexico has a negative reputation internationally around issues of security, transparency, and rule-of-law. Is this merited, and does it impede investment?</h4><p>Regarding security, we have to differentiate facts from perception. The facts are that homicide, kidnapping, and armed robbery have been cut by half within the last three years. In terms of rule of law, we are implementing a new system that will bring more transparency. These are the facts. The perception used to be bad, but now tourist and businesspeople numbers are booming, so the perception of insecurity is changing in a positive way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do you think the MENA region is attracting so much attention from the pharmaceutical industry?</h4><p>The Middle East is indeed attracting lots of attention in the pharma world, either from companies seeking access to this region or investors who are increasingly interested in the region and in healthcare. Pharmaceutical companies follow growth and wider access for their innovative therapeutics and, right now, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is one of the fastest growing in the world. The region offers many of the key fundamentals that are vital for our industry. First, there is a large population and one that is growing at a high rate compared to much of the rest of the world. Second, there is a high percentage of young people, meaning that years down the line they will get older and require medical attention. Lifestyle diseases are on an alarming increase in the region, including obesity leading to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancer, which comes earlier in age in some cases than in the Western world, especially breast cancer. Third, there is a high commitment by governments to healthcare—lots of hospitals and clinics are being built, bed capacity is being increased, urbanization is increasing along with the extension of healthcare services, and the drive to health insurance is increasing, including increased coverage and access to medicine where possible. In that regard, there is a lot of room for further improvement, coverage, support, and growth. Healthcare is central to regional governments' focus to provide for citizens, hence the attention on multiple fronts from governments and companies alike. On the other hand, however, there has been some caution looming in the region since the beginning of the year given the unfolding story of sliding oil prices and its impact on budgets here in the region, as well as the potential resulting pressure on working capital needs for companies operating in MENA.</p><h4>How do you think having compulsory medical insurance will affect the pharmaceutical sector?</h4><p>It will affect the sector positively. If you compare and contrast pharmaceutical consumption in Europe to the Middle East, people in Europe pay some contribution from their income toward their healthcare expenses through taxation systems in their country, and in turn they are subsidized for their healthcare and medicinal needs, so it is a fully reimbursed market model. In the Middle East there is a mosaic of healthcare access across the region, so you have countries that are fully or almost fully reimbursed, such as Turkey, Algeria, and Tunisia on one end of the spectrum, to countries that are mostly out of pocket, like Egypt, for example, on the other end of that spectrum, and the rest is somewhere in between. In the GCC, for example, governments and private insurers combined cover the majority of both the local and expatriate population, which is a good position to be in. When countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia put private insurance on the map and it becomes mandatory, it basically completes the picture and achieves almost full coverage for all inhabitants, so they become like Turkey or the EU from a coverage standpoint. The difference is that in fully reimbursed model countries, the payer is only one entity, i.e. the government and through their taxation systems. However, and as a result of this insurance mandate in the GCC, you end up with a system that provides the same purpose through different payers.</p><h4>What type of companies do you represent in the region?</h4><p>We represent many multinational companies wanting to operate in the Middle East and have their brands available for MENA patients, but want to do it through partnership as opposed to operating on their own. We have teams in the EU and US constantly looking for innovation and disruptive technologies that we think will address an unmet medical need or provide an improvement on existing therapies, or indeed provide better quality of life to patients in the region. For now we represent some products from global companies like UCB, Eisai, Kyowa Kirin, Genomic Health, and more. We operate as a one-stop solution to the region and as a licensing company for new pharmaceutical compounds that are not present here in MENA, thus acting as a bridge to bring this innovation from west to east, and hence the name NewBridge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[grow-diversify]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Thumbay Group's activities span 13 segments, including health, education, and real estate. What was the process of your diversification?</h4><p>Our core businesses are in education, healthcare, and research. Although we are diversified across 13 sectors, most of the subsidiary businesses such as pharmacies, nutrient outlets, health clubs, retail opticals, publishing, health communications, hospitality and trading, marketing and distribution, diagnostics, and real estate are related to our core businesses. We have grown and diversified as per the Group's vision and our focus has been significant in the process. We consider intelligent diversification and timely innovation the mainstays of continued growth.</p><h4>What is Thumbay Group doing to meet the demand of the health sector in the UAE, which has grown 60% YoY?</h4><p>Our hospitals treat 2,500 patients daily. We deliver healthcare services through our four Thumbay Hospitals in Ajman, Dubai, Sharjah, and Fujairah, a 25-chair dental hospital in Dubai, five state-of-the-art Thumbay Clinics and Thumbay Labs in Ajman, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Umm Al Quwain, all in addition to Thumbay Pharmacy outlets across the UAE. Our network of hospitals and clinics are among the largest healthcare networks in the UAE. We offer the most modern treatment and infrastructure across all major specialties. There are many healthcare providers in the country, but we are different from every one of them. The difference is that all of our hospitals have an academic setup, and we are the only ones doing this in the private sector here. We have already entered the medical tourism field in a big way and plan to further expand our medical tourism services.</p><h4>Thumbay Group is actively engaged in turning Dubai into an international medical hub. What do you think are the best practices for successful medical tourism marketing?</h4><p>Dubai is now a leading international medical destination. The visionary leadership of this country has already recognized the medical tourism potential of the UAE and initiated several plans for projects to tap into its full extent. It is already doing its best, and there is a special visa for medical tourism already in place. Thumbay Medical Tourism (TMT) renders a large portfolio of travel and medical services to medical tourists from all over the world, and we also arrange on-demand translator services, accommodation services, customized treatment packages, preferred cuisine, travel arrangements, priority appointments, and airport transfer. Each medical tourist is attended to by dedicated TMT staff. Most packages also include tourist site visits, a dedicated fleet of vehicles, and spa and recreational therapies. We now have the representative offices in Ghana, Nigeria, and other countries in order to bring in patients. We are ambitious in the medical tourism business and in the next five years we want to bring in 1,000 patients a day from 20 different countries.</p><h4>Thumbay is set to build the region's biggest private academic hospital in Ajman. What are the targets of this master plan and how will it contribute to the UAE's development?</h4><p>The new hospital, which is expected to be completed by 2017-18, will be the biggest private academic hospital in the region. It is envisioned as a state-of-the-art, purpose-built, 400-bed smart facility that will be the teaching hospital of Gulf Medical University. The hospital will be equipped with modern infrastructure and will be constructed over 320,000sqft and stand at four floors with over 120 clinics. The hospital will feature a special robotic pharmacy, a first of its kind in the region, and will have quaternary care facilities. The hospital will also have a fully-fledged radiology department with PET-CT scan, a first of its kind in the northern Emirates. With the ultramodern facilities of the hospital, we aim to continue this tradition of providing high quality healthcare services at affordable costs.</p><h4>Thumbay is planning to open representative offices in 20 countries, as it aspires to become an iconic international brand. How is this plan evolving thus far?</h4><p>Plans are afoot to soon open an office in Nigeria, where we already have a representative. With the expansion projects underway in Ghana, we will soon have an office there as well. Offices are also planned in the other GCC countries, with the ones in Oman and Qatar expected to be operational in accordance with Thumbay Group's expansion plans there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medtronic completed the acquisition of Covidien in January 2015. How did you bring together the capabilities of both companies?</h4><p>Since day one there were obvious synergies between both companies. For example, the neurovascular therapy that legacy Covidien already had complemented our neuro offering for neurosurgeons and neuromodulation physicians to offer a more comprehensive product portfolio. The biggest impact has been on the number of patients we are able to reach out to. We have created a company that serves more than 62 million patients around the globe, treats more than 70 conditions, has an R&amp;D program that is in the billions, and is present in over 160 countries. The Medtronic acquisition of Covidien brought with it tens of thousands of new products as well as treatments to areas in the body that we have not treated before. Now we are looking into how we can combine the huge product and technology portfolio with the access we have to the international market and offer meaningful solutions to more patients around the region.</p><h4>In which areas are you focusing your commercial strategy?</h4><p>We feel responsible to equally support healthcare offerings to the 1.4 billion people in our region. Fortunately, we have the opportunity to access patients by helping healthcare systems provide the right level of quality and the right level of care. However, some of these systems are still in the building process and they need help and support in finding the most efficient ways to deliver care to the patients. The variation in the region presents challenges, opportunities, and excitement as well. In the more mature systems within our region we want to support the transformation from the traditional healthcare system that is measured by the success of a procedure, to a value-based healthcare system that works toward improving patients' long-term outcome. In this way we can work on the gaps within each of these groups so that we improve clinical outcomes while lowering overall cost. The more mature systems will see more of a focus on value-based healthcare, especially from the governments and payers who want to maintain high-quality healthcare systems. We want to contribute to all types of markets and not only the mature ones. In the mature ones we want to focus on value-based healthcare. On the other hand, in the underserved countries that are still building up their systems we want to add our worldwide expertise, offer best practices, and contribute to the development of the infrastructure through direct or indirect investment. Through optimization, we can help develop the current infrastructure, which involves developing technologies specific to the area. This would bring a lot of value to us in a sub-Saharan setting and the company is already focusing on that aspect.</p><h4>What is the situation within the UAE in this respect?</h4><p>The third area we work in, which falls closer to the mature market, are countries that have the capacity and awareness level to become mature in terms of healthcare delivery, and which have the resources and the vision of the leaders to carry it out. This tends to be the case in the Gulf region but, most specifically, the UAE. The country's healthcare vision for 2021 and its development programs show the effort spent on the planning process, making sure that the local population is receiving high standard care. We have seen a huge amount of investments being made by the government, but equally we see big investment coming from the private sector as well. What is interesting is that no matter how many new facilities open up it always gets activated within a short time-frame, which means that the demand is high and people's awareness of the local healthcare systems is at a level that would allow for more investment. In the UAE, because we have our headquarters here we feel we can contribute in faster and more meaningful ways. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since opening in 2007, you have treated more than 50,000 patients from over 180 countries. What else can be done in order to further boost Dubai as a medical tourism hub?</h4><p>I have always been intrigued by the role of Dubai as a medical tourism hub, but we are seeing real motivation from the government and other key players. We have been continuously collaborating with Dubai Healthcare City in promoting Dubai as a medical tourism hub. Ophthalmology is one of the top-four demanded treatments from people coming from abroad. Once we fully establish our presence here in the Emirates, we will more actively promote our services in the region. More than 10% of our patients come from abroad without us having done any proactive marketing or branding of our name thanks to our strong reputation. We see patients from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Africa, and even now from the UK. We are also aligned with the government to keep patients here and minimize the number of patients seeking treatment abroad. We have been doing that for eight years, which is yet another reason why we are now opening in Abu Dhabi. There is great potential for medical tourism, but we, along with the regulators and local authorities, need to work collaboratively on the establishment of the drivers of medical tourism, including clinical quality, patient experience, and in terms of creating the brand of Dubai as a medical tourism hub.</p><h4>Why did you decide to start operations in the Emirate?</h4><p>Eight years ago, we opened Moorfields with the aim of exploring the market and become the first NHS hospital venture outside of the UK. After consolidating our activities in Dubai, we decided to expand and develop the business throughout the region starting with Abu Dhabi. For the last two years we have been working on our second facility, opening in 1Q2016. We chose Abu Dhabi because 20% of our patients in Dubai travel from there, and we had experience working with local providers in Abu Dhabi. Moorfields is responsible for clinical operations, and our partners are managing the administration as they are experienced healthcare developers in Abu Dhabi. We are capitalizing on the strength of each of our respective entities, combining our strengths into becoming a leader of ophthalmological care in Abu Dhabi. We are also exploring an opportunity in the north of the Emirates that may materialize toward the end of the year. With these three facilities in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the north of the Emirates, we will cover ophthalmology in the UAE. After that, we aim to explore the GCC market for further expansion.</p><h4>How do you expect your partnership with Dubai Medical College to benefit Moorfields?</h4><p>We are leaders in the eye care industry in the Middle East in terms of clinical practice and formal education delivery. The establishment of clinical practice is an essential first step in the formulation of educational programs that are relevant to the local population. As such, research is the next logical step. We have three main pillars in London, namely practice, education, and research. One of the research units in London is the largest of its kind in the world. In the UK we have a partnership with University College of London. One of our roles in Dubai is to localize the experience and knowledge that we have in London. The contract that we signed with Dubai Medical College aims to provide formal education to undergraduate medical students in the UAE. This is part of our mandate and adds significant value to what we do. Our director of research is a world-renowned researcher in ophthalmology and was knighted last year in the UK. We have a strong clinical governance structure in place, which mirrors the structure in London. We are now implementing governance for education and, once we decide to go ahead with research, we will be well placed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In February you won the Leadership Excellence Award. What impact do you think this award will have on your leadership strategy?</h4><p>Female empowerment is my passion. However, it has to be spoken of in the right way since in the Arab world it has not been understood properly in past years. Female empowerment is about how women can become proper leaders while maintaining femininity in their personal life. It is about creating the proper balance so that you can achieve your goals in the long term. It was really nice winning such an award and it has encouraged me to do more; it gives you a push when you receive an award for the hospital or yourself as it shows you are doing the right things and are on the right track. It is a great feeling knowing that you are enlightening others. You will not see many female CEOs in the private health sector. Healthcare is a complicated industry and the requirements for the private sector are really demanding. You have to prove yourself and you are asked for results to prove this every now and then, so it needs a lot of work to be a CEO whether you are male or female. There is no issue about the gender; you have to prove yourself and help other ladies to show that you can be a mother, have three kids, have a social life, and have a career at the same time. I do not encourage women to leave their careers when they marry and have children. I know this makes me look tough but in the long term you are losing brains. Motherhood is very important but you can create a balance because life is modern now. I studied and received my MBA while I was married and had children so there are no excuses anymore; you don't have to leave everything to establish family life. It is a nice example for the children so with this award I encourage other ladies to do the same thing.</p><h4>How is the Saudi German Hospital Dubai aligning to Sheikh Mohammed's initiatives? </h4><p>Dubai's success and growth is because Dubai is pushing you to meet the standards of the vision. His Highness has provided a high quality of life to all people who live here. We did not have a slow phase because the patients were the judges; they came and said they expect the highest standards immediately. It was really tough on us for the first 18 months until we established the quality that everyone expected and satisfied everyone. I think the reason for our success is dynamic innovative leadership. I am not only meeting heads of department, but all the staff, including junior doctors. When you empower them you will see how much they will open your eyes to things that you can improve. This is the same style of Sheikh Mohammed because he is an innovative dynamic leader who listens to everyone. If you have an issue he will fix it the next day and you do not see this in other parts of the world. This is what we are used to and this is how Dubai is pushing everyone to work in a dynamic way where you have to listen to your staff and customers and take them seriously.</p><h4>What areas would you say need further development in order to achieve the vision of Dubai as a medical tourism hub?</h4><p>We are working with the regulators, Dubai Health Authority (DHA), and we are working on our own. Medical tourism doesn't come about in one day and it needs long-term work, word of mouth, and the trust of patients. When we compile our statistics we find that the best marketing tool for medical tourism is word of mouth. That is why we have to deliver what we promise the patients as per our standards. We have to create the trust with the patients who come all the way to Dubai from other countries to be treated here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Health Check]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[health-check]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits will Mediclinic's acquisition of Al Noor bring to the company?</h4><p>The main benefit of the merger is that Mediclinic is known as the quality provider in Dubai throughout the UAE while Al Noor is known as a quality provider in Abu Dhabi. We have been growing into Abu Dhabi and opened our first clinics in Al Ain and the Corniche. With the acquisition we will automatically boost our geographical presence across the entire UAE, and can combine the two groups to the benefit of the patient, where we take the best practices from both, implementing them throughout, and elevate the standards of care across all the facilities.</p><h4>Do you expect more consolidation in the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Consolidation is inevitable in healthcare because of the benefit of economies of scale. In the medical insurance market, the more members under the same insurer, the cheaper it is per member, as the risk is spread wider. We will see more consolidation in the insurance market, as is already the case in Dubai. Abu Dhabi is a little different, mainly due to the fact that it is essentially government controlled. There are more good regulations being introduced for operators that will improve quality as well. They want to make sure billing is ethical and that the service provided is appropriate for the diagnosis. All of that is driven by an IT system that requires significant resources to manage. Small operators will certainly struggle to survive in such an industry, and that is the case anywhere else in the world. There are also procurement benefits with scale. We obviously get better prices for equipment than a standalone operator would, which was one benefit in taking our operations global. We are in South Africa, the UAE, and Switzerland, and own 29.9% of Spire Healthcare in the UK. We do that to reap the full benefits of global synergy in terms of pricing and best practices.</p><h4>In what areas will you be investing your resources?</h4><p>There will be big innovations in technology in healthcare and we are looking at new hospital information systems. We have just ordered a new laboratory information system. We recently implemented SAP as our back office solutions, and have to have professional coding systems to accommodate the new government regulations. There will be continuous investment in ICT; that is a global phenomenon and it is happening here as well. We do not aspire to be the first in technology; we would rather research and follow the correct technologies that add value, which is one of the reasons we are building the north wing oncology facility, where we are bringing in a linear accelerator.</p><h4>In what area do you identify the most potential for Mediclinic?</h4><p>The barriers of entry into outpatient services are low whereas the barriers into inpatient services are high. The level of expertise required to provide a proper inpatient facility are significant. However, the country cannot have hospitals on every street corner—it is not viable, so we focus on both. As Dubai is growing in terms of population, we put primary care facilities in new areas where the market is opening. On the hospital side of things, we are moving into more tertiary care, services that are lacking in the country now, and services that the country will need in the future. Oncology is a prime example of that. The population here is young so there is not much demand for a cancer center, but it will grow because the population is aging and growing. The cancer center itself will be a standalone and will not be profitable at first because patient numbers will be low, but we need to start moving toward more sophisticated healthcare. We have developed trust in the marketplace and the market is ready to trust us to move into more sophisticated healthcare such as oncology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-right-balance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DHCA released its Annual 2015 Operational Review, showing a stronger YoY performance. What were the main projects and developments that drove that growth?</h4><p>As a dynamic free zone model, we strive to achieve the right balance between governance and providing an enabling environment. In 2015, the DHCA reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing the health system of the Emirate in line with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. Integral to driving this vision is expanding the Emirate's health industry and transforming it into a global medical hub. In 2015, the free zone remained on track, registering growth of 28% in clinical offerings and increasing specialties by 68% compared to 2014. Growth was achieved through the introduction of operational sectors dedicated to education and investment and by forging strategic partnerships with public and private entities. Among projects that drove performance in 2015 was a JV between Dubai Healthcare City and Nshama to establish an integrated community, named Al Fursan in DHCC's Phase 2 expansion. Another milestone was the announcement of AMICO, a leading company in the medical device industry, relocating its headquarters by 2017 to DHCC Phase I.</p><h4>How does DHCA plan to deliver a more robust regulatory framework to attract qualified healthcare professionals?</h4><p>Our competitive advantage has always been a strong regulatory framework that is responsive to changes in the healthcare industry. Our outpatient clinic quality standards are accredited by the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua), the only organization that 'accredits the accreditors.' In 2015, we developed and implemented several regulations such as expanding the list of countries recognized for professional licensing as well as new policies for pharmacies and insurance companies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the health sector in the medium to long term?</h4><p>The Dubai Plan 2021 has put great emphasis on healthcare as it seeks to create a 'City of Happy, Creative and Empowered people,' whose residents are 'educated, cultured, and healthy,' who can take proactive measures to manage their health and enhance their skills and ability to contribute to the economy and society of Dubai. In this context, a world-class healthcare system that focuses on prevention and wellness is paramount to driving the country's development. Case in point, the three new projects in Phase 2; Al Fursan, Clemenceau Medical Center, the first hospital in the expansion, and WorldCare Wellness Village. In the coming years, DHCC will introduce healthcare concepts showcasing innovation that can deliver on the aspirations of the UAE government and its people.  </p><h4>What is DHCC's role in delivering medical education?</h4><p>Our education project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU), will be a game changer in the regional medical education scene and a project that aims to develop a sustainable workforce in the UAE and the region. The MBRU has two Colleges: Hamdan Bin Mohammed College of Dental Medicine for dental postgraduates and College of Medicine for medical undergraduates.  In due course, we will see the Swiss International Scientific School in Dubai, Dubai's first ever private school to offer multilingual education with a scientific focus­—located in DHCC's Phase 2—strengthen the medical education ecosystem with future medical students.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Montegrappa enter the UAE market?</h4><p>Montegrappa is a traditional Italian pen company founded in 1912. We became involved with Montegrappa after their acquisition by the Richemont Group in 2000. In 2010, the original Italian family who had previously owned the brand for three generations re-acquired the company and we assisted in the establishment of a regional distribution platform, Montegrappa Middle East, with a dedicated regional sales and marketing team. Today, the Middle East business is outperforming the rest of Montegrappa's worldwide markets. One of the key elements to this success was the willingness of Montegrappa to work with us on regionally relevant projects. In 2011, for the 40th anniversary of the UAE, we launched a national day pen in the colours of the UAE flag, a collection limited to 1971 pieces, representing the year of unification of the Emirates.<br>Since then, we have worked with Montegrappa on other regional projects including a collaboration with the Gibran National Committee in Lebanon to create a collection of pens dedicated to the renowned Lebanese artist and author, Khalil Gibran. The launch of this project coincided with Salma Hayek's visit to the region and the launch of her Hollywood adaptation of Gibran's most famous work, “The Prophet.“ Most recently, Montegrappa commissioned a book on the history of the Arabic language and calligraphy, and created a matching pen engraved with Arabic calligraphy and Islamic art. Montegrappa supports local cultural initiatives, such as the Montegrappa Prize for Fiction, a writing competition under the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature, which has yielded five published authors in the last three years. Montegrappa is a founding sponsor of the Emirates Opera Project, and in 2013 Montegrappa hosted a concert on the 200th anniversary of the birth of legendary Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, using a full orchestra, conductor, and soloists, all of whom were UAE residents. Such initiatives showcase the cultural depth of the UAE and give the brand the opportunity to engage with people's real lives and interests.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of consumer's interest in luxury pens?</h4><p>At the beginning of the 20th century the fountain pen was a communications tool. It was a bit like the iPhone of today. People wanted the latest features for ease of use and productivity. During the First World War, while most industrial buildings in Northern Italy were forcibly converted into munitions factories, Montegrappa was exempted and continued to manufacture pens as they were important military tools for communications supporting the front line. The most precious possession of a typical World War I soldier was a good pen to be able to write back to their loved ones from the trenches, and many beautiful words of the famous war poets were immortalised through the pen. Things have changed a lot since then, especially in the last two decades with the introduction of new handheld digital technologies. Interestingly, while public perception is that pen sales are declining because of this, in reality the market for high-end luxury writing instruments is growing. The pen today has become more of an item of jewellery than a functional item. It is a perfect gift for someone who is graduating, or moving on to a new job, to symbolise the knowledge they have gained. In addition to making great gifts, people love to buy luxury items for themselves as symbols, not only of a person's financial and material status, but more importantly of their knowledge, education, and culture</p><h4>How do you see the industry evolving in the UAE in the next 5 to 10 years?</h4><p>The luxury pen business can be much bigger than it is today. Watch collectors spend huge sums on luxury timepieces, while pen collectors tend to be more conservative. This is the result of an industry where there is more choice and more expenditure in marketing by the watch brands. Increasingly, we see watch collectors fall in love with beautiful limited edition pens, and we see the parallel between the two industries, especially in this region. This indicates a huge potential as the market for luxury watches is currently much larger than that of luxury pens. The traditional GCC dress style does not give a lot of options for individuality. You can have a watch and cufflinks, but the local dress does not include suits, belts, or ties, so a fine writing instrument in the pocket can be quite an important element of a gentleman's look and is often worn as a fashion accessory. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Marka is the UAE's first publicly traded operator and is focused on hospitality, retail, and sports. What are the key areas of focus in these segments?</h4><p>We place our customers at the heart of everything we do and our market positioning across our three business verticals are mid to high end, so we do not operate in the value sector nor in the luxury sector. There is a priority running order and, at the moment, our core business is food and beverages and then sports, with a slightly more cautious approach on fashion, health, and beauty in the short to medium term as a result of market conditions. We are diversifying out of fashion and into cosmetics, health, and beauty. We have seven fashion brands, a jewelry brand, and Dinh Van from Paris, and are about to launch our first Shiseido Spa.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your partnership with Souq.com?</h4><p>Marka first ventured into e-commerce when we purchased a majority stake in a UK-based e-commerce company called Icons.com, which sells authentic signed sports memorabilia. That business has traded double-digit growth since we have bought it and is truly an international player. Going back to our core business here in the UAE, e-commerce generally in the GCC is in an embryonic stage; it is nowhere near as well developed as it is in Western markets and so we see great opportunity. There is a young upwardly mobile demographic and customer group, there is significant penetration of mobile phones in particular, there is a target audience that is obsessed with retail and shopping, and, if you put those components together, that logic would suggest that e-commerce in the UAE has great potential. Our partnership with Souq.com was just announced. We have started a Marka sports offer with Souq.com selling into Saudi Arabia and the UAE and, without giving the full business plan away, you can expect to see a fashion offer added to that sports offer in the not-too-distant future. We are also working with other potential partners on expanding that e-commerce offer beyond Saudi and UAE and potentially even into North African markets in the months and years to come.</p><h4>What is Marka Holding's expansion strategy?</h4><p>We are a retail holding and operating company; however, we used acquisition in our first stage of expansion to gain critical mass so there will come a point in time where we will not buy any more companies. Right now we are focused on scaling what we have. However, Marka has international aspirations and, like any good retail chain, we want to grow out from the center. Our strategy has always been to focus on the UAE in years one and two, on the GCC in years two and three, and internationally in years three to five. Marka is a long-term player. My role here is about long-term shareholder value irrespective of the challenges or opportunities we face.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>2016 is going to be a challenging year for a lot of businesses. We know about the impact of lower oil pricing, we know that Russian tourism has declined to some degree, and in many ways it is a reality check for retailers in this part of the world. No longer can the fashion retailers and the luxury retailers maintain premium price products. Now digital has kicked in, the market has become global, and consumers are savvy and the power is entirely with them. I have heard reports that 20% of food and beverage retailers are scheduled to disappear by December. I do not subscribe to that but it is a healthy reality check for companies and organizations like Marka because it forces us to look at our cost base and put the customer at the heart of our proposition. Coming out of this period there should not be any lazy retailers and everyone should be on their A-game. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The new Dubai Health Strategy 2016-2021 strategy promises a world-class, patient-centric model of healthcare. What key areas of focus have you identified?</h4><p>The Dubai Healthcare Strategy 2016-2021 is an updated and refreshed strategy, which we designed after extensive stakeholder engagement including feedback and suggestions from 11,000 DHA staff members, the private sector, the public through social media channels, and local governmental authorities. The strategy was developed after a clear understanding of the current strengths, gaps, and state analysis as well as future opportunities. Some of the key features of the strategy are a focus on prevention and a healthy lifestyle, public health and safety, primary care, chronic disease management, private and public partnership and investment, improved governance of the health sector, and medical tourism. One of the main areas of the strategy is enhanced focus on primary and urgent healthcare so that emergency rooms in hospitals do not have to tackle non-emergency cases and can deal with actual emergencies. Prevention and healthy lifestyle is an area that we will significantly focus on through various initiatives aimed at educating and empowering the public to reduce the burden of non-communicable lifestyle diseases. The updated strategy aligns with Dubai Plan 2021, the national UAE plan, key stakeholders, as well as addresses evolving external environment matters.</p><h4>How did the DHA come up with the initiative to create unique electronic medical records for every patient across all hospitals?</h4><p>This is an initiative at the federal level that will be spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the DHA is one of the key stakeholders to ensure that everyone in the Emirate has an electronic medical record (EMR). EMRs and electronic health records (HER) are ongoing projects that are part of our smart health initiatives. Our aim is to ensure that no matter which hospital or health clinic a patient goes, their electronic file follows them and all patient information including allergies, tests, reports, and so on is available at any time. In addition to the EMR and HER projects, the DHA is working on a number of smart initiatives that provide patients with round-the-clock access to health information. We developed apps such as Sehhaty (my health), which can be used by all family members, providing various options such as keeping check of children's vaccination schedules and appointments. Another app we launched at the end of 2015 was Tifli (my baby), which provides information from preconception until a child is two years of age. So, while EMR and HER is a core focus for us, we are building other initiatives to create a truly smart health environment.</p><h4>Dubai is five years ahead of schedule to achieve its target of half a million medical tourists. To what do you attribute these quickly increasing numbers?</h4><p>Dubai offers medical tourists a range of specialties in which they can experience high-quality health services provided by our physicians and healthcare facilities. Dubai is among the top 15 medical tourism destinations in the world and the region's first as per the MT Association. Dubai has all the factors that make it a favorable medical tourism destination—internationally accredited hospitals, a highly specialized talent-pool that speaks several languages, world-class infrastructure and hospitality, and a world-class airport and airline in Emirates. Presently there are 26 hospitals, almost 3,000 clinics, and more than 100 nationalities of healthcare professionals. In 2015 Dubai received 630,833 medical tourists, of which 47% were international, while the rest were inbound tourists from the other Emirates. We recently launched the first-of-its-kind website in the world that has all the relevant medical tourism information, including facilities, medical tourism packages, tickets, and hotel booking on a single portal. Tourists who book medical tourism packages via the website will also receive discounted rates for flight tickets and hotel bookings. With this website and the addition of several medical tourism packages that the private sector offers, we will see further growth of medical tourism in Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[better-by-design]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How should the design sector be classified in order for it to be standardized?</h4><p>We had worked with the Dubai Design and Fashion Council (DDFC) on the MENA Design Outlook Study, the first study on the state of the design industry in the MENA region. The study asserted that the design industry market value surpassed $100 billion in 2014, with the UAE's $27 billion value being the second largest. We can apportion that figure to seven different segments of design: architecture, interior design, lighting, furniture, fashion, communication design, and visual arts. When we talk about design it is therefore in its broadest sense. We do not focus on just fashion or art; design can mean IT or automobiles. We already see this in d3, where we have architects, interior designers, fashion designers, and shoe designers all in the same cluster. This encourages them to do plenty of collaborations with each other and it is working well between the various partners.</p><h4>How do you apply sustainable practices at d3?</h4><p>The Dubai government has chosen d3 as the greenfield pilot site for the Smart Dubai program. An important pillar of Smart Dubai is sustainability resource use. We work with Smart Dubai to roll out 21 different smart initiatives, develop an innovative business community, and contribute to the realization of the Emirate's aspirations to make Dubai the happiest city on earth. Of the six dimensions aligned to Smart Dubai, environment is one of the key focuses, with services such as solar panel roofing, smart street lighting, and waste management being implemented. With the implementation of electric vehicle charging points, energy analytics to better enable our business partners with energy management, and also recycling across the district, we are enabling d3 to become more sustainable to ultimately benefit our end users.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the UAE design market?</h4><p>Growth in the design market is apparent and sustaining. However, the UAE is in a mature stage compared to other countries in the region, and it is up to us to lead progress in this area. We believe growth will continue, but it will not be as significant as in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. However, this situation creates the opportunity for designers who come from d3 to contribute to growth in those other countries in the region. We have the right platform and the right supporting infrastructure and are building the right workshops and spaces. We also hope to host several design schools. All these will contribute to having the right mix and the right designers who can support the growth of the design industry in UAE and the wider region.</p><h4>What are d3's prospects for 2016?</h4><p>This is an important year for us, as we will see many more business partners move in. We are moving into the operational stage on d3, and the community is thriving. With our partners moving in, it is now possible to actually witness the collaboration that is happening on the ground between neighbors and the results of these collaborations at both local and international design events and festivals. This is crucial for us. It is also important to keep attracting such creative minds by sharing the success stories of our creative partners so far.</p><h4>Where would you like to see d3 in 10 years' time?</h4><p>Our vision for d3 has always been to provide a nurturing home for designers from across the region and beyond. In 10 years' time, I see d3 as a genuine center of regional design that incorporates and includes entities, individuals, and organizations from within the entire spectrum of design all working side by side. I want d3 to be behind the transcendence of emerging regional designers into genuine international brands. We have exceptional talent in this region and there in a global appetite for designs from the Middle East. I want d3 talent to become recognized on the international stage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can you secure innovation in the airport retail sector?</h4><p>We try to improve all of the time; we invest in technology and have introduced an online shopping portal, which we expect to become increasingly important to our business and our customers. Refurbishment is necessary, and we closely examine how we deal with our passengers. If we identify congestion then we change and we have recently agreed with the airport to remove a number of retail structures from the center aisle in what we call Concourse B because of congestion. We keep trying to offer better value to the customers and we continue seeking to be the number one in duty free from the point of view of special offers and ensuring that customers get what they want. We work closely with our suppliers to this end. We also have digital advertisement applications at the airports showcasing Dubai Duty Free's offers.</p><h4>What is the average return on sale per sqm?</h4><p>In 2013, our average return on sale per square meter was $80,000, while the average of the rest of duty free was at $34,000 per sqm. Last year we reached $82,000 per sqm, while the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was at $66,000. When we opened Concourse D at Dubai International Airport in February 2016, the new 7,000sqm of retail space will lower our average return. We expect to be at $72,000 this year, which is still way above the average.</p><h4>How do Dubai Duty Free operations contribute to the economy?</h4><p>Around 70% of our products are acquired locally, helping suppliers, wholesalers, and importers. We have 6,000 employees, to which we provide rented accommodation and we also own 740 apartments that house some of our employees. These employees spend money in Dubai, and not only them but also all of their friends and family members who come to visit every year. We not only give our employees accommodation, but also flight tickets, too. They are all contributing to the development of Dubai. We sponsor a lot of events, like the Tennis Championships, which generates over $800 million worth of TV exposure for Dubai, as well as supporting the DP World Tour Championships, the Emirates Rugby 7s, and many more major events. In addition to that, we own the Dubai Tennis Stadium, the Irish Village, and the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel. We are also planning on developing the Irish Village in a new theme park that will be constructed here in the UAE. The build up to Expo 2020 is exciting and the development of Dubai South will see a lot of activity in the coming years. By 2020 we expect to reach $3 billion and have 9,000 employees. It is expected that Dubai South will generate 260,000 jobs. At Al Maktoum we will open up to 80,000 sqm, which will create around 3,000-4,000 jobs.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the banking community's confidence in Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>Our main banking relationships have endured for a long time and have been built on mutual trust and co-operation. We had never taken on debt before but in 2012 we were tasked with raising $1.75 billion in financing to support the expansion at Dubai International Airport. We had many conversations with existing banks and some that were new. In the end the 26 banks that supported us understood the opportunity surrounding Dubai Duty Free at Dubai International Airport  and the phenomenal growth story that was taking place. A year later we raised an additional $750 million and needed just three banks to finance the deal. We have since re-financed both deals with an overall savings of $70 million. The banks like working with us, they understand the success of our business, we honor our agreements with them and have never been late on any commitments due. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We started operations in 2012 with three undergraduate programs and have come a long way in less than four years. Currently, we offer 11 different majors at the undergraduate and graduate level. We have been growing organically, attracting top-class faculty members from all over the world. Today, we boast of a culturally diverse campus environment with students hailing from 40 different countries.</p><h4>Do you plan to launch any new programs?<br></h4><p>We recently launched our MBA program and a master's of law program with majors in public and private law. We plan to expand our program portfolio in 2016-17 by further diversifying it. We will offer courses in IT and software engineering along with other majors. We launch each program after conducting a thorough feasibility study and assessing the job market trends and demand for the programs.</p><h4>What is the university's internationalization strategy?</h4><p>At CUCA we offer an environment that is conducive to the growth of a diversified student population. We have students from 40 different nationalities and this is a true reflection of the overall UAE society, which is international and diverse. We attract students not only from the expat community within the UAE but also directly from various countries, specifically Asia and Africa. To support the internationalization of the college, we formed several alliances that include an articulation agreement with Mantissa College in Malaysia, whereby our students can complete the final two years of their bachelors program at the college there. We also have an agreement with the International Students Exchange Program (ISEP), an entity based in Washington D.C. with 300 partner universities worldwide. The agreement with ISEP gives our students the opportunity to gain international exposure by studying abroad for one or two semesters at any of the partner universities under stipulated guidelines. We are among the few universities in the UAE affiliated with ISEP.</p><h4>How does CUCA encourage interactions between academia and work experience? </h4><p>We have many faculty members who have industry experience along with impressive academic profiles. They impart their knowledge and expertise in the classroom by using industry-specific information and real-life case studies, which gives our students an extra edge. To help them become competent, well-rounded professionals, we must ensure that our students have firsthand experience of their chosen career paths. For example, we have a partnership agreement with R Hotels, the hospitality division of R Holding, in which students from our hospitality and tourism management program can avail internship opportunities at any hotel under the R Hotels group, gaining experience in all departments. It enables them to get a better feel of a live working environment in the hospitality sector. We plan to replicate such partnerships with companies relevant to the other programs as well, enabling our students to experience more real-life scenarios and to shape them into suitable candidates for employment at the companies with whom they intern.</p><h4>In what areas will you be investing your resources?</h4><p>We are building a new purpose-built campus. The investment will be about AED100 million. Construction will start by the end of 2016 and, after completion of the first phase, the campus will accommodate approximately 7,000 students. We also plan to invest in R&amp;D activities, along with improving student facilities and augmenting the overall level of institutional effectiveness.</p><h4>How will higher education evolve in the next five years?</h4><p>In the last decade or so, higher education in the UAE has undergone a rapid transformation. The credit goes to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) of the UAE. It has done a tremendous job in shaping and laying down the framework for higher education in the country. The sector will grow further in the next few years. We can expect to see the UAE as a destination of choice for higher education regionally and internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new courses is the American University in the Emirates (AUE) launching this year?</h4><p>We are going to launch a bachelor's degree in education with a specialization in technology, supervision and administration, psychology, and counseling. We do not want to graduate teachers from the college of education; we will leave this to other universities, and we do not want to compete with any of them so we decided to target logistics as we need a lot of para professionals to realize the vision of UAE pertaining to educational sector. While we have currently unique programs in sports management, sports law, natural disaster management, emergency management, and security strategic studies, we are applying for more programs that are unique and demanded to meet the skills gaps in the region.</p><h4>Which of AUE's programs will allow students to compete more successfully in Dubai's job market in the run up to Expo 2020?</h4><p>Our programs have been designed to meet market demands and will serve the need of Expo 2020 very well. At the same time we are focusing on soft skills training to graduate leader who are more employable in the market. We recently conducted a training program in collaboration with the Institute of Sports Sciences in Germany and invited an expert on sports tourism from George Washington University. For Expo 2020 you need people to be graduated in event management; therefore, we are working on equipping people with the relevant and necessary skills. In AUE we believe that we need to graduate leaders, not just manpower. There are three steps to be taken in order to create a leader. First, they should have knowledge acquired through books and theory. Secondly, they should have up-to-date industrial experience and skills. And the final step is soft skills, which really make the difference and let our graduates stand out from the crowd. In order to be a leader, you need solid knowledge and experience and should be creative, have initiative, critical thinking, and negotiation skills, as well as the ability to make decisions during a crisis and work as a team. If we combine these three dimensions in one person, he or she will be a leader in the future. We want to graduate global minded leaders, and hence we stress on cross cultural sensitivity that ultimately leads to tolerance and peace and this is our real contribution to the market.</p><h4>In what other areas is the university focusing its resources?</h4><p>The university should focus on many areas, including its focus on social responsibilities. We want our graduates to be responsible citizens, and hence our continual focus is also on delivering community services. We organized cancer awareness campaigns and events about speed and road safety to achieve the goal of a happier society, as we strongly believe that we have a big responsibility that goes beyond teaching or research.</p><h4>What impact will the newly establish cabinet have on the education sector?</h4><p>Our leaders consider everything as a challenge, but they also believe that nothing is impossible. If you believe that nothing is impossible and you encourage people, they will think in the same way. There are many expats in this country that could help nationals with new ideas and experience from other countries. We should be flexible enough to learn from others and learn from their mistakes. This is very important, and I am sure that the new cabinet will help further develop the education sector and our human resources. Education is very important and there will be a significant impact on growth and on graduate leaders.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2016?</h4><p>We need to continue assuring that this and other countries are secure. The university should contribute in this area, so we are thinking of creating a peace center to generate new ideas and solutions. We are further supporting security in the country through our courses in security, emergency, and disaster management, and also a future program in intelligence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of programs have been your focus of late?</h4><p>The University of Manchester has been active in considering the types of programs that may be successful within the Middle East, and we have held discussions with a number of schools that ultimately encouraged the university to move closer to the region. Our role has been to share our experience and knowledge of the region with our academic colleagues, based on almost 10 years of operating in Dubai. The university is taking a market-led approach to ensure that we meet the current and future knowledge and training needs of the region as defined by the public and private sectors. This is influenced by the visions of the regional governments, which are committed to economic diversification and moving toward knowledge-based economies and societies. The focus has been on the education and healthcare sectors, which are especially active. We have held initial discussions with the pharmacy school and also looked at the teacher training needs of the region to support capacity building in education. There is broad interest within the university, and we have spoken to a range of schools, from law to healthcare.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the rapid growth in the interest in MBAs in the UAE?</h4><p>Dubai's status as a regional business hub creates a rich business ecosystem that attracts many global professional organizations. Through radical innovation, the UAE has already attracted a number of top business schools to the country, creating access to high-quality learning opportunities. Many of these institutions offer a variety of MBA options and greater choices for students in terms of program focus, content, and learning format. Demand for the MBA degree amongst working professionals in the region remains strong, supported by our own experience. The MBS Middle East Centre is now the largest and fastest growing in the school's international network, supporting more than 1,900 part-time MBA students in the region. Around 30% of these students are already in C-level and senior management positions and around 10% are already educated at the master's level, underscoring the quality of the talent already living and working in the region. With top companies and talent already here and more coming, it is critical that business programs in the region meet working professionals' demands for a high quality and rich student experience, exposure to top faculty, and globally recognized and accredited programs. As the business education market in the UAE continues to mature, more MBA choices have been made available to students. The UAE's buoyant economy, further sparked by Expo 2020, will certainly lead to enhanced career opportunities, with more than 250,000 new jobs to be created according to estimates. All of this emphasizes the strong outlook for the future of business education in the region and confirms that all the ingredients are here to support its continued development and contribution to the UAE's emerging knowledge economy.</p><h4>What is the reason behind the recent name change of MBS?</h4><p>The UK campus-based business school was renamed Alliance Manchester Business School following the generous and substantial donation by Lord Alliance of Manchester, which is the culmination of a long history of collaboration and support between the University and alumni as a whole. The MBS regional center, including the Middle East, will continue as Manchester Business School centers, primarily because they will be rebranded as University of Manchester (UoM) centers starting in 2017. We will move to the UoM branding directly rather than taking another interim branding step. Alongside this rebranding process, we will extend the academic offering to include programs from other departments in the university, beyond just the business school. The organic growth in our offerings of programs and services reflects the success of the MBS international network, which has created the opportunity and platform for the entire university to harness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[vehicle-of-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of Nissan's latest achievements in the Thai market?</h4><p>We produce cars for the domestic market as well as the export market. Our production is now around 150,000 units annually. About 30% of production in Thailand is for domestic use and the rest is intended for export. On the retail side, we just launched the X-TRAIL Hybrid last year, and it has been a huge success considering our market share in the SUV segment shot up from 2% to over 30% after launching this model. We produce that model only in Thailand and Japan. So that is a major achievement for us in the domestic market. From a product point of view, we also launched NISMO, which is more than a product—it is a brand renowned above all in the racing field. Thailand is the sixth market NISMO has entered because we know that Thais love sports cars and that it would do well here. In terms of our retail network, we opened 10 new dealerships, mainly to increase our after-sales network. We now cover all 77 provinces in Thailand. It is the first time we have covered the entire country, and we can service a Nissan car anywhere in Thailand. We have also invested in more training for our service staff, partners, and dealers.</p><h4>What impact have these domestic achievements had on the company's export operations?</h4><p>In terms of exports, our greatest achievement was in 2014, when we opened our second plant. Nissan has over 50 years of production history in Thailand, but we only ever had one plant. The second plant opened in 2014, and it is dedicated solely to pick-ups. Production has started, and we have already started exporting to ASEAN countries and Australia in 2015. Again, 30% of the production from that second plant is for the domestic market, with the remaining 70% going to export. Nissan is also very famous in the Eco car segment for eco-friendly cars. In this category, Nissan has been the pioneer, launching the first brand in this segment after the Thai government launched the program. We have already produced 500,000 units in accumulated production sales, for both export and the domestic market. We are even exporting this brand to Japan, 100% Thailand produced. Geographically, Thailand is well positioned for exporting to ASEAN or the Middle East. Labor costs are reasonable while also well skilled and it has a great supply chain, one of the best in the region.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the future car project that the Thai government is working on?</h4><p>Thailand already is a production hub with a good production base. However, the government is concerned that if Thailand only focuses on being a production hub, there will be a lot of countries to compete with, regional countries with certain competitive advantages like cheaper labor. The government is concerned with going from being a production base to becoming a next-generation automotive production center with a strong R&amp;D base. We agree with its vision, and want to help it achieve this. We have already established an R&amp;D facility to test and develop vehicles in Thailand, and recently launched in April with Thai officials also invited to the launch. We have testing facilities and courses around our plants as well, where we test things like safety, the performance of new models, and emissions. We want Nissan to help Thailand attain its goals in terms of its vision for producing and developing next generation cars. The Thai government is particularly focusing on eco-friendly cars, which is why we have invested in Eco cars as well. They are economic, environmentally friendly, and safe. The government is also focusing on hybrids, which we are too, and the launch of the X-TRAIL Hybrid is part of that vision. The next project for the Thai government is an electric-powered vehicle. We have been discussing this project with the Thai government, but it is still early days. Nissan is leader globally in electric vehicles in terms of market share. So we have a great deal we can bring to this project in Thailand, and we have an advantage in terms of what we can bring to the table in terms of developing and marketing a pure batter-operated electric vehicle in Thailand. If Thailand goes ahead with this electric vehicle project, we told the government we need two things: an incentive, because it is expensive; and an infrastructure for charging stations. If those are in place and there is good demand, we would go ahead with production. Electric cars are the future of the automotive industry and things are progressing very rapidly there in terms of battery technologies, mileage, and costs. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016, following the new releases and the motor show?</h4><p>Our total investment volume this year is about the same as 2015. The Thai government is trying to stimulate the economy on a macro level, but usually those macro incentives and stimuli usually reflect on automotive sales much later. We expect sales to pick up accordingly no earlier than in the second half of 2016. Overall, we expect from next year that the domestic market will lead the way for us. In terms of exports, we look at the global economic picture, which is hard to predict right now. If the global economy picks up, then things will be more positive on that front as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Taking On The Challenge]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[taking-on-the-challenge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What achievements do you feel most proud of at the moment?</h4><p>We have many achievements in many different areas. First of all, the company keeps on growing; as a top contractor, we have our core business in the construction and infrastructure sector, and in both sectors we aim for the biggest projects in the region. One example is the Kuwait Airport terminal tender, which is probably the biggest single building project in the Middle East or even in the world. In the infrastructure sector we are challenging for the Etihad railway, which is a good indicator of our strength. We are present in three other main areas, one of which is steel structures.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the Dubai Viceroy Hotel project? </h4><p>The project was designed and run by our partner SKAI Holding. We have a joint venture with SKAI Holding, which is a minority shareholder. We believe this is very interesting and the perfect arrangement for us to join hands and align our interests. SKAI Holding has great experience of the local market, and it understands the appetite of the buyers. In the financial hub we are also doing well and we have just recently finished syndication, which is a reflection of the trust that the financial sector has in us. Quite a few major banks in the world joined this syndication, which includes ICBC, Bank of China, and quite a few other Chinese banks like Minsheng Bank. With the successful closure of the project financing, all our development is well supported financially so we can now focus on the construction and try to finish as early as we can.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the status of the Sheikh Zayed Road flyover?</h4><p>We have two current projects on the Sheikh Zayed Road. One is access to Dubai Park, which is not a big project but is very challenging because the client has only given us 14 months to finish. We are doing well so far and need to spend more effort to finish the project on time. We are looking at maybe a one-year timeframe. Our team works day and night and tries to keep up with our program. In relation to the flyover, we have recently commenced the 2.5 bridge in between the second and third bridges. This is a sizable interchange to improve the traffic on both sides. The project started in 3Q2015 and we would like to continue with the same kind of commitment to our most respectable client out here, and be sure that we finish the project within the given timeframe with the highest standards possible. We can take on the challenge together. Generally the project is doing well and is on track.</p><h4>What would you consider to be the biggest challenges in the real estate and construction sector in Dubai?</h4><p>The main challenges come from different angles; challenges pertaining to the complexity of a project and technical challenges such as those related to the Abu Dhabi Airport project. On one hand, clients often lack experience, while on the other consultants are not always sure how to address complexities on the technical side. As specialists we try to cope with demanding programs, so the key is commitment. Clients themselves have commitments, which is why we like to work on government projects as it has made the budgets available and its priority is getting projects finished as quickly as possible. I am glad that when we encountered huge challenges with the Abu Dhabi International Airport project, we had great clients and consultants who allowed us to work out a solution together. Another key factor is trust. Without the trust from our clients and partners, we can easily ruin a relationship. It is crucial that all parties have confidence and trust for mistakes to be addressed and corrected. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jumeirah Golf Estates has held the DP World Tour Championship since 2009. What is the significance of this tournament for Jumeirah Golf Estates?</h4><p>This will be our eighth year hosting the championship. This is one of the best events worldwide and, being a host venue, pushes us to continue to provide the same level of quality and support every year, which we align with our partners at DP World and the European Tour. Dubai Sports Council recently gave a five-star ranking to the DP World Tour Championship, which further enhances the tournament's status as one of the premier events in the UAE. The DP World Tour Championship—the season Finale of the European Tour's Race to Dubai—also presents a first-class opportunity to showcase our world-class golf courses—Fire and Earth—to a world of the sport's enthusiasts.</p><h4>Jumeirah Golf Estates recently awarded a contract for Alandalus housing project to Al Habtoor STFA Soil Group. Why did you decide to include mid-market housing on a golf development and what have been the latest developments of this project?</h4><p>Alandalus is a collection of 674 affordable luxury apartments and 54 townhouses. We have seen a 6.5% population growth in Dubai, which has made way for increased demand in the mid-market sector. We always adjust ourselves to the market's requirement; therefore, we decided this was the right time to focus on what the end user requires. We have awarded the piling contract for the Alandalus project to Al Habtoor STFA Soil Group. The construction is going as scheduled, and we are set to complete two buildings by 2018. Everything is progressing as planned.</p><h4>What are the unique environmental challenges in running a grass golf course in this region of the world?</h4><p>It has always been a challenge to run a golf course in such an arid environment and climate. Despite this, our golf courses are among one of the best in the world. We have always maintained our golf courses in house, and we are using all of the available sustainable resources to maintain the pristine greens. We are using recycled water, and we have been using state-of-the-art equipment for all aspects, like irrigation. We are pioneers in our developments, and not just in terms of the golf course. We have 15 lakes and 1,700 constructed and under construction homes, all linked together by two championship golf courses built for world champions.</p><h4>What is your contribution to the local economy?</h4><p>The golf industry in Dubai is worth $131 million. Golf contributes 30% to sport's total economic impact of $421 million, or $131 million per annum. Golf events in Dubai generated an estimated $92 million of total sports expenditure of $1.1 billion. As hosts of the DP World Tour Championship, we are proud of the impact we are having on the local economy. This year's event is expected to attract 65,000 spectators, which will further increase the spotlight on Dubai and its leading golf facilities. Furthermore, the gross expenditure of golf clubs alone stands at $120 million, representing revenue from memberships, green fees, and food and beverage sales. We have always wanted to be number one, and that has been the top-level priority from the beginning and we are maintaining that.</p><h4>How do you expect the real estate sector to evolve in the short term in the region?</h4><p>Our yields are stronger compared to most of the world—in the 5-8% range, compared to 2-3% in the UK. To be more precise, at Jumeirah Golf Estates, our apartments yield is 7-8% and the villas yield 5-6%. It is a promising trend and we have a great marketing team, so I am very confident that our latest developments, including Alandalus will make an impact on the real estate market. As an organization we are constantly listening to the market's needs, and because we are not as large, we are very agile, so we are actually able to accommodate the market and what our buyers and investors are looking for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind Falconcity of Wonders?</h4><p>HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum had asked the private sector how it could support the government's efforts to develop Dubai. One of our major areas of expertise is real estate and construction. We own real estate in Dubai and have built important buildings and infrastructure projects. Our chairman presented Falconcity of Wonders to His Highness and he agreed to take it forward. In September 2005, this company was launched. This city of over 41 million sqft is built in the shape of a falcon, in tribute to the UAE's emblem. We continue to move forward with constructing, building, and managing this megaproject. Every day brings new challenges and new expectations and we aim to complete this project by 2020, before the Expo.</p><h4>Have you implemented any smart or green energy innovations in the Falconcity project?</h4><p>Sustainability is key. We have a new directive from our chairman to study how our new constructions can be LED-certified. We have developed our own sewage treatment plant (STP) that produces reclaimed water and sludge suitable for irrigation and landscaping. We also work on installing solar panel photovoltaic systems that will connect all the villas in the community to the smart grid, following the US Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED standards. We are looking into smart homes. When we started the construction of the 202 villas in the eastern residences we made it a requirement that these villas would be smart. </p><h4>What are your future plans for the project?</h4><p>Our approved master plan contains approximately 1,300 villas and three pyramids that will be different hotel-apartments for sale. There will be an educational zone, a Falconcity mall, and a Falconcity fun city. We have traveled the world to learn from other people's experiences and will incorporate themes in the project, such as London, Venice, Rome, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Taj Arabia, Beirut, and Old Dubai. We will also have a Paris area with a Dubai Eiffel Tower, and restaurants with high-class, high-brand shopping, fashion, and more. The Eiffel Tower will be approximately 325m tall and will be an office building. The New York area with a Central Park will be about 1 million sqft. The majority of our time is not spent on supervising this project but improving it. We cannot implement the same ideas we had in 2005 now because there is always new technology, new ideas, and new concepts. We have to see how we can modify our project because Dubai is a dynamic city. If you do not change and follow the trends, you will be left behind, and our clients expect the best.</p><h4>How are you attracting foreign investment to this project?</h4><p>Foreign investors look for a secure platform for their investment. Thanks to the government of Dubai, the real estate regulatory authority ensures investments here are safe. We have the Central Bank, which makes such investments safe. An investor also looks for a return on investment (ROI). It is by being creative and being unique that we attract investment and rise above the rest of the market. The only project that has such a unique master plan is the Palm Jumairah. We consider how to implement education and entertainment facilities together, or “edutainment."</p><h4>What is your outlook for the real estate market in the medium term?</h4><p>Many say there is oversupply of real estate in Dubai. It is better to have oversupply than undersupply, which increases the price of rent and living costs and people cannot afford to live here anymore. We have 2020 coming soon and we should start planning for that. We are a country that has our plans, targets, and our goals ready. We look for sustainability for the next 50 years by planning today and will not leave anything to luck or fate. We have to plan today to know where we are going in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main services you offer in the maritime sector?</h4><p>We look after container ships, oil tankers, general cargo vessels, RoRo vessels, and so on and have our own supply boats for delivering people and supplies offshore in Dubai, Fujairah, Khor Fakkan, and Ras al-Khaimah. We have Hull Cleaning Services for cleaning ships' hulls, and we also provide correspondent representation for all of the major P&amp;I clubs.</p><h4>In your opinion, what could be done to increase the local maritime community's competitiveness?</h4><p>The UAE and Dubai in particular has thrived for decades through a healthy mixture of investment, entrepreneurship, competition, and most importantly government departments with a business-friendly approach. No doubt there are market challenges and security concerns that need to be addressed. However, if this free market approach is allowed to continue the UAE will remain competitive with other parts of the region and the world. We have been in the Middle East for 60 years and are very positive about the UAE, the region, and the future of our industry.</p><h4>How aligned is GAC with Dubai's vision of sustainability and green initiatives?</h4><p>Last year we received an award for environmental excellence, which was largely due to three initiatives we undertook last year. We converted our warehouse lighting to LED, which is good for the staff and the environment. We installed a water treatment plant to convert wastewater into usable water, which reduced water consumption for irrigation as well as transportation costs for removing wastewater and bringing in fresh water. Last year we installed a district cooling system for our largest site, which is much more efficient than having independent air conditioning systems. This year we are expanding our warehousing capacity and this will include a water treatment plant and a district cooling system.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>There is a little bit of market pessimism about Dubai's future and the Gulf in general, especially because of oil prices and companies defaulting. I have been in the region since 1988, and in Dubai since 1993, and experience has showed me that there have always been ups and downs but the overall general direction has always been upward. People who have been here for a short period of time may feel a little bit spooked by the downturn in the market. We have confidence in the long-term health of Dubai and the long-term health of this region. This is our most important market and we are very confident. This downturn in the market is an opportunity because when there is a downturn in the logistics business, customers start to look for new solutions, which creates opportunities for us. In the last five years we have been increasingly commercially aggressive and see this as an opportunity rather than a challenge. We tend to view it with a long-term perspective. The long-term perspective for Dubai is healthy and we are not worried about the short term. We have longstanding customers, employees, and confidence in the long-term health of this market, including investment, clients, and government support. This year has started really positively. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>P&amp;O Ports was established at the beginning of 2015 as a subsidiary of PCFC. How will P&amp;O Ports support sustainable development in emerging economies?</h4><p>P&amp;O Ports supports and enhances sustainable development in emerging economies because all of our investments are in ports in emerging economies, primarily in Africa. And because our focus is on smaller, multipurpose ports, our focus is on those ports that most need outside assistance and international best practice in ports management. By doing this we increase the attractiveness of the port to more shipping lines and this grows the local economy and creates jobs.</p><h4>What expertise will P&amp;O Ports employees bring to potential ports and terminals?</h4><p>P&amp;O Ports employees bring decades of experience in investing in and managing ports in emerging markets. The team has been handpicked with a mix of commercial, business development, and operations experience that allows P&amp;O Ports to provide a complete ports solution to its clients.</p><h4>P&amp;O Ports has already signed agreements with Madagascar, Somalia, and Albania to enhance their port infrastructure. What other countries do you see as key markets for your operations?</h4><p>Key markets for P&amp;O Ports for future investments and management agreements are in the emerging economies of Equatorial Guinea and Mauritania. We have a large number of other locations where the governments and port authorities have expressed interest in the value we can add.</p><h4>What major investments will P&amp;O Ports undertake in the near future?</h4><p>The major investments that P&amp;O Ports will be undertaking in the short term are locally in the UAE as well as in Albania and Mauritania. These investments are not always about a large monetary investment but they are also about providing the right set of management skills to help the host governments run their ports efficiently and attract more cargo to their ports through the presence of P&amp;O Ports.</p><h4>There is an increasing demand for smaller port services. How do you see the industry's future growth?</h4><p>There is definitely an increasing demand for smaller port operators. The global container terminal operators focus on very large container terminals with volumes upwards of 1 million TEUs per year. In contrast, there are no port operators today focusing on the small multipurpose terminals that load and unload rice, wheat, wood products, and so on. These types of ports tend to be run by the local public port authority. It is P&amp;O Ports' intention to work with local port authorities to privatize and build an international portfolio of these ports, in the same way that DP World built up a global portfolio of large container terminals.</p><h4>Where do you see P&amp;O Ports in the next five years?</h4><p>In the next five years P&amp;O Ports will operate five to 15 small multi-purpose ports, both in the UAE and in emerging markets in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. The journey will be an exciting one. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DP World has announced plans to build a marina for luxury yachts at Port Rashid. Is Dubai experiencing a growing demand for yacht facilities?</h4><p>Dubai is tapping into the rapidly growing cruise sector and will be a major destination for the finest cruise ships in the world. The development of Mina Rashid Marina supports Dubai's long-term strategy to stimulate growth and development in the already strong tourism sector. Dubai and the UAE are clearly seen as the tourist destination of choice in the region. It has stability, combined with a beautiful setting and modern infrastructure. The rapid increase in arrivals at the Dubai Cruise Terminal season after season is testimony to the commitment of Dubai's government to continue to promote this city's tourism potential. The continuous growth of the general population together with the continuing development of boating culture suggest that additional berths will be necessary to moor a growing number of recreational vessels. The continued growth in travel and tourism should bring larger numbers of transient boaters to Dubai over the next decade and facilities will be required to support and dock these visitors. Mina Rashid Marina will be a high-end and dynamic yachting destination with state-of-the-art facilities for visitors, passengers, captains, and crew of the cruise vessels. The project has many strengths, including its location, deep water, planned upland amenities, pent-up demand, lack of regional supply for super yacht berths, and global interest. The feasibility study suggests that the annual homeport super yacht market represents the primary and dominant super yacht category anticipated for the facility. </p><h4>When will DP World launch construction tenders for Port Rashid Marina?</h4><p>This has still to be decided. We have only just announced the project. The first phase of Mina Rashid Marina is expected in the first quarter of 2018, and will provide berthing for approximate 400 boats—both motor boats and sailing yachts—between 15 and 35 meters in length. In the second phase, berths for super yachts up to 100m and above will be available.</p><h4>In what ways is DP World seeking to increase its business portfolio and investments to support the UAE's economy?</h4><p>DP World is a leading enabler of global trade and an integral part of the supply chain. We operate multiple related businesses, from marine and inland terminals, maritime services, logistics, and ancillary services to technology-driven trade solutions and will continue to explore opportunities in these areas, particularly in faster-growing markets. We have a portfolio of 70 terminals in 31 countries across six continents with a significant presence in both high-growth and mature markets. We aim to be essential to the bright future of global trade, ensuring everything we do has a long-lasting positive impact on economies and society.</p><h4>Global trade is facing challenging times. How do you think the sector will evolve in the next five years?</h4><p>Our vision is to be a leader of global trade and our business is one for the long term—we look over the horizon. Our agreements are typically over 40 years on average given that maritime and inland container deports are national assets and pillars of economies. The drive to automation and innovation with new technologies will shape the trade and logistics sector over the next five years as operators seek greater efficiencies to differentiate themselves.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>We reported 3% volume growth in 2015, handling 61.7 million TEUs across our global portfolio of container terminals. Despite the uncertain near-term macro environment, and given the high utilization of our portfolio, we remain confident about the medium- to long-term outlook of our industry and continue to invest to meet the future capacity requirements of our customers. As we look ahead into 2016, we look forward to the new capacity at Rotterdam, Mumbai, Prince Rupert (Canada), and Yarımca (Turkey) to deliver a full-year contribution to our throughput. We expect to open our third berth at London Gateway in mid-2016, adding 600,000 TEUs of new capacity. The additional 2 million TEU at terminal three Jebel Ali (UAE) will be operational in the second half of 2016. We have once again delivered ahead of market throughput growth in 2015 and given this resilient performance, we remain confident of meeting full-year market expectations. While trading conditions in 2016 are expected to remain challenging, we believe a portfolio focused on faster-growing markets and origin and destination cargo, coupled with the addition of new capacity, can continue to outperform the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways does the authority promote the local maritime sector's competitiveness globally?</h4><p>The DMCA works in close collaboration with various organizations from both the public and private sectors to further strengthen Dubai's position at the regional and international levels as one of the world's leading maritime hubs. We maintain close ties with our partners to develop and deploy regulations and initiatives to boost the local maritime sector's competitiveness. The Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy (DMSS), a first-of-its-kind initiative established to regulate, develop, and promote the maritime industry, has helped drive the Emirate's sustainable and vibrant maritime industry toward excellence, creativity, and innovation. We continue to participate in local and international maritime trade fairs and conferences to highlight Dubai's maritime strength, growth and development strategies, and lucrative opportunities in the local sector along with its world-class infrastructure, favorable environment for business, and investment-friendly regulations.</p><h4>What are the DMCA initiatives that contribute to Dubai's competitiveness across the international maritime industry?</h4><p>In 2015, the DMCA successfully represented the UAE across prominent international forums, showcasing Dubai's leading experience as a major player on the global maritime map. Through our proactive initiatives, the DMCA has contributed significantly toward the fulfillment of the prediction of the international report issued by Menon Business Economics Group in Norway that Dubai will rank among the world's top seven leading maritime centers by 2020. The Dubai Maritime Sector Strategy has helped raise the level of confidence of regional and international investors and promoted the competitive advantages to be gained from the local maritime sector. The strategy is helping develop legislative infrastructure and maritime services and building a business- and investment-friendly environment as well. Dubai is among the world's top 10 players in terms of the competitiveness and attractiveness of its maritime cluster components.</p><h4>The DMCA launched the Dubai Maritime Agenda 2015 for the first time in the Middle East. What were the major conclusions drawn from this event?</h4><p>Attended by pioneers of the maritime sector, decision makers, senior government figures, and regional and international experts, the Dubai Maritime Agenda 2015 was a tremendous success. It emerged as a platform for high-level strategic discussions that assessed the growing role of Dubai in supporting global maritime sector growth through an ambitious policy that adopts the latest creative and innovative solutions to build a secure, renewable, and sustainable maritime sector. The Dubai Maritime Agenda manifests Dubai's emerging leadership as an international hub of maritime excellence and innovation. The Dubai Maritime Agenda 2015 achieved its core objective of promoting communication channels to industry professionals to develop a clear vision on present and future challenges and potential opportunities, particularly with regards to technological innovation, legislative excellence, and training and human investment. It also reviewed the DMCA's prominent maritime achievements and the latest initiatives to make Dubai one of the world's best international maritime capitals in the next five years, including the Maritime Sector Strategy, the Emirates Maritime Arbitration Centre, and the Dubai Maritime Training Centre.</p><h4>How can smart applications help in Dubai's maritime growth?</h4><p>The DMCA is expected to launch more apps as part of its comprehensive portfolio of smart applications, which are aimed toward showcasing more interaction within the maritime segment. In fact, the authority's recently launched Smart DMCA app has already garnered an overwhelming response from the maritime community. The integrated app provides key information about the DMCA's operations, along with many interactive features. Other applications include Smart Marine Traffic, which helps track the movement of marine transport in Dubai, and Smart Customer, which provides clients with a smart platform for maritime services. Smart Exam is a quantum leap in terms of evaluating the competency of clients who wish to apply for a marine craft driving license without having to visit DMCA headquarters. Also launched were Smart Inspector, a smart channel to complete inspections, update data, and issue maritime exam results directly and electronically, while Smart Employee provides DMCA's staff immediate and direct access to all internal systems and services using smart devices anytime, anywhere. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Built around  Happiness]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[built-around-happiness]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main reason behind the rebranding of Dubai South?</h4><p>Dubai World Central rebranded to Dubai South for several good reasons. The new name gives the city a stronger and more distinct identity. It communicates the sheer scale of the city and indicates the direction in which Dubai is now expanding geographically as well as figuratively. Figuratively, because Dubai South has been described as the Emirate's flagship urban project that aims to achieve the happiness goals of Dubai Vision 2021. This vision, as outlined by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, directs that Dubai strive to become a city of happy, empowered, and creative people, since happiness is the true measure of successful governance. And since Dubai South is being built around the happiness of the individual, it is also taglined the “The City of You."</p><h4>What are the main features of Dubai South?</h4><p>Dubai South is a master-planned smart city measuring 145sqkm. It has eight integrated districts; residential, commercial, aviation, logistics, golf, exhibition, humanitarian, and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), which will become the largest airport in the world upon its completion. As a city, Dubai South will support a population of around 1 million people. It is a growing platform that is hosting an ever-wider range of business and industrial activity. That said, the city lends itself naturally to the aviation and logistics sectors. Ultimately, the city, with its various free zones, will generate about half a million jobs.</p><h4>How well connected is Dubai South to the rest of Dubai?</h4><p>It is well connected, both in terms of travel times and transport services. The city is served by three arterial roads; Sheikh Zayed Road, Emirates Road, and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road. The RTA runs regular bus services that shuttle regularly between Ibn Battuta Metro Station and the Al Maktoum Airport, running through Dubai South. Bus services will be expanded to keep up with the increasing people traffic. RTA has also announced plans for the extension of the metro line. The Purple Line is scheduled for completion in time for World Expo 2020. In terms of travel time, Dubai South is located just a 20-minute drive away from Dubai Marina, and 50 minutes away from Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>What are you doing to attract foreign investment to Dubai South?</h4><p>All of our investors appreciate the unique position Dubai South enjoys vis-í -vis its ability to function as the region's main aerial gateway. They also know that this advantage will grow exponentially once air traffic at Al Maktoum International (DWC) surges. Also, the Jebel Ali Sea Port is just a 10-minute drive away from the gates of Dubai South, and the port and Al Maktoum International is just 15 minutes away. The outstanding location offers unparalleled opportunities for aviation and logistics players who want to move their sea-to-air goods in record times to serve the emerging markets of the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. We have also prepared a broad range of assets and solutions for all kinds of businesses that are looking to set up shop here—one more advantage our investors appreciate. In terms of investor outreach, we continually communicate our value proposition to various target markets in North America, the sub-continent, Europe, China, and Africa. We organize international roadshows from time to time, and have an active calendar in terms of participation in key events globally.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Dubai South?</h4><p>We are working to become the manifestation of Dubai Vision 2021, to establish a city of happy, empowered, and creative people. In terms of realizing HH Sheikh Mohammed's vision to make Dubai the aviation capital of the world, Dubai South will meet its role by becoming the epicenter of aviation activity. We are also growing a world-class business and industry platform that serves as a powerful engine for economic diversification and GDP generation. Dubai South is thus aiming to become the preferred place in which to live, work, and invest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is FedEx coping with the increasing demand from the health sector for your services?</h4><p>The Middle East's healthcare industry is growing in tandem with an expanding population. Our customers from this industry need the reassurance that their sensitive shipments will be delivered reliably and safely. We launched two new healthcare solutions from our temperature-controlled packaging at the Arab Health 2016 Exhibition in 2016. FedEx Cold Shipping Solutions includes cold shipping packaging for goods requiring a refrigerated environment and can maintain a temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 96 hours. This packaging is designed to be easy to use, reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly for healthcare industry use. FedEx Deep Frozen Shipping Solutions use liquid nitrogen dry vapor technology to maintain a temperature of minus 150 degrees Celsius for up to 10 days. These solutions remove the need for hazardous materials certification and eliminate dry ice packaging. FedEx Deep Frozen Shipping solutions also offer reduced environmental impact.</p><h4>What is the importance of public-private sector collaborations today?</h4><p>There is much to gain from collaboration between the public and private sectors. The private sector has a substantial amount of knowledge to share. Industry consultation is an extremely important component in the development of infrastructure. There are several examples of the value a private sector company can bring to a project when called upon as a consultant. Dubai Customs Authority's Mirsal 2 is the perfect example. Indeed, FedEx worked closely with the Dubai Customs Authority to design and develop Mirsal 2, the first online clearance tool in the Middle East, and share its industry expertise. As a key global logistics industry player, we know the unique requirements of our customers, enabling us to make precise suggestions on what can be improved. Governments around the world understand and seize the need to develop infrastructure to increase efficiencies across numerous sectors. It has become increasingly common for government entities to seek advice from those who have the greatest sector expertise when initiating projects. This enables them to fully consider the specific nuances required in order to develop a particular project with optimum performances. FedEx believes there is great value to expanding consultation and collaborative efforts with governments on a diverse range of areas. By engaging with businesses in the development stage, governments can build stronger infrastructure that is highly beneficial and that benefits from a higher degree of sustainability.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>FedEx is geared up to leverage opportunities that today's environment offers. For example, the rapid adoption of technology and the extensive reach of the internet are allowing more economies to participate in global trade. By providing improved air and ground transportation solutions, FedEx is facilitating this growth. It is anticipated that global trade will accelerate in the coming years. Much of that is driven by the rapid rise of the middle-class in emerging economies including the Middle East, Africa, and India. These economies are undoubtedly thriving because of their excellent connection to the world's economy. These economies are also growing at a faster pace than the world's average growth, making the MEISA region an integral part of the FedEx global growth initiative. For companies operating in the logistics sector in the UAE, both developments of infrastructure and consumers' purchasing behavior bring their own set of opportunities. For instance, consumers have increased awareness of new e-shopping platforms and are armed with multiple devices and payment methods to acquire unique products or cheaper deals that are not available in their own markets. Looking ahead, this sector will have to increase capacity and introduce innovative solutions in order to cater to a rapidly expanding and evolving market. With e-commerce growing at a rapid pace, SMEs are gaining access to global markets, which definitely changes the way they are doing business. FedEx will keep supporting and enabling this growth by connecting SMEs globally through our world-class network, competitive transit times and extensive range of international and domestic solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the aviation industry and the role Emirates has played in it?</h4><p>Aviation is a vital part of the increasingly globalized world economy and has facilitated momentous growth for international trade, tourism, and international investment, in addition to efficiently connecting people across continents. Aviation is one of the main engines driving Dubai's emergence as a global center for trade, commerce, and tourism, which is why the government created a business and regulatory environment that supports its growth by encouraging open competition through open skies policies and efficient operations. As a result, aviation and its direct, indirect, and induced outputs will account for more than 17% of Dubai's total workforce by 2020. I believe aviation and air travel has a promising future, but only if everyone involved in this sector—the industry, governments, regulators, and local communities—work together in the long-term interests of all stakeholders.</p><h4>How can the burden of congested airspace be alleviated in the Middle East?</h4><p>At the moment, air traffic control is manageable, but we know where the issues are, as we have six international airports sharing the same airspace here in the Gulf. We are evaluating a number of air traffic management solutions. Governments in the region understand the criticality of making airspace management feasible for all, and I anticipate progress in the next two years.</p><h4>How can the UAE maintain its edge as one of the world's leaders in aviation?</h4><p>The UAE can maintain its edge because we are fortunate enough to have visionary leaders who understand that the right mix of geography, modern infrastructure, innovative products and services, and, most importantly, people, will help the UAE keep its edge over the competition. For example, Dubai's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, has been at the foundation of Emirates' success in building a global hub for travelers and cargo. We serve about one-third of the world's population within a four-hour flying radius, two-thirds of the world's population within an eight-hour flying radius, and almost 90% of the world's population with non-stop flights using the latest ultra-long range aircraft. Geography is only part of the story. A clear vision was put in place for the right infrastructure, systems, and investments needed to build a global destination. Good products will keep us ahead and will help us win new customers and loyal fans. For Emirates, this means flying modern aircraft that are efficient to operate, and ensuring we have the latest onboard features to guarantee our customers get the best value and experience. Last but not least, it is people. Recruiting and retaining the best people from around the world and bringing together the best insights and practices will continue to contribute to our success.</p><h4>What are Emirates Airline's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>Emirates' rapid growth has reflected that of Dubai's. In 2015, we flew 51.3 million passengers on 240 aircraft. In 2020, when Dubai hosts the World Expo, we expect to be flying 70 million passengers on about 300 aircraft. We will receive 37 new aircraft this year, and will also retire 26 older aircraft to keep our fleet young, modern, and efficient. We will launch services to more new cities including Yinchuan and Zhengzhou in China, Cebu and Clark in the Philippines, Yangon in Myanmar, and Hanoi in Vietnam. There will be more developments, so watch this space. We believe there is still great potential for the airline—and Dubai—to grow even further. For Emirates, one of the keys to unlocking that potential will be the new Al Maktoum International airport (DWC). The new airport at DWC will not only feature the latest technologies for a better passenger experience, but also open up much needed capacity to accommodate the expansion of our fleet and operations. As always, we will remain focused on growth, and take advantage of opportunities that work for the business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which upcoming rail project will attract the most attention?</h4><p>The RTA's efforts will cover all the elements of the transport system including public transport and road infrastructure, whilst focusing on integration between different systems and their surroundings. RTA is currently working on “Route 2020," a 15.5km extension of the Dubai Metro Redline to the Expo 2020 site. The line also serves many major developments, including the Discovery Gardens and the Green Community. Other main rail projects that will be under consideration in the coming years include the Redline extension toward Academic City. RTA will also be procuring more trains to meet the fast-growing demand on the current metro system and will foster and expand the bus feeder system to serve the new metro stations. In addition, the bus network will be subjected to continuous optimization and expansion to serve newly developed areas. All these public transport efforts will support RTA in achieving its aim of holding a 20% share in Dubai's public transport by 2020.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Dubai Water Canal project offer to investors?</h4><p>The Dubai Water Canal project will link the Business Bay District with the Arabian Gulf. It aims to strengthen the position of Dubai as a tourist destination and the new area is expected to attract 20 to 22 million visitors a year in addition to encouraging tourist mass transit, while maritime transport is expected to carry more than 6 million passengers per year. The channel will add 6km to the waterfront of Dubai, while the project will provide an area of over 80,000sqm dedicated to public spaces and amenities. Undertaken collectively by Meydan and Meraas Holdings, the project will feature a cast of deluxe luxury houses, footpaths, and cycling tracks, as well as deluxe retail outlets, luxury hotels, and gourmet restaurants.</p><h4>What initiatives is the RTA launching to reduce the carbon footprint?</h4><p>RTA recently announced its plan to convert 50% of Dubai's taxi fleet into hybrid cabs by 2021. Also, the Dubai Metro will reduce CO2 emissions by over 770 tons per day by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and reducing congestion. Furthermore, the Dubai Tram lays claim to several firsts. It is the first turnkey tramway or light rail system in the Middle East. Its ground-based power supply system employs cutting-edge technology that energizes the current rail beneath the tram as it passes. This is considered safer than conventional overhead catenary-type systems, and encourages the public to use public transportation and reduces CO2 emissions. In 2013 the RTA deployed seven electric-powered buses fitted with electronic motors instead of the traditional diesel motors, and the project has been broadened to include 17 buses. Also, the RTA has launched CNG-powered buses instead of diesel-powered ones to improve the marine transit service between the two shores of the Dubai Creek. In relation to RTA public buses, we have started a trial for an electric bus powered by battery systems and a trial for a CNG-operated bus.</p><h4>What is RTA's strategy for the next five years?</h4><p>We will continue improving Dubai's transportation system with a particular focus on optimization and integration. In this context, RTA has established a transportation integration department that has the mandate to look after the integration of different transport systems and modes. In March 2016 we launched the Dubai Transportation Integration Manual, which established the guidelines and requirements of integration at different levels of area and project planning, design, and operation with a focus on improving travelers' experiences within the first and last miles of their trips. The manual will be proactively applied to all of the RTA's new projects and will be used to improve the levels of integration at existing metro and bus stations. The RTA's strategy will also focus on improving services provided to the public. The RTA Smart City program, which includes introducing new applications and technologies, will contribute to the achievement of the Dubai government's public happiness goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year was incredibly good for Infiniti Middle East in terms of the company's performance. How would you assess your 2015 operations?</h4><p>On a global level, Infiniti achieved a new sales record for the 2015 calendar year with the sale of more than 215,000 cars for the first time ever, up 16% from the previous year. The situation was very similar here in the Middle East, where we sold over 8,300 cars, at a growth rate of 18%. What is also important for us is that with this result we have maintained our position as one of the fastest growing premium automotive brands in the market. Moreover, we have grown three times quicker than the market. This is always an important benchmark for us as we strive to be ahead of the market performance.</p><h4>Infiniti is already an independent, stand-alone brand from Nissan. What was the reason behind this and why did the company want to create this separation?</h4><p>This transition is related to the customer experience. Infiniti is the premium brand for the Nissan Corporation and we deliver what a premium customer expects. We have made a lot of progress on those in 2015. We have new centres in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, and two in Abu Dhabi. Obviously this is not the end of the process with further expansions in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE. Being exclusive is not only about hardware and selling in a premium environment, it is also about giving our staff all the training and preparation they need to treat our premium customers in the right way. We are still very much a part of the Nissan Corporation; however, we operate as an independent premium brand.</p><h4>How is Infiniti adapting to the global trend of autonomous driving?</h4><p>This is a big trend in the automotive industry: autonomous driving. The industry is investing in this principle and the Nissan Corporation has announced that by 2020 it will have more than 10 products that have features for autonomous driving. Looking at it from a very basic perspective, the first step to autonomous driving is cruise control and this has been available in the market for many years now. When people think about the autonomous concept they usually look to the final stage as opposed to the various phases that are required to get there. Currently Infiniti is very much a part of these stages, some of which already exist in our vehicles, which in turn come relatively close to this futuristic fully autonomous world of driving. For example, the Q50 has a lane departure warning and prevention feature and a predictive forward collision warning system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Dubai need to do to become an F&amp;B manufacturing hub?</h4><p>There are a lot of positives for Dubai to become a hub. It already is a hub for trading because it has great ports, great infrastructure, great communication, a business-friendly environment, places for conferences and meetings, and is a great place for people to visit. It boasts great entertainment and solid services. All of these things have helped to turn Dubai into a hub for the Middle East and now it is expanding beyond. All of these are positives. As far as manufacturing, it is a little bit more challenging because the competitive advantages of Dubai are less visible. Normally people look for the lowest cost of production to set up a manufacturing facility. That would be difficult in Dubai because of energy costs and limited land space. However, there is an opportunity for Dubai to become a strong hub for high-quality manufacturing with value added versus commodities. Brands and products that have a certain premium image can be manufactured in Dubai.  I do not foresee Dubai ever becoming a low-cost producer, although the costs can be lower than they are today. There has been a lot of research done to see how manufacturers can reduce their costs and become more competitive. I foresee Dubai as potentially becoming a high-quality producer with great service and a great place to do business overall.</p><h4>What initiatives has Dubai Refreshment put forth to push the food and beverage industry here in Dubai?</h4><p>Established in 1959, Dubai Refreshment is one of the oldest manufacturing companies in the UAE. Certainly, we played a big role in establishing the beverage industry in general, being one of the first. The way we drink a beverage is different today than it was before in terms of the type of package, size of package, and range of flavors. Therefore, we developed our business accordingly. We have also introduced new beverages, such as Lipton iced tea and Frutz juice. We are constantly expanding our product portfolio to meet consumer needs. As consumers become more sophisticated, they want more variety. They want a beverage that addresses different occasions. There are functional drinks, drinks for treats, drinks for quenching thirst, and so on. People drink for different reasons and we are trying to address different consumer needs through our beverage portfolio. Our revenue has generally been growing in the mid-single digits. The export part of the business is volatile and at times impacts the topline. We try to balance that out by having a very consistent local business. This has helped us maintain steady growth in profitability despite some sales volatility. We are trying to reduce that volatility by expanding the countries we export to. Rather than relying on one or two countries with big volumes, we want to have 40 countries consistently buying from the US. We are also trying to expand the range of products and packages that we sell.</p><h4>How are you expanding your capabilities?</h4><p>The new facilities will open at the beginning of 2016. There is a lot of technology that goes into beverage production. There is a new product range we can produce that we could not do before. The speed of production is also increasing. Now we can have lines that require less labor because of the technology. We can have lines that have much better quality control because of technology. We can also use lines that require a lot less energy and have much lower carbon footprints. Overall, we have invested in equipment that is more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and uses less energy. Our new factory can produce up to 120 million cases per year. In the initial stages it will be around 70 million cases, and then over the next 30 years we will gradually increase production to full capacity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cool-districts]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest projects Empower is involved in at the moment?</h4><p>Empower has started some major projects this year with a number of plants under development. For example, we have the Jumeirah Beach project, which will involve a new 35,000-ton plant room. We are taking existing business and converting it into district cooling. This means people have accepted the concept of district cooling and are subscribing more and more to it. We are doing the same thing in the Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone (TECOM Area C), where we are putting in a huge new plant room, along with two more plant rooms in Ghuroob Mirdif and another in Business Bay. We are also working closely with other investors on projects such as Dubai Lagoon and the Dubai Design District (d3) and are also working toward bidding for Expo 2020 projects. Energy is one of the main themes for Dubai Expo 2020 and we are trying to be part of this. We need to encourage the use of district cooling and green buildings. This environmental vision is really supporting the whole economy as people understand the disadvantages of climate change and the benefits of good energy practices.</p><h4>Some people still argue that district cooling is not an efficient and cost-effective method. Why do you think people still have this view?</h4><p>We started district cooling 12 years ago and faced inhibitions from customers in adopting district cooling. Today, the technology is being accepted widely and the industry is growing tremendously, which means we can actually show that it works and is much more cost-effective.</p><h4>Empower has created a world-class, state-of-the-art Command Control Centre. What is the ultimate purpose of this center?</h4><p>This is the first command control system in the world for district cooling. HH Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister, and the Ruler of Dubai, is driving Dubai to be a smart city and as part of this we have created a smart system whereby, for example, we know if there is a problem in our network before the consumer realizes. We are aiming to be proactive as well as responsive to customers. By prioritizing customers this adds value to the industry itself. Our Command Control Center technology also enables the system to be controlled from one place and one engineer can operate more than 10 plant rooms—we currently have 65 in total. The system saves on manpower, increases efficiency, reduces electricity consumption, and optimizes usage. All the benefits go to the stakeholders, meaning the government, the state electricity grid, the consumers, and Empower</p><h4>What green initiatives is Empower implementing?</h4><p>Everything we have done over the years is in support of green buildings and green technology as part of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's long-term national initiative to build a green economy in the UAE under the slogan: “A green economy for sustainable development.“ We are now using gray water (treated sewage effluents) instead of potable water, which we need to conserve. We are also using thermal energy storage (TSE) tanks in each plant room and collecting water during the lower load periods in the evenings. We store and chill this water and then discharge it during the peak energy-use hours of day. This technology thus saves electricity usage and reduces energy consumption.</p><h4>The region's district cooling market is forecast to grow by more than 16% over the next five years. What is your outlook?</h4><p>At the moment we have 70% of the Dubai market and in the region we have close to a 50-60% share. It is important to understand that while district cooling might be a luxury in some parts of the world, such as the US or South Asia, in Dubai it is a necessity. It is impossible to live in this climate without some form of air conditioning, but conventional air conditioning makes up around 70% of electricity bills here. District cooling halves this amount.</p><h4>In February Empower decided to halt plans to launch an IPO. Why did you decide not to go ahead?</h4><p>The market conditions do not support this at the moment. Empower is reflecting good profit margins with a high turnover, and the company is performing very well. For the time being we are working on acquisitions, then we can think about an IPO. At the moment, our projects are properly and sufficiently funded institutionally, so it is not in our immediate preferential list, and an IPO is just another way of accessing funds, after all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENOC recently signed an MoU with Emirates Environmental Group (EEG) to promote local environmental education. In what ways is ENOC implementing environmentally friendly sustainability practices in its operations?</h4><p>True sustainability can only be achieved if we transform the way that businesses think and operate. ENOC is evolving in a way that aligns with this philosophy. We are keen participants in the UAE's environmental protection imperatives, working closely with the UAE Supreme Energy Council and Dubai Carbon on strategic initiatives of demand-side management, carbon footprint reduction measures, and contributing to energy diversification. Our approach is aligned with the goals of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy (DIES), which are to reduce energy demand by 30% by 2030 and to diversify the Emirate's energy mix. In 2008, we adopted a scientific Energy &amp; Resource Management (E&amp;RM) Policy and manual ahead of the launch of ISO 50001. We have also rolled out ambitious initiatives to reduce the company's carbon footprint. We opened the Middle East's first green service station and are working heavily on promoting the use of cleaner, greener fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and biofuels as alternative automotive fuels. All of our service stations in the ENOC/EPPCO network are now providing ultra-low-sulfur diesel. This is in alignment with the UAE Federal Cabinet decree aimed at improving the UAE's standards of diesel fuel from 500ppm to 10ppm, whereby all commercial diesel vehicles and equipment motorists are to use the ultra-low-sulfur diesel that matches Euro 5 standards. There is a perception that green equals expensive, but from our experience this thinking is far from reality. The financial impact of ENOC's quick win efforts toward sustainability has been encouraging. An investment of AED600,000 has yielded savings of almost three times that amount. In terms of business plans, the expected annual savings is $6.9 million, with a payback period of just two years. Being green makes business sense, and we hope that organizations here and abroad realize this.</p><h4>The aviation industry in the UAE is growing at an exponential rate What opportunities does this offer to ENOC?</h4><p>We provide the jet fuel that powers aircraft that fly to and from Dubai. The expansion of the airport facilities led us to launch Project Falcon, a unique opportunity that will fulfill more than half of the total jet fuel demand of Dubai's two airports. Project Falcon is a 58km pipeline from our storage facilities in Jebel Ali directly to both airports, ensuring a safe, reliable, and consistent source of jet fuel for airplanes. Phase I, linking Jebel Ali and Dubai International Airport, has been operational since November 2015. The extension, which will link Jebel Ali and Al Maktoum International Airport, is currently being constructed and is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2018.</p><h4>ENOC also recently acquired Dragon Oil, and you operate across MENA, Asia, and Europe through more than 30 active subsidiaries and joint ventures. What is the impact of these projects?</h4><p>The acquisition of Dragon Oil was a distinctive milestone in ENOC's growth story, making us a vertically integrated oil and gas player that is well positioned to strengthen our nation's energy security. This investment not only adds an upstream arm to ENOC, but also has significant potential for the emirate of Dubai as a whole. This combination allows ENOC to partner, compete, and grow with leading international oil and gas companies and regional national oil companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key to AWR's long-term success?</h4><p>Our vision for 2020 is to increase our revenues to $5 billion, more than double last year's $2 billion revenues. It is not the first time we have set such growth goals. We did it in 2009 during the global economic crisis; while competitors were undergoing layoffs and cutbacks in operations, we were expanding and we found that this was the right decision. The situation is not as challenging as it was in 2009 when the drop in the market was around 40-42%. We still project a marginal market growth in 2016 or in the worst case it may remain flat, but definitely there is no contraction.</p><h4>Sales of Chinese vehicles are expected to grow dramatically in the coming years. What effects will Chinese brands have in the UAE market?</h4><p>We project that China will play a strong role in the automobile market, and this is the reason why we had partnered with SAIC—the largest Chinese automotive group—and have now partnered with Dongfeng Motors (DFM), the second largest Chinese automotive group. In UAE, Chinese vehicles account for 2.5% of the total industry volume, but by 2020 they are expected to have 10% market share and will show a similar trend throughout the GCC as well. Several Chinese automotive companies have already established their base in the UAE and have been increasing their local presence at a rapid pace. In addition, Chinese vehicles have started gaining popularity because of increased focus placed by these companies on accurately understanding the requirements of customers in this region. As a recognized automotive player, we are keen to work closely with our Chinese automotive partners to provide exciting products and services to ensure a long-term, enjoyable driving experience for UAE owners of Chinese vehicles.</p><h4>What is your outlook for electric cars in the UAE?</h4><p>The traditional systems and processes used in cars cannot further guarantee an increase in market share. This is the reason why we see more disruptive technologies being integrated into automobiles, transforming them into hybrid or fully electric vehicles. The UAE is the only country in the region that already has electric cars, an initiative that has been pioneered by Arabian Automobiles jointly with Renault. In April 2015, we held the first ever Electric Vehicle Conference in UAE, where I discussed electric vehicles and their impact. The UAE will celebrate its 50th year of the union in 2021, and we aspire to have approximately 10,000 electric vehicles in Dubai by then. Furthermore, the Emirates Authority for Standardization &amp; Methodology (ESMA) officially recognized electric vehicles at the end of 2015. We are on the fast track, and as the regulations are coming, insurance companies will begin to recognize electric vehicles and all the distributors will be ready to offer their respective products and services. While Dubai aspires to be the smartest city in the world, it is equally important to build a greener city to support future generations. Electric vehicles are a vital component in this strategy and will support Dubai's vision to be the smartest city by promoting sustainable transportation. Replacing one traditional gasoline vehicle with an electric vehicle is equivalent to planting 100 trees.</p><h4>In fact, replacing 10,000 gasoline cars with electric vehicles could transform Dubai to become as green as a forest of a million trees by 2021.How do you expect the automotive industry to evolve in 2016?</h4><p>Based on today's market conditions, we still project marginal market growth in 2016 or in the worst case it may remain flat. Every distributor today wants to maintain their market share amidst these tough market conditions. However, AWR Automotive is fully focused on growing its market share by adopting the right strategies. We are on the right track, the direction is clear, and this is why we are considered by our principals as the regional leader in selling Nissan, Infiniti, and Renault automobiles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DEWA is working to achieve the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 goal to reduce energy demand by 30%. What strategy are you following in order to achieve this?</h4><p>The Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 had initially set the percentage of renewable energy in Dubai's energy mix at 1% by 2020 and 5% by 2030. With the success of the solar park, DEWA has raised the target to 7% by 2020 and 15% by 2030. Dubai recognizes the importance of developing the renewable and alternative energy sectors, as well as the need to form innovative means and methods to improve efficiency, reduce consumption of natural resources, and find alternative solutions to conventional energy. DEWA leads by example internationally by implementing pioneering methods of sustainability, ensuring quality services in the Emirate of Dubai and advocating the conservation of natural resources through innovative projects and initiatives. In addition to all of the projects mentioned, DEWA and Etihad Energy Service Company (Etihad ESCO) have signed two comprehensive energy savings performance contracts (ESPC) at a combined value of AED37 million to improve and enhance overall energy efficiency in the lighting infrastructure at the power plants at Jebel Ali, Al Awir, and seven DEWA-owned buildings, including its headquarters.</p><h4>DEWA recently invited residential and building owners to use Shams Dubai's photovoltaic (PV) panels as part of Smart Dubai. What other initiatives are you promoting as part of this?</h4><p>Through this initiative, DEWA's customers can install PV panels on houses and buildings to produce electricity. This contributes to the diversification of energy sources by using renewable energy and exporting any surplus to DEWA's grid. We are launching outreach campaigns for tenants and building owners, explaining how to install photovoltaic solar panels to generate electricity. One of the other initiatives we are launching is the smart meter initiative that focuses on using applications through smart meters and grids and provides many smart features and applications for customers. We have currently installed 200,000 smart meters and will be replacing all mechanical and electromechanical meters over the coming years. DEWA has adopted a strategy and roadmap for the Smart Networks project valued at AED7 billion. The project aims to enhance the infrastructure that supports the demand side management program and the initiative to connect all renewable energy sources. Smart meters will speed up service connection, improve response times, provide instant reconnection of electricity, and rationalize consumption to enhance the happiness and wellbeing of citizens and residents while supporting resource sustainability. The Green Charger initiative aims to establish the infrastructure to build 100 electric vehicle-charging stations this year. DEWA has already completed its first phase and built 16 Green Charger stations, and installed a further 84 stations by the end of 2015. DEWA is establishing the necessary infrastructure in collaboration with several stakeholders, including car manufacturers, airports, the Dubai Municipality, shopping malls, petrol stations, the Roads &amp; Transport Authority (RTA), hotels, car parking operators, and other facilities.</p><h4>What do you think should be done in order to reduce water wastage?</h4><p>We are making significant efforts to reduce water wastage. We have recently launched a new awareness campaign with the theme “Every Drop Matters" to raise awareness among Dubai's residents about the need to rationalize water use. This is done through the adoption of environmentally friendly practices and behavior to reduce water wastage and ensure sustainability for generations to come. The campaign coincided with World Water Week held in Stockholm under the theme “Water for Development." The Every Drop Matters campaign is part of the awareness initiatives and programs that DEWA launches periodically to encourage all of society to use natural resources responsibly. On a separate note, with regard to distribution of water, we have achieved outstanding results in service efficiency, reliability, and availability. The results have surpassed even the private sector. Water network losses decreased to 9.1%, compared to 15% in North America, achieving leading global results in reducing water wastage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SunGard works very closely with the Dubai Financial Market. What have been the main benefits of this partnership?</h4><p>A large part of SunGard's business is focused on capital markets. This region's capital markets are now attracting significant investment and interest from other parts of the world. We have partnered with the Dubai Financial Market in order to help and promote capital markets in the region. In fact, we have similar arrangements with a number of exchanges such as Borsa Istanbul in Turkey.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of transparency through automated and integrated solutions by companies in the region?</h4><p>Having a reliance on technology and integrated solutions helps in two ways. Number one is the ability to give clients better services. If there is not a proper solution and proper services to provide customers then there is a risk of losing those customers. The second one is cost: Once there are proper integrated solutions, then efficiency increases and that should positively contribute to any cost reduction. </p><h4>How can financial institutions take advantage of social media, and what role does SunGard play in this?</h4><p>In the Middle East there are financial institutions that have invested significantly into their technology, including integrated social media platforms. I do not think it is just an option anymore as the end user expects these types of solutions from their provider. Also, companies want to keep track of their reputation in the market. We have solutions that can help institutions monitor internally what goes out on social media and gather data from social media related to their reputation. I think this is a very powerful tool that organizations can take advantage of.</p><h4>What are the key requirements for Islamic banks to position themselves in the global market?</h4><p>Islamic banking differs not only by region or by country, but by individual banks themselves. A key element for global positioning for these banks is flexibility. Using technology helps clients adopt sharia-compliant practices, which differ from bank to bank, whilst still taking into account the more general global standards of Islamic banking.</p><h4>SunGard recently expanded to Turkey with the implementation of Front Arena trading solution to FinansInvest. What opportunities do you see in the Turkish market?</h4><p>The Turkish market is a very interesting market. If you look at GDP, Turkey was still growing when Europe was facing challenges. The Turkish currency was not the best performer in 2015, but it is a very active market, especially on the capital markets front. Turkey and its capital markets are changing, particularly in terms of technology and in allowing new types of trading. Turkish banks are also restructuring themselves to create “Chinese walls“ between capital markets trading and investment banking, like their western counterparts. A few other factors include a growing derivatives exchange, new instruments entering the market, and European investment in Turkey. When it comes to opening up to international markets, Turkish banks have to adopt solutions that have an international reach. SunGard solutions has helped FinansInvest in the Turkish market and become more internationally recognized; we are helping it to attract more clients and be able to make decisions quickly. We are very pleased to be in the Turkish market at this time. Our solutions have proven to be quite successful by combining the best international standards and quick implementation; giving clients exactly what they want. This market has requirements and our solution is a natural fit. Because of that, we have increased our focus in Turkey and expanded our office. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the competition in the UAE?</h4><p>Competition in the insurance sector in the UAE is fierce. It is a competitive market and there are too many insurers in the UAE. Having said that, the UAE has growth opportunities even in the current climate where we are experiencing a slowing down in projects, company spending, and potential growth. This will have an impact on insurance, if not now then certainly in the near future. Even with growth in mind, there are too many insurers competing for market share. The pricing of insurance is depressed and consequently so is profitability. In 2016 the insurance sector will be challenged quite significantly by new regulations and a continued softening of prices. This will also add to the complexity of working in the insurance sector from 2016. One of our strategic initiatives is to protect the growth that we have experienced over the last three years. I do not envisage such significant growth in 2016, but we are aiming to continue to grow business profitability and focus on the right risks. We also want to improve on our customer service and technology. We have new products that are now available for the retail market. We are aiming to expand this in 2016 as we continue to develop more online and digital capability for retail clients.</p><h4>What accounts for the success of the UAE's insurance sector within the region?</h4><p>It stems from the open-market economy. The way the UAE government allows businesses to thrive is very entrepreneurial. However, in the next couple of years I predict Saudi Arabia will become the largest GCC country in terms of insurance premiums. That is not a reflection of the UAE, but Saudi Arabia has introduced certain measures around the pricing of insurance that have helped it increase profitability. The Saudis have introduced a form of price structuring, whereas the UAE still adopts a very open market. I think that the UAE insurance sector's success has been driven largely by the success of the UAE economy. They go hand in hand. We have seen the economy rising over the last 15 years in particular, and obviously the need for insurance has increased alongside that, both in the commercial and retail sectors. The commercial segment has expanded to deal with the new buildings, infrastructure, roads, public works, and projects. That has then filtered down into the retail side with more expatriates coming to the UAE and a growing Emirati population. The need to bring people, business, and services to the UAE to help encourage commercial growth has led to an increase in both the commercial and retail insurance markets.</p><h4>Health insurance was recently made compulsory in the UAE. Do you expect any other insurance lines to become compulsory?</h4><p>Compulsory health insurance has only been implemented for Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In Abu Dhabi it was established a few years ago by the Abu Dhabi Health Authority (HAAD), and in Dubai it was introduced in 2014 with the Dubai Health Authority (DHA), while there is still an opportunity for the other Emirates to introduce compulsory medical insurance. There is compulsory insurance for motor vehicles, and there are some mandatory car insurance classes on the commercial side. The issue is not so much a matter of making products compulsory, but increasing involvement by the regulators in terms of pricing. We may get to see some of that indirectly over the course of 2016 as the UAE regulator aims to impose a financial framework. However, some of the regulations that are going to be introduced in 2016 will require companies to focus more on appropriate technical based pricing. The enforcement of regulations is another important factor. The financial regulations coming in 2016 will have a positive bearing on the future of the insurance sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Xerox wants to move away from just being a provider of document technologies to a services company. How has Xerox Emirates implemented this strategy into its business model?</h4><p>It would be more accurate to say that Xerox is broadening its portfolio by building stronger solutions and services offerings as part of our core proposition to customers. In this respect, at Xerox Emirates we are developing our organizational structure to be able to “Sell, Deliver, and Manage" solutions and services. There have been many developments on the software platform that reside in multi-function devices and printers, which enables a wide range of benefits from diagnostics that provide advance warning of toner usage and wear on parts to our ConnectKey platform, which then enables us to automate work processes. An icon can be created that enables documents to be scanned and automatically forwarded to specific locations within a customer's organization. The implication for our organization is that we are moving more resources to focus on customer experience and the delivery of service levels. We are investing in the skills of pre-sales analysts and application developers to make our customers' work more efficient. The impact of these changes on our business model is that we see an increase in software and solutions revenue, and we expect this to accelerate over the medium term.</p><h4>What innovative products have you launched?</h4><p>Xerox innovation continues to be around solving real business problems and how customers can leverage our technology better. Customers are less concerned about speeds and feeds and more concerned about improving productivity and reducing cost. So by changing from the traditional break-fix model, which was reactive, we offer proactive support, where technology does the work, informing us ahead of time when a device needs attention—we call this “invisible service." There are also innovations around print management software that enable auditing and accounting by users, departments, or even complete organizations. These developments reduce waste as well as help to lower their carbon footprint. The biggest development is the introduction of ConnectKey® technology. Xerox printers do more than simply scan, fax, and copy. They are productivity powerhouses that help you get more done, faster. With Xerox® ConnectKey® Technology, the multifunction printer becomes the center of a complete productivity ecosystem right out of the box. Customers can print from just about anywhere with mobile print services and scan directly to cloud services. Customers use simple apps for complicated, often-performed tasks. This latest technology transforms the way people work.</p><h4>Sustainability initiatives are on the rise in the UAE. How is Xerox meeting this demand?</h4><p>Government policy is rapidly demanding suppliers to advance the pace of technology solutions, and in every initiative, such as smart cities and smart government, the authorities are demanding companies like Xerox raise the bar. At Xerox, sustainability is a way of doing business rather than a cost of doing business. We focused on environmental performance and sustainability—long before it was popular to do so—in order to positively affect our operations, offerings, customers, and communities. We were among the first technology companies to set a company-wide target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2012, at the conclusion of our 10-year energy challenge program, emissions were cut by 42% and energy consumption was reduced by 31%. Our new corporate-wide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020 from a 2012 baseline. Xerox in 2015 was ranked number four in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's “100 Best Corporate Citizens List." In this market there is a greater customer focus on both the environment and sustainability. Here in the UAE we help recycle consumed printer cartridges. We have a contracted an agency that collects empty cartridges from our customers' premises. With the growth in the awareness of this service, the amount of collection has grown and we collect between 500 and 600kg of cartridges as part of an initiative that we fund through our marketing department. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main pillars of the DIFC's strategy to be among the top-10 financial centers globally?</h4><p>The ultimate aim of the DIFC 2024 growth strategy is to move from being just a financial center to a financial hub. To become a financial hub you need to have scale and we want to triple the size of the district by increasing the number of institutions within the DIFC. In 2015 we had over 400 institutions within the DIFC, and our aim is about 1,000 by 2024. At the end of 2015 there were just under 20,000 people living and working out of the DIFC. Our goal is to have around 50,000 individuals by 2024. We have to provide the infrastructure and the capacity to absorb the target population and will introduce about 5.5 million sqft of gross leasable area within the next 10 years. This means new developments will come into play. In 2015 we had 309 new establishments operating out of the DIFC, and we saw many entities upgrade their licenses in the DIFC. That increase was about six-fold over 2014, which means an increase in balance sheet size and in assets under management. The financial center operates as a fully fledged financial center, not just as a simple real estate play. We also need to focus on new markets for growth. Many world-renowned brand names already operate out of the DIFC. Most of these come from the western hemisphere, and they continue to grow their businesses with us. However, we also recognize there is a great deal of interest from the wider region as well as from the East.</p><h4>What is the DIFC doing to promote the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative?</h4><p>The DIFC is in a good position to facilitate the OBOR initiative. Our infrastructure is in place and the rules and regulations being practiced out of the DIFC are common law jurisdiction. We also have the best regulator and an ease of doing business with a one-stop shop approach. All these allow the DIFC to cater to the growth and strategic ambitions of China in the region and beyond. Today many Chinese financial institutions use the DIFC as a hub for the region. It is the gateway for their operations in the GCC and Africa, as well as in Europe for some institutions.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the DIFC's financial position?</h4><p>We are in one of the best financial positions we have ever been. The issuance of our $700 million sukuk in 2014 is a great testament to the reliability and strength of the financial position of the DIFC. It also highlights our continued commitment to having Dubai as the Islamic finance hub for the globe. The issuance of sukuks is in line with that.</p><h4>What impact can financial technology have on Islamic finance, and what is the DIFC doing to promote its use?</h4><p>Financial technology will have a significant impact across the sector, whether in conventional or Islamic banking. When it comes to Islamic banking in particular, technology will allow simplicity with the flow of funds and in the ease of doing contracts and business. It eliminates many barriers and allows room for innovation and the ability to facilitate flows in a more systematic manner. When it comes to the DIFC and the Islamic finance proposition, the infrastructure is already in place. Our regulations are best in class when it comes to the standards required, and they support the establishment of financial institutions under sharia law. Therefore, the jurisdiction is set up for us to be able to service that need.</p><h4>What are your prospects for 2016?</h4><p>Our ambition is to have as strong a year as we had in 2015. Looking at the first few months of 2016 we are in a very good position. We should be able to replicate, if not improve, our fantastic performance in 2015. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you consider to be Trakhees' most important achievement since its establishment seven years ago?</h4><p>Trakhees' most important achievement is to have made a footprint in Dubai's Special Development Zone (SDZ). Prior to that there was no such thing as an SDZ; everything was under the Dubai local government. To distinguish this area and support real estate investment and master developers, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum issued a decree in 2009 assigning the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation and its companies as an SDZ with its own rules and regulations. The SDZ enjoys certain features and facilities that are not available in the rest of Dubai, including a form of free zone company. Trakhees has set up policies, processes, and procedures that encourage investment in the SDZ. We have created a substantial base for investment in Dubai with the support of the master developers that built iconic developments such as Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, Discovery Gardens, Deira Islands, the International City, and Al Furjan, which is under Nakheel, as well as other developers such as Jumaira Real Estate, Limitless, and DMC.</p><h4>What would be your assessment of the opportunities for investors now in Dubai?</h4><p>The government of Dubai has put in considerable effort and overcome the negative effects of the 2008-09 recession period and the subsequent freeze in activity. Dubai has a commercial center that works well and, as a result, has managed to create and maintain investor confidence. The most important value-added that Dubai can offer investors is facilitating processes and procedures and quality of service because time is crucial for investors. Furthermore, entities are approachable and supportive in Dubai. One of the main values for Trakhees is to have a happy customer, and we work hard to understand our customers' expectations and try our best to meet and exceed their expectations. It is a business partnership that leads to success for both service providers and their clients. We remain accessible and our customers appreciate the smooth and seamless flow of transaction. We are also heavily involved in Dubai smart government initiatives; in fact, Trakhees was awarded by HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed for smart government in 2014.</p><h4>What is the importance of Trakhees' contribution to the local economy?</h4><p>Trakhees' contribution is highly recognized, both locally and globally. Our contribution is supported by development in the SDZ. If you compare 1H2015 with 1H2014, we witness an increase of almost 37% in building permits. These permits are for a mixture of new projects and those that were frozen in the last few years due to the economic slowdown. This shows that Dubai's economy and investment base is healthy and confidence is strengthening. This is taking place not just in the SDZ, but also in Dubai in general. Developers have restarted work on their sites, including a number of shopping malls and luxurious hotels. In fact, 2014 was also a good year, with a 16% increase over 2013 for building permits.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2016?</h4><p>I always see trade going up for Dubai, and it will never go below double digits. We will see at least a 12-13% increase in 2016. In 2015 we worked out an optimistic budget and have even gone beyond that in terms of both revenue and the number of transactions.</p><h4>Do you see growth in 2016 being in a specific area, such as construction?</h4><p>Based on the demand and available supply, and sensing the market, the trend will continue and construction will be number one, as will retail. A good number of projects within the SDZ are due to open. Also, the growth in licensing number within the SDZ is expected to continue growing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can the UAE find the right balance between holding back public spending and maintaining healthy economic activity?</h4><p>The UAE faces a similar challenge as other states in the region: maintaining economic activity at a time when spending needs to be adjusted for reduced oil revenues. The UAE is in a better position than many other countries because it has a more diversified economy. The non-oil economy is driven by factors like trade, tourism, and finance. In Dubai there is more or less the same level of economic activity, with a little softening, but much less than other parts of the country. Dubai is also at the beginning of a process that will, over the next four years, lead to Expo 2020. This will also support activity. The UAE has to continue with the strategy of relying primarily on the private sector to drive growth at a time when the government has to scale back big construction and other projects. The UAE growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 2.5%, which is above the GCC average. However, there is a distinction between the parts that are driven by oil and the parts that are not.</p><h4>What steps should the UAE take towards tax revenues?</h4><p>We have been of the view that the UAE, and GCC countries more generally, all need to begin to develop non-oil based revenue sources. Among the most important instruments is the introduction of a VAT, which could be put into place in a coordinated way throughout the GCC. This could generate about 1.5% of additional GDP, based on our experience in other countries. That would be a positive step. It would also be useful to explore whether some sort of low rate of corporate tax can be introduced. There are two things you need to consider in the GCC and the UAE: these countries have substantial buffers to draw on and do not have to make dramatic adjustments in terms of cutting back spending, raising taxes, or trying to reach a balanced budget overnight. It is a perfectly sensible approach for the UAE to run fiscal deficits as they try to adjust gradually to the new realities of oil prices. In doing so, they have to be careful about how they finance those deficits, because if you finance the deficit disproportionately from the domestic banking system, you could create liquidity shortages in the banking system, which may then have a knock-on impact on credit availability for the private sector at a time when you want the private sector to be more active. Instead it may make sense to draw on your assets and also borrow internationally. These various financing options need to be balanced. The other thing to do is to find ways of protecting the more vulnerable in society during the adjustment. For example, if you raise electricity tariffs and rates, you need to consider making that increase proportional to energy use and income levels.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the importance of the financial services sector as a crucial component in the growth and diversification plans of the UAE?</h4><p>Financial services certainly are an important sector in the UAE's diversification strategy. The banking system will face a more challenging environment moving forward because banks will not be able to rely as much on government deposits and will have to mobilize their own deposits. Liquidity will be tighter and borrowing costs will go up as risk appetite falls. US rates will also edge up. Banks are starting from a strong place in terms of capital and liquidity, and should be able to manage that. The UAE also has the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), which is a very good example of how you can create a hub inside the UAE or any GCC country that serves as a magnet to attract financial companies and also other companies that seek to establish themselves in the UAE and have a regional presence as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current state of Sri Lanka's bilateral ties with Thailand?</h4><p>The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Kingdom of Thailand have historically shared strong traditional and religious links. Theravada Buddhism was introduced to the Kingdom of Thailand from Sri Lanka many centuries ago, and when the foundation of Sri Lanka's Buddhist MahaSangha was threatened during the colonial period, it was from the land of Siam that assistance came to revive the third Noble Gem—the MahaSanga of Sri Lanka. Centuries-long religious and cultural exchanges have enriched both countries and built bridges between the two peoples. This foundation of Buddhism has defined the cultures of both Thailand and Sri Lanka and is rooted in the everyday life of the people of both countries. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Thailand in 1955 was, therefore, the formalizing of a longstanding, mutually beneficial friendship. Today, we celebrate 60 years of relations, both countries are given the opportunity to assess the relationship, seek novel ways of cooperation, and take the different aspects of the relationship to a higher level. In the context of Asia's latent strength emerging in the world economy, it is necessary that Sri Lanka and Thailand seek diversified avenues to work toward the mutual benefit of the countries, their peoples, and the region in order to increase the impact that we can make globally. Sri Lanka values the support extended in international fora by the Thai government during the difficult period in our recent history, and we stand together with Thailand as steadfast friends.</p><h4>What were the major talking points and achievements from your official visit to Thailand in November and your meeting with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha?</h4><p>One of the major talking points of the meetings was shared religious ties; one of Sri Lanka's most venerated Sacred Relics of the Gauthama Buddha enshrined in the Mahiyangana Raja MahaViharaya was brought to Thailand on the patronage of the Sri Lankan people to provide an opportunity for the Thai people to pay homage. It was indeed gratifying to learn that more than half a million Thai devotees had paid homage to the relics during their two weeks in Putthamothon. His Excellency, General Prayuth Chan-a-Cha, also expressed his appreciation of the bringing of the Sacred Relics to Thailand, as well as the gifting of the Buddha statue to the Dhammarama temple in Ayutthaya province. Discussions were also conducted on ways to address the significant trade gap between the countries. We have discussed several areas of cooperation to bring this existing status quo to a more mutually beneficial status. The key, as His Excellency the Prime Minister too identified, is that the two countries be partners and not competitors in this path to benefiting our citizens. In the bilateral talks, a wide range of issues of mutual interest covering politics and economy, cultural and religious cooperation, agriculture and fishery industries, tourism, and person-to-person contacts were discussed. The developments stemming from these productive talks will be reflected in the broadened areas of cooperation between the two countries in the coming years. Following my visit, we expect a further increase in bilateral relations in political, economic and trade, cultural, religious, and social spheres in the coming years.</p><h4>As reported from your meeting with the prime minister, you pledged to boost yearly trade volumes between Sri Lanka and Thailand to $1 billion. Which sectors do you expect to drive this growth?</h4><p>Thailand and Sri Lanka enjoy healthy trade relations, particularly in the field of gems and jewelry. Thailand is also the third largest export destination for Sri Lanka in the ASEAN region. However, the large trade gap between the two countries in favor of Thailand has to be addressed. Representatives of the two governments have engaged in discussions on areas for further cooperation such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and automobile spare parts, as well as our resolve to work together to lower trade barriers. Sri Lanka and Thailand will also work together on value addition in the supply chain. Both governments are also to work in tandem to facilitate the establishment of joint ventures between the related industries in the two countries. The emphasis on developing the rural economy is shared by both governments, as is the recognition of fisheries as a priority sector. Special focus was also placed on the development of cultural and religious tourism between the two countries. There are many areas in the Sri Lankan export services sector that could be harnessed in this regard such as ICT, banking, and financial services as well as the strong education sector that has developed one of the highest literate populations in the Asian region. Furthermore, there are opportunities for Thai investors in the booming economy of Sri Lanka in both the traditional sectors, which is recording a growth rate of 7% in such traditional areas such as apparel, tea, spices, and rubber, as well as in such non-traditional sectors as minerals, food processing, post-harvest packaging, and renewable energy. With the establishment of the 45 economic zones and 11 industrial and technological zones throughout the country, the investor environment in Sri Lanka has been given a significant boost.</p><h4>Which economic opportunities has Sri Lanka identified in Southeast Asia following the recent integration of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC)?</h4><p>As the ASEAN region emerges as a unified economic community, Sri Lanka aims to be a constructive partner of it. In bringing about the changes to fulfill the wishes of the citizens of Sri Lanka, my government works closely with many international partners such as regional bodies, governments, and other international organizations. The changes brought about since January have of course raised the profile of Sri Lanka and propelled the country toward a more harmonious and cooperative relationship with the international community. This has been reflected in the collaborative engagements in international fora. The re-establishment of rule of law and good governance to accompany the peace and security that had been won has resulted in an investment friendly environment of more trade in Sri Lanka. The increased FDI and presence of global companies in Sri Lanka have illustrated the recognition of the international private sector of these positive changes. Sri Lanka welcomes collaboration and looks forward to playing to the strengths of our economy. While ASEAN integration will provide a good platform for the member states to improve corporation among them, Sri Lanka sees a unique opportunity in it to develop trade relations with a group of countries that are culturally close to us. While we look forward to a booming renewables sector is Sri Lanka, we will continue to play an increased role as a partner facilitating naval transport between AEC and the rest of the world. AEC will certainly be an important trade partner for Sri Lanka. With the exchange of technical know-how and specialized knowledge from the top industries of ASEAN member countries and envisaged joint ventures in the private sectors, I look forward to a productive and collaborative partnership with the ASEAN Economic Community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Jafza play in the development of Dubai?</h4><p>Jafza was created through the vision of the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who wanted to position Dubai as a leading global trade and business hub. The free zone was created in 1985 to promote trade and support container throughput at the Jebel Ali Port. Jafza was mandated to attract multinationals to the free zone and I am proud to say we have successfully achieved that mandate. We attracted global brands into the free zone and helped Dubai establish itself as the region's trade and commerce hub. Jafza is currently home to more than 7,000 of the world's finest companies, which include 100 Global Fortune 500 enterprises, and has been one of the main drivers of Dubai's burgeoning economy over the years. The zone contributes 21% of Dubai's GDP on a YoY basis and employs more than 144,000 people in the country.</p><h4>To what main factors do you attribute Jafza's remarkable growth over the years?</h4><p>The main factors were: our capability to understand and respond promptly to customer and market demands; a single-minded commitment to serve customers and enable them to achieve their goals in the region; integrated systems including a one-stop shop for all services in the free zone that make their operations seamless and efficient; and excellent multi-modal connectivity by sea, land, and air due to our location between the region's biggest container port, Jebel Ali Port, and the Al Maktoum International Airport, which is just 35 minutes' drive from the free zone. Furthermore, our outstanding physical and economic infrastructure have always met the requirements of multinationals, which use Jafza facilities to serve the region and beyond thanks to our strategic location midway between Asia, Europe, and Africa, the fastest-growing producing and consumer markets.</p><h4>How do you support your customers in achieving their growth aspirations?</h4><p>As a business enabler we enhance our value proposition to customers. Jafza's initiatives can be grouped under two categories. One is designed to support customers' operational efficiencies and the other supports them in growing their businesses. The first category includes investments on upgrading physical infrastructure and facilities and IT. For example, Jafza launched its mobile application to enable customers to access services from their mobile devices at any time, making business transactions with the free zone easier than ever before. The initiative has further strengthened its existing online infrastructure. The second category includes our drive to maintain dialog with our customers through strategic forums that focus on exploring ways to enhance growth opportunities in different sectors. As part of this initiative, we now invite them to accompany our officials on the industry-specific road shows we conduct in potential markets across the world and the trade exhibitions we participate in globally.</p><h4>What is Jafza's priority focus at present and for the coming years?</h4><p>Our growth strategy is driven by three key words; connect, network, and operate. We aim to provide our customers with first-class logistics infrastructure using the best multimodal connectivity to enable them to reach any part of the world quickly. The Al Maktoum International Airport is designed to handle 12 million tons of cargo annually and we have 17,000km of excellent roads. Meanwhile, we continue to create networks that encourage business growth, such as an online business matching portal and industry-specific events to generate new opportunities. Jafza's top priority at present is to consolidate our strengths and enhance capability as the region's trade, commerce, and logistics hub to meet the anticipated growth in demand for world-class facilities and services.</p><h4>Which countries and industries will be investing in Jafza in the coming years?</h4><p>In the next five years we expect significant growth to come from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Since most of the countries in the region are focused on social and economic infrastructure, sectors such as construction, machinery and equipment, FMCG, healthcare, transportation, and logistics are expected to attract investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities does Africa's Tripartite FTA provide UAE businesses?</h4><p>The formation of Africa's Tripartite FTA between 26 African states is expected to benefit economic cooperation between Africa and the UAE. As a major trading partner, and with increased Africa trade, more exports and imports will transit through Dubai. The development of African trade would drive up the rate of per capita income, which in turn will lead to the growth of services such as schools, hospitals, banks, and transportation. This will open up investment opportunities in which the UAE has a competitive advantage, like ports management, infrastructure, telecoms, transportation, and hospitality. Research by the Dubai Chamber highlights the benefits this agreement could have on most African countries in the medium term, like major economic and structural reforms. The projected increase in Africa's private demand and government development expenditures is expected to encourage more investment in Africa.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of innovation in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai has always believed in the power of innovation and the need to be creative and adaptable. Becoming a smart city is a natural progression. The Emirate has long understood that being innovative is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for being competitive and surviving. The government put in place the Innovation Strategy in 2014, which includes 20 initiatives that will be rolled out by 2017 aimed at making the Emirate the most innovative city in the world. The chamber launched its innovation strategy in 2015 to stimulate innovation in the private sector based on three main pillars, including enablers of innovation, measuring innovation, and honoring innovators as the growth and development of innovation requires contributions from all segments of society. The chamber plans to invest AED100 million between 2015 and 2017 in innovative projects and initiatives such as the Dubai Innovation Index and the Dubai Chamber Innovation Lab, as well as applications that enhance the customer experience while strengthening Dubai's position as one of the best global business destinations. This investment is part of Dubai Chamber's strategy to invest AED500 million over this period to serve the business community and enhance its global competitiveness. The Dubai Innovation Index, created in collaboration with PwC, ranked Dubai 16th among the world's 28 leading innovation-driven cities, while the city ranked 11th in the world for its efficiency in innovation outputs. The Emirate ranked ahead of Beijing, Madrid, Milan, Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Shanghai. In March 2016, the chamber collaborated with IBM to launch the Dubai Digital Entrepreneurship Hub, an online community that will support Dubai's technology and startup ecosystem. The hub will come under the umbrella of Smart Dubai Initiative, representing a unique partnership between the public and private sector to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>What would you consider to be the chamber's most important contributions to private-sector development?</h4><p>One of our major contributions has been our innovation strategy, as well as Tejar Dubai, which is designed to identify and develop nascent entrepreneurs amongst UAE nationals and their respective business ideas. With SMEs accounting for more than 90% of our private sector, this initiative is our commitment to foster and support entrepreneurship. Our research department produces over 100 business intelligence reports and economic bulletins. We also produced customized reports on Africa and the Islamic economy during our Africa Global Business Forum 2015. Our concentrated effort to identify new business opportunities through trade missions, international offices, and access world-class events has helped the private sector explore new markets and grow its business. Our international events, such as the Global Business Forum series, provide the private sector with a platform to network and gain first-hand knowledge about business opportunities in Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America. We have a multi-faceted approach to supporting the private sector, which has been our biggest contribution to the private sector's development in Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Now that the UAE has become one of the region's leading innovation hubs, what comes next?</h4><p>Innovation is a continuous process and we must continue to support new practices and technologies to maintain and increase our reputation for excellence. It is not a question of what comes next, it's about aspiring to world-class standards and performance and increasing efficiencies through innovation for this generation and those that come after us. That ingrained culture and mindset is what will differentiate us from the rest of the world in the years to come.</p><h4>What opportunities does the new PPP law, which came into force in November 2015, offer for both the public and private sectors?</h4><p>The opportunities to develop economies through partnerships enable private-sector expertise to be added to government programs for the wider benefit, particularly in infrastructure and construction. It gives government entities the freedom to define appropriate tender processes outside the constraints of existing tender laws that are not appropriate for PPPs and is a positive step forward for the development of a PPP market in Dubai. Government entities have more freedom and flexibility to specify tender and contract conditions on a case-by-case basis. The overriding award criteria is the “most financially and technically advantageous bid,“ with discretion to specify details. This is another example of our leadership amending regulations to suit the future needs of Dubai and providing more freedom for business to operate.</p><h4>What role can the UAE play in the “One Belt, One Road“ initiative?</h4><p>As an enabler of global trade, DP World is always interested in opportunities that come our way. We are already helping Kazakhstan develop the Khorgos Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Inland Container Depot (ICD), as well as the Port of Aktau on the Caspian Sea. These infrastructure projects will help develop the “One Belt, One Road“ concept, linking China to European markets through Asia. Today, goods from China take an average of 42 days to reach Europe by sea. With the new logistics and transport infrastructure in Kazakhstan, this is reduced to an average of 13 days. Elsewhere, DP World and our partners are investing $1.9 billion in China port terminals until 2020 and we already operate three ports there in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yantai. We also recently signed an agreement with our partners in Qingdao to exchange information and grow business between our ports. In building a global portfolio of more than 77 marine and inland terminals, we have established long-standing relationships with customers, many of whom are looking to the New Silk Road as new areas of opportunity. The experience gained from our Jebel Ali port with its free zone and our other terminals around the world will fuel the development of the New Silk Road at a remarkable pace.</p><h4>DP World has already invested $1.2 billion in India and is the only foreign operator with six port concessions in the country and an approximate 30% market share. Following DP World's announcement that it will invest a further $1 billion over the next few years, what will this investment cover?</h4><p>This will cover expansion in brownfield container terminals, long-term greenfield container concessions, inland container depots (ICDs), and the expansion of existing inter-modal rail services for rolling stock. We already employ 3,000 people at our terminals in India and they are locally recruited and trained. As a market leader in Indian container terminal operations we have the largest portfolio of investments in ports along the Indian coastline, including Gujarat (Mundra, 2003), Maharashtra (Nhava Sheva, 1999 and 2012), Kerala (Cochin, 2005), Tamil Nadu (Chennai, 2001), and Andhra Pradesh (Vishakapatnam, 2002). We have also created rail connections to the hinterlands and have a national rail license from the government to operate seven container trains. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This past September, the UAE's State Minister of Financial Affairs and Mauritius' Minister of Finance signed an agreement on mutual encouragement and protection of investments. What favorable conditions has Mauritius established and what else is being planned to attract investment?</h4><p>One of the things that we have been strengthening over the past few years is the regulatory environment. We have, of course, the rule of law, which is not at present there, and for other avenues we have also strengthened intellectual property procedures. Essentially, what we are trying to put in place are very strong institutions, because Africa, as President Obama said, needs strong institutions, not strong men. This is what we have to do; work through institutions and build strong institutions to address economic fundamentals. We are really reinforcing the existing law and trying to make it as easy for doing business as possible. Being nimble-footed is going to be critical, especially for the economy and the size of the country, but we want to capitalize on the strategic position of the country to really make a difference.</p><h4>Dubai recently launched Dubai Science Spark in a bid to become the most innovative and vibrant science community in the Middle East. What innovative approaches could be drawn from Dubai's example and implemented in Mauritius?</h4><p>We know one of the ambitions of Dubai's government is to promote the Emirate as a hub for medicine and research in biodiversity. We could use institutions in Dubai for furthering testing and a multicentric trial with big corporates. What we have done is capitalized on the genetic diversity of our people to carry out a clinical trial, and this has worked for us. We need to be able to look at niche areas in biotech, be it an ocean economy or in biodiversity, renewable energy, or even water, for example, where we can find small niche projects that we can start collaborating on, establishing comfort and confidence.</p><h4>In what ways could Mauritius and Dubai cooperate in their efforts to empower women in all areas?</h4><p>There are so many ideas that can be floated, and if we look at Africa's agriculture sector, it is comprised largely of women. Dubai's strategy for Africa focuses somewhat on agriculture; this is an area where we can work together to address, for example, the post-harvest area where Africa is weak and, with the technology and positioning of Dubai, it could be used as a flagship to empower women. If women grow products and find ways of adding value post-harvest, this will be a very niche area. Another area where I think Dubai has experience will be for recycled water; water is no longer a resource that we can afford to waste. Much recycling can be done, bottling this water and exporting it. All these are areas where women can play a role. We also need to stress the need to empower women through entrepreneurship, not just in the area we have mentioned, but into new emerging areas of ICT, biotechnology, and big data. Women need to be empowered in all of the areas that will empower them not just to be able to go out to work, but also to operate from home, if the infrastructure is there. Many women can start their business from home. There are many niche areas where women can go. It all comes back to the qualification and capacity that a woman has been able to develop and get in terms of a quality education. These are areas where women can join forces with Emirati women and make a difference.</p><h4>On November 17, HH Sheikh Mohammed received you and other African leaders during the AGBF2015. What were the most important topics discussed in this meeting?</h4><p>We discussed collaboration and partnership in areas where Dubai is very strong and it can, to some extent, take many of the countries by the hand. Dubai has shown strength in the logistics, transport, and hospitality sectors, through a culture of leadership and discipline. This is the type of culture that we want to promote and collaborate on.</p><h4>How would you assess your collaboration and partnership with the Emirates Airlines? Do you hope to establish a similar relation with DP World?</h4><p>Emirates Airlines has been in Mauritius for over 20 years now, and it has been instrumental in opening the capacity to bring in more passengers because we have at least two A380s landing in Mauritius, and the flow of passengers filtering through Dubai has come from many parts of the world, such as Russia and China. What Dubai and Emirates has been able to do for us has been ensuring access to all of this. Increasingly we are referring to working in partnership with Dubai in very much the same way we have done so far with Emirates and they have been helping us a lot to see the emergence of that tourism sector. When the tourism sector is developed, so too are all related industries such as the food industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on cross-sector innovation, and what investment opportunities does it present?</h4><p>Last year was the year of innovation in the UAE and it was quite a celebration. But, beyond that, the Dubai Investment Forum informed investors about UAE's long-term goals and weeks later an AED300 billion UAE Science Technology &amp; Innovation Higher Policy was announced to realize these goals and increase innovation's contribution to total GDP. We believe that a strong enabler for innovation to happen is the investment that comes with it. Certain innovations would not be where they are today without a strong financial backing. Good ideas that look at sustainability are particularly important right now and the government is looking at innovation that fits within the green economy strategy to support the growth and sustainability of all economic sectors.</p><h4>How can the financial services industry help Dubai's economy move beyond oil?</h4><p>A great deal of business planning has to be done with an understanding of where the destination is within economic development. Where economic development plans are really explained, informed, and well designed, then the private sector will take advantage of that in proceeding with its expansion plans. This is what is unique about Dubai and the UAE; the federal and local governments talk in the same tones and play the same tune, and this is music to the ears of investors. The authorities are informing private-sector investors what their plans are and adding new sectors to their plans, which brings more diversification to the table. This effort increases private sector alignment with the government vision, strategies, and plans and increases investors' positive perspective and interest in being part of the government development agenda.</p><h4>How can the UAE's bilateral engagement with international markets be enhanced?</h4><p>Connecting with different destinations around the world is a strong focus for the UAE and Dubai. This is necessary to achieve better businesses, better trade, and of course more bilateral trade with more destinations. For example, there is a delegation, including from the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, going to Colombia in 2016, and there are other missions going to Panama, Mexico, and Cuba. There are others going to Brazil and Argentina a few months later, and probably Colombia again as well. Latin America is increasingly interesting in terms of both its large and small economies. The momentum is happening, and we have more connections to Latin America than ever before. Furthermore, some Western European markets that faded for a while are also reviving, including Germany, France, the UK, and Switzerland. The strong connection is continuing between Dubai and the UAE with Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p><h4>How can international markets can benefit from being in Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai represents a strong platform for entering the large MENA region. It contains more than 2.4 billion consumers. Dubai is a global platform as a business enabler. Dubai allows businesses to benefit from the transit of goods moving through here to other regions and helps global trade. In downturns like 2016, we are seeing an economic cycle that will take a year or two to come back up, and the world needs a destination like Dubai to facilitate the import-export trade. Global trade helped in the last recession of 2008-09, and it will continue to be a strong enabler to help the world come out of what is currently happening. Dubai is at the heart of this. In 2016, we finished an expansion at Dubai International Airport, which means an 11% increase to 78 million passengers. It will continue to be the world's number-one international passenger airport. These are important elements to look at for the engagement of business and to allow them to cut costs even in hard times like these.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE was one of the first countries to establish a permanent embassy in Somalia. How would you assess the UAE's support for Somalia's stability?</h4><p>Somalia emerged from two decades of civil war and instability when the current government was democratically selected in 2012. My government faced the double challenge of needing to rebuild a country with no government or service institutions in place, whilst fighting a terrorist group. In three years, Somalia has managed to regain control of 80% of its territory, establish basic but functioning government ministries, open schools and hospitals, re-establish trade links with various countries, set up a working Central Bank with transparent financial functions, and start to rebuild critical pieces of infrastructure, like roads and ports. There is a long shared history between Somalia and the UAE; we have always traded and have shared interests in the stability of the Arab-African relationship. The UAE was one of the first major supporters of Somalia. The UAE saw the opportunity inherent in establishing a strong relationship with Somalia, initially responding to key humanitarian and development needs in an environment that other donors saw as too risky. We salute the courage and humanity of the UAE governments in doing so. Since then, the UAE has provided a broad range of support to Somalia—but always for on-ground, practical, and tangible initiatives that Somalis feel and see. The UAE has provided extensive military and security support through training Somali soldiers and providing a military training academy. It has supported the resumption of public services, in particular in the health sector, opening hospitals and health centers.</p><h4>Oil represents just 2% of Dubai's GDP, with the bulk of the economy comprised of tourism, retail, real estate, trade and logistics, and manufacturing. In what other areas could Dubai's expertise be of value for Somalia?</h4><p>The UAE has set an extraordinary example of what can be achieved when a country combines visionary leadership, wise stewardship, and investment of its resources and insists on a quality approach to all it does. Standing on the balcony at a hotel in Dubai recently and gazing over the expanse of a city that basically was not there 25 years ago is the best energizer anyone could wish for. Economic recovery and empowerment is the key issue for Somalia—not just in order to be able to finance our own development and future, but also because ensuring that people have access to meaningful work and that get paid to do that work is the best investment a country can make in its security and stability. The UAE took a finite resource and turned it into something of infinite value. Somalia is blessed with a huge store of natural resources, from oil and gas to fisheries and livestock. We have the longest coastline in Africa, two rivers, and extensive agricultural land. We have excellent human potential, a very young, entrepreneurial population, and a highly educated and returning diaspora. When we combine our human resources with the natural resource potential of Somalia, I think there are unlimited possibilities ahead of us as a nation. So, apart from technical support in areas where the UAE has significant expertise, key for Somalia will also be learning from the UAE about rapid, self-managed, and self-funded economic development that suits the Somali context.</p><h4>How do you see Somalia-UAE bilateral relations developing over the next decade?</h4><p>The two countries enjoy a frank and full dialogue, and I am sure this will ensure that our friendship continues to grow. Insha'Allah, our strategic relationship will also become more balanced as Somalia continues to develop. I would hope that there will be less “take" in the relationship and more “give" from Somalia, not just in terms of trade and export, but also in shouldering regional responsibilities such as working to end extremism and positively contributing to the economic stability of the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In October 2015, an MoU was signed between Estonia and Dubai on smart government. How do you assess the evolution of bilateral relations with Dubai?</h4><p>The signing of the MoU on ICT and smart city collaboration is a major step forward for relations between Dubai and Estonia, although we have had cordial relations with the UAE for quite some time, paved by various agreements between our governments. The new MoU is still a big step on a longer path. It lays the foundations, signals the will, and opens the door to practical collaboration between not only our government agencies, but also Emirati and Estonian companies and investors. Although the MoU and our current collaboration initiatives deal with digital economy and government, there is clearly potential for more as we discussed with HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, during our meeting. Estonia can offer a hassle-free business environment gateway to Nordic, European, and even Russian markets for Emirati companies and investors. From our end, our tech, wood, food, and defense industries could have potential new clients in Dubai and the rest of the GCC region. The focus and core interest for collaboration will be in the digital government sphere first and foremost; that is where we know each other best and is where we have the biggest symbiosis. Dubai has a very ambitious smart city development program. It would be our honor to offer our knowhow from 15 years of building the digital government in Estonia and being a globally renowned pioneer on this front. Our companies are also more than willing to offer the state-of-the-art digital solutions that they have built for our government or for governments from different parts of the world for use in this setting.</p><h4>In what areas could Dubai's expertise be of interest to Estonia?</h4><p>One example is the way that digital services work on mobile platforms in Dubai. The Dubai Now app is a perfect example of usability and service-orientation combined. How it is designed and how different services and agencies are brought together to offer the best user-experience really captured my attention while in Dubai. More generally, we would like to set up a regular dialogue and keep up with policy and strategy and also new solutions as they emerge in Dubai.</p><h4>What is your outlook for future cooperation between Estonia and the UAE?</h4><p>Upon my recent visit to Dubai I found that we are much more similar than one would think, given our slight geographic distance. Both of our governments and people are ambitious and willing to take risks for development, and both want to rely on technology to make developmental leaps. We both are very pro-business, encouraging trade and investment. As such, there is a lot of common ground for a mutually beneficial exchange of know-how and practices. At the same time, as both Dubai and Estonia are small, we need partners to go out into the wider world. Dubai could be a bridge for Estonian companies to enter the GCC, as well as South Asian markets. Estonia can offer the same in the Nordic countries and EU for Dubai and its companies. Most importantly, our private sectors could work together to leverage this potential. Finally, we are keen to innovate the future together. We are keen to collaborate on trying some of our key digital solutions in Dubai in a smart city setting. As an outcome, we can perhaps build new or improved solutions that we can then offer jointly to the wider world as a world class, or even world standard, solution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities are there between the UAE and markets in Africa?</h4><p>Three years ago, we added two main regions to our plans—East and West Africa and Central Asia—although we cover the whole world. We are very strong in the conventional areas but want to open new areas for our private business, which are difficult for a single company to go to. We went on a trade mission to Kenya and Uganda, and now my team is in Rwanda. Because it is very difficult for a single company to go to these markets in terms of security and logistics, we gather a group. The opportunities in these countries are huge—there is demand for everything from consumables, finished products, raw materials, construction materials, and food products to confectioneries. All of these are strong in Dubai, either from manufacturing or from re exporting. The growth rate in these countries for the last few years has been very high, not less than 5-8% a year. This is a large growth rate compared to the rest of the world. For example, DP World manages a few seaports in Africa in places like Senegal and Djibouti and there are a few more under construction. Another factor is that businesses and the tourists from East African countries coming to the UAE understand that Dubai is a regional hub, so when they come here they are also exposed to India and other GCC countries. From Dubai they can carry out bilateral trade, not only with us, but also with the rest of the world.</p><h4>What strategy do you follow when opening offices overseas?</h4><p>We are currently in the second phase of our plan. We have offices in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and India as part of phase one. And the second phase, which is finalized, is Russia to cover the Central Asian market, Germany to cover Europe, and Brazil. Brazil is one of the top economies in the world with a population of 200 million, so it is a big market for our private business. With these offices, we cover more than one-third of the world. The future plan is to cover Asia in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and also Australia. We hope that, by 2016, we will finalize both Asia and Africa.</p><h4>What will be the key elements contributing to the growth of halal processed food and what will be the potential export markets?</h4><p>Halal production and halal food is more comprehensive than conventional food because everyone can eat it. Halal is not just a religious product; it is a high-quality, hygienic product, complying with high standards and also with sharia. Halal is not just for Muslims. Dubai wants to be the capital of the Islamic industry. One part of that is halal manufacturing and halal food. Dubai now has fully fledged halal standards that cover the entire food spectrum in the manufacturing of food, which is published online so companies can learn exactly how to comply. We are promoting the halal industry as a whole, which includes Islamic finance, takaful insurance, and also halal manufacturing. We are getting suppliers from all around the world to come to Dubai. We want them all to come here and to use Dubai as the halal hub for all these consumers, which include Arab countries, the GCC, Iran, Iraq, Central Asia, Western China, and beyond.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Based on the innovation and creativity initiative, we have also come up with an innovation in exports. The conventional market will continue to grow, but we want to promote innovation. We are exploring how to promote fashion out of Dubai, as well as cosmetics and perfume, mainly in terms of services rather than the product itself. We want to promote UAE companies dealing with these innovative services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are DAFZA's competitive advantages over other FTZs?</h4><p>DAFZA was envisioned as an entity that would help drive Dubai's goal of becoming an investment-driven economy. Our complementary role in the Emirate's broader development agenda has been, and always will be, the primary differentiating factor and competitive advantage for us. We push for the dynamic growth of investors and business partners, keeping in mind that the results significantly impact local and national economic strategies. Our strategic location, right next to one of the world's busiest airports, and our close proximity to the major markets of Asia and Europe, are critical benefits. We also have numerous incentives, such as 100% exemptions on corporate, personal income, and import and export taxes, zero currency restrictions, dedicated logistics services and assistance, and state-of-the-art infrastructure to establish DAFZA as the Middle East's premier free zone destination. We have worked hard to build a broad community of more than 20 industries to illustrate that we are a pulsing center for businesses of all types, sizes, and nationalities. We are also deploying various smart services and other state-of-the-art technologies to complement our leadership's Dubai Smart City initiative. This has transformed us into one of the most innovative, connected, and advanced free zones in the world. We always emphasize to our hosted companies that we are partners rather than landlords. DAFZA's uniqueness lies in anticipating, listening to the customer's voice, understanding, and enriching customer experiences throughout their life cycle and across all touch points. Around 55% of our customers have maintained their presence within DAFZA for over five years. Our prestigious client directory includes several Fortune 100 companies and some of the most respected business names in the world.</p><h4>How does DAFZA plan to attract potential partners?</h4><p>To maximize our regional and international exposure, we participate in and sponsor major industry events. Last year we began a series of seminars that took us to key markets such as Singapore, Japan, Spain, Italy, and Germany, where we elicited strong investor and business interest by showcasing DAFZA's diverse portfolio of services and incentives. We also focus on forging strategic partnership agreements that benefit the industry and improve bilateral trade relations for Dubai. Our desire to add value for our partners as well as their countries of origin has helped pique the interest of even more potential investors. In order to increase the value of our proposition and further differentiate ourselves, we have recently undergone a major communication restaging exercise by repositioning ourselves as “Dubai's Premium Free Zone." Our challenge was to convince the global business community that “premium" was a tangible benefit, rather than an optional business cost. The integrated campaign was launched in 14 relevant markets, targeting international corporate decision makers. The results were above expectations and our repositioning was well received by corporate and government entities.</p><h4>What would you consider to be the most attractive sectors for investment?</h4><p>From its birth, DAFZA has served as a catalyst for economic growth. Its total assets in 2015 rose 3% with revenue increase of 7% and it contributed AED109 billion to Dubai's non-oil foreign trade in 2014. At present, there are more than 1,600 companies operating in the free zone. The top sectors operating at DAFZA are electronics and electrical, representing 16% of our corporate population, followed by consumer products at 11%, and engineering and building materials and aerospace, aviation, and related services tied at 9%. However, we place equal importance on all the sectors we serve, in keeping with our thrust toward diversified and dynamic development.</p><h4>DAFZA has focused its efforts on creating and adopting “new-to-the-region" and “firsts" amongst free zones. What initiatives make DAFZA successful in developing innovation?</h4><p>We shun complacency and stagnancy and instead pursue initiatives and mechanisms to increase efficiency and innovation. To sustain that momentum we launched an innovation strategy inspired by HH President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's declaration of 2015 as the “Year of Innovation," as well as the National Innovation Strategy directed by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai as a primary means to achieve UAE Vision 2021's goals. We unveiled the strategy during the inaugural UAE Innovation Week in November 2015. Its three goals are the delivery of value-added, best-in-class innovative solutions, the adoption of working styles that inspire creativity across the organization, and alignment with and active contribution to the UAE's national agenda through innovation. It defines three key roles for DAFZA within the national innovation ecosystem: innovator, capital provider, and promoter. Under this strategy, DAFZA will focus on six key executable innovation enablers, namely process, technologies, governance, skills, capabilities, and culture. We have formed a dedicated DAFZA Innovation Unit (DIU) to constantly drive innovation throughout the organization. Moreover, DAFZA pays meticulous attention to sustainability. Projects such as the installation of a reverse osmosis (RO) system and auxiliary treated sewage effluent (TSE) units for our desalination plants, the retrofitting of our street lighting and installation of LED lamps reducing our energy needs by 66%, and our smart demand flow system for our central cooling plant, the first system of its kind to be used outside of North America, have enabled us to minimize our carbon footprint.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently launched International Innovative Platform for Islamic Economy Products (IIPIEP) for DAFZA and what impact will it have on Dubai's Islamic economy?</h4><p>The IIPIEP is a new forum organized by the International Centre of Islamic Economy in partnership with DAFZA, to encourage innovation and creativity in the development of products for the international Islamic economy. We introduced concepts such as: the Innovation Oasis in DAFZA, the first global oasis dedicated to incubating creative ideas and entrepreneurial projects that support the international Islamic economy; an endowment bank for financial institutions operating in accordance with sharia law; and cash financing through telecoms services. Such ideas will lead to the establishment of an integrated economic system that can adapt to rapid changes in the regional and international Islamic economic landscapes. IIPIEP also provides a platform for discussing and addressing key industry issues, strengthening relationships between the public and private sectors, and enhancing communications among decision-makers, experts, and innovators. For Dubai, IIPIEP is an important vehicle for bringing the Emirate closer to its goal of emerging as the capital of the global Islamic economy within the next few years.</p><h4>How is DAFZA helping to develop the halal industry?</h4><p>We recently entered into a cooperative agreement with Malaysia's Halal Industry Development Corp. to pursue mutually beneficial ventures. This will improve Dubai's halal compliance infrastructure and at the same time energize business between Dubai and Malaysia. A Joint Working Committee will be formed to ensure that the objectives of the agreement are met. Another related development is the setting up of a dedicated area for the halal industry among the light industrial units we are constructing in Qusais. The units are scheduled for completion by December 2016 and will include provisions for cold storage, parking, and utilities, plus they will all be leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED)-certified.</p><h4>What are DAFZA's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We plan to further raise the number of our hosted companies We will also work on the expansion and diversification targets we have set for the year, which focus on the opportunities arising from Dubai's hosting of the 2020 World Expo. In addition, we will continue visiting key and new markets to reinforce existing partnerships and forge new ones. And of course, we will proceed full-steam ahead with all major ongoing projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new cabinet, announced last February, complement the pressing needs of the broader economy?</h4><p>The UAE leadership considers Emirati citizens and residents as a priority and seeks to provide them with the necessary requirements for a happy and secure lifestyle. It also works diligently to enhance the country's position regionally and globally on all levels. In order to achieve its goals, our wise leadership attempts to foresee the future with a long-term solid vision. The latest cabinet restructuring reflects the UAE leadership's emphasis on boosting sustainable development in the country, raising the happiness curve, and building an advanced scientific environment. While this restructuring of the ministries may not reflect directly on the economy at present, the positive impact of these ministries following several economic enhancements will become clear in the near future. The state of the economy is an integral component of happiness</p><h4>SME development has been unprecedented in the UAE. How has this development been achieved?</h4><p>The interest in the SME sector is part of the UAE's economic diversity policy and its sustained efforts to reduce the reliance on oil as much as possible. The SME sector's role has increased YoY as a result of this policy's success. The SME sector has always been one of the country's priorities given its vital role in boosting development, strengthening economic diversity, and supporting the steps taken to achieve a knowledge economy that is based on innovation. The UAE leadership has taken consecutive measures throughout the 44 years following the country's establishment in supporting this sector. The efforts commenced with granting citizens pieces of lands to start their commercial and industrial projects. The government also offered financial guarantees to citizens so they could leverage banking services. This process has developed over the years with the establishment of official government entities that oversee the support citizens are provided in the SME sector, such as the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development, Dubai SME, Ruwad Establishment, Saud bin Saqr Programme for Young Business Leaders, and the Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla Program for Youth Projects Support. The Federal Law No. 2 of 2014, pertaining to the SME sector, was a remarkable achievement in the development, organization, and definition of this sector. It also provided a number of benefits to national SME projects. This law is a reflection of the leadership's keenness in growing the SME sector. The UAE cabinet, headed by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, approved the decision to create a council for SME projects and establishments, and to launch the National Programme for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Projects to support their owners with benefits and incentives that boost the spirit of entrepreneurship. As a result of the above-mentioned legislations and support, around 350,000 SMEs and projects have been established in the country—creating job opportunities for over 86% of the total workforce in the private sector. Small- and medium-sized projects today account for over 94% of the total number of companies working in the UAE. Of these, 73% is in the wholesale and retail trade sector and 16% is in services, while the industrial sector accounts for the remaining 11%.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the resilience of Dubai's economy in the face of external economic pressure?</h4><p>The UAE's economic resilience is a result of many factors, such as its non-reliance on one resource of income, with non-oil sectors currently contributing about 70% to the economy. The contribution of non-oil sectors to the GDP is increasing annually, thus helping to reduce the reliance on oil. We expect that non-oil sectors will contribute up to 80% of the GDP by 2021, which will enhance the country's resilience toward any negative impacts of market fluctuations or global oil prices. Assuming that oil prices remain low, thus leading to a reduction in the oil sector's contribution to the GDP, this in turn will lead to an income increase in other sectors that have been positively impacted by the decline in oil prices. The IMF expects that the UAE will register good growth levels regardless of other global economic challenges. This is another indicator that we are heading in the right direction despite all the challenges facing the global economy in general and our national economy in particular. Furthermore, the UAE has proved to be an attractive investment haven thanks to a legal environment that protects investors and guarantees their rights. We are also monitoring the markets to control inflation rates, which will in turn boost the appeal of our cities to some of the largest global companies and their employees. The UAE economy has proved to be strong and promising—regionally and globally. It has maintained a significant growth level throughout the past years. In addition, the UAE's cash reserves in offshore accounts have largely limited the negative impacts of fluctuating emerging market economies in the last two years.</p><h4>The revised federal budget was announced at AED48.56 billion. How will this impact the real estate and construction sector, which looks at strong public investment to generate positive sentiment?</h4><p>Firstly, I would like to note that the federal budget is in good shape and has been able to keep up with the requirements of the government and its development plans for the current year. The truth is that our non-oil national economy enjoyed a strong performance in 2015—mainly driven by construction and industrial projects. The national economy includes several elements that are closely linked, such as the real estate market, which in many developed economies is a reflection of the country's economic growth. In 2016, we expect to see a year of sustained growth in foreign investment entering our country. To leverage this investment effectively, we are creating more projects in different economic sectors. This will be reflected in the supply and demand system in the real estate sector, which will gradually increase the value of real estate in the coming years and lead to the launch of more important real estate projects. With regard to infrastructure, our expectations are to continue the implementation of various projects that will directly contribute to raising the attractiveness of the business environment in the UAE and enhance competition. For example, the work with a large number of infrastructure projects continues such as the expansion of national airports in the country, which amounts to AED100 billion, and the Etihad Rail network project that amounts up to AED40 billion, as well as roads, transport and tourist facilities and the work on the electronic financial services infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Real Estate Ethos]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[real-estate-ethos]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your philosophy on real estate, as well as on architecture and design, contributed to the growth of ALARGAN?</h4><p>It is very basic; we are in the business of adding value. We are not a primary industry; real estate is a secondary industry. Accordingly, when we go and develop or build, we have to build to the specifications of the end user. We focus on the largest segment in society: the middle class. When we go to a new territory, in that territory we make sure we understand quite well what would raise the bar. Right now we are entering into Morocco, and we found that there are certain things that are not being served for the middle class. We go the extra mile to provide them with that service. As far as style goes, once something we have built is occupied it is not only a box to come and work in, but a place the client can be comfortable in. We provide our customers with that feeling and with basic amenities, whether it has to do with proper parking, services like a gym, an auditorium, or a place to eat. That is why we hope to couple retail with residential with design spaces so that they can be accessed without a car, and in the future we will create entire communities that are developed with that ethos in mind. These are services that complete the basic amenities that our clients are looking for. That is what we do.</p><h4>Initially your focus was on building middle-income housing, but you have other projects. Where are you looking now and how are you driving growth at Alargan?</h4><p>We announced our 2020 strategy last year. By the year 2020, we will make sure that we secure a 40% return on our capital with 20% every year, so it is 40/20 at 2020. This has brought in another parallel to our focus where we have to produce income-generating properties for which insurance and cash flow is steady and will offset the locality of developments. We are doing a project in Salmiya that has to do with retail; we have another one coming up in Sabah Al Salem, which is mostly a social club, with services, and education and health facilities all together, for middle-income families. The health side will be something of a subsidiary of ours. It is focused on something that is really missing in the market from the private sector side: physiotherapy treatment.</p><h4>Real estate prices have fallen in Kuwait recently. What effect will this have on you?</h4><p>It will affect us in a good way. It is always good to have a correction. We will also see a drop in retail prices, which is something we already forecasted in our studies about three or four years ago. Our studies are always built on smaller numbers than now. It is going to be much healthier to have this drop now and to make a correction and move in a steady way, which will allow businesses to be able to function in a more healthy way than these inflated prices that we are seeing today.</p><h4>What are your ambitions, plans, and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Times are not going to be as simple as they were before, and we are already prepared for it. Whatever we are doing is within that line of preparation. We are also very excited about moving into new markets. Morocco is going to be our new territory. We are looking at other territories as well in North Africa, but now Morocco is certain. Iran is another market that has recently become very interesting after the sanctions have been mostly lifted. It is a very exciting market and we will do something there for sure in the future. For 2016 and 2017, there are other things that are already under construction or in the pipeline. We just have to make sure that we meet our deadlines and accomplish those things, and then we have to start thinking about what comes after that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[highly-valued]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief summary of the recent trends within each of the major property segments covered by Colliers International?</h4><p>The residential sector has definitely had a run up in value and supply over the last four or five years. It is reaching a stage where some segments of the market appear to be approaching saturation. There are some structural weaknesses in the economy that also make future residential growth less strong than it has been. These weaknesses are in purchasing power, household debt, and the general export situation, which has been depressed, along with the global economy. All of these factors have had an impact. Domestically, banks have reined in lending a fair bit as well. We do not see signs of distress, though it is definitely not as strong as it was. The one segment that seems to be defying this trend within the residential sector is the upper-end of the market. This is being driven mainly by high net worth individuals who have little confidence in alternative investment products. There is a tendency not just in Thailand, but also throughout Asia, for wealth to gravitate to property. We see that clearly here at the top end. There is, however, no great depth to that high-end market. In the commercial real estate sector, the office segment is particularly strong. To understand this you have to realize how strong the residential market has been. In Bangkok land prices have followed condominium prices and it is all related to infrastructure development. Condominium projects are being built close to infrastructure projects, mainly the MRT and the BTS. This has driven up land and the condominium prices to the point where office developers cannot buy land. Where in other cities you might find prime road frontage in the commercial business district being snapped up by commercial developers, it is not the case here. The result is that there is relatively little new supply in the office segment, while demand is not weak.</p><h4>What macroeconomic factors are driving this demand in the office segment?</h4><p>Much of it is domestic expansion more than anything. There is growth in the e-commerce sector and there are more start-ups growing into bigger businesses and taking up more office space. Many of these businesses do not require much office space to start with; however, as they grow they take on more staff and can become large operations. Rents in the office segment have moved up pretty sharply. As the situation with the land prices continues, there is likely to be a continuing shortage of new office developments. We also witness a growing trend of large multinationals setting up their regional offices in Bangkok. Initially we did not see any immediate affect after the AEC was established in 2015. Now more foreign investors are coming to Thailand. Bangkok provides a center within the AEC for foreign investors who want to invest or develop projects in Myanmar, Laos, or Cambodia. However, there are still certain constraints here. One of the biggest constraints for the office market is staff availability. There is almost full employment in Thailand and the country has a demographic pyramid that is similar to China. Therefore, you do not see a lot of young people coming through and education and English language skills are lacking.</p><h4>How do these trends translate to the commercial real estate market in areas outside Bangkok, especially with special economic zones (SEZs) and the government's efforts to push industry to the borders?</h4><p>Thailand has an extremely centralized economy and there is really only one commercial city. There are other little pockets elsewhere; however, ultimately Bangkok is where all the business is. The government has been trying to push development out of Bangkok. This has been a theme for the last 30 years. The first stage of this was the eastern seaboard, which has done spectacularly well. Now the government is trying to replicate that success by going further afield. It has latched onto the four or five million immigrant laborers who come to Thailand for work, and bringing that work to the borders. There is some logic to this, although it begs the question why neighboring countries would not just set up these industries themselves on their side of the border if this were a feasible idea. In any case, the land portion of those SEZs has been the first property to take of and there has been an enormous amount of land speculation around the SEZs.</p><h4>What impact will transport expansion projects have on inner-city development and the future of Thailand's real estate sector?</h4><p>It will have a huge impact—today we have two MRT lines and the impact of those two lines alone has been massive. It has created pockets of development that we would not have had otherwise. Therefore, with the expansion of the MRT we can expect to see massive changes. We should see further clusters of commercial development springing up. There have been a lot of M&amp;As going on and we expect many more alliances like that happening. Even going back just 10 years ago there were four or five significant developers who had a pretty low market share in the residential sector. Right now there are probably 10 to 15. The market has become so brand conscious that it is difficult for the smaller developers to sell properties in it. So even if the overall market does not grow, these large developers can keep taking more market share and continue to grow. The big guys are just getting bigger.</p><h4>How have Colliers' business segments been performing?</h4><p>Our positioning is most clearly on the advisory side of the business. We are market leaders in advisory services, and this business continues to be strong. Our typical clients are landlords, and we have some government clients that we do a lot of work for. We also assist property funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs) that need valuation services, as well as international institutions or investors looking to place money here. We see many more international investors, especially from China and Japan. We have many Japanese clients and a strong relationship with our Japanese office. They visit once a month now with clients. We want to maintain our market positioning. We also do a great deal of brokerage work. We do plenty of tenant representation work as well. Colliers is not the market leader for representing landlords; our position has been that we represent mainly tenants, such as multinational firms looking for office or industrial space. We also do some project sales, both inside and outside of Bangkok, which helps residential developers sell property.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How and why did DuPont decide to split off its chemical businesses into Chemours?</h4><p>DuPont had always been recognized and was born out of developing chemical applications and chemical products for several industries. That has been the story for just over 200 years; however, as the world continues to evolve, the CEO and management of DuPont decided that the future of the company was more in nutrition, food, and bio-technology, but at the same time the chemical segment still represented a major part of the company turnover and growth. That was and remains strong today, so the strategic decision was to separate the company into two. Chemours was created as a spin-off of all the chemical businesses. The separation took place over 2014, and we became officially separate on July 1, 2015. DuPont does not have any shares or own any stock in the Chemours Company, and vice versa. They are totally separate and independent companies.</p><h4>What business areas does Chemours now have?</h4><p>We have 8,000 employees and a $6.5 billion annual turnover. Chemours' businesses were organized into three business units. One is the Titanium Technologies business unit, through which we manufacture mainly a white pigment called titanium dioxide, used mostly in the coatings industry. It grows as the middle class and GDP grows, because infrastructure needs to grow and that means more roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and houses, and all of that drives the consumption of TiO2. We are the global leader in the TiO2 industry with the largest producer and the highest market share. We have the largest manufacturing plant worldwide of TiO2 located in Altamira, Tamaulipas, Mexico, where we are finalizing an investment of over $600 million. The second business unit is the Fluoroproducts business, where we have a number of applications. We are also a number-one global maker of Fluoroproducts and in Mexico the leader as a quality provider in refrigerants and propellants. One important usage of these products are refrigerants, which are used for air-conditioning systems for home, offices, and industrial use, food storage in supermarkets, and so on. Recently we announced an invest of $230 million over three years to construct the new facility at the Chemours Corpus Christi site in Ingleside, Texas, with start-up expected in third quarter of 2018. This investment will triple capacity of Opteon„¢ products, a refrigerant with very low Global Warming Potential (GWP), enabling Chemours to capitalize on a cornerstone growth opportunity. The new site will use an innovative, patented process to manufacture Opteon„¢ YF (HFO-1234yf), which is used in automotive air conditioning and in Opteon„¢ refrigerant blends for a range of applications. Another application of fluoropolymers applications is Teflon„¢, which has developed non-stick surfaces in pans. We own the well-known Teflon„¢ brand name, and we continue to invest in improving our capacity and supply to customers. The third area of business is the chemical solutions business, where we have six smaller business units. One of the points of our transformation plan is to review our portfolio of chemical solutions businesses, where there were a few businesses that were not performing well over the last few years. The market for these products was not growing, so we are reviewing our strategic approach in this business and we will probably divest some of these operations and concentrate our investments in areas where we see growth and technology leadership, such as the mining industry, in which we are the global leaders as a manufacturer of a chemical solution that is essential for this industry and the leader supplying this product in Mexico, as well.</p><h4>Where did the name Chemours come from?</h4><p>It is a nice and well thought out name. The form of the logo represents a chemical molecule. The logo has three Cs, which stands for Chemours, chemistry, and customer centered. Our name, Chemours, means the Chemistry of Ours and refers to how we develop our chemistry together with our employees and customers. We also wanted to make a connection to the heritage of how the company was born, since this was a spin-off from DuPont, whose founder was born in de Nemours City in France. We have been in the chemical industry for 200 years, and I have almost 30 years of experience in the chemical sector. We maintain a nice blend of young talent and older experienced employees. We have five key behaviors that we want instill in the company culture, the first of which is refreshing simplicity. We are now a smaller company and we have the opportunity to keep the best systems and processes that we used to have at DuPont, but simplify the processes that are not required for a company the size of Chemours. The second behavior is safety obsession. We work with hazardous materials, and we do it better than anyone in the industry. Environment, safety, and the health of people are our number-one priority. The third behavior is collective entrepreneurship. As a smaller company we want to make everyone feel like they are at home and have the creativity and the possibility to innovate; that is something that everyone should feel empowered to do. The fourth value is unshakable integrity. We are a global company with 35 manufacturing sites, serving more than 5,000 customers in 130 countries of North America, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe and will not risk deviating from ethical behavior, which applies to how we treat people, how we respect the environment, and how we conduct our business. The fifth targeted behavior is customer centered and has to do with ensuring that we are well connected to our customers and that we listen and collaborate hand in hand with them.</p><h4>What is the significance of Mexico for Chemours globally?</h4><p>Mexico is a key country for Chemours, right now. We are finishing a $600 million investment at a Titanium Dioxide plant in Mexico. This project began three years ago and construction was completed in December 2015. We are targeting commercial production by April 2016, making this plant the largest TiO2 producer globally, and we now export from Mexico to Europe, South America, the US, and the rest of the world. We are producing around 150,000 tons of titanium oxide, and the new line that we are due to start in April will more than double our capacity. This plant started back in 1959 when the first investment in the plant began. It had an initial annual capacity of just 4,000 tons. Over the last 15 years the capabilities of our plant and the people within it have increased significantly. From being one of the lower performing manufacturing sites within our segment, we grew to be one of the best-performing plants around safety, quality, consistency, and costs. The first foreign investment that DuPont made outside of the US was in Mexico back in 1925, so we have in a way been doing business in the country for 90 years. It is also interesting that the first investment that Chemours is doing outside US is also in Mexico. With all of the integration that is growing every year between North America and Mexico, it makes this plant a strategic location for us. This investment will also give us growth; therefore, the focus of our attention and resources for the next couple of years is the plant and utilizing the capacity as much and as quickly as we can.</p><h4>Given that you work with many potentially hazardous chemicals, how are environmental concerns integrated into your operations?</h4><p>Safety obsession and unshakable integrity are two of our core values. If we step back a little bit, chemistry touches our lives in many ways and in many aspects, and it will not go away. It would be difficult to maintain the quality of life that we have without chemistry and chemical products. What is important here and what we have identified and recognized for many years now is that chemistry serves society, chemistry serves quality of life, and it can be well used if we do it safely in a responsible way. This is at the core of our DNA.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There are plans to increase Ghana's domestic aviation capacity. What are the main challenges to that development?</h4><p>The challenge is how to fund expansion; domestic aviation is not as profitable as international aviation. Airports fund themselves via passenger service charges. A domestic service charge has been set low to promote domestic aviation, but the safety standards of airports must be standardized. We already have four regional airports: Tamale, Kumasi, Sunyani, and Takoradi. Takoradi is run by the military air force, though civilian aircraft do travel to it. We embarked on two additional airports last year. One airport is an existing runway of 2,000m and is in good shape, we just need to do some ancillary work. We then started a new airport, beginning with a simple runway of 1,600m by 30m. The project is supposed to be completed this year. Based on our cash flows, we may look at some of the other regional capitals. The president's vision is to have an airport in every region, both to promote socio-political development and to boost domestic aviation. Airport communities tend to have added value, hence we coined the phrase “Airport City." We are planning to form JVs with developers for this.</p><h4>Your experience has until two years ago been in the finance sector. What challenges did you face when you took over this company?</h4><p>I spent 25 years in finance and banking, so I came to the airport with a new administration and a mandate to transform the airport in alignment with the President's vision to develop Ghana as a regional aviation hub. Our mission is to provide excellent airport facilities and be a leading airport business in West Africa. Following a self-assessment, we concluded that we needed two things: good infrastructure and excellent service. There was a big infrastructure deficit at Kotoka International Airport (KIA), so we embarked on a program to address that. The airport was overcrowded, most of the equipment was outdated and dilapidated, and there were issues with infrastructure, runways, bathrooms, the terminal building, and the baggage systems. We started to systematically address them all, and we have improved significantly to date, resolving 95% of the issues.</p><h4>Why was Ghana's travel industry so resilient during the Ebola crisis?</h4><p>We suffered by association, but only a bit. Our business at the airport is diverse, and our international market did not suffer. We were proactive from the moment it began. We have a health clinic attached, we introduced thermal body screening thermometers, and there was a lot of public education through posters and hand sanitizers at all the regional airports. The media in Ghana also helped; Ghanaians were aware of what was happening and it did not stop people from traveling.</p><h4>You are about to launch your flagship Terminal 3 project. How will that affect your capacity?</h4><p>We had a footfall last year of 2.5 million. The designed capacity of KIA is around 500,000, so the project is demand-driven rather than speculative. It will be a purpose-built international terminal, and we expect it to be completed around July 2017. It will be a first-class terminal facility capable of handling 5 million passengers a year and 1,200 passengers at peak hours, with six air bridges that can be expanded to eight. It will include 45,000sqft of space for commercial use, three business lounges, and approval for six baggage carousels. We looked to the capital markets to raise funds. The objective was to raise $400 million; we have to date secured $250 million, while the other $150 million has yet to be sourced. The airport has to offer a full complement of services, including hotels, food, waiting lounges, meeting rooms, security, car parks, and all of those related investments are going to have to be provided. Some of those we will provide ourselves, but those that are easier for the private sector to do will be sourced accordingly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Mubadala responding to the pressures of the current macroeconomic situation?</h4><p>Any prudent, active global investor should be managing its portfolio through challenging economic conditions. For Mubadala, this has meant optimizing expenditures, both operational and capital, monetizing assets when value creation opportunities exist, and ensuring that we maintain a diverse portfolio in order to maintain stability through volatility. We continue to meticulously evaluate our portfolio to ensure we are applying the right mix of long-term strategic vision with the ability to adapt when opportunities arise. If we see the right conditions materialize we have and will continue to consider the merits of monetization. We believe that the current global economic environment underpins the importance of our shareholder's vision to diversify Abu Dhabi's economy, and the role Mubadala plays in delivering on that vision. For patient investors, this offers opportunities and we will continue making targeted investments that advance Abu Dhabi's priorities.</p><h4>What role does Mubadala, as a state-owned investment fund, play within the national economy at a time when the deficit has widened?</h4><p>First of all, it is important to understand that Mubadala's mandate to support Abu Dhabi's economic diversification has not changed since we were set up by the Abu Dhabi government over 14 years ago. In fact, our particular focus is even more intense during cycles like these, in terms of delivering the transforming the economy in line with strategic priorities. Against this backdrop, 2015 was another strong year of delivery, with Mubadala contributing to a range of milestone developments in the UAE, including the opening of Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, the region's most sophisticated hospital. This complex care facility is the only one of its kind in the region and reduces the need for thousands of UAE patients to travel abroad for treatment. In 2015, the hospital completed more than 58,000 appointments and 2,300 surgeries for patients, many of whom would have otherwise required overseas treatment. Another success story for us has been Strata, our composite aero structures manufacturer, which saw Boeing deliver the first 787 Dreamliner to Etihad Airways with UAE-made components. Strata is also part of an industrial cluster that is creating tens of thousands of local jobs and providing opportunities for the UAE's residents and businesses alike.</p><h4>Which markets are currently appealing to Mubadala, bearing in mind mixed sentiment around BRICS, and low oil prices hammering GCC economies?</h4><p>As a global investor with a long-term perspective, Mubadala is constantly assessing multiple markets. In 2015, for example, we established a $10 billion UAE-China Joint Investment Fund with China Development Bank Capital and China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange. The fund will have the flexibility to look at a range of alternative investment strategies, asset classes, and special opportunities, including greenfield investment projects with the aim of building a balanced portfolio with a focus on sustainable returns and principal capital protection. The strategic and commercial partnership builds on investments we have made through Mubadala Capital, our dedicated, in-house asset and investment management unit. With a focus on sovereign investments, including those with Russia and France, we gain direct access to key international markets alongside trusted local partners, who bring local expertise and investment access to the table. Brazil is another market where Mubadala has interests. In 2015, we finalized the restructuring of our $2 billion preferred equity investment in the EBX Group. The completion of this complex restructuring has enabled us to gain a portfolio of assets that hold attractive, long-term value in sectors aligned with, and complementary to, core Mubadala businesses, such as metals and mining, infrastructure, and real estate. The aggregate value of these assets is now in excess of the original amount invested, and we have opened an office in Rio de Janeiro to manage the Brazil investment portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the domestic pharmaceutical industry over the last year, and what more needs to be done?</h4><p>Last year in the domestic pharmaceutical industry there was a royal decree that regulated pharmaceutical work in Oman. This has given pharmacies double the space to sell non-prescription products, so they can generate more income. As a result, it has reduced the prices of a majority of drugs, some by more than 50%. There was a decision by GCC countries to unify the price of drugs in all member states. Oman had some of the highest prices for drugs in the region, and now prices are much cheaper. Our aim is to have more of this industry based in Oman. We had visits from international pharmaceutical companies, both from the region and the West. I hope they will study our proposals to have a base and produce medication in Oman. Establishing a strong pharmaceutical sector in Oman will be the gateway to East Africa and to Iran, as well as the GCC. If any investor in healthcare, pharmaceutical companies, or hospitals is serious about investing in Oman, we can provide them with a plot of land as part of a medical city. I have 5 million sqm available purely for healthcare facilities and logistics support. In pharmaceuticals, we still import more than 93% of our medications. We want medication security. I am hoping to see more international companies coming to Oman to have a base. The facilities are available and the regulations are much simpler than they used to be.</p><h4>What are some of the new objectives pursued by the Ministry of Health as part of the government's ninth Five-Year Plan for the country?</h4><p>This is my sixth year as the Minster of Health and my goal is to improve the quality of healthcare in Oman. When I was appointed in 2010, the Ministry of Health had just over 4,000 doctors. Today, we have more than 8,000. The number of nurses and professionals has doubled as well. Between 2010 and 2015, we introduced 80 new clinical services, and we opened more than 16 health centers and facilities. We opened a cardiac center in Salalah, in Muscat, added a genetics center, and we expanded the oncology center. We just signed a contract to build four facilities, and there are about 16 more in the pipeline to be built by the end of 2016. This is part of our plan, but our concentration is still building the capacity in human resources. More than 70% of our doctors are expatriates. We need to increase the number and quality of Omani doctors. In addition to the two medical schools in Oman, we started sending Omanis to study medicine abroad. Our target is 50 students per year. The medical schools here graduate about 220 doctors per year and our target is about 350. Also, some projects that were not implemented from the previous plan, if the financial situation allows, will be finished. For example, there is a large hospital in Salalah, one in Suwayq, Falah Hospital, and in Khasab. The need for these four hospitals is definitely there and they will be done. We have almost 95% coverage for primary healthcare in the country, which is one of the highest worldwide but we are still aiming to reach higher.</p><h4>Do you see the health sector as a good location for future PPPs in Oman?</h4><p>Absolutely. I would start with the medial city. It will be open for private investors to build, own, and operate there. At the moment, the private sector does not have the capacity to provide the services I want to buy. For example, we are still buying renal dialysis. We have units all across the country, but the demand is increasing. We want to encourage the private sector, but it is slow to respond. We started buying services from the private sector to encourage them to expand. Secondly, we provide them with statistical information about the needs of the country and locations for healthcare expansion. Everyone wants to be in Muscat, but there are certain parts of Oman that are heavily populated, and the private sector is still lagging behind. In addition, there are other incentives, like plots of land. Land applications for developing healthcare centers can be processed within 24 hours. If they prove they can provide high-quality services, we will definitely buy more from them. I am optimistic that private healthcare in Oman will continue to grow. If more of our hospitals are trusted by the population here, we can treat patients here instead of having them go abroad and keep the money in the country. I am also hoping to become a hub for medical tourism for GCC countries and for the huge populations of India and Iran. If someone comes to Oman, the visa regulation is easy, the environment is peaceful, and the facilities are attractive.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to safeguard the population against new diseases and epidemics?</h4><p>We have had outbreaks of Hepatitis A and also Crimean-Congo fever. We abide by international laws and report every case that must be reported to international agencies like WHO. Protecting the public from outbreaks of diseases is the responsibility of the country and the Ministry of Health plays a leading role, but it cannot be achieved by us alone. Both of these outbreaks are infectious diseases. One is an animal-to-human disease, and there is a necessity to ensure that animals imported to the country are clear of diseases. Concerning the outbreak of Hepatitis A, we did not vaccinate our children for this before because it was not considered a burden on this country, but we are considering it now. The vaccination rate in Oman otherwise is almost 100%. There is still a threat in Oman of some international viruses, such as Zika. We take steps to prepare just in case we have these outbreaks. That said, non-communicable diseases are more costly. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases constitute about 63% of causes of deaths in Oman and the region, in addition to traffic accidents. Unfortunately, our lifestyle habits are not great. Physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and tobacco use are chief concerns. The Ministry of Health cannot fix these problems without other government agencies. I cannot increase the tax on tobacco or tax fast food, for example. We can ask people to be more active physically, but we need to provide them with facilities to go out and exercise.</p><h4>What is your vision over the next 12 months?</h4><p>For the coming 12 months, I want to take into consideration the limited resources we have now and to retain the good standard of healthcare we have achieved. If you go to any country where governments spend less than 3% on healthcare, you will have a waiting list. Today many of our waiting lists are almost zero. Knee replacements used to be 2.5 years, now you may only need to wait 4-6 weeks in Muscat, or one week in a local hospital. Oman's position worldwide in healthcare is highly appreciated. For example, among 90 countries assessed by the WHO for management of vaccines, Oman was rated number one worldwide. Oman is now used as an international training center in this regard.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate BSE's operations during 2015?</h4><p>The year 2015 witnessed relatively modest trading movement on the BSE. In the year's 241 trading sessions, 74.6 million shares were traded for a value of $629 million, compared to 96.8 million shares valued at $661.4 million for the year 2014. This represents a decrease of 22.9% and 4.9%, respectively on the volume and value of shares traded. Total listed capitalization remained almost unchanged at the end of the year 2015 at the level of $11.22 billion. Finally, the value of secondary public offerings in 2015 decreased by 85% to reach $80 million against $521 million in 2014. This may be attributed to the political situation in the country and the large extent to which this situation is deterring administrators from getting involved in the BSE or for the already listed ones to come out with new activities.</p><h4>Nearly 90% of companies listed on the BSE belong to the financial sector. How are you attracting companies from other sectors to diversify operations?</h4><p>Diversifying the structure of listed companies on the BSE is one of the biggest challenges the stock market has faced since its reopening 20 years ago. Lebanese businesses are, in their vast majority, small, family-owned firms that prefer to finance their activities through bank credit in order to keep control over their companies. These companies do not see the advantages of being listed on the stock exchange; clearly, they are more influenced by the banking culture and would prefer to go under a bank's umbrella. On the other hand, almost all big companies are still owned by the state with no clear plan for privatization in the near future. We are trying to correct the current situation by giving increasing attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on the BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholder base by highlighting the importance and advantages of financing through the stock exchange. We need first to recognize the specific needs faced by start-up companies and address these in an appropriate fashion. Start-ups need the financing that the BSE can help them raise. At the same time, they are not always prepared to meet reporting requirements that currently exist on our exchange and do not have the kind of resources necessary to inform investors on a regular basis about company developments. We can help by designing a special market—to run in parallel with the official market and the junior market—for these companies with lighter reporting requirements and listing rules. The BSE can also assist start-ups with training on matters such as investor relations and communications.</p><h4>How will the eventual privatization of the BSE change the public's view on the institution?</h4><p>A private stock exchange will give its management flexibility in doing business. The public will be more confident to trade here. Local as well as foreign investors will see that things are moving forward in Lebanon. Hopefully, investors will also come back in masses to the country once the political situation is stabilized.</p><h4>What have been the major transformations brought about by the Capital Market Authority (CMA)?</h4><p>Currently, the CMA is in the process of updating and releasing new regulations. Up until now, the CMA released 20 regulations that govern financial markets, disclosure policy, crowd funding, insider trading, derivatives, securitization, and collective investment schemes as well as regulations concerning financial institutions, brokerage firms, and the suitability of people selling financial products.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the BSE in the following year?</h4><p>The future of the BSE depends fully on the completion of the privatization process, since this will signal the true engagement of the financial sector. Once this process is implemented, I hope that Beirut will recover part of its former place as a leading financial capital market in the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SPAD was established under the Land Public Transport Act in 2010. What have been your major achievements since then?</h4><p>SPAD has had some tremendous achievements, especially compared to the period before 2010. Public transport was a fragmented industry with 13 agencies involved in planning without any coordination. Based on success models from abroad, like LTA in Singapore and Transport for London in the UK, we realized we needed integrated planning and SPAD was thus established. Our mandate was to not only be the regulator, but also the planner and executor of all the key infrastructural projects in the country. Malaysia has undertaken a rapid pace of urbanization, developing from a rural society to an industrial nation. The rate of urbanization has increased tremendously from the 10% figure 40 years to nearly 70% today. These new dynamics impose challenges in terms of mobility management and addressing the issues of traffic congestion. In 2016, we will complete a major program for LRT extension of both the Kelana Jaya and the Ampang line, which will add capacity of up to 300,000 passengers per day. MRT 1 will be completed by June 2017, which is a significant achievement as it connects northwestern Kuala Lumpur all the way to the south, spanning 52km and connecting major demand corridors. We are already planning MRT 2, another 52km line, and are conducting a study for a third line. The Greater Kuala Lumpur rail is the backbone of our public transportation network, and we are investing a great deal to make this happen. We develop a major transformative infrastructure project to help mobility across Kuala Lumpur. We plan it, we receive ministerial approval, and we set up agencies to ensure development and operations. Our role is major planning and regulation; we ensure that the work is done in accordance with the guidelines and technical specifications.</p><h4>What are the objectives of all these rail projects?</h4><p>In addition to reducing congestion on the roads and increasing mobility, there is the sustainability aspect of public transportation. We see the MRT as a green project as it takes cars off the road. In addition, we need to take the “first and last mile" into consideration; you cannot have world-class infrastructure without a world-class bus or taxi service. We also improve bus services in suburban areas to link housing estates to rail stations. In total, we have invested MYR100 billion in public transport in Greater Kuala Lumpur: that is in the last five years and the next five years. That includes MRT 1 and 2, the just completed double-tracking project from Kuala Lumpur to Ipoh, the projected double-tracking from Johor to Kuala Lumpur, and the high-speed rail (HSR) to Singapore. Greater Kuala Lumpur is the nucleus of the country, but we need to connect to other urban centers as well. The HSR to Singapore is a game changer; it will fundamentally change the dynamics of how the two cities interact and how the two countries will open up investments, business, mobility, and tourism. Traveling to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur currently takes about five hours via air, and with the HSR that journey will be reduced to two-and-a-half hours—arriving 30 minutes before check in, a 90-minute journey, and 30-minute arrival procedures. We learnt from Japan, France, and Spain that it helps to develop cities along the corridor, which is extremely important for us. The west of the country has always been more developed and the eastern states need our attention for development. We are currently studying a new East Coast rail line to link the ports via this new rail initiative. This will spur a multiplier effect on our projected infrastructure developments. Buses have always been a neglected part of the public transport systems, lacking proper planning. The government has now assured its commitment—resources, people, and funding—to ensure there is an efficient bus service to connect with the existing train services. Projects in Kangar, Perlis, Seremban, and Negeri Sembilan have seen a 30% increase in ridership since we started. The BRT is the most exciting project with elevated bus terminals along the most congested highway in Kuala Lumpur. The BRT can fundamentally change the way people see bus services. We hope to see ridership in public transport double in the next five years.</p><h4>The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore line is a cross-border project between SPAD and LTA. How is this cooperation working out?</h4><p>It is going well; we deliver what we promise. The negotiations started a few years ago and it is a complex case because of the technical aspects, the financing, and the mapping. It is also important to note that 90% of the line is in Malaysia, and we had to ensure that we came up with an equitable arrangement in terms of financing. We agreed on a bilateral committee, overseen by SPAD and LTA, to ensure that the project will be executed properly.</p><h4>How are you addressing new developments on the taxi markets, with peer-to-peer taxi applications like Uber and GrabCar?</h4><p>The taxi industry in Malaysia needs to be transformed. It needs to change to reflect changes in technology, as well as consumer interests and to be able to provide first class service. There have been many complaints from both tourists and locals about our current taxi service. Uber and Grabcar have jumped into this market, with their commute sharing technologies. The key question is how to be fair. At the moment, they use unlicensed cars and are, therefore, excluded from taxi regulations. This is a common problem around the world, with taxi drivers protesting everywhere. We have four principles of looking at this. The first is that we embrace technology, no matter if it is disruptive. We welcome competition and we support new players coming into the market. We also believe in a level playing field; what you impose on taxi drivers must also be adopted by any other new service, such as Uber or GrabCar—they must follow the law. The fourth is that we must be fair to taxi drivers and take their complaints seriously. If this business model is indeed outdated, then we should change it. Based on those four principles, we will look for solutions for regulations in the taxi market. It is not our job to provide services, so the business model, the fares, and services are up to the industry. SPAD will develop the regulatory framework, maintain standards, and listen to issues in society.</p><h4>What is your role in regards to the responsibility of “right of way" in the context of land use?</h4><p>Our first priority is rail alignment. The law enables us to acquire the land that the government has allocated for rail lines. We also talk to operators to ensure they include transit-orientated development in their construction plan that will enable us to capture the value of the land appreciation or even potential revenue in the future. It becomes endowment revenue, as we have learned it is possible to carry the costs by fares eventually. We increasingly look at such transport development: a mixed urban development is needed around rail stations. In the context of Kuala Lumpur, the urban sprawl is not ideal because it still encourages the use of private vehicles, which we try to reduce. Integrated development is key here: if the development is 5km from the rail line, then there needs to be a connected bus network. We refer to this as “the demand, pull factor." We try to pull people into using public transport, improving the infrastructure. There is the push factor as well, like the price of parking. We need to join forces and develop policies to make public transport economically attractive. But, before we impose new conditions and congestion charges, we need to ensure the system is world class.</p><h4>What is your agenda for the year ahead?</h4><p>Malaysia has achieved tremendous growth in the last five years, greatly supported by development in public transportation. I would like to see our current projects come to fruition in a safe and reliable manner and for us to start operations flawlessly. We need to gain the confidence of the greater public. I want to ensure that our planned projects, like the HSR and the East Coast Railway, will enter the next phase of development, and become finalized. We need to work on a sustainable financing model—we are building billion-dollar projects in the next five years and need to ensure that there are returns to the government. We have to remain competitive to induce people to use public transportation so we have to look at transit-orientated development and recoup the government's investment. For example, with the HSR, the mandate is not only developing the rail system but development around the stations as well. I see the SPAD initiative as part of an inclusive government, because not everyone can afford a car; saving money by using inexpensive public transportation increases disposable income.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the importance of the transport sector to Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>The transport sector is the second most important sector of the economy after oil and gas. This sector is the one that affects all sectors, including oil and gas. We are currently upgrading all modes of transport, including rail, roads, sea, and air. We have been working on the seaports at Onitsha, Baro, and Lokoja. The first two are ready and the third will be ready soon. We are talking with Chinese companies to see how we can capitalize on Nigeria's internal waterways and use them as a means of transport. In railways, we're in the process of developing a plan to lay 2650km of new railways, investing $20 billion over a period of four years. The construction of two deepwater ports is also underway in Lekki, near Lagos and at Ibaka in Akwa Ibom River State. The Lekki deepwater port is still in a starting phase but both these developments will be critical, particularly to handle trans-shipping.</p><h4>How can you expand the capacity utilization of the dry ports in Nigeria?</h4><p>Dry ports and extensions are key, and will provide stimulus to the economy. We want our dry ports to be close to where we construct our new railways, especially the Lagos-Kano railway.</p><h4>What role does Nigeria want to play within West African Regional Rail integration?</h4><p>We are developing this integrated system, because the amount of cargo and services that can be transported within the region is huge. It is an ECOWAS-driven project and will facilitate greater trade and development of solid minerals, finished goods, agriculture, and so on, boosting the economic development of the region.</p><h4>What is your assessment on the potential of Lagos as a transport hub within ECOWAS?</h4><p>We need more airlines coming to Nigeria and the region. This is starting to change and more airlines are coming here, such as Alitalia, Air France, United, Delta, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, and so on. However, we still need more regional airlines to connect our 22 airports. The promotion of inter-regional flights and transport routes is also key to this development. In the next five years we aim to have a range of regional flights.</p><h4>After South Africa, Nigeria's air travel sector is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa. How are you working to keep this privileged position?</h4><p>We have fixed the communications aspect of air travel, and everything concerning safety, to ensure that we minimize the risk of all preventable accidents. We are also building more connections with airlines. For example, Turkish Airlines will begin flights to Port Harcourt, on top of its flights to Lagos and Abuja. There is huge volume of trade going on in Nigeria, and air travel will expand to cater to these growing needs and demands. The government has plans to concede the management of four airports to improve services and create higher standards. The four airports in question are Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt.</p><h4>What kind of legacy would you like to leave after your term of office?</h4><p>For me, the most important project for the next four years is the railway project. This will change the country greatly and have a positive impact on the economic development of Nigeria. It is a NGN4 trillion project, which is totally unprecedented. The impact will be felt in all sectors of the economy and provide employment, contributing to Nigeria on both a macro and micro level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the milestones for Bank Audi during 2015 and how would you assess the Group's overall performance?</h4><p>Bank Audi achieved a good performance last year, despite persisting regional uncertainties affecting our three pillar markets of Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt. We had a 15% increase in the Bank's consolidated profits, which is attributed to all main entities rather than to a single one. We have adjusted our operating conditions in a way to improve our spreads, to enhance our non-interest income generation, and to limit increases in our operating expenses. Breaking down the consolidated performance over the main markets, Bank Audi (Lebanon) witnessed an increase in net earnings amid sluggish economic conditions, mainly as a result of achieving productivity gains and improving efficiency. In the case of Turkey and Egypt, our operations were supported by relatively good economic performances, with each market achieving real GDP growth of around 4% translating into a double-digit banking activity growth. Within this context, Bank Audi's operations outperformed the domestic banking sectors in both markets in terms of asset growth, loan growth, and deposit growth, adding a few basis points of market shares for our subsidiaries. Growth in revenues has accordingly more than compensated the negative impact of the depreciation in the exchanges rates in both markets, with the Egyptian pound depreciating by 10% and the Turkish lira by 25% in 2015, translating into a 15% increase in nominal net earnings.</p><h4>How did Bank Audi work through these currency devaluations?</h4><p>The exchange rate correction that both Egypt and Turkey recently went through did not affect our overall economic performances in both countries as witnessed by their relatively high growth rates. It also did not have a material impact on businesses, mostly due to a structural effect as 75% of our Egyptian activity is denominated in local currency, while the ratio reaches 50% for our Turkish operation. Having most our capital denominated in local currency minimized the impact of these currency corrections, since limited lending in US dollars reduces the risk of impaired loans. When looking at the evolution of our non-performing loan ratios in both markets, they improved in spite of the magnitude of currency correction. In all cases, correlation of NPLs in both markets with GDP growth rates is much higher than their correlation with exchange rates.</p><h4>Odea Bank became a top-10 bank in Turkey in less than four years. What was your strategy to build up Odea in the Turkish market?</h4><p>Our strategy for Odea Bank has been focused on making it a real challenger bank in Turkey. The concept comes from doing more by using less, from building state of the art infrastructure able to quickly support our franchise building in terms of accounts, customers, loans and deposits, and credit cards. Today, Odeabank has established a universal banking model and market leading productivity levels as well as strong brand recognition and customer awareness. We rank ninth in the general spectrum of banking institutions in the country, and we have a larger portfolio than global banks with over 25 years of presence in Turkey. We have remained realistic about our potential in the Turkish market, and we have lingered between tier two and tier three banks. Now, we aim at becoming number seven among conventional private banks in the country, which would position us between the lower range of tier two banks and the upper range of tier three banks.</p><h4>Do you consider exploring new markets anytime soon?</h4><p>In the near term, we are keen on strengthening our market shares in Turkey and Egypt, while maintaining our leadership in Lebanon. We are looking as well to launch operations in Iraq through a branch network this year. In the medium term, after achieving our targeted market shares in Turkey and Egypt we intend to explore further regional expansion opportunities including a presence in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, capitalizing on the Bank's existing turnovers in those regions. Furthermore, we plan to establish a footprint in the United Kingdom through a light structure to support the private banking development strategy. Our private banking franchise, which represents the fourth development pillar, actually operates through three main entities in Lebanon, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia with additional offices in Monaco, Qatar, Jordan, and the UAE.</p><h4>You have been outspoken about the harm cash inflows and domestic-driven growth cause to the economy. How can this trend be reversed to trigger larger growth rates?</h4><p>Lebanon has permanently suffered from Dutch Disease, caused by the big brain drain the country faces and the subsequent remittances the Lebanese diaspora send back to their homeland. This has created a high dependence on foreign inflows that represent an important share of disposable income in Lebanon relative to domestic income, fostering an import economy. Domestic consumption represents 77% of GDP, with imports accounting for an average of 35% of GDP. This has created a vicious cycle of overdependence on inflows to finance domestic consumption, a system that has been resilient so far but that is unsustainable in the long run. Lebanon's growth drivers should shift from domestic demand to external demand, from consumption to exports, as this would generate higher quality growth rates with respect to job creation. Efforts to initiate such a positive shift have so far been insignificant.</p><h4>What steps does the country need to take to turn into an export-driven economy?</h4><p>Lebanon needs efficient, basic utilities such as electricity, water, telecommunications, and transport. The government capital spending on infrastructure has been hovering around 1.2% of GDP over the past half a decade, against an average of 5% for emerging markets. The evident challenge facing the Lebanese policy makers is to ensure necessary infrastructure upgrading without putting at stake fiscal consolidation requirements at large. Adjusting fiscal imbalances in order for real interest rates to go down is important in this direction. It is also a matter of political commitment to guarantee basic infrastructure and put the necessary reforms and the right adjustment plans in place to ensure macroeconomic efficiency.</p><h4>Bank Audi has been a major supporter of entrepreneurial initiatives in Lebanon. What have been your main contributions to this sector of the economy?</h4><p>We were the first bank to invest and promote incubators and facilitators for startups nearly 15 years ago. We used to have the largest share of financial investment in this promising sector compared to other banks in the system with an investment portfolio of $100 million. In fact, prior to the issuance of the BDL program, Bank Audi invested in four local and regional funds as well as incubators. The BDL initiative, which was launched in August 2013 with the issuance of Circular 331, reinforced the bank's vision in investing in startups. The bank took the lead in promoting this initiative, being the largest provider of capital with $106 million of funds eligible to be directly or indirectly invested in financing local innovative and promising businesses. This is driven by our belief that the knowledge economy is one of the most significant potential drivers of the domestic economy at large, along with the financial sector and the energy sector. Nonetheless, we have to recognize that all those efforts still represent a tiny share of the total financing in Lebanon. The current consolidated level of investment in the sector is less than $400 million, while bank loans to the domestic economy represent $48 billion. This means that less than 1% of the country's financing is being channeled to this promising sector and the country has to build up more momentum to foster people's creativity and add value to this segment of the economy.</p><h4>What is your vision for the economic development of Lebanon for 2016? </h4><p>Looking back at 2015, we can say the actual macroeconomic performance did not match the potential of the Lebanese real sector on the back of an economy with large cyclical output gap, operating at less than 80% of its full-employment output. The country somehow avoided a recession and achieved an average real GDP growth of 1% last year, a weak growth by the country's development standards. Such a sluggish trend that has constrained local economic growth, mainly at the level of domestic capital formation and net foreign demand, is still there and its shadow is impeding Lebanon to grow further in 2016 and beyond. We will probably witness another year of delays in the potential economic upside of Lebanon with a significant cost to the country's economic prosperity, but we will not witness any significant shocks and lashes to the domestic economy. The challenges that lie ahead are much more an issue of delayed upside rather than downside risks. Having said that, opportunities do exist and are tied to the fact that Lebanon did not lose its intrinsic survival and resilience features and still maintains a capacity to regain strength and momentum. This is mostly tied to a potential improvement in the overall political environment that represents the key for Lebanese corporate and institutions to regain their normal status and their potential productivity and for the economy to regain confidence and faith putting an end to the gradual meltdown it underwent for the past half a decade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of PROINVEX?</h4><p>Our overarching mission is to sustain Panama's leadership in Central America in attracting FDI, namely to identify and promote investments in strategic sectors that are growing or will grow exponentially in our country. Some are evident, such as the array of services that will further grow as a result of the Panama Canal expansion project. There should be heavy investments in logistics, a doubling down on increasing Panama's capacity as a transshipment hub for the Americas, as well as attracting foreign investment in the diversifying logistics activities within the country, mainly value-added activities. This means moving beyond transshipment and looking into developing value-added logistics services, as well as increasing the country's capacity to attract and develop multi-model services going beyond 3PL into a 4PL full-service spectrum.</p><h4>What makes Panama an investment destination?</h4><p>Connectivity factors, along with a stable and dynamic, dollarized economy, strong democracy, competitive incentives regimes, investment protection laws, pro-business environment, free-market and open economic policies, and, of course, its ecological beauty and diversity, make Panama a prime investment destination. The numbers reflect this: Panama captures almost half of all FDI in Central America, and it is the only country in this region with an increasing number of investments. Between 2014 and 2015, FDI grew by about 17%, of which 50% was reinvestment. This means that not only are companies flocking to Panama, but that those that are already here are expanding, hiring, growing, and diversifying.</p><h4>What role will the financial sector play in attracting FDI?</h4><p>The financial center in Panama is huge, in the sense that the relation of its assets to Panama's GDP was 218% in 2014. Panama is a services-based economy and international finance will continue to be a pillar of growth, and the sector will also continue to be competitive, with a positive growth outlook in the short and medium term. The solidity of the financial sector is an important reason that all three main ratings agencies—Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings—have all ratified our country's investment grade. A safe and secure investment environment is a crucial determinant in a multinational's decision to invest in a country. Panama leads the region in this regard.</p><h4>Where will the government's efforts be focused in the medium term?</h4><p>The government has a strategic investment plan of $20 billion over a five-year period. That is $10 billion in social programs designed to increase the quality of life of Panamanians, create opportunities, and make Panama a sustainable place for investors, creating the conditions for Panamanians to be active participants in future developments of key strategic development sectors. Over 30% of public investments are in infrastructure development, which provides a large array of opportunities for international contractors to participate in large-scale public tenders. Panama is diversifying its electricity grid and there are similar projects that are $100 million and above. The development of those projects will further establish opportunities for investments in greenfield projects for alternative energy production. That is tied to Panama's development of its national electricity plan, which is designed to reduce the country's reliance on thermal energy—the idea is that over 70% of Panama's mix will come from renewables. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>One of the key growth sectors is not just to establish regional HQs. Many multinationals are diversifying their operations, growing into global business services or consolidating regional operations in Panama and importing new business units. Panama is one of the leading countries in absorbing technology through FDI. We want to attract companies that train the local workforce in advanced and sophisticated processes and innovative management practices or vocational and technical activities. It is easy for foreigners to come and invest in Panama and train the local workforce, which is what makes our FDI-friendly policies sustainable in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Need to Grow]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-need-to-grow]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the industrial sector and the economy of Costa Rica for 2016?</h4><p>The IMF's 4.2% projected growth rate is not enough. Obviously, Costa Rica's growth is above the average in Latin America; however, if we want to become a developed nation then we need to grow at a higher rate. In the industrial sector, a significant portion of the growth that we are projecting for 2016 is based on the growth of companies established in the free trade zone regime, mainly high technology medical device manufacturers. In order for Costa Rica to become a developed nation and to invest and generate the important level of employment, it needs to grow at 7-8%. An important effort needs to be undertaken in the area of competitiveness. If we improve our competitiveness and solve all of our problems in traumatology procedures and improve infrastructure through means such as investing in our 28 terminals and moving the containers that will be coming to Limon, we will drive not only important development in the region, but also help to enhance the competitiveness of different sectors of the economy, as exports are key to our success. The expansion of the Panama Canal will also help generate employment and other activities in the Province of Limon, which is very much in need of activities that generate employment. The best way to develop a country and to shift away from crime and other problems is to generate employment. We need to make sure that we create the conditions so that the Province of Limon can generate employment and new activities outside of the new container port. Not only will it have a positive effect on Limon, but also on the country, as developing competitiveness is definitely important for Costa Rica. We will have two new terminals, and the widening of the Moin Terminal and APM Terminals is providing freight services for imports and exports. On the other hand, we also need to work on the development of other important regions, like Guanacaste. Tourism is good along the coastal areas of the province; however, we need to consider that there are other regions within that province that need to be developed.</p><h4>What initiatives are underway to encourage investment in other areas beyond the capital?</h4><p>The recently renovated airport in Liberia, Guanacaste will play an important role; hence, we need to work on the cargo terminal there in order to generate trade activity in and out of the country. That will also provide conditions for the development of other economic activities, such as agroindustry. We need to move forward and through innovation try to generate or transform our agricultural industry into value added processes whereby Costa Rica, its people, and the agricultural undertakings take advantage of the activities that are being developed by the multinational corporations active in the country.</p><h4>What do you think the country needs to do to increase its competitiveness?</h4><p>We need to create better conditions, and energy is an important area. Costa Rica has been successful, and the Chamber of Industries has played an important role in the establishment of a sustainable long-term energy plan. We are in full agreement with the government that the country is moving in the right direction in that sense. We need to be less dependent on fossil fuels for generation, and on non-sustainable resources in general. Costa Rica has for many years been developing hydroelectric energy; however, we need to focus on improving rates and generating significant levels in an effort to reduce costs. That has to do with efficiency and focusing a lot of our matrix into lower cost, sustainable energy generation. It is also related to efficiency and opening up energy generation and distribution to competition. Competition drives efficiency and leads to a reductions in costs and rates. We also need to ensure that we make processes easier for companies to come here and invest. This is something that we have been discussing seriously with the President. One of the most important things that we need to focus on is strengthening our security. We all understand that we live in democratic countries and that the people of Costa Rica are prone to corruption and illegal activities; therefore, we need to ensure that we provide jobs and a sense of wellbeing to the population so that they do not feel the temptation of such activities. </p><h4>How do you foresee Costa Rica's economic structure evolving in the short to medium term?</h4><p>Services are going to continue to grow. We need to make sure that we maintain the diversification of our economy, which has proven to be successful for the country. Diversification means that we have the possibility to continue to move forward as sectors are affected in the future. A diverse economy reduces risks that may occur when a specific sector suffers a downturn. The fact that Costa Rica was diversified when we faced the 2008 real estate crisis allowed the country to better handle the crisis and survive. While other countries were significantly affected because their economies were not as diversified as Costa Rica's, we were able to emerge faster and stronger. </p><h4>What is the Chamber of Industries doing to contribute to the growth of the industrial sector?</h4><p>We need to understand that what we are producing and selling today is not what is going to be sold in the future; I do not know what sort of industry we will have in the country in five years. The role of the Chamber of Industries is to ensure that we help in the development of new activities and in the development of the future industry of Costa Rica. The Chamber of Industry is playing an important role as a facilitator by organizing activities and bringing in key worldwide players in innovation to come share their successes and experience with local industry and different players in the country such as universities and institutions involved in R&amp;D as well as governmental divisions and industry so that we can generate actions to get them involved in innovation. Innovation can happen when industry, academia, and research institutions all work together.</p><h4>What are Costa Rica's competitive advantages as a destination for FDI?</h4><p>Costa Rica is still a good location for manufacturing where high technology is a factor and skilled human resources are needed. The country will continue to generate highly trained, skilled, and prepared human resources. What we need to do as a country is ensure that we are more effective in generating the type of human resources needed to meet future demand. We need to be flexible, with a focus on enhancing education in technical areas such as engineering and software development, and we need to continue training people in those areas where there will be significant demand. The English language will remain an important skill that we can provide to investors. Now what we need to ensure is that we not only teach them English, but also learn to identify and develop additional skills. One of the important capabilities that companies have found in the human resources of Costa Rica is the ability to create, as have a legacy of creativity. This is very much appreciated by the companies that have established in the country and continue to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Iran is a founding member OPEC and one of its largest producers. What role has the country played in the history of the organization and what role does it play today?</h4><p>Iran was one of the five founding members of OPEC back in 1960. The country has hosted several OPEC Ministerial Conferences and has held the OPEC Conference Presidency on a number of occasions. It also afforded the organization its first Secretary General back in the 1961, and many of its people have performed important and productive roles at the OPEC Secretariat. Over the years, it has contributed much to the organization. Iran continues to play an active and important role today. We respect and appreciate its support and input. And this goes for all member countries: each of them has a voice and their views are important to the organization's present and future.</p><h4>Since the JCPOA agreement, Iran has boosted its oil exports and increased production. How important are Iran's supplies to the global oil market?</h4><p>Iran's full return to the oil market is a welcome one. Iran is an important country, a founding member of OPEC, and a key participant in the global oil market. It has vast hydrocarbons potential, excellent manpower, and its production and exports remain integral to the future stability of the oil market. The world will need more oil in the future. Oil demand is expected to be close to 110 million barrels a day by 2040, an increase of around 17 million barrels a day from today. There is no doubt that Iran will play an important role in helping ensure this demand is met.</p><h4>What is your opinion on further cooperation between multinationals and local companies to develop projects within Iran?</h4><p>With the third-largest oil reserves and the second-largest proven gas reserves in the world, Iran has tremendous opportunities for cooperation between its companies and multinationals. Currently, there is clearly significant interest from a wide range of international companies. How this evolves is a matter for the Iranian government and the Oil Ministry, but there is no doubt that its long-term development will depend on greater cooperation with international oil companies. I hope they are able to reach an agreement that satisfies all parties—one that enables Iran to expand its production and exports.</p><h4>How do you see the oil market outlook for the rest of 2016?</h4><p>There are signs that supply and demand are moving into balance as we head into the second half of 2016. Oil demand remains fairly healthy at 1.2 million barrels a day; economic growth is set for 3.1% in 2016, higher than last year, and non-OPEC supply is expected to contract by 740,000 barrels a day. This means the overall average requirement for OPEC crude in 2016 is expected to be 31.5 million barrels a day, an increase of 1.8 million barrels a day compared to 2015. However, it is important to note that stock levels remain high. The five-year average for OECD commercial stocks in May 2016 is a surplus of around 350 million barrels. It is vital that we see this figure on a downward trend. We hope to see a more stable and balanced market by the end of the year. This will be beneficial to both producers and consumers.</p><h4>Over the past few years we have seen significant supplies coming from non-OPEC countries, although this year non-OPEC supply is expected to contract. Where do you anticipate most of the long-term supply growth to come from?</h4><p>In the 2013-2015 period, non-OPEC production increased by over 5 million barrels a day, which was a major factor in supply outstripping demand. And yes, as I mentioned in the previous question, this year there is expected to be a contraction in non-OPEC supply, given that a lot of the recent non-OPEC increase has been in high-cost production. In the long term, non-OPEC liquids growth is anticipated to be limited, with an increase of around 3 million barrels a day between 2015 and 2035, before then declining slightly to 2040. The main contributor to liquids supply growth after 2020 is OPEC. In the 20-year period between 2020 and 2040, OPEC crude is expected to expand by 10 million barrels a day to a level over 40 million barrels a day. By then, the share of OPEC crude in total liquids supply is projected to increase to 37%, compared to current levels of around 33%.</p><h4>What is OPEC's view on the Paris Agreement reached at the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) in December 2015? </h4><p>OPEC welcomes the agreement made in Paris last December. The environment and climate change are concerns for us all, and all our member countries were part of the Paris Agreement, submitting their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). However, we do need to be realistic about our energy future. Can renewables meet the energy needs of the world? No, they cannot. Do we need all energy sources? Yes, we do. Are fossil fuels going to remain the mainstay in the coming decades? Yes, we believe they are. It is important to stress that environmental protection and the use of oil and gas are not mutually exclusive. We can still use oil and gas and have a cleaner environment, and this means focusing on technologies. At OPEC, we recognize the importance of continually looking to advance the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and use. In addition, we should not forget that today around 2.7 billion people or more still rely on biomass for their basic needs, and 1.3 billion have no access to electricity. These people need access to reliable, safe, and secure modern energy services to live and prosper. We need to keep in mind that the three pillars of sustainable development—economic, environmental, and social—mean different things to different people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the goals behind the establishment of the SEC in 1992?</h4><p>The establishment of the SEC was a landmark development because it was the first time we had an independent organization exclusively take care of Thailand's capital markets. The way in which our commission is structured is quite a departure from normal government administrations in the sense that we tried to have a combination of private-sector representatives and government officials on our board. It was with the view that capital markets are dynamic and we need to be able to keep up with all the changes and developments that can come from all sides. Over the years, we have tried to remain close to the private sector to understand the landscape of where we are going and also react to the changing environment throughout this period, both good and bad.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest challenges in ensuring an efficient and transparent capital market in Thailand?</h4><p>One of the biggest challenges is promoting effective corporate governance practices in the market. Linking back to the view by many financial analysts that the 1997 financial crisis started in Thailand, the crisis had its root in the failure of corporate governance, particularly in the financial sector. That is one area in which we are doing plenty of reforms on many fronts. One of the most successful developments has been the creation of the Thai Institute Of Directors, which helps develop professional knowledge and skills necessary for directors of listed companies. It is important to universalize standards and get people to understand what corporate governance is. There have also been many rules, laws, and regulations put in place; for example, the requirements on independent directors, related party transactions, disclosure, and accounting standards. We have come a long way in creating awareness and the practice of corporate governance. Under the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard initiative, for example, last year, out of the top-50 companies that achieved the highest rankings across ASEAN, Thailand had 23 companies there and two were among the top five. It is an achievement we are proud of. Now the key issue is moving from basic corporate governance to issues such as ESG and anti-corruption, which we also play a major part in. We have the Anti-corruption Progress Indicators initiative to encourage listed companies to put in place serious anti-corruption measures and so far we think there has been satisfactory improvement in this area. Another big challenge for Thai capital market deals with the investment side. As types of financial products offered in Thailand are still quite limited, we are working to allow investments in things like hedge funds, high-yield bond funds, and leverage funds, so investors will have greater choice for their investments.</p><h4>What is your opinion of crowdfunding?</h4><p>SMEs are the backbone of Thai economy, accounting for almost 40% of our GDP. However, SME funding still relies heavily on short-term loans from banks. Crowdfunding will be an alternative fundraising channel in which smaller businesses can get more access to funding. But crowdfunding alone cannot provide all solutions. Venture capital and private equities, for which the government has provided interesting tax incentives to investors, can be useful fundraising tools for SMEs and can also help pave the way both for the preparation of the balance sheet side and the corporate governance side of those SMEs.</p><h4>What are the major trends in Thailand's capital markets?</h4><p>In terms of financial service providers, things like financial technology will play a significant role in the way in which business is conducted. Once implemented and taken up, it will lower the cost and increase the speed of transactions. The key issue depends on the sophistication and the uptake of people. FinTech is like an approaching tsunami that is coming fast, but no one knows exactly when and how it will hit. Its growth, though, will not be linear. Usually we see changes in a linear way, but with FinTech it will come and take off. It will change the face of our financial system, not just capital markets, but the way that people do business.</p><h4>What are the challenges from a regulatory point of view regarding AEC?</h4><p>The AEC is not yet a single market nor is it aiming to be: it is not the EU. It is more of a loose form of cooperation whereby we try to have more harmonized rules and regulations. But we will not have one set of rules and regulations issued by a central authority that covers everyone. We are not talking about single currencies, visas, or passports. It involves cooperation in trying to promote ourselves as one community to the world rather than a single platform: that is the key difference. However, Thailand's positioning in the neighboring countries—Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam—should be noted. Vietnam has already grown at a rapid pace, but for the other three, there are quite a few challenges to tackle for further capital market development. At the same time, all these countries need a great deal of funding as they look to the future. Things like infrastructure funds will likely play a strong role both domestically and regionally. I think this will be one of the key issues for people to keep track of.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Nigeria for the overall revenue and strategy of the company worldwide and in Africa?</h4><p>Weatherford has been in the country since 1975. Globally, Nigeria is seen quite strategically because, when you look at Africa, Nigeria is usually the highest producer of barrels on a daily basis, although Angola overtook temporarily. With any global company, if you are going to operate globally you have to ensure that your presence in Nigeria is strong. You cannot be a strong participant in the global hydrocarbon economy unless you are in the biggest markets, which makes Weatherford Nigeria strategic to Weatherford International's operations. We enjoy all the support that comes with that in terms of equipment, assets, expertise, and training, and in turn we are justifying that assistance with our business activities in Nigeria.</p><h4>What are your investment and development plans in the country for the near future?</h4><p>We continue to expand our portfolio. In 2015, we brought in additional business units, drilling services, managed pressure drilling (MPD), and drilling tools. We did this in a period of downturn, proving that we are not just looking at the short term but also further into  the future, which goes a long way to support the strategic positioning of Weatherford in Nigeria.</p><h4>What type of solutions can you offer to help the oil companies become more efficient and reduce costs?</h4><p>There are some costs that you cannot control; for example, security, which we have to provide for our personnel and assets. That is an issue that is beyond our control. We talk to government and advise where this can be optimized to bring down those costs, but unfortunately the events of late May imply that we cannot let our guards down. For our clients, we look at supporting them in lowering their costs by bringing out technology that can do more for less. If it takes about 18 hours to make up pipes and if you bring out technology that can reduce that to half the time then you will save them a significant amount of money. We also integrated our different business units so that when clients need multiple operations done by Weatherford we look at how we can reduce the amount of people needed to do the job and we are able to offer it at a better rate. This is one of the things that we are doing during this period of industry downturn that is actually building up our inter unit business capacity to integrate our projects.</p><h4>What challenges and particularities with drilling does Nigeria face compared to other countries?</h4><p>What makes the difference in Nigeria is local knowledge. We share the best practices with our clients to help them optimize their drilling plans. Technology is available globally and one of the things that I would love to look at in the future is to support educational institutions to develop local research centers. There are peculiar local issues that we can work together to come up with technological solutions that will also have global impact. Nigeria is an exporter of talent and we are in the position to tap into those talents. This industry has been available locally for the last 50 years or more so the best practices are there and you have well trained people. Around 95% of the Weatherford Nigeria workforce is actually Nigerian, and that is something that is very important.</p><h4>How do you think the petroleum regulatory framework changes the environment in this sector?</h4><p>It will have a significant impact given that businesses do not like uncertainty. You cannot really plan how things are going to grow and this is one of the problems that we have had in the country and it has stalled investment. Once that petroleum regulatory framework is closed and everyone has clarity on what the government expects of them, then people can sit down and evaluate their business model and how that affects them. They can then start projecting returns and, based on that, investment will come. It is critical that the PIB is finalized, even if it is imperfect; imperfection is far less of a problem than uncertainty. We have had uncertainty in the regulatory environment for nearly a decade and, in such an industry as ours, the lack of a framework is quite disruptive.</p><h4>What is your opinion on Nigeria's refined fuel scarcity?</h4><p>The past government attempted to do what needed to be done and the current government has truly taken the bull by the horns. The country is broke, and we can no longer subsidize refined fuels. Today, imports of refined products come from Europe and the US; however, refineries based in Nigeria can supply a lot of what Africa needs. We are gradually on the right path; the crude oil is nearby and, if the security is there, then people can invest. Nigeria has the capability to refine products and export to countries across Africa and beyond.</p><h4>What role do you see the finance sector playing in supporting the oil industry?</h4><p>The issues that the sector is going through are temporary. This is why we brought new services last year as part of our long-term strategy. During a downturn, our clients are cash strapped; many people want to do things but they do not have the finances. The people who have the money need to be more efficient, but there are many that cannot raise the funds and, therefore, activities shrink in downturns. Banks, therefore, will play a major role in this environment., We hope that this government will close on the PIB and, when that is done, this country will experience a big boom. New licenses will come, funding will come, and Weatherford will be ready.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for the rest of 2016?</h4><p>We do not see things changing from what we are experiencing now. Many organizations are already cutting back significantly on projects. So even though the oil price seems to be moving up, militancy in Nigeria is part of the reason why it is moving up so we are not a beneficiary of that rise. Given the fact that many clients have set budgets for 2016 based on the pessimistic oil price levels we do not see much activity changing from where they are now. We just need to see the year out. We believe 2017 will be better and by October or November 2016 we will start seeing what companies are planning for next year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has UNIFIN grown over the past two decades?</h4><p>UNIFIN was established in 1993, prior to the Tequila Crisis, and this set the mark for the first stage of our history. The crisis of 1994-95 affected both the people and companies, and UNIFIN was no exception, as the banking sector was hit severely. This period, nevertheless, allowed Mexico to build a future that would set in motion important changes from the year 2000 onwards. It was then that UNIFIN entered its second evolutionary stage; we institutionalized the company and provided it with formality to propel its success. We entered the stock market in 2002, issuing bonds for Ps20 million. In 2006, we created the securities based on our lease contracts—the first time leases had been securitized in Mexico. Today, we have issued a total of Ps30 billion in bonds, which represents a growth of 1,500%. We have three main products: leasing, which is our core product and accounts for 80% of our business; factoring; and automotive credit. In 2015, we were voted as the best place to work in Mexico, as a socially responsible company and as the largest leasing company in Latin America.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the remarkable growth of UNIFIN?</h4><p>To achieve a strong level of growth in this business there are a series of necessary factors such as capital, financial flexibility, a capable technological and human resource structure, and most importantly, a high level of risk analysis and portfolio management. UNIFIN has all of these factors and that is the key to our formula. Mexico has a low level of banking penetration compared to its Latin American peers and this also contributes to our success, because there are still big spaces to fill. Our business model allows us to move Ps2 billion monthly, by far the largest such figure amongst leasing companies in Mexico.</p><h4>Has UNIFIN's growth contributed more generally to the growth of Sociedades Financieras de Objeto Múltiple (SOFOMs) in Mexico's financial system?</h4><p>We were one of the first SOFOMs when the system was created in 2006. This system has strengthened the country's economy and plays a strategic role in the financial system today that is distinct from that of traditional entities such as banks or brokerage houses. We have focused instead on SMEs, providing them with capital and pushing them to grow. This is particularly important, given that SMEs represent a significant part of the Mexican economy. In May 2015, UNIFIN was publicly traded, and people across North America, South America, and Europe all became familiar with us. Six out of the world's 10 major institutional investors hold UNIFIN shares.</p><h4>What makes the Mexican financial sector attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>At the macroeconomic level, the banking sector in Mexico is perfectly capitalized and its non-performing loan portfolio is low. In the particular case of UNIFIN, which serves smaller clients, we are a specialized player in the economy; we have maintained our business model year after year and it has remained successful. Foreign investors come to us because we know the market and we guarantee profits for our clients, we know how Mexico works, and we contribute to the country's financial strengths through our good practices. Mexico has a diversified economy, a large manufacturing sector, and a vast export base that incentivizes investors to establish a presence here. This country faces significant challenges, yet it also offers comparative advantages that render it attractive for people abroad.</p><h4>Do you think the challenges that Mexico faces will dissuade investors from coming to Mexico?</h4><p>There are many types of foreign investors and they all see the country's challenges differently, according to their specific needs. Those who come with noteworthy investments aim to stay here for a long time and they are less perturbed by the current situations in Mexico. The country is indeed interesting, and we have important problems to solve, yet investors see beyond that.</p><h4>What are your plans for the future of UNIFIN?</h4><p>We want to keep growing in Mexico. We have 11 offices in the national territory and our goal is to reach 20 in the next two years. We have strong growth targets and we are confident in our future success because we leverage our experience and know-how. We will maintain our business line and our future lies there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for NAICO?</h4><p>One of the goals of the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 is to establish an independent agency under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to look into the overall developments in the aerospace industry. MITI set up NAICO to take on this role before we establish a dedicated agency over the course of next year. We aim to further engage with all aerospace-related agencies and stakeholders in order to consolidate the nation's aerospace industry development initiatives. We work closely with MIDA, MATRADE, and SME Corp, as well as MARA, as these are the main stakeholders in the aerospace industry. The Ministry of Transport, which oversees airports and aircraft operations, is also involved. It is our task to coordinate all the players involved to ensure we have the same vision and direction, ensuring that the industry can develop smoothly. According to the plan, NAICO will become an agency that will lead industrial development, investment, and supply chain development in Malaysia in achieving our aims to be the number-one aerospace country in South East Asia by 2030. We will focus mostly on the six pillars we have identified: aerospace manufacturing; MRO; system integrations; engineering &amp; design; training &amp; education; and research &amp; technology, with support for defense industries as an additional area of attention. We want to develop the supply chain and the business environment for SMEs, as well as build up industry research &amp; technology activities, the latter for which we will engage with Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC). We target strategic and quality investment from tier one OEM companies into Malaysia and prepare the local supply chain, including SMEs, to become part of the global aerospace supply chain.</p><h4>What is the vision behind the recent launch of the 3M Global Aerospace Future Landscape project between Malaysia, Mexico, and Morocco?</h4><p>We predict OEMs and tier-one companies will seek regional hubs in specific markets. In this regard, we anticipate that Mexico will be the hub for North America, Morocco for Europe, and Malaysia for Asia Pacific. Competition is still ongoing and open for the Asia Pacific market, and we can take the lead there. 3M is part of our effort to engage with Mexico and Morocco and develop Malaysia as the hub for the Asia Pacific region. We visited Mexico recently to discuss potential ways to collaborate and to draft the outline of 3M. We also exchanged best practices on developing the right aerospace ecosystem on a national level. Asia Aerospace City (AAC) has an MoU with the Universidad Aeronáutica en Querétaro (UNAQ), where we learnt how UNAQ became a one-stop center for training and development for all the surrounding industries, from technicians to master's-level engineers in manufacturing. In Malaysia we have several institutes around the country that are working on this, and the key strength of Queretaro is that it brought them all together in a single area, something we would like to emulate here. We will also visit Morocco soon to discuss its experience and vision on the future development of the aerospace industry.</p><h4>Are you actively promoting the Asia Aerospace City (AAC) initiative by MARA abroad?</h4><p>In the last two years we promoted the AAC following its international launch at the Paris Air Show in 2013. We recently launched KLIA Aeropolis, another aerospace park that will be developed by Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB). Now we will have AAC Subang, KLIA Aeropolis, and UMW Serendah land, which is developed by UMW following their business collaboration with Rolls-Royce. This is the landscape we promote to the world in terms of infrastructure. We are also talking to a number of state governments that are seeking to develop more aerospace parks in Malaysia, for example Senai of Johor, which are located close to Singapore and can benefit from spillover activities from there.</p><h4>Along with NAICO, the Malaysia Aerospace Industry Association (MAIA) was established. How do you interact?</h4><p>We need to work closely with industry players, and when necessary we need to sit down to understand each other and come up with coordinated initiatives. MATRADE set up MAIA, which we welcome because it brings a coordinated talking point for the industry. We can function as the catalyst for developing the regulatory framework, the infrastructure, and the incentive policies, but we need input from the private sector to align ourselves. We have the Aerospace Blueprint 2030, the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, and a number of Entry-Point-Projects (EPPs) in the field of aerospace-targets for five, 10, and 15 years from now. We need contribution and commitment from the industry to achieve these targets, and need new quality investments and strategic partnerships with global champions in the US and Europe.</p><h4>What is on your agenda in terms of R&amp;D and sustainable aviation?</h4><p>Together with AMIC, we have the Factory of the Future initiative, where we look to modernize in terms of technology and industry research. We recently signed an agreement with Airbus Group, University of Malaysia, and the French Embassy in Malaysia to develop and implement an online robotics project. At MITI we are poised for Industrial 4.0, which is in line with our policy here, where robots and information technology come together. We promote these activities under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, providing funding to AMIC to engage in robotics and other new approaches for aerospace manufacturing activities. We also want to utilize natural raw materials. For example, we want to produce aviation biofuel and take the regional lead here. AMIC is embarking on the development of sustainable aviation jet fuel with its partners UPM, UM, and other research institutes. Another recent project is on macro-algae, looking into seaweed plantations and how seaweed can be used to produce high-quality bio jet fuel. Malaysia has abundant natural materials it could use, and we explore all the possibilities of developing and producing that. We are considering working with Indonesia and Singapore on this. In addition, we are looking at green materials for the composites industries as natural source products like bio resins. There is much potential in renewable and sustainable materials for the aerospace industry.</p><h4>What are your initiatives in terms of training and education for aerospace industries in Malaysia?</h4><p>To become number one in Southeast Asia, we need to have strategic investments from OEMs and tier-one firms. We need to continue developing initiatives like the 3M project, but definitely need to prepare the next generation workforce to serve and build this industry. To achieve high-income status, we need to develop highly skilled human capital. Our people need to be top notch for the objectives we have set for the country. We engage with the National Professor Council, Ministry of Higher Education, MARA and related agencies to determine how we can further develop aerospace training and education to raise interest within students to choose a career in engineering particularly aerospace.</p><h4>What are your ambitions and objectives for NAICO in the near future?</h4><p>We will continue our 3M efforts, and will go global with our development agenda of the aerospace industry in Malaysia. Our key objective is to lead these efforts, and to realize our vision by 2030. NAICO is currently still an office in MITI, but our ambition is to transform to NAICA next year and become an agency. Our target to recruit about 20 to 30 people for positions in industry development, industry and market intelligence, marketing development, and developing a comprehensive aerospace industry database to have the right resources to play a leading role in the aerospace industry. Not limited to internal activities, we have to ensure the smooth implementation of the Aerospace Blueprint 2030 initiatives, Eleventh Malaysia Plan aerospace projects, and the aerospace related EPPs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IMF predicted a 4.2% growth for Costa Rica in 2016. What are your expectations and which sectors will lead that growth?</h4><p>Costa Rica is a country with almost three decades of continued and uninterrupted growth, which has led to a much more diversified economy in terms of the foreign markets that we export to and the portfolio of products and services that we export. We export over 2,000 products and in the last few years services and new technologies have gained a lot of momentum. In terms of services, in the last few years we have seen the establishment of service centers across the country in different economic sectors. We also have diversified and strong agribusiness exports. This diversification has allowed us to not suffer as much when prices of a certain commodity such as coffee drop. This diversification has also enabled us to not be as affected by the international crisis. Another of the strong features of our economy is that we have a strong domestic market, with people enjoying a relatively good consuming power, especially compared to the rest of the region. This helps us to cope with a slowdown in exports, as we saw last year due to certain challenges. The continued level of FDI that we have managed to attract over the years has been another core base of our growth in the last decades. We managed to attract larger volumes of foreign investment even in the first couple of years of the crisis between 2008 and 2009. Costa Rica enjoys a consolidated political, economic, and regulatory stability that makes our country an attractive destination for FDI. On top of that, we have register zero inflation for two consecutive years, we enjoy freedom and good capital flows, we have enjoyed internal peace for over 100 years, we have low violence rates, and the public and private sectors always look to create synergies and jointly develop the economy of Costa Rica. The country enjoys a well-established institutionalization that helps to attract foreign investment, which currently stands at 5% of total GDP. Overall, have created a consolidated and highly respected country thanks to the high levels of security, political stability, and economic development. </p><h4>What are the sectors with the greatest potential to attract foreign investment?</h4><p>The service sector is among those with the greatest potential in Costa Rica. In this context, the tourism industry should be particularly highlighted, as it has in itself a great deal to offer, such as beaches, ecotourism, gastronomy, mountain sports, and so on. This year we have seen a nearly 20% increase in the number of visitors. However, the northern region is leading this growth, accounting for 30% of the increase in tourist arrivals. We have attracted a lot of investments in high technologies due to the fact that we have a highly qualified and skillful workforce. The infrastructure sector can still play a more active role. This is due to the fact that the state cannot bring forward all the necessary projects because of the sector's complex legal framework. That has led to certain delays in catching up with infrastructure projects and the speed with which these kinds of projects are implemented. Costa Rica needs to invest in rail and road infrastructure. Additionally, the fishery industry and maritime logistics have not been fully exploited and still present a lot of potential. There is also room for improvement in the export of agricultural goods with greater added value. Costa Rica has attracted the investments of many companies who have relocated their businesses and call centers here. We offer a competitive regulatory and retribution package to these kinds of companies, and we have a competitive workforce to offer as well.</p><h4>How can the country benefit from the expansion of the Panama Canal?</h4><p>We are close to Panama, and the expansion of the Canal is great news for us. We have maritime infrastructure such as the Moin Port, from where we can offer complementary services to the users of the Canal. Costa Rica can offer the logistics services that shipping companies need, which is why we aim to increase volumes to and from the Canal. Additionally, we also export to Asia and the US, so the expansion will positively contribute to our business activities. Therefore, the increase in capacity of the Canal will definitely bring an increase in volumes and business for our ports, especially for the Moin Port, where we are developing a megaport infrastructure, something that boosts the local economy and that of the entire country. With the development of our ports, we do not consider only maritime cargo, but also maritime tourism, as we will be able to better serve this industry with a more dynamic and specialized infrastructure. Panama is also a relevant business partner for us, so in a way there gain is also our gain.</p><h4>What are the main efforts carried out by the government regarding green policies?</h4><p>Over 50% of Costa Rica's consists of protected natural areas. Costa Rica is mainly made of volcanic soil, which is particularly fertile. We do not have deserts. We have prioritized the protection of our fertile land instead of promoting wood, mining, and other such large projects that could have brought us plenty of economic resources. Over the years, we developed a strategy of national parks and protected areas. We have always prioritized green policies and the protection of the environment, implementing energy policies based on renewables. This year we will achieve a surplus of energy generated from renewables. We have put a lot of effort into solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy. At the same time, we promoted the use of renewable energies among the private sector. We also have nationwide plans for recycling plastics and paper, an effort in which the education sector is truly involved. We need to further invest in wastewater and solid waste treatment, which are two areas set to offer plenty of opportunities for private investors to collaborate with the state on the development of joint projects.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work on attracting foreign investment to Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica on its own is already attractive thanks to its political and security stability, as well as its privileged geographic position. Costa Rica enjoys highly valued bilateral relationships with many countries, and we are stable from a macroeconomic point of view. We also have the tools and conditions to attract foreign investment through free trade zones, the availability of qualified and skilled human resources, high quality education, and a strong network and strategy of promotion at the international level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to the development of Iran's industrial, mining, and trade industries?</h4><p>Unfortunately, we had some negative growth for two consecutive years before last year so I think to go from negative growth to positive growth is not so difficult. First of all, after the election of Dr. Rouhani, people gained a new mood for working and investment. They became really optimistic about the future. This is a main reason people started to go for business, production, marketing, and so on. They had lost their hopes in the previous years because the economy and industry were going down. They then became optimistic about the new government. They really came into action. Secondly, I remember the first month our new government started about two years ago; we developed some points about the removal of the hindrance to production in the economy. We took it to the government and it approved about 35 articles in order to pave the way for new investment, new actions, and so on. Afterwards, we again developed another group of points, which it needed parliament approval for. There were points about the banking system, taxation, how to increase the capacity of the banks, as well as how to help people who owed money to the banks. We got some permissions from parliament. We took about 30 articles to parliament, but they added 30 more when they were approving discussions, so it came to 60 articles. Really, our effort was to remove all the obstacles so the economy and industry could grow. I think these were the main reasons. And this was done at the same time the sanctions were there. We couldn't get any help from outside; no banking relations, no long-term transactions, and most of the companies were afraid to work with us. In spite of this, even our non-oil exports increased about 19% last year.</p><h4>What opportunities and partnerships are you looking to create in order to develop the industrial sector?</h4><p>First of all, Iran has not changed. It's the same Ministry, the same policy, and the same country. Iran was pictured by the outside world as looking for nuclear weapons and so on. But, finally, after long-term negotiations, people understood the facts. We are here for cooperation. Now, we are looking for long-term, strategic cooperation. If someone wants to sell their goods and leave, we are not here for this. Already, we have so much production inside the country. Even in medicine, we are producing 97% of consumption. In the car industry and many other industries, most of the goods are produced in Iran for domestic use and some for export. We are looking for long-term cooperation, including joint investment. We are looking at the domestic and the export market. Also, we are looking for long-lasting cooperation, which means engineering cooperation, R&amp;D, HR, technical, commercial, export, top management, and so on.</p><h4>In what ways is the Ministry trying to promote economic ties with the EU?</h4><p>We think each of these countries has some specialties. They have good or competitive conditions in certain areas. For example, Italy or Germany, these are industrial countries. We think Germany has five or six areas for cooperation. We have information and history that shows there are certain countries with certain areas that are more cooperative. We look forward to finding out the companies on their side that are qualified and then try to match them with ours. The government is not going to do business; we have to make general policies so they can work together. If you want to expand the business, banking relations are a priority. This is why they are bringing their bankers here to talk with our banks about cooperating again. For investment, you need export credit agencies to support the investors. They have to find out how to restart their cooperation. We have only started in the last two months. We have said that, if they want to restart, as a basic criteria, they have to start with banking. We have to exchange information. We have to see how to match their companies with our companies. I think it's going to take some time to build this. I expect real cooperation to start by the beginning of 2016. By that time, then we are talking about joint contracts and so on with some eligible companies. It takes some time for negotiations.</p><h4>Iran recently announced plans to cooperate with China to contract an industrial park for petrochemicals, aluminum, and steel. How has this project progressed? Will this project help trade relations with other Asian countries?</h4><p>Yes. Sometimes European people think that Iran's relationship with Asian countries will hurt its relationship with European countries. But, you see, Iran is big enough to have cooperation with all of these companies. We are not going to lose all relations with the big industrial, growing countries like China or Russia. They have some advantages that we need to utilize. For example, in infrastructure, there is so much capacity in China. Big projects, big activities, and their processes are competitive, so why not cooperate? We are just continuing our previous cooperation as well as starting new cooperation. This government is looking for a good, long-lasting relationship with all the countries and it will not happen unless we can make it win-win for all sides.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the mining sector?</h4><p>Last year we invested about $3 billion in steel complexes. It was a sanction and we did not have so many financing options, but we still did it in one year. By 2025, we are looking to reach a minimum of 50 million tons of steel. Some of the projects are already under construction. Some will happen in the coming years. We have domestic growth and it's an area where we can supply steel to our neighboring countries. Out of this 50 million tons, we think a minimum of 10 million tons will be more exports. This year we will produce a minimum 18 million tons of steel, but there are many different stages.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some key events over the past year for AUK?</h4><p>The key events that have characterized the past year are program accreditation, faculty recruitment, and expanding campus facilities. For example, our Intensive English Program (IEP) has received accreditation for 10 years from the Commission of English Association (CEA), which is indicative of the accreditor's high confidence in our program. We have completed three self-studies along with their site visits for our computer engineering program, arts and graphic design, humanities, and social sciences by Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET), National Association of School Graphic Design (NASAD), and American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE), respectively. In addition, our College of Business and Economic Standard Alignment Plan (SAP) and two progress reports were approved by the The Association to Advance Colligate Schools of Business (AACSB). Overall, the past year wouldn't have been successful without the support of the entire AUK Community. The past year was also characterized by concerted efforts in faculty recruitment due to the increasing of number of students in some programs and also in anticipation of opening new programs such as systems engineering and human resources. The aim is to recruit high caliber faculty that combine both excellence in teaching and research. As regarding campus facilities, the construction of a new student center and an additional academic building that will house the College of Engineering is underway.</p><h4>To what extent do you collaborate with the private sector in order to enhance curricula?</h4><p>We continue to collaborate with the private sector on at least three levels. One level encompasses creating business incubators on campus that would provide training, workshops, and services to students. A second level is through internship and practical training programs that connect our curriculum and students to business sectors that broaden the students' practical experience. A third level involves the business sector in supporting student activities and competitions whether national or internationally. Investing in students by the business sector not only is a civic responsibility but also as a national one. A fourth level is through providing consultancy by our faculty to the business sector if requested by the latter.</p><h4>You recently signed an MoU with the American University in Cairo. To what extent is there an international research network between these universities?</h4><p>All private institutions in Kuwait are required to have a foreign partner. Our formal partner has been Dartmouth College. In addition to Dartmouth College we have signed MoUs for collaboration with George Washington University, Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, Sciences Po, France, the University of Göttingen in Germany, and American University of Cairo (AUC).</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For the coming years, our plan is to complete all program and US institutional accreditation. Next year will not be much different than this year and, accordingly, our concerted efforts will continue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the current state of Mozambique's transport and logistics infrastructure?</h4><p>Expansion in transport infrastructure, ports, roads, and railways is recognized as fundamental to Mozambique's development plan for mining, agriculture and tourism. Traditionally transport and logistics infrastructure provided for half of Mozambique's annual revenue, transporting mining and agro-products from its landlocked hinterland to Europe and Asia. However due to historic reasons, investment and expansion of ports, railways, and roads has not been consistent and the business shifted to South Africa. Grains, metals, and minerals exported from Zambia and Zimbabwe are routed through Durban and Richards Bay, even though Mozambican ports still handle some of the import requirements such as fuel. There have been some expansion investments in Beira, such as the new coal terminal. However, enhancing the ability for Ports such as Maputo and Beira to receive larger vessels would make them more competitive. Aligning the management and concession policies for transport infrastructure to ensure investment in port, rail, and road infrastructure to compete with South African ports will bring back iron ore, coal and commodity exports to Mozambique.</p><h4>What is the role of Anfrena in Mozambique's ports infrastructure development?</h4><p>Anfrena was involved in the engineering and construction of the Maputo Fuel Terminal and added LPG and Bitumen Terminals to Maputo Port and is currently constructing it in Beira Port. Anfrena has designed and constructed the tank farm expansion for Petromoc and Puma in Maputo and Beira and the bulk fuel terminal and tank farms for Vale in Moatize. Anfrena is one of the few Mozambican companies specialized in terminal design and development of Petroleum downstream distribution infrastructure design and construction. <br></p><h4>Mozambique has vast unexplored mineral resources. What are Mozambique Holdings' current and future initiatives in the mining industry?</h4><p>Mozambique Holdings' role as a developer in the mining sector is more long term, because of the depressed values for metals and minerals and the comparatively large and long term investment required. However, opportunities exist for our engineering division as EPC contractors.</p><h4>Potable water facilities were available to less than 25% of Mozambican population in the early 1990s. What role did Afrodrill play in the significant increase of that number?</h4><p>We have been involved in water resources development through Afrodrill for over a decade. Due to the adaptability and comparative cost advantages of Indian technology, and skilled manpower for rural water resources development, we have been very successful in Zambezia, Nampula, and Sofala. The National Directorate of Water (DNA) has maintained ambitious water coverage targets to ensure access to drinking water for every citizen. We have worked with DNA to develop project profiles and geotechnical studies and have presented these to potential donors and investors for funding support. The government of India and other donors like UNICEF and World Vision have responded and are funding rural drinking water resource development, executed by Afrodrill, in Zambezia, Nampula, and Sofala since 2004. This effort coordinated by DNA has raised the drinking water coverage from the 25% percent in early 2000 to current levels of over 60%.</p><h4>Mozambique jumped 15 places in the Ease of Doing Business rank. It currently ranks at 127 out of 189 economies. As a foreign businessman, how would you rate regulatory efficiency in Mozambique and what changes would you like to see in the regulatory framework?<br></h4><p>Mozambique, at the political level, intends to attract and encourage foreign investment and entrepreneurship to develop its resources through imported technology and services. It has to be streamlined and reconciled with the aspirations of local Mozambicans to be skilled and employed, and encouraging indigenous entrepreneurship. The imported technology and manpower should adapt and evolve into a Mozambican concept in the local context over time.</p><h4>What will be the main focus of Mozambique Holdings' strategy for the years to come?</h4><p>Our medium-term focus will be to consolidate our strengths in core sectors to provide more efficient state-of-the-art design, technology, and services and at lower costs through skills and efficiency accumulated over time.</p><h4>How will you envision Mozambique's mid-term economic future?<br></h4><p>Mozambique is blessed with plenty of resources that have yet to be explored and exploited. However, there are also challenges related to attracting investments and technology to develop these resources and train and equip Mozambicans to become entrepreneurs and skilled technicians, thus becoming profit centers contributing to the cost of governance. Policy and planning have to balance the expectations of the population for immediate consumption and betterment of their living standards. There will be austerity and astute planning to apply limited resources to the more essential requirements. I believe Mozambique's progress and future is well planned on sound fundamentals and that the government has the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to the teething problems of this young economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Although projected economic growth in the region is falling, the IMF recently raised its projections for growth in Peru in 2016. What are your expectations for the Peruvian economy this year?</h4>
<p>A stable economy with a steady investment flow in infrastructure is a key component of the successful growth Peru has experienced over past years. Our forecast points to GDP growth within a range of 3.7% to 4% for the current year.</p>
<h4>Peru recently signed the TPP, a landmark trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim countries. What is the economic potential of this agreement and how will its impact be felt in Peru?</h4>
<p>As any trade agreement, the TPP offers potential for Peru to increase its exports as it opens up access to a major trade region comprised of 11 countries, which together represent 40% of the global economy, 25% of global trade, the destination of 30% of FDI, and equally important a market with more than 800 million consumers. Several studies and analyses have been conducted, indicating that for Peru the TPP might generate direct benefits to the agro-business, fishing and mining industries, and the retail sector by reducing non-tariff barriers and facilitating increased integration in the production chain. The World Bank estimates that the TPP could boost exports by 10% and GDP growth by 2.1% in the next 15 years. The Trade Research &amp; Development Area of the Chamber of Commerce in Lima estimates that exports will grow by 12% in the next five years. Undoubtedly there is tremendous potential for the country, but as in any trade agreement the definitive success depends on the determination of the countries in terms of its timely implementation.</p>
<h4>BLADEX offers a number of financial solutions to increase international activity and support different sectors. What financial solutions have been most useful in the Peruvian market?</h4>
<p>One of the main focuses has been on helping companies in the trade supply chain by offering solutions designed to allow them to improve their terms of purchasing from suppliers and offering better selling conditions to their to clients. We offer the Vendor Financing Facility, which is designed to achieve the goal mentioned above, whereby BLADEX assumes the credit risk without recourse, allowing more business to be conducted among the parties involved. Another key focus of our offering is to support a company's expansion plans, or their needs for liability management, by offering access to funds from investors in Latin America as well as outside of the region. To achieve this goal we set up a special syndications and distribution platform, which has brought already to market more than 30 transactions in past years, with eight transactions done with companies and financial institutions in Peru.</p>
<h4>What are some of the most significant challenges the Peruvian market faces right now?</h4>
<p>Among the so-called emerging markets, Latin America has been impacted very importantly in the last two years. Nevertheless, we have observed that this impact has not been even across the region. Peru, for instance, has been one of the exceptions as the focus on fiscal discipline, adequate and pro-active monetary policy, and investments in infrastructure are a reality. Therefore, the main challenge for the country is to keep this clear path toward sustainable growth with responsibility, irrespective of the changes in the political arena.</p>
<h4>BLADEX recently arranged a $25 million, three-year loan to Agrobanco. What is the importance of the agricultural sector for international trade in the region?</h4>
<p>The agricultural sector is Peru's second-largest export industry. The forecast for Peruvian exports related to this particular sector points to almost $6 billion in 2016, which will account for 17% of the total exports of the country. As we observe this sector in Peru, there has been an important increase in sales of non-traditional products such as grapes, quinoa, and blueberries, for instance. On the other hand, the irrigation projects in northern and southern Peru (Alto Piura and Majes Siguas II), will lead to a considerable increase in new crops, which, associated with the focus on increased productivity, bode very well for the country. We understand that Latin America is a strong player in agricultural exports, and as we can see from Peru's performance the country is not an exception to the rule. Peru is increasing its participation in the share of agricultural exports to the region, which is confirmed by 2015's performance when Peru exported about $1 billion in agricultural products to Latin America.</p>
<h4>What are some new partnerships or international agreements BLADEX has joined recently and how will they advance its goals in Latin America?</h4>
<p>BLADEX's focus has always been on teaming up with other financial institutions to promote trade finance in Latin America. As an example, we recently entered into an agreement with the International Financial Corporation (IFC), a member of The World Bank Group, to establish a risk-sharing contract with the objective of expanding access to trade finance available for agribusiness, within IFC's Critical Commodities Finance Program, which has translated into more financing over a three-year period for the production, processing, and trade of agricultural products in nine countries across Latin America, including Peru.</p>
<h4>What are BLADEX's goals for Peru and the region in 2016?</h4>
<p>Peru is a rising star in the region and we have set up a representative office to allow us to be closer to the Peruvian market and increase our participation in the trade finance spectrum, thus supporting our mission to offer financial solutions of excellence to our clients in the corporate world, and in the financial institutions area as well. We expect to increase our portfolio in the country, from today's level of 9% of the outstanding balances of BLADEX, to at least 12 to 15%. As far as the region is concerned, our target is to post more moderate growth ranging between 3 and 5% in 2016, as there is a divergent path of growth in Latin America, and the trade flows both regionally and globally reduced importantly in the last two years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[open-the-club-gates]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe CClub's brand and clientele?</h4><p>CClub was designed by the owner of ALARGAN, which wanted to create more of a social club rather than a typical health and fitness facility. Of course, the company did all the construction work and engineering. Due to the services provided and the high annual rates, this place usually attracts high-net worth individuals, people who can come in, socialize, and do business networking. We want to have the “crí¨me de la crí¨me" of society and we are happy to serve them with whatever needs they might have, whether it is dinners, lunch parties, corporate events, personal training, or health issues. Moreover, there are all the health and fitness services, like a gym, spa, swimming pools, and squash courts. I think our outdoor pool is usually the number-one attraction. Plus, now that we have a Michelin-star chef, people like to come and dine and hang out. At the same time, CClub is the face of ALARGAN. Usually when there are guests from overseas or board meetings, it is held here. This is how they present the company—with this facility. Most of our members are locals, but we do have a percentage that are from the Gulf region, from Europe, and from the US. Members who use our facilities are instructed by health and fitness professionals. For example, our head squash trainer is a former world champion and both our swimming instructors were members of their respective national teams.</p><h4>What would you say is in the future of ALARGAN in terms of health and fitness?</h4><p>To answer this, we have to go back to the basic business of ALARGAN, which is building medium-income housing facilities. This is how the company started and how the company emerged, but, after a few years, they started getting into the commercial side of the business, which is establishing hotels, restaurants, and eventually into gyms. We hope to have a health facility in every country where ALARGAN is present as well. This was the initial idea by the owner: wherever there is a project, there will be a gym or a health facility like this one. Seeing the different income and revenue between the housing and the commercial side is what attracted them to expanding the health and fitness industry within the company itself. Another big part was the global health and fitness trend that they certainly wanted to be part of. For instance, one of the main megaprojects under construction right now is a 4,000sqm physiotherapy and rehabilitation clinic. This idea actually emerged as another gym, and then the more we sat together with the owner and the chairman, everyone was convinced there were already enough gyms in the country and the area, so we had to be different in some way. I have seen many trainers who are showing interest in the physiotherapy side to differentiate themselves from regular trainers. There is a direct link now between physiotherapists and personal trainers. They are getting certified to be physiotherapists or rehabilitation coaches, which is the future for fitness and sports rehabilitation.</p><h4>Diabetes is a major health concern across the GCC. How would you describe health and fitness concerns in Kuwait?</h4><p>Over the past five years, there has been a lot of awareness, especially among 20-30 year olds, yet teenagers and children are the most affected by diabetes. I would like to see a solution for the child obesity and diabetes problem. It starts with the government taking the initiative and then major companies sponsoring programs or school activities or camps. It has a lot to do with gadgets and too much PlayStation and iPad time. Kids do not want to move anymore. When we grew up, all we could do was play sports. We did not have these gadgets. To fix this issue, we have to start from the home. As a parent, it is important to set the examples where children usually imitate their parents; if the parent is active then the child will want to be the same. Also, the schools have to mandatorily include sports or physical activities or exercises in the curriculum itself. We try to raise health awareness by consulting our clients and members on nutrition, wellbeing, or getting rid of bad habits. On a bigger scale, being a lecturer and a nutritionist, we also educate other trainers from other facilities and we certify them as far as sports nutrition is concerned. I hold a lot of workshops and training sessions for sports nutrition here in Kuwait. I have been recently asked to speak at Kuwait University regarding sports nutrition and the link between it and exercise and physiotherapists.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Advice]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-advice]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of your clients?</h4><p>What makes us stand out is that we have clients from a wide range of sectors. We have offices in Chiriquí­, Colón, and two in Panama City. We provide our services locally and can meet clients all over the country to serve and assess a whole range of sectors such as international commerce, hotels, tourism, education, retail, industry, automotive, financial services, and attorneys in law, real estate, and development. We serve our customers by providing seminars, book publishing, and technical material on fulfilling the laws and regulations of each of the sectors. We are also in the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors and have clients dedicated to handling and producing bottled water. Our clients are family businesses as well as international corporations that operate in different countries around the world.</p><h4>How have your clients performed over the past year?</h4><p>It has definitely been a period of adjustments and stabilization, not only in Panama but on a global level. I have clients in the retail market that have seen sales go down by as much as 30%. In international commerce, the duty free zone of Colón was greatly affected due to the economic and political problems in South American countries. I tell my clients to be creative and not rely on just one business source. They cannot rest on their laurels and must research, innovate, and develop new products. It is a good time to invest, but this means purchasing wisely. It is a good time to invest in the science and technology sectors. We have focused on services and commerce, but I recently met an engineer who was able to produce vegetables using a new system, capable of harvesting vegetables up to 10 times per year instead of just once or twice as under normal production. We need more of this type of innovation to help promote and share scientific knowledge in Panama. A scientist is very valuable to society in such times of climate change and challenges in water, health, and food.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>It looks like 2016 will be a year of new adjustment. It will not be the best year economically. However, we are arguably growing in a more stable way. We are adjusting to an orderly growth. My message to investors who visit us is that Panama is a country with a lot of advantages, being economically stable, democratic, and relatively safe with a modern legal framework. We need to support the maritime, logistics, and canal-related sectors. We aspire to constantly update legislation, as the private sector on its own cannot function without the right legislation in place. The same is true of the transport sector. In 2016 Panama will consolidate its position as a growth leader in Latin America, and we are ready to work on building these sectors to the same levels as three years ago. We need to strengthen the maritime and logistics sectors, which need better and more specific legislation. We also need to work to modernize the education sector and tackle the lack of high-level specialists, which is an issue highlighted in national surveys. We have a number of international schools that have seen this opportunity to develop private education as good business in Panama. The private sector takes the initiative but the public sector now needs to align itself and prepare people not just for work, but also to invent and innovate. I am a great believer in robotics and science as knowledge will propel Panama toward its new future. Even though we are more focused on some sectors such as sports, we need to export talent in other professional specializations as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has allowed the company to grow from Morgan &amp; Morgan Attorneys to a successful international group?</h4><p>My father initiated this group in 1923 when he became a lawyer in Chiriqui, and we are the largest law firm in Panama because we have the largest litigation department. After we finish working here, we will not own anything. We were inclusive from the beginning and that is one of the secrets of our firm's growth, because people stay with us. We started expanding in Panama and elsewhere. We had a large fiduciary company that was providing the kind of services that Panama needs in the offshore world.</p><h4>What attracts people to Panama?</h4><p>Panama is a service economy and more than 80% of the economy is dependent on services. This leverages the location and the facilities of a banking community that is regionally connected. The law firms that work here are good law firms. Having the dollar as our currency makes it is easy to do business in Panama, as we do not have to exchange. We do not have a central bank in Panama, so we cannot print money, making our economy robust in that sense. We have enacted some laws to attract foreign corporations into Panama. Many multinational companies put their headquarters in Panama to provide services to the region. They have incentives for doing that. There are at least 125 of those established in Panama, which is important and contributes a lot to the economy.</p><h4>What are the drawbacks of operating here?</h4><p>We were ranked 69th on the World Bank's ease of doing business index and that is nothing to be proud of; we need to improve. Although Panama has had a functional democracy since the 1990s following the US invasion, we have not been able to educate our people, especially our politicians, to understand our need for civil service in Panama. The reason other countries are considered advanced is because they do not change their civil servants every four or five years. We have not reached that point, but I hope we will. Education is the main point here where we are falling behind. Politicians are learning that they have to work on long-term state projects, not just for the years when they are in office.</p><h4>How important is social responsibility for Morgan &amp; Morgan?</h4><p>I am proud to say we are the only law firm in Panama that has a social responsibility program and a pro bono program. We are deeply involved with social responsibility issues. At the beginning of 2015 I took the decision as CEO that it would be personally handled by me. It is sometimes difficult to make people understand the importance of social responsibility. It is not just giving back to the country, but also doing business. Companies that are not perceived well by the clients suffer. Clients love when they learn that we are involved in social responsibility because they, too, are doing it, especially clients from the US and Europe.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2016?</h4><p>We will be more involved in arbitration in Panama. We have participated in several arbitration procedures, but we are not yet as big as we should be. That is an area of practice that I want to get into and we are working enthusiastically on that. We look at the world now and it is constantly changing. We see where the opportunities are and we react to that. We are not on the lookout for things to do, as we have enough already, but if we see an opportunity we will pursue it. There are other areas of practice where we want to expand internally. We are working hard, but we need more lawyers. Sometimes they are not easy to get. We have enough with what we have today, and if we do something, it will be to become larger in certain areas that we already have today in Panama. That is the way that I will continue this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the museum's mission?</h4><p>The museum began with a vision of developing a tourism strategy for Panama based on scientific research about the tropics. A small gathering of international experts was organized, including architect Frank Gehry, and the Biomuseo project was created as a part of a bigger plan. Both Frank Gehry and the Amador Foundation, which created the museum, wanted it to be a celebration of something important to Panamanians. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the University of Panama joined the cause to contemplate what the mission of the museum would be. It was decided that the museum would promote awareness of biodiversity, the first project of its kind. The idea is to create not just an exhibition space, but a way of learning how we are supposed to live and design our sustainable future for the 21st Century. Our mission is first of all to teach the importance of biodiversity; to educate on not only what it is, but also on things that we must learn to do.</p><h4>How did your partnership with Grupo Rey come about, and how did you manage to incorporate the museum within school curricula?</h4><p>The idea is to try to bring each year an important number of students from public schools to the museum for free, but more importantly to make each visit a part of what they do in the classroom; to make schools and museums partners in education. We worked for three years developing this program with Grupo Rey, and we have trained over 3,000 teachers, even in remote areas. Grupo Rey donated $1 million for the implementation of this program even before the museum started and for several years to come thereafter. </p><h4>What do visitors learn at the Biomuseo?</h4><p>The museum teaches us about the important role that Panama plays in shaping the modern natural world. In the late 1980s, the Biomuseo started doing research on the geological history of the Isthmus of Panama. They discovered that about 40 million years ago, North and South America were separated, and the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean were one. Once Panama closed that gap, the oceans started changing; their currents changed, the temperature changed, the Caribbean was formed, and it created the Gulf Stream as we now know it. Many experts believe that it also triggered the Ice Ages, as the isthmus prevented warm water from reaching the North Pole. The Ice Age allowed man to cross over the Bering Strait and come to America. It transformed Africa, which used to be more like the Amazon, into a continent of deserts and savannahs, and in turn this climate change, some authors think, changed the way that man evolved. When we tell that story at the museum, we tell the story of how Panama shaped the world in a sense because it triggered all of these changes. One of the phrases in Steven M. Stanley's book, Children of the Ice Age, is that we are all Panamanian due to the central evolutionary role of the isthmus. This shifts the narrative for locals regarding their identity in relation to the natural landscape, and emphasizes to non-Panamanians the underlying unity of all our stories as humans on Earth. We are tied by nature all over the planet, which is the lesson of biodiversity that we want to teach. Every country should introduce itself in this way, because we all have amazing stories; this is the vision of the Biomuseo. In the same way that plants and animals use color to attract other organisms, we designed our blooming building in the middle of this amazing part of the city to attract visitors. In experiencing the museum, visitors actually realize that the whole building and the whole project is actually helping them to connect physically with nature, with the landscape, and with culture in a physical and emotional way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main tourist attractions of Colón?</h4><p>There are many popular attractions in Colón. In the city itself, renovations are taking place. We have highly interesting architecture. Recently the Christ Church by the Sea has been restored; this is the first church built in Colón and a one-of-its-kind building in Latin America. Many other historical buildings are being restored as well. At just a short distance from the city within the province of Colón, the forts of Portobelo and San Lorenzo can be seen, both of which have been recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Then there is of course the Panama Canal and its Visitor Center, where the canal can be viewed. The Colón Free Zone is a great place for shopping. Colón features beautiful beaches and rivers, fishing tours, railways, the lake, indigenous communities that can be visited by boat, and lots of flora and fauna to explore. Food is also an important part of what Colón has to offer, considering that we have culinary influences from many different cultures, including West Indian, Chinese, Spanish, Arab, and Italian. There are a lot of options in Colón. As part of a wider tourism strategy, the government hopes to promote the inclusion of Colón as part of new cruise ship routes, along with islands such as Aruba and Curaçao.</p><h4>What are the current administration's priorities and vision for Colón?</h4><p>We want to renovate and renew the city. We want to improve its living conditions and convert it into a key tourist destination. Not only do we want tourists to see Colón as a shopping center, we also want them to explore and truly discover our city. It is a different city since it is not colonial, but rather American and French in its architectural order. The old city can be traversed on foot in 15 minutes, and we want to encourage visitors to do that. Walking through the old city is the best way to see and experience the most interesting and historical district of Colón. We want to make Colón one of the safest cities in Panama, and we are also promoting the development of its public spaces.</p><h4>An Odebrecht-led consortium recently won the contract to renovate of the old city. What does this megaproject entail, and what will it represent in terms of job creation?</h4><p>The renovation will have a big impact on three critical aspects, the economy, culture, and society. We want to empower our people with the tools and the knowledge to build their own future, not only as employees, but also as entrepreneurs. Colón has a major housing problem; many of its houses are uninhabitable, dating back to 1917-1920 when the Panama Canal was being built. All of these houses need to be renovated, as houses have a limited lifespan, especially when they lack proper maintenance. Certain heritage sites like Casa Wilcox and Maison Blanche are going to be renovated as well. We want to give people better places in which to live and better buildings, more public spaces, and a better quality of life. The government has invested a lot in this project, starting with a $500 million commitment that has since grown to $800 million. We would also like to see private companies investing in this renovation. We want people to come out of the Free Trade Zone and project into the city, thus integrating the two. We are learning from similar experiences in other places like Curundú in Panama City, which has become a much healthier sector with access to water and sanitary conditions. We also want to construct more housing facilities for middle-income and working-class citizens, which currently presents a deficit. We hope that all of this will be a great incentive for the private sector to invest in Colón. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has foreign investment contributed to the growth of Panama's tourism sector?</h4><p>There has been a growing interest in Panama over the past few years. The tourism industry has seen a rapid growth and there has been significant investment in Panama from foreign tourist companies and other investors. All major hotel brands are in Panama as well as a number of boutique hotels. There has been growing interest from micro businesses outside the capital. We have a number of foreign airlines and some new ones coming in this year, bringing more direct flights between Panama and the rest of the world. Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa are coming in this year, and Emirates is still interested. This is going to increase the number of visitors that Panama receives. The Asia-Panama connection is going to be important. Panama is also an important part of cruise ship routes. Panama still remains an important connection—we have the expansion of Tocumen Airport and there have been discussions of establishing direct flights to Panama with a number of new airlines, including Japan Airlines and Virgin. A number of international firms have invested in Panama, such as FEMSA and CEMEX from Mexico, Toyota from Japan, and many multinationals from the US, all of which generate tourism. </p><h4>What is the ATP's strategy for promoting Panama internationally?</h4><p>We are working to unify the efforts of the private and public sectors, as groups were previously working on their own, which was not effective. We are also hiring a PR company with the expertise and past success to sell Panama as a destination. We found through surveys that people are either unaware of Panama, or have false impressions of it. In order to create more demand, continuous promotion is fundamental. We now have a 10-year plan in mind because this is the minimum amount of time that will be needed to promote Panama as a brand. The second important aspect is training. Our best promotion of Panama is for people to leave with a positive view of Panama, so we are working on providing the necessary skills and relevant work experience to our human capital. One disadvantage of Panama's full employment is that there are many jobs available and, therefore, there is a high turnover, which affects the quality of services that we can provide. The third is that we now have an infrastructure plan in place based on ecotourism. We are working with a number of organizations involved in environmental protection and sustainable development. We are also focusing on business tourism, and there is a new convention center being built that will be ready in about 24 months. We want US companies to come to Panama to do business and take advantage of the FTA, which provides an important incentive for them to host conventions here in Panama. </p><h4>What is the Panama Tourism Authority's target for 2019?</h4><p>Our target for 2019 is to reach 3 million visitors, and we are on track to meet this goal. We have to be concrete in our efforts in order to maintain this growth, and we have to optimize our resources along with our marketing efforts. Despite the fact that tourism is the number one contributor to Panama's economy, our budget is actually smaller than other countries'. We have a US-focused strategy because it is our main market, but we are still betting on emerging countries. We have to be creative, and we are increasingly moving into the growing trend of digital marketing. In the region, we are targeting Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, which is our second most important market. Luckily, Argentina is recovering, and it represents an important segment of tourists that enjoy coming to Panama for a number of reasons, notably the lack of visa requirements. Hotels are unfortunately not able to charge as much today, but we have to take advantage of this and add to our competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is INDICASAT's mission?</h4><p>INDICASAT-AIP was started in 2002 by SENACYT as an institution involved in technological advancement services. The aim at the time was to provide analysis and technical services. Initially, we started by supporting the Panama Canal and carrying out analyses for canal operation purposes. In 2008, when Dr. Julio Escobar was in the National Security branch of the government, two changes were brought about. The first was to make the institution autonomous, as previously it was part of the government. He put Association of Public Interest (AIP) in the name, and this led to tremendous institutional progress because it allowed us to receive tax-exempt donations for research purposes. Also in 2008, Dr. Escobar decided that this institute should evolve from being a service center to becoming a leading research institution, and current National Secretary Dr. Jorge Motta is further supporting this idea, thus making the institute highly competitive and innovation driven with productivity. The institute focuses on biomedicine and inter-disciplinary sciences. Biomedicine does not only refer to medicine and doctors, as we also work with psychologists, sociologists, computer engineers, and other disciplines through all of the available faculties. Right now, there are 28 academics working at the institute, including chemists, medical doctors, biologists, engineers, social scientists, and physicists.</p><h4>What is being done to promote patentable technologies? </h4><p>The institution is a model institute, so we started a program whereby we were publishing papers and collaborating on innovative technologies. Now that Panama is more aware of patentability, people are focusing on it. We wanted to go one step further and build a technology park. We have a received a land donation from some Panamanian groups and plan to build what will be called the Knowledge-Based Technology Park. We plan to collaborate with companies and involve Panamanian scientists in the creation of novel technologies and play a key role in the transfer of technology from elsewhere. The important thing is that we not only want to pursue scientific development, but also promote developing technology within the country. Even simple antibiotics are not currently produced in Panama; they are instead only repacked here. We would like to develop a technology park so that we can bring together local and foreign investors. We will use the benefits from that for developing science, technology, and education Panama.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We have set three important targets for 2016. The first is to create a greater role for local institutions and universities in INDICASAT, and to this end we have started a joint program with UTP, which is the first PhD program in the country. This is a successful program with increasingly more institutes becoming involved. The program will be taught in English, which is something new and will help empower local universities. We are also helping the University of Panama develop a batch of English-speaking medical doctors, while finalizing MD-PhD program implementation. Our dream is to help universities around the country become stronger in the areas of STEM teaching. As an institute of highly qualified individuals, we want to transfer that knowledge to develop and support local colleges and universities. The other dream is the Technology Park, for which we would like to finalize the plans by the end of 2016. Our goal is to transform INDICASAT-AIP from a model institute into a leading institute and thus make it a National Institute of Excellency with international recognition. This would position Panama as an international science hub within the next 10 years. We are looking for wise decisions by Panama's policymakers to invest in science and technology in the coming years. We predict that by 2050 the GDP of Panama is going to increase by threefold, and we will need local Panamanian manpower to handle such economic growth. Hence it is necessary for policymakers to take a long-term approach toward investment decisions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Panama for Provivienda?</h4><p>Provivienda started in Panama 22 years ago based on Colombian funding. We do not work through a holding corporation; instead each country has a separate company of its own. We try to replicate the best practices from each other's companies in the way we do business. We have created and delivered more than 20,000 units in Panama over 22 years and are currently the largest residential developer here in terms of units and sales. Our primary focus is middle-income residential housing; however, as Panama is such a small country we have to be present in every segment of the housing market. </p><h4>In which segments do you have more of a presence?</h4><p>We actively participate in the $50,000 and below segment, which is government-subsidized housing. However, regulations have changed in the past decade, making it extremely difficult to build profitable affordable housing. Developers do not generate profits in these segments so many have changed the scope of their businesses and moved out of the low-income, social housing segment. Provivienda and other large-scale developers of these segments have worked with the government to change current social housing regulations and now we begin to do social housing developments once more. We generally operate in the low-income segment of up to $50,000, in the second bracket of $50,000-$80,000, and in the segment between $80,000 and $1 million. We completed a luxury residential beach resort project in Bijao. It was one of the first luxury, second-home beach resorts in Panama, along with Buenaventura Beach Resort. Those are the two most successful projects of this kind in the country.</p><h4>How is Panama's rapid growth driving the expansion of the real estate sector?</h4><p>Panama has experienced constant growth over the last five years, although this has slowed somewhat and is predicted to continue to the level out to a more stable growth rate. Double-digit growth rates are worrisome because we might have a growing economy, but we do not have the right infrastructure behind it. Panama is still a third-world country with huge problems in areas such as education. Returning to a 5-6% growth rate is a safe place for the country to be in the years ahead. We have seen important growth in the middle-income segment, which represents most of the economy here. Provivienda has experienced stable growth in Panama, which has created dramatic changes in the industry and put more money into the mid and low-mid segments where we are focused. The downside is that all this growth in the real estate market has driven up construction costs. The average price for a residential unit has increased dramatically. Still, sales prices are cheaper here than in countries with comparable economies, such as Peru and Colombia. Fortunately, the world economic slowdown has put a stop on some of the increasing construction costs and this is keeping the real estate market stable here. Panama has no local production of the high-impact materials used in construction; thus, we depend on imports, and that is driven primarily by international markets. On the other hand, strong government restrictions, codes, and regulations counteract these decreases and continue to cause construction costs to increase. Panama will be in a good place for the next five to seven years. </p><h4>Do you face challenges in hiring locally?</h4><p>Labor prices and demand for labor are going up here; however, people without the right knowledge and skills are entering the construction industry, which is a problem. The current labor code in Panama is ancient and should not apply to an economy like this. It is not based primarily on productivity, which should be the driver for construction. We invest a great deal of money and time in our in-house training programs. We hired external trainers for all the different disciplines in which we work, which ensures quality control. We truly believe and invest in our people and development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government announced the delivery of 92 homes under “Techos de Esperanza.“ How many people will this benefit and what are the wider implications of the program?</h4><p>This project is focused on people that own their land but do not have adequate housing conditions, like a lack of basic sanitation. We initiated the program with government resources and have recently strengthened the project by tendering it out to the private sector. A total of 15,000 houses are currently being constructed by the private sector. From May 2016, we will have put to tender a further 20,000, specifically in those areas that are most in need, such as those that have the highest rates of poverty.</p><h4>How will the renovation of Colón attract private sector investment into the construction of new low- and middle-income housing?</h4><p>There is an important investment on the part of the government to renovate urban areas in order to improve infrastructure and the availability of housing. We are in the process of approving the Colón Puerto Libre Law, which will stimulate the private sector to drive the country's economic growth. Whilst the ministry carries out a program of renovation, construction, and improvement of infrastructure as well as living and housing conditions, this law will propel private sector investment in Colón, incentivizing the construction of more retail and residential projects, casinos, and hotels. The government is also working hard to promote the tourism sector to make Panama not only a port for cruise ships passing by but a destination to visit in itself. The Colón Puerto Libre is an important part of this strategy.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Housing and Land Management's role in creating new centers of economic activity outside of the capital to tackle the issue of mobility? </h4><p>Right now the plan we are executing is for the construction of 31,000 homes; our aspiration is to reach 100,000 and before the end of the year we have to begin the construction of the first 50,000. Around 99.9% of these are in the interior of the country, such as in rural areas. This is not just helping Panama City in terms of reducing urban migration, but it also is helping cities like Santiago, David, and Colón, where people are moving in search of opportunities. The government has a large-scale plan to bring not only new housing to these regions, but also health centers, schools, and basic sanitation. All this is being carried out by local labor force, further incentivizing staying there, taking advantage of the new opportunities that are being created.</p><h4>How will the new Metro lines influence the location of urban development projects, and how can the ministry better integrate the city with public transport?</h4><p>There was already a plan in place from the previous administration, which we have since strengthened. Now, not only do we have Line 1 up and running, but also the construction of Line 2 is under way. Before the end of the current administration, Line 3 will also be awarded. This, coupled with the fact that the Ministry of Metro now handles the Metrobus, means that the two are viewed in a parallel manner, whereas before they were in competition. We are of the opinion that we need to increase the density around the Metro, but we are also demanding that developers create more parking spaces in residential apartments and shopping centers.</p><h4>What are your goals between now and 2019, and what are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>I would like to achieve our goal of building 100,000 houses within five years. We have managed to gain the confidence of the private sector, and it is participating in this and subsequently bringing many of these projects to tender. By the end of 2016, we will hopefully have tendered, awarded, and given the green light for the construction of more than 50,000 homes; over half our goal. If we achieve this, we are on the right track to achieve our 2019 goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Panamericana de Avalúos built and defended its reputation?</h4><p>There are many factors, but I would like to think that it is based on character and moral principles.  We like to say our work is our best presentation card, and this has been carried over to all levels of our organization. Today, I have a team of 48 dedicated and totally committed professionals, 18 of which are engineers and/or architects, including myself. We have an important role in the market as the only company whose appraisal reports are accepted by all banks as well as insurance and reassurance companies established in Panama.</p><h4>Who are your biggest clients?</h4><p>Banks and insurance companies account for 50-60% of our work, with the remaining balance coming from local and multinational corporations as well as real estate promoters and individual customers. I entered this business because I felt at the time there was a lot of room for improvement in the sector. Real estate accounts for about 80% of our portfolio, while the remaining 20% comes from industrial concerns and construction equipment companies.</p><h4>How do you stay ahead of the competition?</h4><p>This is the day-to-day situation, and we never let our guard down. We are in constant development, always seeking ways to improve the service we offer, as we were the first company that enabled clients to download their appraisals. Because of the rigorous analysis of values and tendencies in the market that we maintain, our clients have the assurance that the value and results obtained reflect actual market conditions. We always try to follow up with clients once they have sold their property to learn the final sale price in order to review the accuracy of our work. Our experience shows that the resulting sale price is on average closer to our appraisal and not the client's initial perceived figure, and banks understand this.</p><h4>What trends in the real estate market have you observed?</h4><p>The behavior of the real estate market tends to be cyclical by nature about every 10 years, with reasonably steady growth. However, by the end of the last century until the first years of the current one, the market experienced a slowdown to the point that it was stagnated. We were obtaining lower appraisals in 2001 for properties purchased in 1995 and 1996, much to the dismay of the owners. Until 2004 the market was slow; however, almost overnight in 2006 the market experienced unprecedented growth. A big percentage of that was due to the migration of potential buyers that considered Panama a good place to retire, while others from our neighboring countries that were experiencing political and economic turmoil moved to Panama, creating an impressive and more optimistic market demand with the speculation factor becoming an issue to be considered.</p><h4>What are you goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We are here for the long term, and the construction industry is going to continue to grow strong, making the necessary shift to address the huge housing deficit in the middle and low-income segments. Speculation in land and materials is taking its toll, and it is unclear whether or not people will be able to afford properties. Another important point is that interest rates are low right now, but they will at some point in time have to go up. It should be noted that with all of the speculation and price hikes taking place today, banks have been extremely cautious with regard to financing mortgages, requiring buyers to put up higher equity for their properties. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the portfolio of Grupo Céspedes changed in recent years?</h4><p>When we first started, our core focus was mainly on infrastructure for government projects.  Since then we have diversified into a whole range of services specializing in the construction industry and catering to all its necessities. Our business portfolio has shifted from a 60:40 government-private sector ratio to 80% private and 20% government. As a group, we have dedicated the last 20 years to improving the construction business in Panama, by raising its standards and offering better solutions to its every need. Our corporate group is divided into seven companies, offering a full range of construction, heavy equipment, engineering, quality control tests, appraisal, real estate, marketing research, and financial services.</p><h4>What are some of your current projects?</h4><p>As a construction company, we are developing a real estate project in Costa Linda, Juan Diaz for Bienes Raices Regency. We are also building the new warehouse for Grupo Primavera. Another project that makes us proud is the infrastructure of the Logistic Humanitarian Regional Center in Panamá Pací­fico. As developers, we have an important project in Penonomé. After studying the market, we noticed that there was rising activity in Penonomé due to the mining industry, hotel proliferation, and the beaches. We detected an unattended need for affordable housing to host the labor force moving to the area. So last year we built 170 social housing solutions and this year we are building 500 more. We believe in Penonomé; therefore, we will continue to invest there.</p><h4>How can the government incentivize investment in social housing in order to address the shortage?</h4><p>The social housing market is very interesting, because there is always going to be a lot of demand.  The problem is that developers do not bet on it, as it does not provide high returns. It requires a lot of knowledge in the buying and selling business, and any mistakes can be costly, making it a difficult market in which to survive in. The government has marketed the incentives of social housing well. The problem is that the process of getting the incentive back is very slow and bureaucratic. As a consequence, developers have lost faith in the incentives because it takes too much time to be able to count on it. </p><h4>What are your plans for growth and what is going to drive the group forward?</h4><p>We want to consolidate ourselves as a group and get people to know us and the wide array of services we can provide—as an appraisal company, as a real estate firm, and as a developer, not just as a construction company. We have been investing in other related activities for almost 50 years and recently added new companies and services to our group, always thinking in the best interest of our clients, coworkers, and the companies. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016, and how will it compare to the previous year?</h4><p>Overall, 2015 was a rough year, but this is not a reflection of the government. There is always a slowdown in the first two years following government transitions. We were expecting that and planned accordingly. I am still optimistic that we will have a good 2016. On the construction side, it will be our best year in about five or six years. This is what we have been working on and this year we are going to make it. For our appraisal company we have visualized new business opportunities, offering our services to financial institutions, brokers, law firms, and others.  We are also widening our services portfolio with financial and quality inspections, a new line of business that we have not yet explored. There is a lot of competition in the appraisal sector, but we bring to our customers the fastest response, with innovative solutions and excellent service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some changes that have allowed the MOP to carry out its mission more efficiently?</h4><p>This administration has worked hard to comply with strict building standards. One of the main objectives is to achieve the highest quality standards for our civil work. We acquired new equipment to streamline the functions of the MOP and employed the equipment and technology to meet the transportation needs of communities, especially in areas that are difficult to access. With this new equipment, the MOP will expand and strengthen its machinery fleet, and we can effectively support the construction of roads and dredging of rivers and streams, channeling rivers, street maintenance, and other urgent activities. The MOP conducts its bidding processes transparently and all companies can participate fairly, offering competitive market prices. We will proceed with the construction of the Agua Fria-Santa Fe-Canglón-Yaviza Road, which will benefit over 48,300 inhabitants in Darien. We will move forward with the design and construction of vehicular bridges over Potrero River in Arraiján district. We provided technical assistance for the management project of the fourth bridge over the Panama Canal and are currently conducting the bidding process for the design and construction of this ambitious project that will benefit more than 1.7 million people. We continue to manage tender processes to develop new works, with projects such as the study, design, and repair of rural roads.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Nueva Red Vial de la Ciudad de Panamá project?</h4><p>The purpose is to create a vial platform to effectively distribute the nearly 600,000 vehicles that pass through the downtown area of Panama City daily and serve as a base system for the Metrobus and Panama Metro. In this sense, we move forward with continuity projects, of which some have been completed, such as the viaduct of two lanes at the intersection of Via Centenario with Avenida Santa Elena and the one-lane viaduct at the intersection of Via Cincuentenario with Avenida Diego de Almagro. Approximately 100% of the repairs and expansion of the Amador Causeway is now completed, including upgrading and expanding four Amador Causeway lanes, and a landscaping study to preserve the recreational and tourist destination. The rehabilitation of the superstructure and substructure of the Bridge of the Americas is now 88.88% completed. The MOP recently opened a bidding process to contract the design and construction of the widening of the Omar Torrijos Road between Corozal and the Centennial Bridge.</p><h4>How is the MOP working to improve the quality of life in rural areas?</h4><p>One of our main goals is increasing the connectivity of all the communities around the republic via efforts to optimize the economic and social development of people. We run various projects within the country, including repairs to the Puerto Armuelles Internal Road in the district of Baru, Chiriqui, which will provide greater security and accessibility to the public and help with the government's efforts to revive the banana zone. This 36,153km work includes the design and construction of 17 vehicular bridges over streams or channels, of which 13 will be placed on the existing alignment and four on a new alignment. We will incorporate the communities of northern Veraguas in the country's development by implementing the construction project of the Guabal-Rio Luis-Calovébora Road for the benefit of over 17,000 inhabitants. Repairs to the Cerro Camino Sombrerot-Chichica Road, and the design and construction of the Chichica-Cerro Miel-Peña Blanca-Llano Tugrí­ Road, will improve access for inhabitants of the Ngäbe-Bugle region and help to improve their health, education and housing situation. We continue to conduct repairs to the Las Pipas-Llana Arriba-Pitaloza-La Mesa Road, which will facilitate access and strengthen production of cassava, yam, corn, tomato, and orange, among others. Currently, we are working on the expansion of the Sabana Grande-El Hatillo in the district of Pese. We will continue with construction of roads this summer to facilitate access to basic services, especially for the less well-off, promoting balanced social development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Georgia Tech's role in raising the level of education in the logistics sector?</h4><p>Improving education is one of our main objectives. Mostly, our contributions are at the academic and professional levels. At the academic level, we collaborate with industrial engineering and logistics schools, meeting with professors and conducting workshops on topics such as curriculum, new approaches, and techniques. We established—with the support of the Secretariat of Science, Technology, and Innovation—a dual master program in supply chain engineering, which provides scholarships to qualified students at the Technological University of Panama and the Universidad Latina de Panama. In 2015, as part of their capstone project, students in this program analyzed the flow of the Metro Bus, which involved conducting a public survey, gathering GPS data, and analyzing timetables, stops, bottlenecks, and passenger numbers. At the professional level, we offer two certification programs: the Lean Supply Chain and Supply Chain Management. We also have a Breakfast and Learn program where we cover state-of-the-art subjects targeted at the private sector and the academic sector, respectively. </p><h4>Can you tell us about your new partnership with National Institute of Vocational Training for Human Development (INADEH)?</h4><p>A study by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) identified a weakness in technical-vocational education in Panama. We recently started collaborating with INADEH on a program called Supply Chain Fundaments, oriented toward entry-level individuals who intend to work in the supply chain and logistics field. This program, consisting of nine courses, was designed by a consortium of eight universities in the US, one of which was Georgia Tech. This program was offered to us at Georgia Tech Panama, and we translate the courses for INADEH and will help them integrate this program into their regular training programs. In this line, we have just signed a MoU that opens the possibility of further collaborations. </p><h4>How do you foresee the canal expansion affecting trade flows and volumes? What new opportunities will this create for Panama?</h4><p>The expansion of the canal represents a paradigm shift in the maritime industry; we are abandoning conditions that have existed for many years. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the near future in terms of flows, trade, and services provided to the ships that pass through the canal and the impact on the value-added services to cargo. In terms of value-added services, the expansion has made available about 1,200ha that could be used for warehousing, consolidating cargo, and other services related to postponement of merchandize, including light manufacturing. The integration of the local supply chains of producers, agricultural and industrial, with global supply chains is another opportunity that needs to be discussed. Both sectors are not performing well and work practically in isolation of the booming logistics sector, especially the manufacturing sector. The integration of these two sectors into the logistics sector will contribute to extending the benefits of international trade. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Georgia Tech Panama in 2016?</h4><p>We are now part of the Logistics Cabinet, which means we are more involved in supporting government strategies, policies, and regulations. We will continue our work with maritime and land transportation stakeholders and will increase our presence in the area of air transportation. We expect to continue strengthening the center's relationship with universities and start working more directly with the private sector in 2016. In this direction, we have become members of various private sector organizations such chambers of commerce, including AmCham, as well as the Maritime Chamber of Panama, where we participate in their respective logistics committees. Even though the government regulates and facilitates business activities, actual competitiveness rests with the private sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been IDAAN's response to the water scarcity issues in Panama?</h4><p>We work with the Ministry of Environment to push forward the National Water Security Plan, which is important for securing our natural water resources in the short and long term. We try to mitigate the impact of El Niño through a large-scale well construction program and are constructing around 138 wells throughout the country, with plans for further wells in the future. We also work to deliver water via trucks to our clients in rural communities that are in serious need. To operate our water filtration plants, we build dikes in rivers in some areas that do not have enough flow or depth at the moment due to the diminished flows that occur during summer. We undertake improvements to many water intake pumps and make investments that diminish the weaknesses of our systems, which at the moment are vulnerable to water scarcity. We definitely require a change of water management in the sense that we need to manage our water resources, but also need more awareness amongst the general population. The water scarcity we experienced during the El Niño years, particularly in the countryside, has raised awareness, but habits are slow to change. We have not yet seen a strong lowering of water consumption.</p><h4>How do you work with other authorities?</h4><p>We focus on the collection and supply of potable water and the treatment of wastewater, which are our main goals. We work with other sectors on the National Water Security Plan, but as we are the largest water and wastewater operating company, servicing 75% of the Panamanian population, our priority is to service populations that live in cities.</p><h4>What is your role in the Sanitation of Panama and the Bay project, and who will it benefit?</h4><p>The Sanitation of Panama and the Bay project is led by the Ministry of Health, and has now been turned into a wastewater collection and water treatment program. It is a strategic project because it will take care of disposing wastewater for the largest areas of Panama City. IDAAN takes care of areas to the north as well as some larger cities of the countryside. In the end, all systems have to converge and be transferred to IDAAN for wastewater lines operations, treatment, and maintenance. This project has been in need of financing. It will be key to promoting health and tourism throughout the city, and will improve the quality of life of many people who live in the largest cities of Panama.</p><h4>What new technologies are you working on at IDAAN?</h4><p>We have several partnerships with universities and with CATHALAC, and are in the process of transforming our organization to increase its institutional capacity. We undertake several projects, including a telemetric project that allows for remote management through a network of monitoring points that control Panama's aqueducts. We also include technological projects such as an enterprise resource program to integrate and improve our internal systems. This helps us manage our projects, stock, purchases, and transfers. It will also help merge our operative and commercial areas that currently work independently. We will know when repair crews need materials and can improve our organizational processes. We also work on a geographical information system that covers the whole institution, which will support us as we currently do not have knowledge of where pipes or leakages occur. We also implement micro-metering to lower our consumption, and are starting a pilot to do water metering from large distances. The intelligent micro-metering system will cut services if someone does not pay.</p><h4>Does the Panama Canal expansion put more pressure on IDAAN?</h4><p>Around 55% of our water production from our filtration plants comes from the Panama Canal watershed. We have to manage with the canal to make the best use of that water, considering that human consumption is the most important use of our water resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ministry of Environment was set up in March 2015. How does it differ from its predecessor and what are some of your goal and achievements?</h4><p>One of our biggest accomplishments is the realization of a National Water Security Plan that ensures an integral and holistic approach to the capacity to plan in in the mid and long term. Environmental issues are typically long-term issues that involve timeframes beyond that of any current government. We need to ensure that what we do is sustainable, will last, and that the fruits of our investments can be enjoyed by future generations. We also work on promoting sustainable tourism. Over 40% of Panama is under a protected area category. Communities in these areas typically do not see any benefits to living in these protected areas. One of our objectives is to incorporate the private sector, NGOs, and communities in protecting these areas, while also showing them the benefits of sustainable tourism. This will enable us to appreciate and understand the natural wealth and resources in Panama, while bringing in a source of revenue. In terms of climate change, we participated in the Paris Climate Talks and took part in all the negotiations. We launched, with President Varela, an initiative that will lead to the creation of an international carbon market and the creation of carbon credits through market mechanisms. The need for climate financing is much higher than what can be met through public funds, so we need to incorporate the private sector in that transformation to maintain the global temperature increase at less than two degrees centigrade.</p><h4>How do education and training come into play in your efforts?</h4><p>Planning is crucial in terms of setting out the investments that need to happen and in creating awareness of why these investments are important. We are currently doing an extensive consultation on the plan in all the different provinces in Panama. This year we will initiate an important contribution to a private sector initiative for a nationwide competition on water involving high school students who will engage in research and learn about water issues. With the office of the First Lady, we also work with 450 primary schools, supporting projects related to taking care of our surroundings, the importance of recycling, of having trees near water resources, and so on. Projects like this are an effort to invest in our country's future by grooming new generations of Panamanians who realize, understand, and value the importance of environmental resources, security, and sustainability.</p><h4>What is being done to encourage and develop recycling in Panama?</h4><p>There are a number of recycling companies in Panama but unfortunately, on the whole, Panamanians are not used to recycling. Recycling is not really a government responsibility, so instead we try to create the right conditions for businesses to take this on and fill that niche. We are also working to create a general law on garbage that will make conditions for better recycling, reducing waste, using space and landfills more efficiently, and providing better services from garbage disposal authorities and municipalities</p><h4>How is the ministry working to develop sustainable infrastructure in protected areas to promote eco-tourism? </h4><p>We have started an action plan on sustainable tourism focusing on five protected areas in particular. There are the pilot areas where we invest in infrastructure, create trails and better signaling, improve apps, and establish visitor centers. Each protected area typically has a management plan, and the management has a section that is called a “public use plan" that we will implement. Panama is the regional leader in sustainable tourism and the dynamic agent for communities and the private sector surrounding protected areas. This is the vision we agreed on, as our concept of green tourism. It will serve as a guideline for the government, the private sector, and communities to develop their protected areas into appealing destinations and encourage green tourism in Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was a dedicated authority, separate from the government, established to manage the canal?</h4><p>This organization evolved from the fact that the US managed the canal as a public utility for the better part of 85 years. The Panamanian people wanted to make sure that the canal would operate outside the political sphere and therefore decided that it needed to be totally independent both financially and operationally, unlike the other government institutions. We resorted to a constitutional amendment, which took place in two different legislatures in 1993 and 1994. The success of the Panama Canal has had to do with this marked independence from government rooted in the constitution, but contingent that it would be operated safely, uninterruptedly, efficient, and that it must be profitable. </p><h4>What spillover effects will the expansion of the Canal have?</h4><p>The spillover effect has already been felt. The construction of a project of this magnitude requires many workers to mobilize to the project, both from different areas of Panama and abroad. At peak of the construction some 14,000 workers were being employed on the many Panama Canal Expansion projects. This significantly increased consumption in goods and services including housing in Panama. We have already spent about $5 billion on the project, much of which has been pumped  into Panama's healthy economy. Moving forward, the expansion will not only allow our present customers to benefit from the economies of scales provided by the larger vessels that will soon be able to transit the canal, but it will also allow the canal to exploit opportunities for growth in other sectors. </p><h4>What opportunities will the new port of Corozal provide and why is this project so important?</h4><p>Additional port capacity is needed on the Pacific side to attract more container trade to Panama. We have an area of 120ha in Corozal that can be developed into a transshipment container terminal. By having additional port capacity on this end we should be able to attract one or two additional services of the container trade. Just one container service per week means 104 vessels per year, or $70-80 million additional business for the canal itself, in addition to an expected $25 million in initial revenue that would come from the terminal concession. That is part of our new diversification strategy, as we  are concentrating mainly on those activities that add to Panama's logistics strength on account of its favorable geographical position. We also see opportunities that go beyond the container terminal—we have reclaimed a considerable amount of land which  was contaminated with unexploded ordnance left by the US military and which we cleared to make it suitable for the new locks and channels. We are currently working on a master plan for the first 257ha, which we want to develop into a logistics park, another business that we would we target for concessions. This would promote more use of the port on the west bank and add value to PSA's port that is now undergoing an expansion on account of a land concession awarded to it by the Panama Canal to add two post-Panamax berths.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our outlook is that 2016 will probably be similar 2015. We are finishing the third set of locks, and our expansion should be operational by the end of 2Q2016; every effort is focused on not missing that deadline. This of course is not entirely in our hands since we dependent substantially on our contractors' ability to execute. With regard to contractor claims, they will take some time to resolve, and we have a strong team that represents us well in these processes. In the meantime, we are concentrating on getting the construction completed with the required quality, and to begin to see our customers making use of our new locks and channels. The pressure is on us, both locally and from abroad. This project is the largest expansion of the Panama Canal ever—it will be done when it is done, and we want it done right. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Panama Maritime Authority in safeguarding Panama's maritime interests, and how has the organization evolved since its inception?</h4><p>According to the legal mandate from the national Charter, the Panama Maritime Authority is called upon to be the regent body of the maritime sector and also the leader of the National Maritime Strategy. Our country manages the world's largest ship registry through this entity, with over 8,000 registered merchant vessels that account for 218 million in gross tonnage and represent 18% of the world fleet. Subsequently, our registry has more than 300,000 licensed seafarers worldwide working onboard these vessels. The staff and I are permanently committed to the safety of people at sea, safety of navigation, and the protection of the maritime environment. We oversee the local concessions provided to international players managing our port infrastructure, which is the most efficient in the Americas. The national maritime sector and the PMA are forecast to grow every day. Therefore this administration has believed, since the beginning, in the principles of capacity building and technology transference; these are the keys to success. I personally support the continuous training of our staff in all fields concerning maritime issues, either locally or through international courses given by organizations to which we belong, such as IMO.</p><h4>What are the authority's most important goals and challenges?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is to encourage maritime and logistics development throughout the nation. The goal is to develop the potential of the canal and the major ports. Future port developments are going to take place not just in the city, but all around. We are working with international organizations such as the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) and the Development Bank of Latin America to develop ports like Puerto Armuelles in Chiriqui, highlighting the importance of being transparent in all the steps that entail these kinds of concessions. We want this to be open to investors around the world that are looking into these projects. The main objective of the PMA is to be trustworthy and to give all the assurance that legality will lead the process.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with other countries that share the waters surrounding Panama and other maritime organizations around the world?</h4><p>Panama has a tradition of maintaining neutral and peaceful relations with other countries, as witnessed by our Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty, which guarantees safe passage through the canal of vessels from all countries without any distinction measures. In this respect, our country maintains an excellent relationship with our neighbors and the government actively participates in regional and international forums around the world, which allows the PMA to have mutual cooperation with many maritime nations.</p><h4>What are the pillars of Panama's maritime strategy moving forward?</h4><p>Panama's maritime strategy promotes the sustainable development of the maritime-logistics cluster to support Panama's socioeconomic growth and consolidate it as the main offshore platform for the Americas by improving processes between the public and private sector. All the aforementioned, supported by a strengthened and qualified human resources pool, are key parts of all business.</p><h4>What contribution will the maritime sector make to the country's GDP and what are your expectations for 2016? </h4><p>According to statistics provided by the Panama Chamber of Shipping, the maritime sector as a whole makes up 33% of Panama's GDP, and we expect this figure to grow next year as we continue to integrate the complete logistics platform of the country. Panama inspires a lot of confidence for the future expansion of the canal. Definitely, our country is ready for all the changes that will come due to the soon-to-open Panama Canal expansion. The ports are ready and the PMA is prepared to take on this increased level of activity in the maritime sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Panama fit into the global biopesticides market?</h4><p>We are entering the Panamanian market at a stage where there are diversified crops, so we target those crops for which biopesticides can create a higher value than other products. We usually begin with fruits and vegetables, as they are more sensitive to chemicals and tend to be consumed by end users in their unprocessed form. We launched our efforts with rice in Panama after attaining positive results in other countries. Rice is an export crop in Panama, so quality control is a central issue for the industry. The results for farmers are much better in the long term. Government subsidies for crops, including rice, allow for better cash flow. We are also considering working with coffee and other crops in Panama. The reason we entered Panama was because of the diversity of its crops, the exportation of its output, and its openness to the benefits of biopesticides.</p><h4>What are you doing to raise awareness of the benefits of biopesticides at regional and national levels?</h4><p>Big changes in the industry are always mediated to some extent by the biggest players. Established companies recently started warming to biopesticides after seeing that it was not a threat to their chemical portfolio, but rather a complement to it. Once they understood that, the real journey began in terms of M&amp;A licensing and distribution agreements between the big players and the biopesticide producers. Biopesticides are now an integrated part of the industry and everyone has accepted that there is a legitimate place for these products in their portfolios. We are still at different levels on the learning curve for our products, and the growth of the sector depends on extracting maximum value throughout the distribution chain.</p><h4>How will China's Hebang Group's recent acquisition of 51% of the company affect Stockton's operations and further its expansion?</h4><p>This was an important event for us, considering Stockton has been a family-owned company for the past 20 years. Our relationship with Hebang is extremely good. In the past, Stockton relied on its own internal resources in terms of investments, goals, and business strategy. This deal allows us to carry out more ambitious plans. Stockton's vision is to become a leader in biopesticides and to integrate this product into the conventional spraying program. This increased financing will help us develop additional commercial products besides our already well-known products, like the Timorex Gold fungicide. The new ownership structure will also enable us to penetrate new markets such as the US, China, India, Japan, and Europe. Our new shareholders have made it clear that they would like to see the company listed on the NASDAQ exchange in the next three to four years, so we are working toward that goal. Another aspect of this investment will be Stockton's ability to start screening and collaborating with the aim of discovering additional biopesticide technologies.</p><h4>What new products are you are preparing to bring to the market?</h4><p>We want to diversify our product lines into herbicides and insecticides. We also want to strengthen the appeal of our products in the market. The early stages of our research are spent seeking ways to purify biological AI technology in order to make them viable. Almost 70% of a plant's structural mechanism is meant to be defensive. That is a fantastic place to look for implementing crop protection solutions, and we intend to invest in more research to launch more plant-based products.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where will Stockton have the biggest impact in terms of the reach of its products?</h4><p>Our vision for Stockton is to become a place of innovation where ideas become realities that can be applied in new and different ways. We want to bring our new technologies all the way to the individual farmer. Part of our mission is to help create technology that will benefit all of humanity. It would be great if Stockton could succeed in actualizing this goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ministry responded to the drought conditions brought about by El Niño?</h4><p>Our country, like the rest of the Pacific region, experienced one of the longest droughts in recent history. The summer of 2016 is predicted to be very severe, and since 2015 was also very dry, a shortage of water for agriculture and cattle production could result in severe losses. Based on these predictions, the ministry launched, in April 2015, a study in every province, district by district, to find out how could they be affected. A drought plan was developed for the entire country at the cost of $14.5 million. On September 27, 2015 a nutritional program for cattle and a plan to build wells, lakes, and water collection ponds started in the province of Los Santos, which was one of the worst affected areas. About 2,800 cattle died in the province in 2015 while 5,000ha of corn and 40% of the tomato crop were lost. In February 2016, a similar program was launched in Herrera, to be followed by the provinces of Cocle, Veraguas, and so on. Panama was blessed with tropical rain for many years, so we did not have the need to collect and store water. The government recently appointed a High-Level National Committee with the help of UN and other international agencies in order to establish water policies for the next 25 years.</p><h4>What are the ministry's plans to make Panama a food distribution hub?</h4><p>Panama's strategic location, solid banking system, status as a logistics hub through its airports, the wide variety of commercial products going through duty free zones, and the more than 15,000 ships crossing the Panama Canal every year, some of which go back to Asia empty after leaving their cargo here, all make Panama the ideal site to be a food distribution hub. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Commerce and together with the Ministry of Agriculture, private executive associations, producers, and several countries that have demonstrated interest in this idea. The government is working on the necessary documents and surveys to develop this project. The center will include packing centers, refrigeration storage, facilities to supply ships' needs for their employees and passengers, and a logistics center for brokers to take orders for major supermarkets and distributors all over the world. A preliminary trial was conducted last year in which a ship with 7,000 tons of bulk rice came from the US and in 10 days all this rice was packed into 100-pound bags. Later, some 400 containers were shipped to countries as far away as Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How can Panama exploit opportunities in agro-tourism? </h4><p>With the Ministry of Tourism and our Agro-tourism department, we conduct educational programs and seminars that teach producers how to attract international and local tourists. Campaigns to attract tourists to production sites can help them understand the new technologies used to produce and preserve healthy food, learn more about our country's traditions, seen different forest trails, organic farms, and so on. We started new coffee and sugar cane routes that feature different plantations and processing plants. All agro-tourist farms have to be evaluated and certified every two years by the ministry.</p><h4>What are some initiatives to increase production for small farmer?</h4><p>In Panama we have around 350,000 producers. Approximately 80% are small producers who are responsible for 20% of all the food being produced. Our main target is to get them organized into associations or cooperatives, so that we can better assist them and help them sell their crops. At the present, we work with some international agencies to teach them to be more efficient by using new certified seeds, water supply systems, and fertilizing techniques. There are also seminars and field trip experiences on processing, drying fruits, cheese making, and so on so that they can add value to their crops. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Mapiex?</h4><p>I founded Mapiex in 1981. We started selling aircraft parts and providing charter flights. Today, 34 years later, we run a complete FBO in Panama with services at eight different local airports. Our services include aircraft part sales, an aeronautical repair shop, air charter, ground handling, landing and over flight permits, fuel supply, and in-house customs and immigration services. Mapiex Group is a family business and continues to grow.</p><h4>What are some other examples of clients that you serve?</h4><p>We have had the opportunity to provide outstanding services to important customers such as the world's most important and recognized businessmen, several presidents, famous people in the music and film industry, and many other important personalities from all around the world. We have been privileged to serve these clients.</p><h4>What are your recommendations for using an FBO in Panama?</h4><p>A large number of private flights prefer the Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport because it is more comfortable and much quicker. In our facilities, passengers and crew can go directly from the plane to the VIP lounge area, where they immediately receive customs and immigration services. We are also located next to the main street and have our own exit door, so customers can leave shortly after their arrival. We also recommend the Panamá Pací­fico International Airport, as long as the weather conditions are appropriate, because it is also close to the city and we can give both crew and passengers the same services, making their stay as short and comfortable as possible. Tocumen International Airport is our best-known airport of entry for airline passengers but it is not our first choice for FBO services. Tocumen has a lot of traffic and private airplanes usually have to go to reboot the platform, therefore it is not comfortable for the customers because they have to go through the same route and procedure as a regular airline passenger to pass through customs and immigration. We also offer services in the Tocumen Airport, although it is not particularly comfortable for clients.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the aviation industry in Panama?</h4><p>In the last few years, Panama's development has increased the aviation industry. In our particular case, we have had continuous growth in our private and corporate flight services. Mapiex currently has more than a 73% market share for FBO ground-handling services of all private airplanes attended in Panama.</p><h4>How do you assess the human capital in the industry in Panama?</h4><p>We are proud to say that we have over 100 Panamanian employees. We are committed to having the best instructors in the aviation industry and maintaining a continuous and rigorous training program for our employees.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion?</h4><p>We are currently working on the following three new products as short-term expansion projects: providing our new FBO ground handling services at new airports in Cuba; services for Pratt &amp; Whitney (an American aerospace manufacturer); and services for Turbomeca engines. We are also working on increasing and developing our services at Panamá Pací­fico International Airport.</p><h4>How will you stay ahead of the competition? </h4><p>We have always been focused on improving and expanding our range of services. Our expansion plans are based on maintaining our operational safety standards and providing the best service. We have been the market leaders in our services in Panama and we keep updated in our industry to ensure the delivery of leading-edge solutions to our clients.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Some of our services may be affected by the economies of other countries this year, but this is a cyclical trend. It will be an interesting year for Mapiex Group, but our expectation until now is to continue growing, as we have so far. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who is your audience?</h4><p>Previously, 80-90% of our readership at Capital Financiero was made up of top executives. However, it now consists of many mid-level executives who read our newspaper, particularly women in senior- and middle-management positions and people between 28 and 34 years old. Our subscriptions are increasing and our female and young readerships are becoming increasingly important. Senior- and mid-level executives make up approximately 50-60% of our readership today. Students in the past did not buy the newspaper, but now we connect with this demographic by working through social media and attending events. The newspaper's model is based 95% on physical subscriptions, with 6,000 paper copies going to specific subscribers in various industries</p><h4>What is driving readership in this younger demographic?</h4><p>Capital Financiero is a strong brand in Panama. Moreover, younger people are increasingly in positions of power in Panamanian businesses. The reason for this change is that younger people have the required skills because of better educational opportunities today and the digital transformation that has taken place. This is the principal reason. Younger people can be seen in any kind of office in Panama, so this trend is simply representative of what is happening in the country in general. We have the combination now of older and younger readers, which is a perfect mix. The lifestyle of our audience has changed and multimedia represents a big percentage of our business. However, the future for us is not only online, we need to establish complementary platforms.</p><h4>Is Capital Financiero distributed internationally and do you have any plans to publish in English in the future?</h4><p>Panama City is our principal area for distribution and around 90% of our overall distribution is in the larger cities across the country. In 2016, we are planning to begin expanding, with the first step being to publish a newsletter in English. The second step will be having all of our supplements in English. We are finding that there is demand from businesses for information about Panama in English, and Capital Financiero needs to facilitate communication between Panama and the rest of the world. Furthermore, Panama City has become a cosmopolitan hub that attracts English speakers and they need access to this same information.</p><h4>How are you integrating events into the newspaper's ecosystem?</h4><p>Capital Financiero has traditionally held forums over the last 15 years, but we have changed this toward events as a broader concept. We now have 12 events per year, covering energy, telecommunications, entrepreneurship, education, talent, banking, logistics, maritime, environment, economic diversification, and business transformation and development. We have one event per month, usually with 200-300 people in attendance. Our forums used to be attended largely by our subscribers and by general managers. Now our events are larger with a wider appeal, so even students and middle management attend. In 2016, we intend to have more events with higher-profile speakers.</p><h4>What goals do you have for the newspaper, and what will be the main stories to look out for in 2016?</h4><p>The media business is like a shopping mall; it is not only digital content, it is all kinds of products. We do need to increase the volume and quality of digital content. Capital Financiero has traditionally been known for its high-quality output and top-rate journalists. However, we need to combine this expertise in the paper with the whole ecosystem. In 2016, we are planning to change the editorial and content management system for the web so that it works well online. Commercial advertising is another area that has changed for newspapers. Clients can advertise not only in the physical newspaper and its supplements, but also digitally. One topic is that Panama's GDP is staying above Latin American and world averages. Oil prices are also an important issue for 2016. Panama will experience healthy growth in the coming year. Panama is not just about the canal and copper, and that our construction sector continues to perform well is evidence of this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Next year is Canon's 50th anniversary in Panama. What are your reflections on this landmark and how it be celebrated?</h4><p>Our reflection on this landmark is our commitment to continue with the development of new technologies, new business domains, new business models, and new lifestyles for our customers and partners. Our guidance behind the 70 years of Canon history is based on our corporate DNA, respect for human beings, emphasis on technology, and maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit. It has not been easy, and we have seen large and well-known companies disappear over time because they stayed behind changes; companies that adapt to business changes and listen carefully to the market and customers' needs are the ones that survive. We are not planning a major celebration, because we are moving into our new installation right now, in which we have invested tremendous amount of money to improve our efficiency in the workplace. We are in a new facility because we have been growing significantly and added new key staff. We also need to enhance our image improving our building and location. Our goal is completely to focus on satisfying our customers. We want our customers to come and see our machines and solutions for themselves.</p><h4>To what extent have your sales activities been impacted by the economic climate in the region over the past year?</h4><p>The economic climate is important in our life and in all business environments. The Panamanian economy has shown strong increases compared to the other countries in the Latin American region. As our economy is based on services due to our geographical position, what is happening in the rest of the world affects our business. Different external factors such as the slowdown in the economies of North America, Europe, China, and the rest of Asia, the exchange rates, and the slowing down in business of two major business partners in the Colon Free Zone, in Colombia, and in Venezuela, mean that trade and transit through the canal have been impacted negatively. All of these factors affected the business climate in our country. We are facing some internal issues that the government needs to address in order to guarantee continued economic growth, such as security, education, health, infrastructure, and transparent management of all government institutions in order to show transparency at all levels. This year our expectation is to grow our business and increase our operational efficiency. We are optimistic and are taking into consideration the new strategy of the government, which calls for executing more than 2,800 projects with an investment of $4.532 billion.</p><h4>How does Canon foster the development of human capital in Panama? </h4><p>Investing in training is one of our main strengths. Working on advocating our talent is one of the points where we pay a lot of attention. Developing new trends to improve productivity and reduce costs is what we seek with the solutions we offer to our customers, and this is the reason why we require constant training. When we hire, we are always looking for talented people with the right profile, and if we see improvement opportunity we do not hesitate to make the investment to improve the skills of our staff. We have our training program with our internal, well-known Canon Academy and we are constantly training our staff. Education is one of the main challenges for our government in Panama.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectation for the year ahead? </h4><p>Our goals and expectations are to be the number-one company in all product lines, and we want to achieve double-digit growth. We can create the best technology that can support businesses and people's lives. Our focus is on maintaining a win-win relationship with all of them. In the coming years, we will keep working with and growing our business partners and customers to continue, as indicated, our win-win relationship with everyone and contribute to society with our products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government recently announced a plan to restructure public transportation in Panama. What issues need to be addressed?</h4><p>Panama's Strategic Government Plan 2015-2019 clearly identifies a number of weaknesses and areas that require improvement in our transit and transportation sector. These issues include traffic congestion, accessibility, and mobility in Panama's metropolitan area and weak institutional capacity to handle these challenges. During the past year and a half, we have been working on giving form to a plan to address these issues. This plan encompasses the modernization and organizational reengineering of the Transit and Terrestrial Transport Authority and a complete review of the transit and transport's sectors legal framework. One critical improvement area is public transportation, where we are working toward the implementation of an integrated public transportation system for Panama's broad metropolitan area. Another key area is cargo transportation, which is particularly important at this moment in time due to the increased cargo volumes that are expected as a result of the canal's expansion. Our government has created a Logistics Cabinet, which is responsible for the strategic planning, development, and implementation of a master plan to promote Panama as a logistics center. The ATTT is part of this Cabinet and plays a major role in making sure that the issues regarding the land cargo sector are included and addressed in the master plan. Aside from this, the ATTT has set up a task force with representatives of the land cargo transport sector and other related instances to discuss operative issues and adopt measures to make this activity more efficient, cost-effective, and safe.</p><h4>Where will modernization efforts be focused?</h4><p>Public transport is the area that needs the most improvement and modernization. In recent years, there has been a need for a mass public transportation network, which did not exist previously. We just had old buses, which were known as the diablos rojos, or the red devils. The concession won by MiBus brought in better vehicles and improved the sector overall. The metro has also had a major impact with line one having recently been completed, adding an additional dimension and forming the backbone for the public transportation system in Panama. Line two is under construction. When completed, it is expected to transport 500,000 passengers per day. Line three will cover the west side of the metropolitan area. But before line three is undertaken, various other infrastructure projects need to be completed, such as the fourth bridge across the Panama Canal. It is important to keep in mind the geographical characteristics of Panama City, which has natural barriers that limited its expansion. Having the Pacific Ocean to the south and the Panama Canal to the west, the city was forced to grow eastward in a rectangular fashion. Presently, there are only five main arteries in Panama City including northern and the southern highways, which are paid, to handle the flow of around 900,000 vehicles.</p><h4>How are you addressing the issue of traffic safety?</h4><p>We are going to schools, both in urban and rural areas, and universities to talk to students and the population. We are using social media to increase awareness of road traffic safety. Public servants receive training on safe driving, and we are offering certificates. We are also teaching drivers to be aware of pedestrians and cyclists to respect road rules and speed limits, and to understand the importance of seatbelts, for example. In short, we are covering every single aspect and factor that relates to traffic safety. In 2016, we will also reinforce our control and law enforcement capacity by increasing the number of inspectors and traffic police units on the roads.</p><h4>How are you tackling illegal transportation?</h4><p>We are taking measures to overcome this by requiring drivers to have the right documentation and urging people to choose legal and safe transport rather than illegal options. In 2016, some of our main goals include the restructuring of the institution and concessions of collective public transport operations. Independently of what I just mentioned, there are challenges to overcome in both public and private transport. We have to reduce the “red spots" in traffic, as well as traffic on the roads in general. We need to increase road safety through education for drivers and also pedestrians and cyclists. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main pillars of the recently launched National Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, and Innovation 2015-2019?</h4><p>The plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in January 2015. It is a plan that was developed by different segments of society. It is not simply a five-year plan; it now comprises a 25-year policy framework. We did not develop a plan by area; instead we have taken a completely different approach. Our objective is to use science to support the sustainable development of equity, and central to this goal is health and education. With the funds that we were assigned by the government of the Republic of Panama, we will continue with the development of human capital in fields such as engineering, science, and mathematics not only in primary and secondary schools, but also in advanced degrees at the master's and PhD level. The pillar of innovation seems to be embedded in a culture that needs to be developed locally, because businesses can get complacent while external competition remains ferocious. Panamanians are only now beginning to understand that, and we need to constantly remind them that innovation is key. The plan also focuses on the governance of the whole National System of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Panama, because the issue is that this topic has not been well articulated. SENACYT is also an administrative agency that gives support to the research facilities in different parts of the nation. Science has to be integrated into the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, and even the Ministry of Commerce. What we would eventually like to see is all of the government entities creating an office dedicated to science and technology within their organizational structure. We cannot think that by just giving money to SENACYT, the field of science has been sufficiently addressed.</p><h4>How do you promote interest in the STEM subjects among students?</h4><p>We promote STEM subjects through a variety of ways. Together with the Ministry of Education we coordinate Science Clubs and a National Robotic Competition. SENACYT recently joined the international campaign and educational program called “Hour of Code" to promote computer science nationwide. We also use other tools to promote STEM, such as Scratch, a program developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of the Science Clubs, we organize the National Competition of Chemistry in the Kitchen, which allows students to learn chemical reactions through the art of cooking. There is a lot more to do, and we are now launching an aggressive campaign to move forward in an effort to teach students that science is not something entirely abstract and that technology affects every aspect of their lives. This is going to take time.</p><h4>What needs to be done to promote commercialization of the research and advancements in technology taking place in Panama? </h4><p>In 2015, we granted funds to 72 research and development projects. This was a tremendous change, after having gone through a period over the last two years during which the previous administration did not provide funding for any projects. The funding varies so much that it is another disadvantage for our country. We plan to increasingly regulate funding in order to support more projects. Panama is still in the early stages of commercializing its emerging R&amp;D culture. We seem to have gone through a phase of just producing scientific and academic papers, but this is about to change, as the incubators and entrepreneurial associations are starting to develop. SENACYT is involved in helping the efforts of the Technological University of Panama in this regard. Innovation is what we need to work on, and to do that we need to convince ourselves that we have the necessary talent to be innovators. In order to be an innovator, a certain level of education is necessary. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does this project compare to others with which you have been involved?</h4><p>One of the great things about the mining industry is how different the projects are. The last project I worked on was the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia for Rio Tinto. It was a copper mine of about the same scale as this one, but in the South Gobi desert, which regularly reaches 30 degrees below freezing. A lot of the infrastructure had to be built up to eight feet underground because water will freeze at anything above that. I worked before that at the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, in one of the most remote parts of the world. Panama is warm and humid, and as a rapidly developing country it is a great place to start building a mine of this scale. There have been a few smaller mines that failed and made a negative impression on the community, the investors, and the government because they closed shop and walked away, leaving behind unpaid workers and environmental degradation. Panama is, therefore, somewhat cautious regarding mining. The operational challenges here are different from the challenges in Mongolia; in Mongolia there is no rain, whereas the location of the mine here receives 4-6m of rain every year. The area is set within a rainforest, so environmental management is critical. Environmental sensitivity is a major point of focus when operating in challenging climates. The mine in Papua New Guinea saw 10m of rain a year and was the second wettest place in the world.</p><h4>Do you find price fluctuations a challenge with these projects?</h4><p>That is a definite challenge. This is a 40-year investment, and to invest billions of dollars years before seeing any return with no control of the selling price gives a sense of the courage that it takes to make these types of investments. The project is designed to withstand the fluctuations of copper prices, as it will be a relatively low-cost producer. As the price of copper fluctuates, Minera Panama can, should, and will be near the bottom of the cost curve, while more expensive mining operation will feel the heat first. Our contribution to Panama's exports will change depending on the copper price, but it should be about $2 billion overall. Panama's exports in 2015 were $800 million; therefore, the project alone more than triples Panama's exports. We will be Panama's largest single exporter by a factor of close to 10. </p><h4>What is the importance of the Minera Panama project for the country? </h4><p>The project will directly contribute about 4% to GDP, triple the country's exports, and directly employ 2,500 people, while indirectly employing up to 5,000 more. Having another plank of industry provides stability and diversity to the Panamanian economy. As we develop the mine, we will get a better understanding of the geology and the exact potential of the mine. The estimated 34-year lifespan is based on what we know now, but it is common for these lifespans to expand. That said, we are in the process of planning for closure, even if it takes 50 years. Our philosophy to date has been to rehabilitate areas if we are not going to use them anymore. The more detailed planning of what will happen to workers and the communities develops alongside the rest of the project. This is an endeavor that for the next 30 to 40 years will be the biggest employer in the Coclé region and will drive the economy. A young person coming out of university or high school today could start at our project and work there until they retire. This is a story not just for Panama, but for the whole region as well. It will provide this part of the world with huge economic growth for 40 years of generational growth, which is the real opportunity for Panama. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which segment does the company have the most consolidated position? </h4><p>We have a total market share of 29% consolidated across our entire portfolio. We have an extremely strong position in the cold juice segment, where we own 80% of the market. In the cold milk segment, we currently own 70% of the market share. As for ice creams, we own 65% of the market share. We own 10% of the market share in the UHT segment, 15-20% in juices, 25% in yogurts, and 6% in cheeses. Our two main strategies are to maintain our leadership in all cold segments and ensure that we are the first choice for consumers and sellers. We currently reach 7,500 stores, and we must continue working with this same focus, as the cold product segment is one of great potential in Panama. We see opportunities to improve in areas such as yogurts and in-store selling. We plan to invest during 2016 in the yogurt segment and to expand coverage in the ice cream segment, as this is a market segment with a lot of potential; the 6-7 liters of ice cream consumed per capita every year in Panama is extremely high. This is why we need to focus on implementing innovative actions that generate added value.</p><h4>What potential do you see for Panama to become a regional food hub?</h4><p>There is great potential and we need to focus the efforts of the entire value chain on this goal. Panama enjoys a great geographic location and that competitive advantage can be taken further with collaborative development of infrastructure and efficient logistics to capture all of the potential benefits. We have seen that the government has taken positive steps with local producers and is set to continue with players from the agroindustry. Our focus is on investing and innovating, which is important in this industry. We want to further consolidate our products, activities, and brand in Panama, which is a country with one of the most appealing growth levels in the entire region. Our expectations are to consolidate our activities in Panama and generate more value for our clients and consumers. This also means introducing new products, adding greater value, and applying more innovation. Our priority now is the local market, where Estrella Azul enjoys a strong position and is the leading brand for dairy products.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Panamanian market?</h4><p>We see that nowadays we have more knowledgeable consumers; people are well informed and look after themselves much more than in the past. People today look more in detail at the ingredients and nutrients within products, which is why we are boosting our investment in innovation. We are currently offering a broad portfolio of high-quality dairy products to satisfy the nutritional needs of the thousands of consumers that choose Estrella Azul every day. Another emerging pattern is one we have witnessed in the milk collection and distribution channels. Panama produces an average of 200 million liters of milk a year, and every year we buy 50 million liters from local 300 farmers. Panama has the highest milk prices of any Latin American country, at around $0.65 per liter. We are currently working together with our suppliers and the government to make this sector a profitable one for all actors involved in the production chain, from producers to retailers. Since I took over this position in the company, I have personally overseen action to generate value in the industry. However, we need to invest more in the research of animal genetics and properties of the local soil. We need happy cows that produce around 25l to 30l a day. This is one of the main challenges the sector faces, and the private sector needs to work with authorities for the implementation of long-term initiatives that establish a common vision for the entire sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What segment drives the company's activities in the region?</h4><p>Automotive parts, power tools, and household appliances are the main drivers of our business that are well known by end-users. However, we have a presence in the project segment throughout the region through some of our other divisions. Bosch Pharma packaging technology is present in a highly relevant pharmaceutical project in El Salvador. Our hydraulic solutions are used in the largest hydroelectric project in Venezuela, the Guri Dam. We have a significant presence in mining projects in Peru, with our hydraulic motors and drive units. Packaging technology and steam solutions from Bosch are used in most international confectionery and food plants established throughout the 17 countries of our Latin American region.</p><h4>How is innovation driving the role that Bosch plays in Panama's development?</h4><p>We are represented in Panama via distributors and integrators in various segments, from power tools to automotive spare parts, as well as thermotechnology and household appliances. We also have a complete portfolio of security systems, an important part of our business in Panama. The surveillance system surrounding the Presidential Palace in the historic Casco Viejo district of Panama City was produced by Bosch. Our smart homes and smart cities concepts are now in their first stage of development. The strategic importance of this market can only increase. Ecuador is hosting the upcoming Habitat Exhibition in 2016 and Bosch will be there presenting its smart technologies.</p><h4>How is Bosch technology used in the canal, and why were you chosen?</h4><p>The Panama Canal is an important part of our business and is another reason why we are here. Bosch was part of the modernization project of the Panama Canal that took place in 1998 when the old mechanical lock systems were replaced by new hydraulic ones from Bosch Rexroth. We are also involved in the new set of locks for the Panama Canal expansion with the same technology. Bosch Rexroth is delivering all of the drive-related components needed for the rolling gates between the chambers and the water sewing basins. This innovative solution allows the canal to save up to 60% of the water previously used during operation of the locks, which illustrates well our motto of “Invented for life,“ meaning that we focus on innovation and technology. We file an average of 5,400 patents every year, which is the equivalent of one patent every 30 minutes. What is also interesting to know about Bosch is that 92% of our share capital is held by the charitable foundation of Robert Bosch, which invests profits in social, cultural, and health-related projects worldwide.</p><h4>How will Bosch continue to consolidate its presence in the region?</h4><p>Cuba and the Dominican Republic are targets in the short run. We are exploring opportunities in Cuba, and we have already established distributors there for the automotive and power tools segments. We have been present with a corporate booth at La Feria Internacional de la Habana (FIHAV) 2015, which is the most relevant exhibition and industrial fair taking place in Cuba. We have a household manufacturing plant in Peru. Bosch recently opened a branch in Costa Rica to provide technical support to the security systems and accounting services for the US, and we also opened a sales office in Ecuador in 2015. In 2016, we opened a sales branch in Panama with the purpose of selling directly to our customers, and we started with power tools and then expanded to other divisions. The region that we cover here represented $80 million in revenue for Bosch in 2008, but has since grown to roughly $240 million. The target for 2020 is $500 million, meaning we aim to double turnover in the next five years. The Center of Competence located in Panama plays a decisive role in achieving this target. We are seeking opportunities to challenge ourselves in order to reach our goal in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities as Minister of Industry and Commerce and what is your vision for the ministry?</h4><p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce plays a major role in the development of Panama's economic and trade policies. As Minister of this institution, my vision is to create strategies aimed at developing the sectors of trade, services, and production to maximize their competitiveness, and promote modernization. My main priorities are focused on maximizing exports, attracting FDI, and modernizing the industrial sector. According to 2015 figures, national exports decreased by 15%, excluding the Colón Free Zone and service exports. Panamanian trade efforts are oriented to promote traditional agriculture products such as banana, pineapple, coffee, melon, watermelon, and such other high potential products as cocoa, papaya, and tuber. A priority of the ministry's policy is to attract foreign capital to develop a stronger agroindustry. Last year's data was strongly influenced by several factors, namely weather conditions, a reduction of productivity in several regions, and a stronger US dollar, which increases the cost of Panamanian exports compared to those of competitors. The answer to overcoming external obstacles is to focus on value-added products where industrial activities can guarantee local production in order to export products in a more efficient manner.</p><h4>Which trade and investment partners will become increasingly important for Panama in the coming years?</h4><p>The US has been always the major trade and investment partner for Panama. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, new business opportunities will come, especially those related to the use of our logistics platform such as the concept of transforming Panama into a “Food Hub“ for the Americas. In that case, the country has the opportunity to develop a new business towards logistic activities for one of the major sectors with the potential to reach new markets. The European region is also an ideal market for Panamanian trade and investments. Currently, countries such as the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and Germany are major investors in Panama. Eastern European countries are also highly attractive for promoting agricultural products. Most of the efforts by the government are focused on trade and investment promotion in Europe. With Asia, we have had close dealings with Israel through a new FTA. Japan's role in megaprojects with Line 3 of the Panama Metro and the fourth bridge over the canal will open the door to new opportunities related to technology and know-how transfer between countries. With Singapore, our government is implementing a Technician Center on the east side of Panama using the methodology and know-how of relevant education programs for the future of Panama in human resources development. The arrival of Turkish Airlines and Emirates will also open a new window for those emerging markets where Panama has lot of potential to develop according to their strength in industrial activities.</p><h4>What new opportunities does the expansion of the canal bring for international firms?</h4><p>Panama offers a strong legal framework for investors in which investments enjoy legal stability and steadfastness. The inauguration of the canal expansion will reinforce our strategic position as a center for transshipment, business, and value-added services for the entire world. It will allow not only the passage of ships with nearly triple the capacity of vessels that currently cross the canal, but also the possibility to access a broad range of investment opportunities related to strategic businesses oriented geared toward the development of a value-added logistics services platform. One of the major investment projects that we are executing is the construction of the new Corozal Container Terminal on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal. This project will include the construction of approximately 2,081 linear meters of docks, container yard, and superstructures, all on approximately 120ha of land. This area will have the ability to handle up to five post-Panamax ships simultaneously, provide direct rail access, and expand the capacity to handle about 5 million TEUs annually. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see Panama's energy mix evolving, and what would be the ideal balance of energy sources?</h4><p>We currently operate on an energy matrix of 55% hydro, 6% wind, and less than half of that through solar. We hope to be sourcing around 75% of our energy from renewables by 2018, meaning hydro will stay more or less where it is now, but we will have a 12% increase in wind and a little bit more than that in our use of solar. The important thing is that the new solar and wind generators will produce energy when there is no rain. It will be an excellent complement to the existing capacity, as Panama has a different peak ratio of demand than the rest of the countries in the area, such as Colombia and those of Central America, due to the fact that we mainly use electricity for air conditioning rather than for industry. We peak during the peak of the sun; therefore, solar and wind perfectly match our demand. They produce water and energy when there is no rain so it is an excellent form of coverage and a natural hedge.</p><h4>What are some initiatives to increase energy integration in the region?</h4><p>We already have a capacity of 300 MW between Panama and the rest of Central America all the way to Guatemala. We are currently expanding our national grid, so we will be able to add a further 300-400 MW of capacity between Panama and Costa Rica. We have three connections with Costa Rica, and we will be able to increase that. We already have an interconnection with Central America to Guatemala, which is subsequently connected to Mexico. The other interconnection will be with Colombia. We are making great progress and have settled on a route that has been declared suitable by the Ministry of Environment. We recently received permits to conduct feasibility studies on the road and the transmission line. We will do those in the coming months and present our findings to the general congress. With a second approval, we can then do an environmental study and probably start work in 2017. We have a 130km undersea power line that will leave Panama in the Guna Yala region and extend to Colombia somewhere near Necocli in the Gulf of Uraba. From there we will continue on for another 180km toward Cerro Matoso. Once this line is operational, there will be 400 MW going both ways. If we had the line right now, we could already be selling electricity to Colombia, which would help with the big prices they are facing today.   </p><h4>What are some of the major projects that you plan to carry out in 2016?</h4><p>We have an intensive investment program and an expansion plan that was conceived in 2012. What we are actually doing is executing the expansion plan that was put in front of us. The first year was about getting the money to perform these projects. When I came to ETESA almost two years ago, there was hardly any money at all, yet we had a huge list of projects. We will be executing about $1 billion worth of projects in these five years. The first two years were relatively slow in terms of project execution due to a shortage of funds, but we have already secured $180 million and we have another $100 million committed for 2017. We will probably issue a $350 million 30-year bond in 2016, and our goals are to acquire the necessary capital, continue developing contracts, finish the third line on time, tender and finish the fourth line, and initiate the Interconeccion de las Americas between Panama and Colombia. The fourth line is a $500 million project and finishing the third line is a $350 million project. We are running ETESA with the mindset of a private company, even though it is owned by the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did LS Energia choose to establish its headquarters in Panama?</h4><p>Out of all the countries we could have picked, Panama had the best environment. It has high-quality infrastructure, its airport is a hub, and there are a number of fiscal benefits. We view Panama the same way people see Dubai in the Middle East: it is a country that has security, a solid legal framework, and there are many factors that allow you to work efficiently. Here you can really focus on your core business.</p><h4>How do you assess Panama's efforts in moving toward renewables?</h4><p>We have dedicated the greatest amount of time and effort into natural gas and liquid fuels; however, we make major efforts with regards to solar energy—much more than wind or hydro—as we see a lot of potential here. One of the challenges, especially in Africa or even Latin America, is bringing power to remote villages. If you string in cables from the power grid it will involve great cost and will not be effective. If you put a power plant there, you have to supply the fuel, which is worse. Solar energy, on the other hand, if available, is free; you just build the panels and power the town. That is where we see the best solution and best replacement for fossil fuels, which, of course, also helps the environment and powers the village. But once you deliver electricity to a town, it has to be delivered consistently and with quality. This is a huge challenge, especially when we talk about a remote area. There are technologies for energy storage, which provide some level of solution.</p><h4>Where are your R&amp;D efforts focused and what innovations are you working on?</h4><p>We plan our next moves on the renewable side, namely building hybrid plants. There are towns that, for example, require power for more than 5,000 people where it is not feasible to have batteries that last that long. Therefore, we work on hybrid plants where you have a conventional power source, such as a generator, but you only run the generator when your primary source of electricity, whether it is solar or wind, is unavailable and your batteries are empty. This allows you to provide more reliable power.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion in Panama?</h4><p>We are looking at South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, which are three separate areas for us. South America is relatively well developed as far as power generation goes but this is not the case for the Caribbean, which mostly works with unclean fuels, such as diesel. This source of power is expensive and the resulting pollution is a deterrent to the tourism industry on which these islands depend. Those countries present considerable challenges but are also exciting places to work in. We are trying to develop that market from our base in Panama. There is a similar situation in Central America, the difference being that Central America has hydro energy, which is a great source of power, but the region also relies on imported fossil fuels when its reservoirs are low or empty. Again, the hybrid concept may be the ultimate answer: combining technologies.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I predict the price of oil in 2016 will stay low, which has an impact on our business and not necessarily a positive one. Countries with fewer investment capabilities do not invest in technology, as they expect their returns will be lower. This year will not be a bad year altogether; we will see cheaper energy and countries that depend on imports of energy will experience growth, whereas those dependent on energy exports will go down. Europe and Asia will grow and other countries will slow down a little. It will definitely be an interesting year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Celsia's plans to expand into non-conventional renewables?</h4><p>We plan to build solar farms in Chiriquí­ on land that we already own to take advantage of existing substations and transmission lines. The plan is to install 40 MW-60 MW of photovoltaic capacity that we hope will be completed in 2017. One of Panama's assets is the ability to use solar power to meet its energy needs. Peak energy demand is between 8am and 6pm, and we believe solar energy can meet this demand and relieve pressure on energy generation. The other plan is getting generated energy from Chiriquí­ to consumers in Panama City; we need to strengthen our transmission lines.</p><h4>How do you foresee Panama's energy mix evolving, and what role will renewables play?</h4><p>Panama has a strong hydroelectricity sector. Developing more hydroelectricity projects will be a challenge because of social and environmental restrictions. Solar and wind is what Panama will focus on in the future. Panama already has an important wind project: the Laudato Si wind farm in Penonomé. Since the cost of solar power has lowered significantly, it has become increasingly competitive and is likely cheaper than investing in wind. The priority should be maintaining a mix of energy sources. Renewables require a lot of effort to meet demand, and there is less security compared to either thermal or hydro. I envisage a future energy mix that incorporates thermal energy. Having said that, thermal will change. Today, it relies on bunker/fossil fuels; however, over the next few years we will see LNG coming in following a contract that Panama recently signed to develop LNG plants here. We will see LNG replacing bunker fuels, which will be a major change in the thermal sector. Thermal is changing and becoming much cleaner.</p><h4>Celsia was recently named one of the leading companies in the world for sustainability. What is this in recognition of?</h4><p>We have the largest thermal electric plant here in the country and the best relationship with the local community, both in terms of our social and environmental initiatives. We have always met requirements and we continuously work with local communities. We have a number of projects, from reforestation to community and social work programs. In terms of our thermal projects, we are in the process of renewing and updating our technology to make it more efficient and competitive. We have a restructuring plan in place for our plants in Colon whereby we hope to transform all our plants that are 40 years or older into newer, more modern, cleaner plants within the next three years. We are looking to convert our diesel plants to LNG, following the country's cleaner energy policy.</p><h4>What are the company's plans for expansion in the region?</h4><p>Celsia is the fourth-largest generator in Colombia and the fifth-largest distributor. In Panama we are the second generator and in Costa Rica we have a wind project with a capacity of 50 MW, which makes us the fifth or sixth generator. Right now, we have Mexico in our upcoming projects, where we intend to develop our own projects. We are considering Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Guatemala. Our policies are looking northward to the US, and we will evaluate any great opportunities we see arising in this region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we will consolidate our operations here in Panama and Costa Rica. We hope to move forward with the Chiriquí­ solar project and position ourselves as leaders in distribution of energy as well as in installation of solar panels in the country. We hope to consolidate our wind farm in Costa Rica and expand our capacity by 60 MW through some tender opportunities. We are also moving into transport and mobility; for example, we have a project to convert buses into electric buses with the authorities in Cali. If this works, we want to replicate this in the rest of the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the construction of the Azuri Peninsula evolved over the last year?</h4><p>We finished the piling work and now have 1,060 piles in the ground, all of which have been casted and tested for viability and sustainability. We have also got off the ground with the first tower, the Orun Tower, and we hope to finish the entire podium for the three blocks by September 2016. We have had a few delays; however, we are glad to be where we are now.</p><h4>How has the real estate market evolved over the last year?</h4><p>With the economic downturn nationally and globally, developers have started to think outside of the box, looking for more ingenious ways to increase efficiency and raise standards. The government is enforcing punitive measures on defaulting developers to ensure we have viable and well-built developments. Today, we are seeing such practices being valued, which is a positive evolutionary trend for the country.</p><h4>What projects have served as an inspiration for the development of the Azuri Peninsula?</h4><p>We have combed the world for inspiration. The first model that comes to mind is Dubai. One advantage for Eko Atlantic is that we are able to study the deficiencies and issues that were not taken into consideration in Dubai, and correct those mistakes or oversights. We also travelled to the Netherlands to study how a country below sea level has never flooded in order to apply the same engineering to Eko Atlantic. In terms of how to deal with and mitigate the risks of excessive traffic, we studied the organization of Manhattan. We have studied Toronto, Shanghai, Singapore, and California, and tried to implement the positive elements of each of those cities and adapt them to suit the needs of Nigeria.</p><h4>How else can you customize real estate to Nigerian needs?</h4><p>Every culture and country has its own unique circumstances, attitudes, life philosophies, and conditions. Five or 10 years ago, if you brought a UK-style house to Lagos, nobody would buy it because in Europe the population is accustomed to small spaces and open-kitchen plans. This would not work here because we have large extended families in Nigeria as opposed to the nuclear families you see in the UK, and it also would not work because of the way we cook our food, which would just not be viable with an open-kitchen plan. Therefore, you have to consider all those things when planning these projects. People are changing and adapting, though, and thus new trends must be considered alongside our culture and way of life.</p><h4>How does Eko Development Company Ltd (EDCL) integrate environmentally sustainable practices into its operations and projects?</h4><p>As company policy, we do not believe in cut-and-paste developments. We spend a lot of time exploring the world and learning from iconic buildings and phenomenal engineering projects. We try to bring those lessons home and adapt them to Nigeria rather than imitating projects. Every country and city has its own topography, climate, and market, which all have to be taken into consideration. For example, we are in an area that has salt water, meaning that we have to adapt our metal structures to ensure that the structure is not affected by salinity. We also do a lot of high-rise buildings; hence, we have to ensure that the elements will not affect the structural and ethic integrity of our projects. Another aspect is taking into account the positioning of windows and doors to reduce electricity expenditure for air conditioning. We are also taking into consideration open green spaces, and there will be naturally aerated spaces built into our projects, as opposed to the entire project being mechanically cooled.  We are pleased to note that other developers are finally catching onto this trend as well.</p><h4>How efficient can natural aeration and cooling through open spaces be?</h4><p>With human traffic in these buildings there will of course be a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon monoxide. We have to make sure the air we let out and the air we take in is good enough to sustain the plants, the environment, and the people within that space. We will combine natural ventilation with mechanical ventilation as well as populating open spaces with plenty of plants.</p><h4>Eko Atlantic will be a global city. What percentage of the inhabitants would you expect to be Nigerians and what percentage foreign companies or expats?</h4><p>Eko Atlantic is indeed an international city; therefore, there is no national segregation. It is open for business, it is a free trade zone, it is an economy within an economy, and it is open to Nigerians and expats. In Nigeria, we have an open policy to all parties compared to, say, Dubai, where there are strict legal delineations between foreigners and locals and what they can do and own in Dubai; that is not the case in Nigeria.</p><h4>This is a tough time for investments, considering the state of the global economy and low oil prices. Why is Eko Atlantic City a good investment considering the economic circumstances?</h4><p>There are three categories of investors, which include; hybrid investment, localized investment, and mediocrity investment. Every savvy investor knows that the best time to invest in an economy is when it is at its lowest point, because when the economy and the market eventually grows and booms, they stand to reap the greatest benefits.</p><h4>How will the pegging of the naira to the dollar or the yen affect investments?</h4><p>Every emerging economy is pegged to a stronger currency. In the past, we used the US dollar because our national trading commodity was petroleum, which is transacted globally in dollars. Irrespective of what the naira is pegged to, if Nigeria fulfills its ambitions of diversifying the economy, it will be for the better.</p><h4>How have you seen the role of women evolving in the Nigerian economy and society?</h4><p>We have had opportunities and some of them have been misused. Some women who were given the opportunity to showcase what we can do in the spheres of economics, politics, and governance have misused that opportunity and shot the cause of women in the foot. Recently we've had at least two female chairpersons, one at the First Bank of Nigeria and the other at the Access Bank Plc of Nigeria. It remains to be seen what their financial capabilities are in terms of governance in that sector. I hope women in power can help by being role models and improving self-confidence for younger women and those in less fortunate positions. There is a saying educate a woman and educate a nation. We as women can take this world to higher heights all we need is chance, determination, and focus.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will start the steel tower structures soon; 30 stories in all. In terms of the economy overall, it will be a tough year with many twists and turns, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The beauty about our Eko Atlantic project is that it is as cost-effective as possible. We have thought of innovative ways to ensure that we have the necessary financing for the project and that it is spread over a long period of time. The purchasing power of the naira has dropped, and people are much more careful about expenditure. Once we're out of the ground and people see what we have put on the table, the buyers will come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Selangor represents approximately a quarter of Malaysia's total GDP. What do you think are the key strengths of the state besides its infrastructure and educated population?</h4><p>We have been an economic powerhouse not just over the past five years, but also since the country's independence 50 years ago. We have extensive experience in dealing with foreign investors and supporting a broad range of industry players. Our output for all these years makes it clear that Selangor is indispensable to the country. We produce the highest number of skilled workers to support our industry, and we have world-class infrastructure that enables many businesses to grow. One of the 12 largest ports in the world is located here, as are the largest and second largest airports in the country. We have all the elements that make a state an economic powerhouse. Land prices are slightly higher than other states in Malaysia, but still modest compared to other countries in the region. We have high-quality manpower, experience, and expertise, but also low costs. Selangor is the center of the world. We are conventionally taught to understand that the world is divided into two parts—the East and the West. But looking from another perspective, turning the globe around and putting Europe to the extreme left and America to the extreme right, you will get a different picture. If you include demography, with 1.3 billion people in China, 1.3 billion people in India, 600 million in South Asia, 350 million in Bangladesh and Pakistan, 200 million in Korea and Japan, and about 400 million in the Middle East, there are a total of over 4 billion people that live within an eight-hour flight from KLIA Airport. The center of all of this is Malaysia, and Selangor is at the center of Malaysia. Selangor is the gateway to the larger region of Asia. Culturally as well, the people in Malaysia speak Chinese, Tamil, Bahasa, and English. You can find partners here to give you access to the markets of China, India, and Indonesia.</p><h4>What are some efforts from the state government side to push the economy forward?</h4><p>We are emphasizing strongly on aerospace, e-commerce, services, and biotechnology. Of our GDP, 59.5% comes from the services industry. Only 39.5% comes from industry. We have placed all our effort into the industry, and tend to forget about this larger part. We have set up three councils—the Selangor Information Technology and E-Commerce Council (SITEC), the Selangor Bio Council, and the Selangor Aerospace Council—where we create a mechanism to push the industries forward and create the right playing field. For example, under SITEC, we set up a digital center called the Selangor Digital Creative Center to train our SMEs to become e-commerce traders, and we provide co-working space to train startups in this industry. In e-commerce, training our people is key; we want our SMEs to market their products online. We also look to attract players and traders who come here to make it the e-commerce base of Asia. E-commerce has a lot to do with logistics; this is a sector where we can create value as the infrastructure is there. Under the Bio Council, we are developing Selangor Bio Bay, where we will create a complete ecosystem for biotech research. The complex will be on 1,000 acres of land, 500 acres of which will be allocated for biotech research, and we will invite other industries to come in for the other half.</p><h4>Selangor has a strong manufacturing industry for electronics, chemicals, and automobiles. What are your focuses to attract investment?</h4><p>We focus on the five clusters of: transport equipment, machinery, licenses, food and beverages, and electronics. Within the five, we place special focus on biotechnology and life sciences, including the medical equipment industry. Malaysia has seen rapid growth in the medical sector in terms of medical tourism and is shifting our manufacturing industry toward this purpose. In transport equipment, there is special attention placed on aerospace, again divided into five clusters: MRO, OEMs, engineering services, training, and aero parks. In the service industry, our vision is for Selangor to become a global trading hub and a financial and logistics center. We do not just have a vision but a specific strategy and plan in place to realize this potential.</p><h4>How are you preparing for the development of Selangor being the site of the new Asia Aerospace City (AAC) in Subang?</h4><p>We have world-class infrastructure, including the KL International Airport and the largest low-cost airport just next to it. This definitely helps us to grow the industry. Over 62% of the aerospace activities in Malaysia are located in Selangor, which is the reason why we recently set up the Selangor Aerospace Council, in addition to the efforts of the federal government. The AAC is an exciting initiative that brings together all aspects of the aerospace industry such as manufacturing, engineering, and R&amp;D. We work in close cooperation with the federal government to do our share. On our part, we look to offer our own vocational training program in the aerospace industry.</p><h4>How do you foresee the signing of the TPP affecting investment in the state?</h4><p>It opened up the market for us and we definitely have to match the competition; however, we have to catch up in in order to compete. Even though global markets become more accessible, we have to compete with countries more advanced than us. The TPP involves the US, a tremendously large market, but with a much higher level of technology, and this presents challenges, especially to our manufacturing industries. Things move fast, and we need to follow suit and be ahead of the competition. This is why we promote companies in biotechnology and aerospace to come in, enable the necessary infrastructure, and provide incentives to grow these industries. When we enhance our skills and meet global standards, the TPP will be extremely beneficial. In addition to that, we foresee many companies from other countries that are not signatories to the TPP coming to Selangor to invest and manufacture here and export to member nations, thus taking advantage of the agreement.</p><h4>How is the Eleventh Malaysia Plan affecting your agenda?</h4><p>We believe Selangor will achieve the ambitions of this plan three years before Malaysia. Our GDP and level of development are above the national average. As we are centrally located on peninsular Malaysia and we develop key elements of the infrastructure, our growth will have spillover effects on other regions and will create jobs around the country. Sustainability and inclusivity are key elements in our development strategy.</p><h4>What are your key objectives for the year ahead?</h4><p>The ultimate objective in Selangor is to grow our trading power and become a global trading hub. An important step in this direction is the making of Selangor as the Asian Business Center (ABC), and the launch of the annual Selangor International Expo. We would also like to build the Selangor World Trade Center. We are branding Selangor globally and reaching out to the world with our potential in aerospace and biotech. These industries are all about ingenuity and design, sectors where human capital can add serious value. These are exciting developments and we hope to see the fruits soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-rise-of-the-north]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the Tripoli Special Economic Zone (TSEZ) project get started?</h4><p>For a very long time, the northern part of Lebanon was marginalized from economic activity and investment. Indicators on poverty, economy, and development were always ranked lowest in the north of Lebanon. So, in 2007, the concept for the TSEZ started to be discussed in terms of how to foster economic momentum in Tripoli that would guarantee sustainable growth for that part of the country as a whole. By 2009 the entire legal framework was put in place but the decision to appoint a board of directors was delayed. We started the feasibility process with $1.5 million in funding from USAID and this was a comprehensive and complex study, yet relevant in shedding light on what we could do with the project. The feasibility study assessed three different locations for the TSEZ, as well as the market assessment, the demand forecasting, the development of the financial and operational models, the implementation plan, and the identification of the sectors. Finally, in 2015, the Council of Ministers appointed a board of directors, and we are now preparing to set the TSEZ in motion.</p><h4>What were the main advantages that Tripoli offered as a location for a SEZ?</h4><p>Tripoli is the second-largest city in Lebanon, with a lot of untapped human and natural resources. Its location lies right next to the Port of Tripoli, the second largest port in the country, which has recently undergone an expansion. Trading activity in Tripoli has increased significantly over the past few years, with more shipping companies choosing the port as their berthing point. Also, it is the getaway for the Levant to the Euro-Mediterranean economic zone, the entry port to Turkey, and it is the connection through Syria to the Arab hinterland, an area of opportunity we look forward to exploring once the situation there improves. Tripoli also has the Rachid Karami Trade Fair, a 1 million sqm plot of land sitting in the middle of Tripoli that has not been properly exploited yet. Tripoli is well placed in terms of transportation routes, capacity, and installations and offers an excellent platform for attracting investment into Lebanon.</p><h4>How has the TSEZ project brought the business community of Tripoli together?</h4><p>Across the political spectrum, everyone seems quite cognizant that the TSEZ is one of the most important projects taking place in Tripoli today. Regardless of what party you are from, the project is known to be crucial. Tripoli is in a dismal state due to the lack of a manufacturing industry, very little economic activity, and because the few economic sectors present there are not diversified. This project presents a rebirth for the region and the business community is quite aware of that; people realize the TSEZ has the potential to attract investment and start a new chapter for the north of Lebanon.</p><h4>Where will the funding for the TSEZ come from?</h4><p>Considering the very limited financial means of the government, I have had to resort to concessionary and grant financing for a lot of the activities we are doing, and also for technical assistance, since we do not have the in-house expertise to undertake such a large and complex endeavor. For the past year, I have been trying to promote the project and pitch it to the international community. The process has moved forward, and today we have the backing of the Secretary General of the UN and the President of the World Bank. We have received funding from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the World Bank, and the UNDP. Now, we are in the process of identifying niche markets for the TSEZ, the sectors it will attract, and the final stages for the regulations, as well as the safety and environmental regimes.</p><h4>How will the TSEZ differ from the Beirut Free Logistics Zone?</h4><p>The Beirut Free Logistics Zone is a pure free zone with a customs-free zone and some incentives for traders, importers, and exporters, but with no developmental implications. On the other hand, the TSEZ has been given the authority to set up its own procedures and provide a streamlined business environment. We will provide state-of-the-art infrastructure with all the utilities, amenities, IT, broadband, and transport infrastructure. What we will have here in Tripoli does not exist anywhere else in Lebanon at the moment, so it will greatly contribute to the country's development process. We want to bring much-needed employment and socioeconomic development through the TSEZ, not just for Tripoli but all of northern Lebanon.</p><h4>What will be the major benefits from TSEZ for the north of Lebanon?</h4><p>The transformation of Tripoli started with the revitalization of the port. Now there is an opportunity to have Tripoli play a role as a platform for logistics, warehousing, and redistribution activities. We want to supply value chains from here and that would require prepping the local economy, such as training the local workforce, fostering high-skilled labor, and opening up the market offering for companies here. Also, the Lebanese government is about to pass two decrees to regulate oil and gas exploration. This hopefully would pave the way for gas and oil exploration off the shore of Lebanon. TSEZ can become attractive for downstream and upstream oil and gas companies. Finally, there is the Syrian factor. The international community is preparing for the post-conflict period in Syria and Tripoli is the closet city to the border, so we want to make the TSEZ an incubator for the reconstruction process. The government, local community, and private sector have to rise to the challenge and help prepare the local economy to be up to standard to benefit from this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Scotiabank's recent acquisition of Citigroup's consumer and commercial banking operations in Costa Rica and Panama affect your own operations?</h4><p>The primary reason we went forward with the acquisition is because it is complimentary to our business considering the segments in which Scotiabank is growing and is often the market leader. In terms of personal banking, Scotiabank is primarily engaged in secured lending for mortgages and cars. By comparison, Citibank's operation was focused on credit cards, which is an unsecured business with higher margins. The businesses complimented each other and the acquisition created a more balanced sheet for Scotiabank. Our market share for credit card operations before was 4%, while now it is closer to 15%. We also acquired a significant amount of strong talent, so the organization's talent pool has grown in an important way, which is something that we are always looking for. Here in Costa Rica, around 80% of our lending is in US dollars and only 20% is in Costa Rican colón, which is not unusual in the private banking industry. The reverse ratio was occurring at Citibank because credit cards are largely used in the local market and thus most transactions take place in colón. Another advantage of the acquisition was also to reduce the weight of dollars on our balance sheet in Costa Rica. The acquisition also more than doubled our customer base with the 240,000 new customers that we gained.</p><h4>How is Scotiabank ensuring a smooth transition for previous clients of Citibank? </h4><p>Clients are at the center of what we do. We are taking our time and not rushing the transition process. We announced the acquisition in July 2015, waited for the regulatory approvals, and then we took control in February 2016. It may take anywhere between 28 and 36 months before we completely merge the entities. This length of time will allow us to build the infrastructure for the call centers and to support the credit cards. We have to build a new software platform because what we have at Scotiabank today is not robust enough to take over the significant volume we have gained from Citibank's operation. We also need to manage the ecosystem. We are doing everything in an organized and incremental manner. Scotiabank has done over 25 integrations over the last 15 years, so we have the experience to do this successfully for our clients. We want Scotiabank's existing customers to see improvements to the levels of service they receive, and we want our new customers to have a great experience with us through this process.</p><h4>What were some of the main challenges that Scotiabank had to face when entering Costa Rica over 20 years ago, and what opportunities did you foresee?</h4><p>We entered the market by purchasing a small bank that was focused on car lending, which was an industry we knew well. We currently have 110,000-115,000 personal clients, and about 1,000 commercial and corporate clients here. Our total portfolio amounts to about $1.5 billion in the retail segment and $750 million in the commercial segment. Our corporate clients include all of the large multinationals with operations in Costa Rica. The main challenge when we entered the market was to expand the value proportion of the bank. The challenge grew when the decision was taken to buy Banco Interfin; we were a small bank buying a big bank. The challenge was to integrate two cultures and systems into a third model, and we went through a rough ride between 2007 and 2009. It took us two years to transfer everything over, and it was a challenge to maintain our market share while going through such a significant transformation. The real opportunity was the market, as it was booming. Unfortunately there was a sudden drop in 2008-2009, which compounded the challenges of integration and expansion. The challenge for us today is to push the bank more into local currency lending. We have a high-quality portfolio, as risk management is one of our key strengths, and we are trying to focus on customers. Securing market share is an important game. However, we need to balance growing our market share with maintaining primary customers.</p><h4>What CSR initiatives does Scotiabank have in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Scotiabank is an organization that gives back to the societies in which it operates; therefore, we have a strong CSR focus. We focus primarily on youth, sports, and the environment. We do have huge global sports sponsorship arrangements, but our primary in sports focus is again on kids. We measure this not so much in terms of the amount of money the bank invests, but in terms of the time our staff invests. One of the CSR projects that we are proud of is the La Sabana Park Rehabilitation Project in San Jose. Costa Rica's primary airport was on this site many years ago, and after it closed eucalyptus trees were planted here, which are not native to Costa Rica. The eucalyptus trees were preventing other plants and bird life from thriving in the area. In 2008, we started a huge project supported by a variety of entities to cut down the eucalyptus trees and replace them with native trees. The birds are starting to come back as a result, and the aim is eventually to have La Sabana reflect the biodiversity of the country.</p><h4>What are your medium-term projections for Costa Rica's banking sector, and how does Scotiabank fit into this outlook?</h4><p>What has changed is the exit of other international players, namely HSBC and Citibank. This has opened the door to the arrival of strong Colombian groups. I would tier our banking system into four groups. The first group consists of state banks, which enjoy an unlimited government guarantee. The second tier would be of large private banks, which includes Scotiabank and two Colombian banks. There are also regional players, which are smaller entities than the two Colombian banks and ourselves, but they have operations all over the region. The fourth tier is comprised of the smallest banks that are just now coming into the market. They usually operate just in Costa Rica and maybe one or two other countries, but no more than that. Each of these four tiers offers a different value proposition. The task for us is to ensure that we leverage our position as the only international bank here. We also need to leverage our global network and knowhow while remaining relevant in all of the different market segments in which we operate. We are focusing the organization on the customer and on ensuring that we make it as easy as possible for customers to deal with us. This is our common framework, and it is part of maintaining our competitiveness in the market. Scotiabank has been making digital investments across the world, and this is a milestone moment for the group globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Panamanian Association of Insurers (Apadea), the sector is expected to experience a growth rate of 6% in 2016. Do you agree with this forecast?</h4><p>It is a little bit ambitious but yes, it will be a year of positive growth. We expect growth of around 3-4% for premiums. The main reason is that the world of reinsurance is entering a soft market and rates tend to go down. Any major project today will be much less expensive compared to the same project 10 years ago. If we only measure premiums, there will be low rates of growth; however, if we measure policies, which are a better gauge of the insurance industry, the rates of growth are higher. The number of policies has increased more than 9% compared to last year, but for premiums the rate of growth is around 3-4%.</p><h4>Which segments are growing the most?</h4><p>Usually, the auto segment is one of the strongest. Even though we are a small country, more than 50,000 new vehicles are sold every year, which is a large figure. In terms of the number of policies, auto is one of the main segments, followed by fire, life, and health. In terms of premiums, auto comprises 14% of the market and it is growing. Usually, the negatives are related to projects. Insurance companies are fighting for business. There are not many countries that are growing the way Panama is. Competition is really high on the reinsurance side.</p><h4>How high are the barriers to entry for foreign players, and what are the advantages of setting up here?</h4><p>Panama is easy to enter. If you want to compete in Latin America, Panama is the heart, not only geographically but also in terms of connection. There is no other country in Latin America with more connectivity than Panama. It is cheaper to set up here compared to Miami, Mexico, or even anywhere in Colombia; it is also safer and a nice place to live. It is cheaper to run operations from Panama, and if we modify the reinsurance laws number 63 and 19 of 1996, we can provide tax benefits and other perks, such as not limiting the number of employees companies can bring to Panama. We are not aiming to increase the number of players in itself; we are targeting increasing the level of quality of the reinsurance market. There are many reinsurance companies; however, we want the best ones here.</p><h4>How are you working to develop the industry?</h4><p>The more solid the Superintendency, the better the market and the safer the reinsurance companies are going to be. It has been a year of changes as we are trying to bring the Superintendency to international standards. We are active in all the meetings with regulators in the region, the Americas, and Europe. We are watching Solvency II, an EU directive that harmonizes EU insurance regulation. However, it is unlikely that this will be the answer for Panama, as it hasn't been the answer for Mexico. However, we have to work to bring the regulation to the same level as Europe or North America. On the consumer side, there is a lot to do. We do have good penetration in insurance; however, that is tied to the banking system, as it is mandatory to have fire and life insurance on a mortgage. In terms of life insurance, we are still behind Peru, Venezuela, Chile, and many other Latin American countries. We are also working to improve the quality of data we require from the market. We are going to separate premiums issued in Panama from those issued elsewhere; that will give us the true penetration rate. At the moment, it looks like Panama is the third Latin American country per capita on insurance penetration, but after next year we will have a better, clearer picture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons for acquiring Spanish banking group BBVA?</h4><p>The acquisition of BBVA complemented our offerings. Although BBVA was small in credit cards loans, it was well developed in auto loans and there was therefore synergy with our operations that allowed us to achieve approximately 23% of the market share. Similarly, they had a construction loan department, which we did not. Corporate and commercial loans were also important. In terms of personal loans and mortgages, BBVA had a great portfolio that complimented ours, although in mortgages we are a little more conservative than the main banks here in Panama. We finance 80% of the purchase of the sale price or the value of the property—whichever is lower. Other banks commonly finance as high as 90-95%. We want to grow our business, but sustainably; our strategy is to grow in every segment every year.</p><h4>How does the banking sector encourage home ownership in Panama?</h4><p>There are many opportunities to buy a house here in Panama because of the offers from the large number of banks operating here. There is a system called Preferential Interest in which the government subsidizes the interest for houses below $120,000 for the first 15 years, providing much-needed support to encourage home ownership. The banks that are involved have a reference rate in function of the top five to 10 average mortgage rates. </p><h4>What types of innovation is the bank introducing?</h4><p>We are the first bank here to provide a mobile application. People are using more electronic channels every day and we pay attention to this. We have to make lives simpler for our clients. Currently in Panama we have 40 full branches and two electronic branches that used to be banks but are now multifunctional self-service ATMs where customers can receive money, pay credit card bills, check their accounts online, and access our call center. We have 225 ATMs, which is a large number for Panama, and 35 multi-functional ATMs that can accept cash deposits. Multi-functional ATMs have been widely accepted here. Customers are getting older every day, but our new customers are younger and moving forward is the only way we will succeed. The reality is that the future will be electronic.</p><h4>How does the role of the Panama Banking Association differ from the ministry and superintendency?</h4><p>The Panama Banking Association was founded 53 years ago and represents 70 of the 91 banks established in Panama. The Panama Banking Association is a private, apolitical non-profit association and one of our main roles is to provide our associates with the necessary support to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering legislation. The Panama Banking Association also has an educational arm—the International Banking Institute—that offers courses to local and foreign banking employees and non-banking employees, and it is currently in the process of being converted into a university. </p><h4>Panama will join the list of OECD countries that share tax information as of 2018. What impact will this have?</h4><p>In his address to the UN in September 2015, President Varela said Panama is ready to do so, but in a bilateral way. It is willing to exchange information without pressures, and these matters have to be addressed at the UN and not by a group of countries, deciding that the UN was a forum made to discuss such matters. So Panama's position is to handle the issue on a bilateral basis depending on the geopolitical situation at a certain point, and follow the steps of our main commercial partners so that we can emulate what they are doing. The world is more transparent, but it is important that information is exchanged properly and is not misused. We have to be clear whom we give that information to and how that other party will use and save that information. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[welcome-to-the-city]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the pillars of the Plan of Action for the city, which was formulated based on recommendations from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)?</h4><p>Amongst other areas, we focus on mobility and waste disposal. We want to revitalize the central district of Panama City, since it is constantly growing and expanding horizontally. In the last four years, the center of the city has lost 50% of its population. We want to turn that around and attract people back to the center. The major challenge there is mobility. This is not only about moving cars; it is about moving people. We need to invest in sidewalks as much as wider roads or public transport options, for example. The metro is a fundamental part of this action plan, as are metrobuses and other new buses. We need an integrated transportation system that incorporates all of that: vehicles, public transport, pedestrians, and bicycles. Only with an integrated approach can we achieve our goals.</p><h4>How do you think the metro will affect congestion, and what other measures and initiatives could be taken to tackle that issue?</h4><p>Line One is complete and Line Two is under construction. Line Three is next. Those metro lines will play a huge part in alleviating congestion in Panama City. We will ultimately have five lines, which are envisioned to be completed by 2035 and will cover the entire city. It is a long term vision that will play a huge role in easing population density and the stress this has on public transport, business, and circulation. The next stage is to get people used to using the metro and public transport in general. We need to reduce the reliance on private transport and promote public transport as a viable alternative. We take Singapore as a model for what we are doing here. It has created a truly integrated and efficient system, incorporating public transport, roads, private vehicles, and also sidewalks and cycling options. Many areas that Line One of the metro passes through have been depopulated; therefore, we hope the metro passing through will help attract people back and make it an attractive place to live again. After all, it is more efficient, cost effective, and convenient for more people to live and work closer to the metro. The municipality wants to invest in public housing to help this along further.</p><h4>The government hopes to attract more firms to establish regional offices here. What makes Panama City an attractive place to live and do business?</h4><p>Panama is a country of immigrants, and almost all Panamanians have roots in another country, myself included. Panama is, therefore, an open society for foreigners. There are no legal inequalities that favor nationals over foreigners. All are treated equally, and that also includes businesses, investors, and companies. We have laws that encourage foreign investment and a free and open market in which to operate. In addition, culturally and socially, we have food and cultures from around the world, people of all of origins, great international connectivity with flights to and from many destinations, and a cosmopolitan feel to the country. There is a vibrant and strong Asian and Chinese community, for example. The Bolivarian dream of Panama becoming the capital of Latin America has never been as true as it is today.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve in 2016, and how much of the plan of action can be implemented in the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have a $350 million investment plan from 2016 to 2019. Half the projects within that investment plan began this year, such as the “walkability plan,“ which includes 5km of sidewalk, the laying of cables underground, renovation of the fish and meat markets, as well as new sports and cultural facilities. We see great potential to develop the tourism in the city and the country, especially with the expansion of the airport, which will reach an annual capacity of 20 million once completed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama has just been removed from the FATF's Grey List. How will this impact people's perceptions of Panama internationally?</h4><p>That has important ramifications. Since we were added to the list in 2014, the whole country came together, including the private sector and the government, to develop a strategy to get us off that list. Panama took the necessary steps, and this was finally achieved. Now we are in the process of consolidating that effort so that we will never end up on another similar list in the future. Being a small country, our potential is tied to our reputation so we need to protect that, as well as gain back all of the business that was lost or affected, especially with the correspondence banks for local banking institutions in the country. That is actually the main directive that Panama will take, and it is an effort not only by the government, but also the Banking Association of Panama and the Superintendency of Banks of Panama. We definitely have a new opportunity and we should not miss it. </p><h4>What are your plans for expansion?<br></h4><p>Panama still needs banking services around the country. Banco Nacional is in fact the only source for banking services in some places, which is of some concern for the government. We also need to evaluate whether we need to create more physical branches or expand via technological means. We are currently using both, because there are some sectors in rural areas that have neither. In order to introduce technology, we have to bring some physical capacity first and then start preparing people so that they can effectively use the services, which is an interesting process. The government currently runs different subsidy programs, but there is also an opportunity to teach people who receive those subsidies to save and invest, because these subsidies will not last forever. We have to teach our people to take advantage of that and to develop a different perspective, one through which they see a need to use the funds to advance and enhance their businesses and their lives and further integrate with the economic cycle. In that way, Banco Nacional wants to create new sources of economic development in certain areas that are currently stagnating through establishing new branches.</p><h4>How quickly are banks and customers adapting to new technology in Panama?</h4><p>They are adapting quickly. A large part of those subsidies are being delivered through electronic bank cards, which people have embraced. The next step will be to use mobile technology in the more remote areas. Panamanians embrace new technology and we want to leverage that to create a new way of seeing banking services in the future, because mobile phones will be the new branch for current accounts and services. This transition can be carried out within a short period of time. This will grant people fast access, and the ability to accomplish a lot of tasks that in the past they were not able to do within the current banking relationship.</p><h4>Panama saw a 16.9% increase in FDI in 2015. How will the banking sector continue to drive that growth?</h4><p>A lot of this increase represents reinvested earnings. There are currently around 97 or 98 banks currently in Panama, and approximately 46 or 47 of them have general licenses. Banks are discovering new ways to finance big projects, whereas in the past they only looked at external financing. Banks are now in a better position to get involved in things that we need, and that reflects part of the industry's growth. There is a great deal of competition as well as offerings, and people use banking services more. We are on a good path, and if more banks come they will face a great deal of competition, because the institutions here offer a wide range of services. It would be beneficial to come to Panama and shop for banking services, because we have everything.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the British Chamber in encouraging investment from the UK to Panama?</h4><p>The BCC started in 2012, growing out of what was a businessmen's lunch club into a full-fledged chamber. We have 137 members as of April 2016, and we have a variety of activities to support those members and businesses that want to invest in Panama. We work closely with the embassy and often conduct joint events, with the support of the ambassador and his team, which is especially important for a young chamber such as ours that is still building credibility and contacts. He also helps us lobby for members, attends our lunches, and invites speakers from the government.</p><h4>What makes Panama an attractive destination for UK firms?</h4><p>The UK is the third-largest foreign investor in Panama. Its perfect geographic position as a regional business hub offers advantages for new companies. Furthermore, there is an openness about Panama for foreign companies. That said, it is not as easy to do business here as it might at first seem; still, it is no harder than other countries in the region. There are many regional headquarters here from such UK companies as Bi-Water, GlaxoSmithKline, Diageo, JCB, Unilever, and London &amp; Regional. Panama has also always had a close relationship with the US, and that seems to rub off a bit on its attitude toward the UK. Panama is a land of opportunity; almost every conversation is a business opportunity. The economy is growing fast, though as a service-based country the sector still has room for improvement.</p><h4>What are some of the biggest obstacles that firms come across when entering Panama?</h4><p>Bureaucracy is always a major hurdle, and Panama is no exception. The BCC tries to ensure support from the embassy for its members. The Anglo-Saxon mentality of businessmen from the US or the UK can differ from the local business mentality; however, Panama is an interesting country in the sense that it is developed in certain aspects yet still has a scope for development in other aspects. That kind of hybrid nature can be challenging. The BCC seeks to help British businessmen and companies deal with all of these challenges. Investing in Panama is a long-term project; it is difficult to come here and get a quick win. That is something every investor needs to know. Investors need to be patient and committed.</p><h4>Do you also play a role in attracting investment from the UK to Panama?</h4><p>We have not done that much to date; however, we are seeking to do it too. We are also part of something called the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (COST), a multi-sector group made up of government representatives, private sector companies, and business associations. This is important for us, considering the negative image that Central and South America has in terms of transparency and fairness in tendering public offers. Another initiative started by the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce in which we take part is the Anti-Piracy and Anti-Contraband Commission. Considering that 70% of cigarettes smoked in Panama are contraband, the significance of the problem is undeniable. The BCC is involved because one of our members is British American Tobacco, and they have a lot of interest in fighting contraband. The same goes for alcohol and other products. We want to work more closely with other British chambers around the region, as well as the chambers of the US and other countries. We all have the same interests and have to work collaboratively. We will indeed seek to make more trade missions to attract more British companies to Panama and support more British investment in the country. With just one full-time employee, we are essentially all volunteers and there is a lot to achieve, but we are ready and willing. We have a great team here, with everybody bringing in their own specialized fields and areas of expertise to cover all angles for our members. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you satisfied with the progress that has been made on the major infrastructure development projects initiated by the Thai government?</h4><p>Our prime policy focus areas are aimed driving investment projects on Thailand's railways. Rail is not new in Thailand—it is 100 years old—but we never modernized our technology so that is now our priority. Bangkok currently has two mass-transit lines, but the aim of the government is to expand this to 10 lines in the coming years. All 10lines will be approved by the end of 2016 and we aim to commence with the construction of the pink, yellow, and orange lines in the second half of 2016.Our second major focus is the Intercity Rail system, where we will double our single rail track, one of the obstacles to our transport and logistics sectors flourishing. We have altogether six double track projects, mainly linking Bangkok to the north, the northeast, and the south of the country. Our third focus is the high-speed rail, which the government has approved and is currently working out with our Chinese counterparts. The original length of the track was 845km; however, it was later reduced to 250km. I cannot say I am satisfied with the Thailand-China deal because of a few delays we have had to deal with. But Thailand has a world-class reputation for doing business where we take each project through a feasibility, design, financing, and construction stage; therefore, I am convinced we will succeed in getting the job done.</p><h4>From the ministry's point of view, what have been the key milestones and trends in the aviation industry?</h4><p>For aviation, the major issue is delisting ourselves from the significant safety concern label, the SSC, which was issued to us due to safety concerns with aviation regulation. We hope to complete our recertification of airlines by November and thus request for a re-audit of our supervision and regulations of the airline industry at the end of 2016. Our goal is to improve our capacity on the human resources side because airlines in Thailand have been growing rapidly. Over the past 10 years or so, we have seen an evolution of the entire industry, particularly as low-cost airlines grow rapidly and bring not only foreigners to Thailand, but also crucially serve the domestic market at affordable prices, which is vital for our population. We see huge potential in the future of inter-regional travel throughout ASEAN and beyond. Thai Smile, for example, is becoming more active in connecting with regional cities, which opens up new, exciting markets and is affordable from the airlines point of view. Because of this rapid growth, we have to look at our facilities and ensure they can accommodate this surge. The government policy is clear to use three major airports as Thailand's capital city's airport, i.e. Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang Airport, and U-Taphao Airport. Primarily, we look into the expansion of Suvarnabhumi Airport by building a satellite terminal, a domestic terminal, and a third runway. We use Don Muang Airport as a domestic and low-cost terminal with the need for expansion further by renovating the third terminal. Our regional airports are also at full capacity so we need to expand. We promote more intercity flights that do not feature Bangkok to ease the congestion, such as Chiang Mai-KohSamui, Chiang Rai-Phuket, and so on.</p><h4>How willing has the government been to engage with the private sector for these infrastructure projects?</h4><p>We encourage our projects to be PPP in type and include several projects into the PPP committee. Investments by the private sector, not only for operating, but also construction, can often take time to become profitable with such large infrastructure projects, so it is crucial to identify the right partners and delegate tasks accordingly. This is the future, especially for governments like ours, which are committed to upgrading the entire transportation network. The government can invest in construction and the private sector can come into the operation and maintenance areas. This is not only for rail projects; for example, our highways are operated by the private sector and the concessions likewise go to them. We will extend our motorway between Bangkok and Chonburi to reach Pattaya and Map Taphud, which is a location for industry as well as a tourism destination. The other two motorways to be constructed this year are the northeast motorway from Bang Pa-in-Nakhon Ratchasima and to the west from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi. The government funds the construction and the private sector manages the operation and maintenance of the highway.</p><h4>With all these infrastructure projects in the pipeline, do you believe Thailand has the potential to be the logistics hub of ASEAN?</h4><p>Definitely. We planned for regional connectivity 20 years ago when we first built the road network connecting the country. To the south is Malaysia and the border checkpoint is extremely congested so we will open a new border checkpoint. Looking at Cambodia, we have the biggest checkpoint border, which is now congested. Passengers, vehicles, and trucks use the same road, so we will build a new border checkpoint just for trucks and other heavy vehicles. The existing one will be for tourists. We are building a second bridge to Myanmar, which will make it easy for trucks and cargo to cross the border. In the northeast we have three friendship bridges crossing the Mekong River. We try to reduce the cost of transportation by improving rail connectivity across the region. Thailand will be the logistic hub because our population of 67 million is huge in terms of its purchasing power compared to our neighbors. The main objective is integrating our own infrastructural development with the new Silk Road project that the Chinese are building. The reduced travel time and logistics cost mean they can bring the goods from China by rail to our sea ports, and from there branch out to other regions and continents.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect that 2016 will be a year of construction. In 2013 and 2014, we were engulfed by political issues and protests resulting in a slowdown in business. Once the new government came in, everything returned to normal and we are ramping up. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister want to see all the projects driven this year. At the same time we have to be extremely careful and transparent, particularly for large projects. It takes time to get projects approved and to run a tender process. Two major projects have started construction and we expect construction of the pink, yellow, and orange lines in Bangkok to start in the second half of 2016. Bangkok will be one large construction site in 2016. Our roads and highways have been damaged for many years so we need to reconstruct them. This will be a year of construction to link Thailand to ASEAN and the outside world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of PROINVEX?</h4><p>Our overarching mission is to sustain Panama's leadership in Central America in attracting FDI, namely to identify and promote investments in strategic sectors that are growing or will grow exponentially in our country. Some are evident, such as the array of services that will further grow as a result of the Panama Canal expansion project. There should be heavy investments in logistics, a doubling down on increasing Panama's capacity as a transshipment hub for the Americas, as well as attracting foreign investment in the diversifying logistics activities within the country, mainly value-added activities. This means moving beyond transshipment and looking into developing value-added logistics services, as well as increasing the country's capacity to attract and develop multi-model services going beyond 3PL into a 4PL full-service spectrum.</p><h4>What makes Panama an investment destination?</h4><p>Connectivity factors, along with a stable and dynamic, dollarized economy, strong democracy, competitive incentives regimes, investment protection laws, pro-business environment, free-market and open economic policies, and, of course, its ecological beauty and diversity, make Panama a prime investment destination. The numbers reflect this: Panama captures almost half of all FDI in Central America, and it is the only country in this region with an increasing number of investments. Between 2014 and 2015, FDI grew by about 17%, of which 50% was reinvestment. This means that not only are companies flocking to Panama, but that those that are already here are expanding, hiring, growing, and diversifying.</p><h4>What role will the financial sector play in attracting FDI?</h4><p>The financial center in Panama is huge, in the sense that the relation of its assets to Panama's GDP was 218% in 2014. Panama is a services-based economy and international finance will continue to be a pillar of growth, and the sector will also continue to be competitive, with a positive growth outlook in the short and medium term. The solidity of the financial sector is an important reason that all three main ratings agencies—Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings—have all ratified our country's investment grade. A safe and secure investment environment is a crucial determinant in a multinational's decision to invest in a country. Panama leads the region in this regard.</p><h4>Where will the government's efforts be focused in the medium term?</h4><p>The government has a strategic investment plan of $20 billion over a five-year period. That is $10 billion in social programs designed to increase the quality of life of Panamanians, create opportunities, and make Panama a sustainable place for investors, creating the conditions for Panamanians to be active participants in future developments of key strategic development sectors. Over 30% of public investments are in infrastructure development, which provides a large array of opportunities for international contractors to participate in large-scale public tenders. Panama is diversifying its electricity grid and there are similar projects that are $100 million and above. The development of those projects will further establish opportunities for investments in greenfield projects for alternative energy production. That is tied to Panama's development of its national electricity plan, which is designed to reduce the country's reliance on thermal energy—the idea is that over 70% of Panama's mix will come from renewables. </p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016? </h4><p>One of the key growth sectors is not just to establish regional HQs. Many multinationals are diversifying their operations, growing into global business services or consolidating regional operations in Panama and importing new business units. Panama is one of the leading countries in absorbing technology through FDI. We want to attract companies that train the local workforce in advanced and sophisticated processes and innovative management practices or vocational and technical activities. It is easy for foreigners to come and invest in Panama and train the local workforce, which is what makes our FDI-friendly policies sustainable in the long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main factors that allowed the government to reduce its fiscal debt in 2015?</h4><p>The fiscal deficit of the non-financial public sector (NFPS) in 2015 was 2% of GDP, while in 2014 it was 3.4%. In this reduction we can highlight four main factors. Total revenues grew by 3.9% while total expenses increased at a slower rate of just 2.5%. Capital expenditures represented 7.1% of GDP in 2015, and approximately 58% of public investment was financed via current savings. These figures all show how Panama has continued to progress in its fiscal consolidation. There is a combination of specific elements that led to an improved fiscal situation in 2015, specifically the prudent budget management of public spending together with the continued strengthening of the General Directorate of Income to continue achieving greater efficiency in its tax collection, which in 2015 exceeded the figures recorded in 2014 by approximately PAB47 million. Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch Ratings, the three major worldwide rating agencies, reiterated Panama's investment grade in 2015 with a stable outlook, highlighting macroeconomic and macro-tax prudence, moderate levels of public debt, and the positive outlook for economic performance in the years to come. By the close of 2015, we met the limit deficit required by the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The government defined a five-year investment plan of about $20 billion as part of its strategic plan, 64% of which is allocated to social investments. Thus, the major targets of the 2016 budget are focused on social matters such as education, basic sanitation, health, and transport, which together frame the social policy of this administration.</p><h4>What are some of the most important reforms needed to increase transparency in the banking sector?</h4><p>From January 2016, new rules limiting the use of bearer shares of Panamanian corporations came into force. With these new rules, companies that have issued bearer shares must give them to the custody of agents who are authorized and regulated by financial authorities. In compliance with the commitments to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), we passed Law 23 of April 27, 2015, which represented an important step to strengthening our financial and non-financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing, in compliance with the roadmap prepared by the Money Laundering Commission in order to take our nation off of the FATF's “grey list.“ Other new measures to prevent money laundering include increased due diligence procedures, a risk-based approach to identify, assess, monitor, manage, and mitigate the risks associated with money laundering, extended proceedings when there are unusual transactions or when there are doubts regarding the veracity and accuracy of customer identification data, and reports of cash transactions. In addition, as part of the implementation of monitoring and combating illicit activities, we have passed seven new laws that include new offenses and regulation of non-financial sectors and the incorporation of the Administration of Supervision and Regulation of Non-Financial Subjects, which is in full operation. In addition, Panama will join the list of OECD countries to automatically exchange tax information in 2018 and has accepted the automatic exchange of information on a bilateral basis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Panama's membership in the OAS has resulted in many significant contributions to the country's development in several areas including political, economic, and social, from the observation of nine electoral processes since 1972 to the support given by the OAS to the advancement of trade negotiations with other countries of the region. In 1977, the OAS was the host of one of the most significant events in the country's history when the governments of Panama and the US signed the treaties for the progressive transfer of sovereignty of the Panama Canal to the people of Panama, an event still remembered as an example of goodwill and cooperation between the two countries. It was no coincidence that the Organization of American States was selected as home and headquarters for the signing of those treaties. In recent decades, Panama has participated actively in the efforts promoted by the OAS. It has twice hosted the OAS General Assembly on two opportunities, in 1996 and 2007, and also played host to other high-level hemispheric meetings of the OAS that have shown the country's leadership in the region and positioned it as a valuable promoter of issues of the highest concern for the region.</p><p>Panamanians have actively participated in the scholarship programs offered by the OAS and in other training programs that range from port security to international law. Being a member of the OAS represents a unique value to a country like Panama in the context of globalization, where it is part of a community of nations that act together on issues of common interest and cooperate among themselves, regardless of their size or economic growth rates. Panama has also benefited from the participation of key stakeholders in their innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem in the Americas Competitiveness Exchange (ACE) on innovation and entrepreneurship and the Group of Experts of Subnational Competitiveness (GTECS) with the support of the OAS.  </p><p>In 2013, Panama hosted the VII Americas Competitiveness Forum (ACF), working closely with the OAS Technical Secretariat to share public policy experiences on infrastructure and innovation. Since then, projects like the expansion of the Panama Canal and the new metro of Panama, as well as programs aimed at promoting innovation, talent, and connectivity in Panama such as Infoplazas to facilitate Internet access, Pista to develop academics and young scientists, and the innovation and logistics center and the urban redevelopment of Curundú, are all part of the experiences shared by Panama through the Inter-American Competitiveness Network (RIAC). In Panama, the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States has also worked closely with AMPYME, the country's SME support institution, in order to organize training programs for the use of information and communication technologies as a means of improving the business management of micro and small businesses. These programs have placed an emphasis on women entrepreneurs, so that they can take advantage of expanded domestic and international markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Panama an important diplomatic, economic, and security partner for Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica and Panama maintain a strong and deep relationship of friendship and policy alignment. They are countries with solid institutions, which have abolished the military, put in place open economic models, and prioritized investment in society and sustainable human development. In this sense, Panama is a strategic partner for Costa Rica.</p><h4>Planning is underway for the construction of a new bridge over the Sixaola River. How will the project promote regional integration, and how will it impact trade?</h4><p>The construction of the new bridge over the Sixaola River will facilitate the development of binational and international tourism in the Caribbean region, particularly in the provinces of Limón and Bocas del Toro. The bridge will help establish a multi-destination tourism hub in that area, which Costa Rica and Panama will be able to promote jointly in international markets. In addition, it will allow for the strengthening of commercial relations between both countries through the establishment of modern infrastructure that will support commercial transportation between the Port of Colón in Panama and the new APM terminal in Puerto Limón, Costa Rica.</p><h4>How can Costa Rica and Panama leverage each other to promote tourism?</h4><p>Tourism between both countries is very important, and in this regard Costa Rica and Panama could consider taking practical and concrete measures. Among these possible measures would be the simplification of migration processes at land border crossings, the development of new installations and facilities at the main overland entry and exit points, and increasing the frequency of tourist buses crossing between the two countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, Panama and Aruba signed an MoU to boost cruise tourism. How do you assess its success, and what are some ways trade ties can be reinforced?</h4><p>The locations of Aruba and Panama make our partnership a proverbial win-win, as both destinations benefit from stimulating cruise tourism in the Southern Caribbean. Panama and Aruba have had a strong informal collaboration for many years, but in 2013 the Aruba Tourism Authority and the Chamber of Tourism of Panama signed an MoU to formalize our efforts to stimulate cruise tourism, especially during the summer months. Our respective Ministers of Tourism have been working steadily since 2013 to develop concrete steps to secure additional cruise business for our countries. In addition, these joint efforts have been expanded to include the country of Curaçao. The goal is to approach specific key cruise line partners as well as to collectively embark on potential product development efforts. I am very confident that such efforts will lead to success for all three countries in increasing cruise tourism. I believe it is important for countries in the region to no longer view one another simply as competitors, whether for tourists or foreign investment, but  rather to seek out ways we can work together so we all may benefit. Our MoU with Panama regarding cruise tourism is one inventive and promising way to do that, but we should find others. I think we can also strengthen our trade ties with Panama in the maritime and logistics sectors.</p><h4>What are the similarities between Panama and Aruba, and how can Panama learn from Aruba's experience in marketing itself to visitors?</h4><p>In terms of joint marketing to increase cruise tourism, what is more important for Panama and Aruba are the differences in our tourism and how we can complement one another in terms of what we offer to cruise tourists. Panama, of course, is a much larger country with a vibrant and modern metropolitan setting in Panama City. Panama also has mountains and jungles, as well as the Panama Canal Zone, one of the industrial wonders of the world.</p><h4>What makes Panama an important trade and investment partner for Aruba?</h4><p>Panama is a tremendous multifaceted trading hub, not only for the region but for the world. Aruba also has a strategic location in the Caribbean and is developing its potential with a new state-of-the-art Multi Cargo Sea Terminal that will open in 2016. There is great potential for Aruba and Panama to collaborate and to develop business opportunities in the maritime and logistics sector. And Aruba, as part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, offers a unique opening to Europe right here in the Caribbean. In April 2015, after attending the Summit of the Americas in Panama, I led a Trade Mission Delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that hosted a conference and participated in a trade show in Panama, both focused on the maritime industry. In addition, the Kingdom sponsored a matchmaking session where companies from the Kingdom could explore business opportunities with Panamanian companies. The Kingdom was represented in Panama by 30 companies from the maritime sector alone, which were seeking to do business with Panamanian and other companies. This strong showing of interest of the private sector in the Kingdom, makes clear that Panama is a very important trade and investment partner for Aruba and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are some of the ways in which the two countries can cooperate, and what do you envisage for the future of bilateral relations between the two nations?</h4><p>I believe the future of bilateral relations between Aruba and Panama is a bright one with tremendous potential as our countries cooperate on promoting cruise tourism and seeking business partnerships in the maritime and logistics sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama's GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in 2016 according to the World Bank, making it the most dynamic economy in the region. What is driving this growth?</h4><p>Global economics are challenging now due to factors like the price of oil, the financial crisis, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the declining acquisition power of many countries that do not use the dollar. We are concentrated on the local region of Central American, the Caribbean, and parts of South America, which for many years have been the primary market for Panama's exports. Most countries in the region are still emerging economies. Latin America has been the emerging market of primary interest over last few years. Consumption has decreased dramatically in the submerging markets of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. In the context of trends in some regional economies, our roughly 6% growth in 2015 gives us great confidence.</p><h4>The CCIAP highlighted the 60% cumulative increase in the minimum wage in Panama between 2007 and 2015. What impact has this had?</h4><p>Our law stipulates that the minimum wage be revised every two years. The past administration took populist measures to gain popularity among voters. The law states that the private sector must meet with labor unions to collectively negotiate changes in the minimum wage. If they cannot agree on a revision, the elected government is to arbitrate a decision. Purchasing power has decreased as a result of a rise in consumer prices. The government increased the minimum salary by 15% in 2009, 2011, and again in 2013. These measures exacerbated the problem by driving up the cost of labor and production. The combined external and internal inflation reached a level of 4.5-5% across a period of two to three years. That created a lot of instability in the market, but inflation is now down to low levels, at a less than 1%. </p><h4>What contribution does the construction sector make to growth?</h4><p>Growth in the construction sector will be high in the next few years. The sector grew impressively during the past three or four years due to the expansion of the Panama Canal, but now construction investments are moving toward other infrastructure initiatives. From 2014 to 2015, construction growth overextended to 14%, but it is now plateauing and returned to around 7% this year. Contributions from the sector totaled $2.5 billion in 1H2015, so it still growing. We are building a second line of the metro, a $2 billion project that will span nearly 44 years, as well as renovating Colón City, a $600 million project. We are also bidding on a third metro line, which could reach a total value as high as $2.4 billion. We are bidding on another major infrastructure project to build a fourth bridge across the canal. Two or three projects can have a lasting impact on economic growth and job creation. There is another investment opportunity to develop a project in water, wastewater, and human sanitation</p><h4>Several FTAs have been signed in the past year. Which industries will benefit most from an increase in trade with partner nations, and how will potential negatives be mitigated?</h4><p>The most complex FTA is the agreement with the US, under which import tariffs decrease gradually over the next 20 years. This will increase the global competitiveness of local sectors by allowing them to modernize. One of the benefits of FTAs is the access to global markets they provide to local companies across sectors. We can use these FTAs to take advantage of opportunities in industry, technology, and agriculture. Panama has a sizable trade deficit. We spend about $980 million on Mexican imports, while we export only $20 million to Mexico. Our imports from Peru exceed our exports by about $600 million. We really have to make an effort in certain sectors to be able to export products to different countries around the region, and FTAs help facilitate this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama and Chile have a history of strong bilateral relations. What makes Panama an importance economic, security, and political partner for Chile?</h4><p>Panama is the main logistics hub in Latin America, making it, without a doubt, an important engine for global trade. In this context, Chile is the top Latin American user of the Panama Canal and third overall, turning Panama into a key player for the growth and development of Chile's foreign trade. Since the expansion of the Canal was announced, Chile has closely followed its development, as it represents the possibility to further increase our trade with the rest of the world, particularly regarding gas imports from the US and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, which will be able to circulate through the new locks. In addition, Panama also aspires to become the hub for disaster relief aid throughout the region, an issue of great interest to Chile.</p><h4>Chile is the first country in South America with which Panama signed an FTA. How did this reinforce trade and investment links and which goods are particularly important?</h4><p>The economic and trade relations between Chile and Panama are governed by the FTA, in force since March 7, 2008. The FTA establishes a regulatory framework that includes disciplines such as market access for goods (rules of origin, customs procedures, technical standards, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards), trade in services, investment, transparency, and dispute settlement. All these disciplines ensure the best conditions for trade in goods and services between Chile and Panama. Since the entry into force of the FTA, exports have grown at an average annual rate of 4.1%. During 2015, Chile exported to Panama a total of $176 million and imports from Panama in 2015 were $82 million, an increase of 9.3% in relation to 2014.<br>There is an increased presence of Chilean products in the Panamanian market, including salmon (five-fold increase), machinery and metal products and equipment (four-fold), and processed foods and wine, which have doubled their exports. Moreover, there are growth opportunities for trade in services, as 80% of Panama's economy is linked to this sector.<br>Regarding investment, Panama is the 10th destination in the world for direct investment of Chilean capital. The accumulated direct investment in that country amounts to $813 million, representing 0.8% of the total invested abroad, and it ranks as the largest recipient in the region of Central America, with over 20 Chilean companies. Chilean investment is mainly concentrated in services, focusing on finance, transportation, retail, computer services, and construction.</p><h4>How can the two countries increase their cooperation in other fields such as tourism and education?</h4><p>The government of Chile assigns a special priority to strengthening our relations with Latin American countries. Since 2014, we have focused on promoting an ambitious agenda in Central American countries based on not only the administration of FTAs, but also on the three additional pillars of the modernization of these trade agreements, development cooperation, and investment promotion. In the area of development cooperation, Chile is carrying out some South-South, as well as triangular cooperation projects in the region. In February 2016, we presented a cooperation project entitled “Strengthening the institutions responsible for trade policies of the Central American countries" to the EU. This project aims to contribute to strengthening the Central American region as an economic group and help in their integration with international trade. We hope to continue incorporating similar initiatives in other areas such as education, security, and tourism, among others. In addition, we welcome the interest of Panama in the Pacific Alliance and hope that we will continue to strengthen relations in the area of regional integration through closer cooperation on areas such as education, tourism, transportation, and promoting SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>Despite their name, the Panama Papers are not mainly about Panama. They are not even primarily concerned with Panamanian companies. The more than 11 million documents, illegally hacked and relating to previously undisclosed “offshore" corporations, are roiling the world with revelations of the vulnerability for rampant abuse of legal financial structures by the wealthy.</p><p>They are unfairly called the Panama Papers because this particular trove of documents came from a single law firm based in Panama; however, the problem of tax evasion is a global one.</p><p>Panama does not deserve to be singled out on an issue that plagues many countries. But we are willing to accept the responsibility for fixing it, in part because greater transparency is ultimately a continuation of reforms we have recently undertaken. The world must tackle this problem collectively and with urgency, and Panama stands ready to lead the way.</p><p>The scope of the information is breathtaking, with the files including information on more than 14,000 banks, law firms, corporate incorporators, and other middlemen from more than 100 countries, which is just a small part of a worldwide industry that harbors trillions of dollars. That some can rig the system to hide their wealth is not merely unjust, it also harms global development by siphoning off revenues that could be directed to education, healthcare, and infrastructure.</p><p>Contrary to media reports, Panama does not make special allowances for “offshore" structures. The association of Panama with offshore activities comes from the fact that we tax only income derived from within Panama, not from without, which remains taxable pursuant to the laws of relevant jurisdictions. These rules, based on laws in New York and Delaware, originated in 1927 and are common today. While these laws have been buttressed by additional regulations, they can still be manipulated for illicit purposes.</p><p>Under previous governments, Panama was no doubt a target of money launderers. Today, Panama is committed to adopting all transparency reforms needed to satisfy the international community. In the 21 months of my administration, Panama has taken steps to increase transparency and strengthen our financial legal systems. We developed a robust treaty network that allows for the exchange of information. “Know your client" regulations were substantially enhanced and extended not only for financial and corporate providers, but also for key nonfinancial industries vulnerable to abuse. And as of January 2016, we require identity certification of shareholders of all Panamanian companies.</p><p>I have announced a commitment to the automatic exchange of financial and corporate information, and we have proposed steps that we believe are consistent with the goals of the international community, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) through its Common Reporting Standards proposal. These reforms have been recognized and validated by the international community, including the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, which cited Panama's “significant progress" in combating money laundering when it removed us this year from its gray list. Removal from that list occurred in record time.</p><p>Still, more work is needed. I have announced that Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs will create an independent committee of international experts to evaluate our policies, determine best practices, and propose measures that will be shared with other countries to strengthen global financial and legal transparency. We expect their findings within six months. Panama will continue to cooperate with other jurisdictions to prosecute offenses outlawed in our Criminal Code, and we will continue to exchange financial and legal information to comply with the many treaties we have ratified. We also reiterate our willingness to engage in dialogue with the OECD and its Global Forum with respect to reaching financial transparency agreements that can further the economic development of our countries.</p><p>After decades of dictatorship, Panama is a stable democracy committed to the rule of law and is home to the regional headquarters of more than 100 transnational companies. To fulfill our democratic evolution, we must have a government committed to transparency, accountability, and the separation of powers. Our response to the current crisis will test our resolve and our potential. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently Thailand struck a deal with Bangladesh to set up a shipping line to and from Ranong Port. What will the shipping line between Bangladesh and Thailand mean for the Port Authority of Thailand (PAT)?</h4><p>The cooperation was initiated between the Port Authority of Thailand and the Embassy of Bangladesh. We have just started working together and discussing how we are going to decrease the transportation costs. We have sent our staff to inspect the Ranong area to see how feasible the project is. In the near future, we will send persons to observe the Bangladeshi side as well. Typically, cargo or shipments from Cambodia or China have to pass through Singapore to get to Bangladesh; therefore, we are trying to have a shortcut that goes through Thailand instead; it is cheaper and faster. However, it is under study because there are many items we need to look at. We should approve everything before we can say if this proposed route will definitely cut costs, although at this stage everything suggests that it will.</p><h4>Laem Chabang is boosting the capacity to 18 million TEUs per year. What is the strategy behind that?</h4><p>Normally, we have 80% from the ports of Thailand exported from Laem Chabang, which is growing every year. We expect that in the next six to seven years, our capacity will almost hit the maximum; therefore, we have to plan ahead to build the market. Our plan for Phase III of the development is to serve larger vessel, which requires a deep-water port. Therefore, with this development we have to think big. An upgrade to Bangkok Port is also under planning in a bid to upgrade all of the facilities and services offered by PAT. Improving IT systems and security, likewise, plays a big role in our development plans as it increases efficiency, which is crucial in this business. In each of these stages, we will try to include the private sector for investments, not only to raise funds but also because private-sector investments also encourage greater efficiency in any redevelopment.</p><h4>To what extent will the AEC help boost demand?</h4><p>For now, we have just begun the AEC; therefore, it is a little difficult to forecast now what is right or wrong. However, as a government policy, we have to explore ways to become more engaging with the neighboring economies. One thing that the AEC will definitely help spur on is better connectivity through our collective transportation systems. At this early stage all that we can do is monitor policies introduced by each of the governments and asses how they will contribute to better integration and more opportunities. In Thailand, the government is trying to adjust its policies to support business interests along the country's borders. If we fail to account for these regions, they will become neglected by investors. The ports need to look at how to serve the investors in all areas to reduce their costs in transportation. Now, we are studying how the Port Authority of Thailand will help investors cut their costs or to start a new business in the five special economic zones, which have been set-up by the government. In this regard, we have to ensure that we are accessible, efficient, and affordable.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We should have a growth of about 5% in exports in 2016 but, in the worst case, maybe about 4%. Frankly speaking, the export volumes have not decreased, but the total revenues of our exports are down. Looking forward, we hope that these factors will help Thailand become a major hub for logistics in the region. If we think of the hubs in the maritime sector, we cannot exactly compete with the likes of Singapore or Hong Kong because of our location. For example,we don't have the shorter routes of marine transport. However, we can certainly aspire to be a hub amongst the integrated ASEAN markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of IHS Nigeria and what its major milestones have been over the years?</h4><p>IHS started 15 years ago when the Nigerian telecommunications sector was privatized in 2001. We started by building telecommunications sites for operators and essentially stimulated the initial growth spurt of the telecommunications sector, which has become one of the largest contributors to the Nigerian economy. We are a B2B company with our clients including various mobile operators, internet provides, and private companies. In 2008, we undertook a strategic shift and decided to focus on infrastructure sharing and the leasing of telecommunications towers while continuing to build sites when necessary. Sites that were previously owned by operators now belong to us, an independent company, which has allowed for these tower assets to be shared between operators. So instead of multiple operators spending more money and resources to build their own infrastructure, we enable these shared sites to provide coverage for all of their networks. This naturally saves money on equipment, infrastructure, utilities, raw materials, and other expenditures, all of which eventually translates into cheaper rates for end users, and less repatriation of hard currencies from the countries we operate in. The operators can then focus on doing what they do best, which is to sell lines, sell data, and attend to their customers. We subsequently expanded into Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire, followed by Rwanda and Zambia. We also acquired the portfolios of MTN and Etisalat in Nigeria, and in March 2016 we acquired Helios Towers Nigeria's portfolio, one of Nigeria's first independent tower operators. Presently we have approximately 16,000 towers that we manage in Nigeria, out of our portfolio of over 23,300 towers in Africa. We are considered the tenth largest tower company in the world. We provide jobs to more than 40,000 people across the five countries in which we operate, who are either directly employed by IHS or through our partners and suppliers. </p><h4>As a major telecommunications firm with significant energy needs, what do you think can be done to address the lack of power across the continent and what measures are you taking specifically in this respect as IHS Nigeria?</h4><p>Some statistics say around 600 million people in Africa do not have access to electricity. Other statistics say that the populations of only seven Sub-Saharan African countries have more than 50% access to electricity. In Nigeria, the frequent power outages and shortages lead to a loss in annual sales revenue of more than 10-15% for manufacturing firms. IHS Towers is a huge user of power, consuming more than 200 million liters of diesel per year, which is why we are so interested in renewable energy. Of course, this takes long-term planning and investment. Our business demands a complex, well-functioning supply chain and we must work to ensure the government is 100% behind us and our investments. We have invested more than half a billion dollars in upgrading our network in Nigeria to be powered by renewable energy systems; that is the direction we are taking. Similar projects are underway in other countries across the continent. For instance, we're keen to build a solar farm in Rwanda and, in Zambia, we hope our portfolio will eventually become almost diesel neutral in the near future. That's the vision, and that's the dream, but it's a viable dream.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for the telecommunications sector and operators in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is nowhere near saturation, but many challenges remain. The operators face two major issues: coverage and capacity. The current focus is on expanding coverage to include rural areas, which is a challenge as these areas are not always a commercial priority. Our job is to make those places accessible and to design solutions for operators to expand to those areas. We rely on the government for assistance, and it is active and helpful in that sense, inviting operators to expand to these areas. Congestion is another problem. But, that can be solved via expansion and more towers across other parts of the country. Other challenges include a lack of access to market-leading equipment and technologies. Moving to 4G will provide better value and better quality in the sector overall. Nigeria needs 20,000 to 30,000 more towers for the network to be at the level it should be, which is mostly just for voice. Data is an underserved and underdeveloped part of the sector, with a penetration rate of just 10-20% for all of Nigeria. There is still a lot to be done.</p><h4>What can IHS do to reduce noise and pollution created by the towers and their effects on surrounding communities?</h4><p>It's important to realise that our tower-sharing business model fundamentally seeks to reduce noise, carbon emissions, and pollution by enabling mobile network operators to share tower sites and power sources. In other words, where there were previously three or four towers in one area, all generating noise and pollution, with our sharing model you now have one single tower, one site, and one generator. However, the regulators are tough on us and we have to abide by their stringent standards. For every single site, we bring in their consultants, who study and audit the surroundings as well as our site to ensure that we comply with all regulations. If we don't comply, we simply do not get the permit. As new renewable technologies such as solar and DC generators come into play, our operations become quieter and quieter. Our aim is to eventually use zero diesel, and that will do a lot to improve the noise our sites produce, making our operations even more environmentally friendly.</p><h4>The National Assembly is considering passing the Communications Service Tax Bill into law. How would that bill affect IHS and the end user?</h4><p>The Communications Service Tax Bill will affect the whole telecoms sector, but of course it is just one of many taxes that are affecting the supply chain as well as our operations. There are federal taxes, state taxes, local taxes, and other agencies, so the sector is already heavily taxed. In terms of the Communications Service Tax Bill, it is not yet clear as to who will bear the burden of the new tax because the operators will charge the subscribers and then it will go to the government. In our opinion it's not charging taxes that will bring the best outcome; it's re-consigning, consolidating, standardizing, and regulating that will make the sector stronger, healthier, and more profitable for all in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major global trends will the UAE take into consideration in the upcoming years?</h4><p>We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. The World Economic Forum, which I attended in Davos, Switzerland, discussed these issues at the start of the year and this is something we must keep abreast of as a nation. The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent and the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance. The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. These possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, energy storage, and quantum computing. In the future, technological innovation will also lead to a supply-side miracle, with long-term gains in efficiency and productivity. Transportation and communication costs will drop, logistics and global supply chains will become more efficient, and the cost of trade will diminish, all of which will open new markets and drive economic growth. Another major trend is the government's focus on diversifying the economy as a means to embrace a future beyond oil. With oil prices at low levels globally, this strategy is being pursued with vigour by our leadership for the benefit of future generations. In our own sector, DP World recently highlighted five key ICT innovations for ports and logistics firms in a report; robotics and automation, simulation and virtual reality, big data analytics, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity.</p><h4>Now that the UAE has become one of the region's leading innovation hubs, what comes next?</h4><p>Innovation is a continuous process and we must continue to support new practices and technologies to maintain and increase our reputation for excellence. It is not a question of what comes next, it's about aspiring to world-class standards and performance and increasing efficiencies through innovation for this generation and those that come after us. That ingrained culture and mindset is what will differentiate us from the rest of the world in the years to come.</p><h4>What opportunities does the new PPP law, which came into force in November 2015, offer for both the public and private sectors?</h4><p>The opportunities to develop economies through partnerships enable private-sector expertise to be added to government programs for the wider benefit, particularly in infrastructure and construction. It gives government entities the freedom to define appropriate tender processes outside the constraints of existing tender laws that are not appropriate for PPPs and is a positive step forward for the development of a PPP market in Dubai. Government entities have more freedom and flexibility to specify tender and contract conditions on a case-by-case basis. The overriding award criteria is the “most financially and technically advantageous bid," with discretion to specify details. This is another example of our leadership amending regulations to suit the future needs of Dubai and providing more freedom for business to operate.</p><h4>What role can the UAE play in the “One Belt, One Road" initiative?</h4><p>As an enabler of global trade, DP World is always interested in opportunities that come our way. We are already helping Kazakhstan develop the Khorgos Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Inland Container Depot (ICD), as well as the Port of Aktau on the Caspian Sea. These infrastructure projects will help develop the “One Belt, One Road" concept, linking China to European markets through Asia. Today, goods from China take an average of 42 days to reach Europe by sea. With the new logistics and transport infrastructure in Kazakhstan, this is reduced to an average of 13 days. Elsewhere, DP World and our partners are investing $1.9 billion in China port terminals until 2020 and we already operate three ports there in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yantai. We also recently signed an agreement with our partners in Qingdao to exchange information and grow business between our ports. In building a global portfolio of more than 77 marine and inland terminals, we have established long-standing relationships with customers, many of whom are looking to the New Silk Road as new areas of opportunity. The experience gained from our Jebel Ali port with its free zone and our other terminals around the world will fuel the development of the New Silk Road at a remarkable pace.</p><h4>DP World has already invested $1.2 billion in India and is the only foreign operator with six port concessions in the country and an approximate 30% market share. Following DP World's announcement that it will invest a further $1 billion over the next few years, what will this investment cover?</h4><p>This will cover expansion in brownfield container terminals, long-term greenfield container concessions, inland container depots (ICDs), and the expansion of existing inter-modal rail services for rolling stock. We already employ 3,000 people at our terminals in India and they are locally recruited and trained. As a market leader in Indian container terminal operations we have the largest portfolio of investments in ports along the Indian coastline, including Gujarat (Mundra, 2003), Maharashtra (Nhava Sheva, 1999 and 2012), Kerala (Cochin, 2005), Tamil Nadu (Chennai, 2001), and Andhra Pradesh (Vishakapatnam, 2002). We have also created rail connections to the hinterlands and have a national rail license from the government to operate seven container trains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the sector evolved over the last few years and what role has Real Plaza played in the sector?</h4><p>The retail sector has been growing at a greater rate than the overall economy. We have been active in going to different regions in Peru outside of Lima. The first shopping mall we opened outside of Lima was in Chiclayo. We have worked in cities of 200,000 people or more, such as Trujillo, Arequipa, and even cities where there was no formal retail at all. The question there was how people would buy and use modern retail when they had been used to just going to traditional markets. We perceived a latent demand there, and we decided it was a good move. We did not just start with a big shopping mall in Juliaca (Puno Region), but rather we did it in phases. We had a complete master plan and grew through a process, which has proved successful. We started with supermarkets and have added entertainment, fashion, and other phases as demand develops and business grows. We were the first to sell cappuccinos in the region when we opened a Starbucks in Huancayo. People were open to it, they responded to it, and it all worked out well. It is younger consumers who responded best to the changes that we brought.</p><h4>What sort of innovations are you bringing to the sector with the high standard of shopping malls that you are introducing throughout Peru?</h4><p>We have introduced the first escalators in some cities. We brought cappuccinos and Starbucks to places that never before had that. We have modern malls offering modern experiences to people who were only used to shopping in traditional markets. Automation, tellers, and technologies—all of these come with our shopping malls. Therefore, there is a great deal of innovation touching these people's everyday lives throughout the country. In Huancayo in the Central Andes, there are many people and a lot of traffic; however, it is still an undeveloped place. We opened a mall and a supermarket there, and there were huge lines of people trying to get in. The supermarket did great, but we then saw some decline, which we thought was normal. However, a study that we conducted through our marketing and research department showed that the standard throughout the city had changed, as had the standard in the traditional market. The old market was cleaner, more organized, and generally better; therefore, our entry changed standards throughout the city. In line with that, people started demanding better services as well. We have had a positive effect on these places, and people now expect international standards in their daily lives; we are proud to be a part of this change.</p><h4>What would you say are Peru's advantages to international investors looking to invest in the retail sector?</h4><p>Peru has been growing by leaps and bounds over the last 10 years. Few countries have grown as rapidly as Peru; therefore, it is an ideal place to invest. The country is huge, the population is large, and the potential is massive. We are in constant contact with all of our malls and with our partners and clients around the world. We are members of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), which has a major network and holds seminars around the world. We organize events and we bring brands here to let them see the potential that there is in Peru. We are not so interested in luxury brands, but rather in more horizontal brands. We pick our brands carefully, and we target brands that can grow with us around the country.</p><h4>What is your strategy for expansion and growth in Peru?</h4><p>We work fast and we go to regions where there is potential to grow or where there is demand for a modern shopping experience as well as modern entertainment, modern cinemas, and so on. We are present in 12 cities outside of Lima, and we were the first shopping mall in 10 of them. We have been proactive and aggressive in that sense, and we have been ready to take risks when and where we believed we would be successful, which is a strategy that has worked well for us. Lima, of course, is a much more difficult market to penetrate, with more competition, more players, expensive real estate, and a generally saturated market. Shopping malls require a lot of space, which is hard to find in Lima; therefore, we focused instead on the other regions, and we are looking to consolidate and then expand these malls.</p><h4>Shopping malls have generated 32,000 new jobs in Peru and changed retail and shopping habits throughout the country. How has Real Plaza contributed in this sense?</h4><p>When we open a shopping mall we usually create about 2,500-3,000 new jobs, which counts only the stores and does not take into consideration the mall staff. This is usually how many people work in a shopping mall; it like a small town, meaning the contribution is huge. Our presence in the regions of Peru tends to formalize the market. Everyone who was working in the informal economy is brought into the formal economy, and they are treated and paid well, which also translates into more taxes for the country. Hence, the impact has been positive in this sense. Those people who work there get a better standard of living, their children go to better schools, and they eat and live better.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Infrastructure is a priority for the government as a means of economic development. How is Dantata taking advantage of the opportunities in this sector?</h4><p>We bid for lots of the projects, which in most cases is the federal or state government. The opportunities are there and you can see it from the number of projects that are offered for tender and the number of projects that are on going. We take as much opportunity in this sector by going for the jobs especially in the locations where we already have a base. We also push for more opportunities in this sector by expanding into other places that have a promising future for construction. Some of the opportunities we took and are still working on include the Outer Northern Expressway (ONEX), which takes people from the North to Abuja, and the Abuja-Abaji road from the south to Abuja via Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport. We are hoping to finish both by the end of 2016 if the budget permits. We are also keen to have the Western bypass in Kano, and the Kano-Shuari on Maiduguri road, which are critical road projects, especially for the northeastern part of the country. These should rollover to next year before we complete them pending on the budget. More opportunities in this sector that we are gladly taking are projects like Dangote fertilizer plant in Lagos, Bayelsa airport in Bayelsa, Auchi-Benin road in Edo state, Gidan Jaja—Kaura namoda in Zamfara, Okpella Plant Bua in Edo state, Greenville LNG in Rivers State, Guzape district in Abuja, Kaduna township roads in Kaduna, and more.</p><h4>How do you deal with the logistics challenges that come with your operations in Nigeria?</h4><p>We have a department that controls and oversees everything we do. Our organogram defines each department and its reporting formula to the head office. This makes the work efficient. In logistics, we have a transport section, imports section, and purchase department that handles the movement of goods from purchase to the final point of delivery. One of the challenges in Nigeria is you have to do almost everything yourself, as you cannot rely on other companies to do things, such as logistics, for you. In other countries you do not have to worry about doing logistics yourself, as there are lots of competent companies you can rely on. However, this sector is an opportunity that is waiting for someone to provide a top-quality service and many will be willing to outsource.</p><h4>How have you incorporated youth and modernity into the company since you became executive vice chairman?</h4><p>I have encouraged greater professionalism in every sector. I always try to be sure that the traditional concept of who you know is no longer the means of promotion or employment. If a person is capable and can deliver then we have to be sure we give that person the opportunity to actualize his or her values. In areas that are not our core business areas I make it possible for outsourcing, and focusing on our primary business and business related areas so that we can do it much better. At the same time that even creates opportunities for other businesses to be actualized. This means more growth in our economy and employment. We also recently started taking opportunities in the South, such as in Bayelsa, Edo, and Lagos state. We are also looking beyond Nigeria to other African countries. While doing the physical presence expansions, and widening the business while focusing on the core, we introduce computerized systems into the business. This will continue to help us to become more efficient and cost effective.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourself from your competitors?</h4><p>We stand out through quality and efficiency. Those are our main attributes. A road built by us is a road that is safe and durable. We never compromise our quality and we try as much as possible to deliver projects in a timely fashion. However, funding is a typical issue. When there is less money in the economy or the budget then our performance typically slows down to match the client's financial wishes. This might slow down a project to a client's capability at the time. However, throughout, we maintain our quality to the fullest.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the rest of 2016?</h4><p>We are expecting a great year for 2016. The adjustments from the new administration have created many opportunities for Nigeria. The fact that imports are expensive means production has to increase in the country, which creates wealth and jobs and improves purchasing power, reduces crime, and improves security. All these are correlated as one feeds the other. We are still expecting the federal budget, which is expected to be over NGN6 trillion. If this kind of money is poured into the economy then definitely lots of works will be done. Hence, the current difficult economic times come with certain advantages that may in the long run be to the benefit of Nigeria. If Nigeria can take advantage of scarcity then production should prevail. A more prosperous Nigeria with more jobs, more purchasing power, more wealth, and a growing middle class is of course a great advantage to companies such as ours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your visit to Iran after meeting President Hassan Rouhani last April?</h4><p>Meeting with President Hassan Rouhani was friendly, pragmatic, and constructive. The same can be said about the visit as a whole. He pointed out that relations between Estonia and Iran have a long history of almost a century, and expressed his interest in developing relations with Estonia in a variety of areas. On the political side, high-level exchanges between government representatives as well as members of Parliaments can be envisaged. In addition, further potential in business contacts and bilateral trade was noted. There was also an MoU signed between the Estonian and Iranian Chambers of Commerce. President Rouhani showed particular interest in Estonia's experience in the field of e-governance, where Iran has also made some progress. We also discussed the situation in the broader Middle East. The meeting, being the first high-level gathering in the history of the two nations, gave undoubtedly important impetus for the continuation of a fruitful dialogue.</p><h4>Both sides have expressed their willingness to boost bilateral ties. What are the main areas of cooperation that could be opened between Estonia and Iran?</h4><p>As a member state of the EU, Estonia is interested in developing economic relations with Iran in a broader context. After the successful conclusion of the nuclear talks last July and the subsequent implementation of the agreement reached, Estonia is willing to use the opportunities offered by the EU's economic environment also in its relations with Iran. There are opportunities to be explored in several fields, including ICT. Estonia has made some progress in developing e-governance and e-services, and we are ready to share our experience. Another potential field for cooperation is logistics, due to the geographical position of Estonia and Iran, both being situated in the cross-points of trade routes and transit corridors. Estonia's position in northeast Europe in the immediate proximity to Scandinavia offers particular opportunities for the transit sector, including establishing distribution or production centers. There are modern transport solutions and ports in Estonia that are best suited for fast and reliable service. In addition, the Estonian food industry is offering high-quality production on international markets, especially milk and dairy products, meat and meat products, fish and fish products, berries, and honey. We are also ready to offer our products to the Iranian market. Our experience with producing alternative energy might also be of interest, especially in the field of wind, solar and biowaste energy. Estonia is experienced in developing the technologies for combined energy production, using energy for producing both, electricity and heat. Also, Estonian wood and wood products, as well as wooden houses, are well known.</p><h4>How will this new relationship between Estonia and Iran boost the economic growth of both countries?</h4><p>My recent visit to Iran was the first high-level visit from Estonia. Its main objective was to witness the developments in Iran and explore the fields for cooperation. The reception was warm and we received a good overview of the situation on the ground. As regards to the agreements, we are looking into it based on the actual needs. During recent years, Estonia substantially diversified its economic geography. Growing interest toward Iran is a natural part of it. Currently, the trade volumes are modest but both sides see a lot of potential.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Iran's regional and international role in the coming years?</h4><p>Belonging to the world's top 20 economies, Iran could play an important role as a trading partner to the EU and its member states. Iran's particular advantage is its increasing, young, and highly educated workforce. It is also clear that the potential of connections between north and south, between the ports of Persian Gulf and Central Asia, and the Caucasus, has not yet been exhaustively utilized. I would like to see Iran constructively contributing to the stability and security in the region. I hope that Iran will have its place as a responsible international actor, reconnected to international economic and trade system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[baobab-resources-iron-steel-project]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Baobab's activities evolved in Mozambique?</h4><p>Baobab Resources has been wholly focused on the exploration and development of mineral resources in Mozambique since 2005. The company, working with its joint venture partner, the IFC, has discovered and defined a 750Mt iron ore resource immediately adjacent to the core iron and steel making raw materials of coal, power and water. By leveraging the project's unique access to these resources, Baobab intends to establish a vertically integrated mining and steel-making operation, producing steel products to supply the industrial, commercial, and urban growth in Mozambique, as well as regional end-markets.</p><h4>What makes Tete province a strategic location for establishing steel making capacity?</h4><p>Tete province is central to three major regional growth areas and attracts the lion's share of fixed capital investment in the Southern African Development Community, with existing infrastructure—in particular international port, rail and road networks—being rapidly refurbished and expanded. Significant investment is also directed towards power generation. Mozambique is home to southern Africa's single largest hydroelectric scheme at Cahora Bassa and there are numerous other hydro, gas and thermal plants in the pipeline worth an estimated $10 billion. This explosive regional growth underpins a sustained and rapidly expanding demand for steel. Currently Mozambique consumes approximately 400,000 tons of steel a year, which translates to less than 15kg per person per year. Consumption is expected to double within the next decade, but even at double the per capita consumption, Mozambique will be a long way behind the curve in comparison to its regional peers—underlining the long-term growth potential not just in Mozambique, but in the neighboring southern African region. Situated 50km north of the provincial capital of Tete, Baobab's iron and steel project is centrally located in the heart of the regional development picture, ideally positioned to service the Mozambican demand for steel as well as the neighboring landlocked markets of Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, which are almost entirely dependent on steel imports.</p><h4>The project has ready access to the Moatize coalfields. How is this an advantage?</h4><p>Baobab seeks to utilize the thermal coal being produced as a wash by-product on the project's doorstep to convert its captive iron ore into value added steel. Baobab's c.750Mt iron ore resource is exceptional, with 550Mt of the inventory underlying a footprint of just 2.5sqkm. At 0.5Mtpa of steel production, there are sufficient resources to support over 100 years of operation (the first 30 years of mining will be at a staggeringly low strip ratio of just 0.15).</p><h4>What makes the iron and steel project such an important development and how do you see this project transforming the province and country?</h4><p>The Tete iron and steel project is of game-changing importance for Mozambique. It attracts unprecedented government support and is strategically aligned with the 2015 presidential manifest and five-year plan, which focuses on industrialization and job creation. The size of Baobab's resource and technology selection will underpin over 100 years of steel production and is scalable to meet the future demands of Mozambique and the region. With its captive iron ore, abundance of low cost coal, and geographically competitive location, Baobab will be operating at the bottom of the global steel cost curve. This, combined with a growing national and regional steel demand, translates into a robust economic proposition delivering long-term investor returns. By ensuring that the entire value chain remains in country, the project will also deliver unprecedented socioeconomic returns at both local and national levels. The project marks a profound shift in the way we think about African resources. With Africa emerging as the next big growth market, the previous model of exploit and export is rapidly becoming outmoded. In-country beneficiation is an essential catalyst for nation building and industrialization. By fully utilizing their raw materials, countries like Mozambique will be empowered to fast track the development process and achieve its full potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for Costa Rica's growth and what sectors do you feel will push the 4.2% growth in GDP projected by the IMF?</h4><p>Costa Rica has managed to sustain growth over the past three decades, which is mainly because we were able to advance our economy from a basic agricultural setup. We used to export basic agricultural products such as coffee, bananas, sugar, and beef, which accounted for about 80% of our total exports, to mainly Central American countries and the US. Today, we export 4,500 different products to 160 different countries around the world. Our number-one export sector is the services sector, with $3.5 billion worth of IT and IT-related and enabled services alone. The service sector exports a total of $7 billion in the export of actual services. In goods, our number-one export sector is medical devices or life sciences, which accounted for $2.2 billion of the $10 billion in total goods exported in 2015. Basic agriculture exports today account for less than $1.3 billion, which is less than 10% of our total exports. This shows how Costa Rica has completely transformed its economy, which is what has allowed us to sustain that growth. In 2015, the sectors that exported and grew the most were life sciences and services. Also, tourism has been growing tremendously. We coined the term ecotourism. Lastly, FDI today is probably the number-one sector that is moving the economy forward and will continue to move it forward in the coming years as long as the country is able to sustain its growth in terms of delivering the number and quality of people that those sectors demand.</p><h4>What has been the significance of local talent to this growth?</h4><p>Costa Rica has invested heavily in its human capital, both in education and health. For 150 years the education in the country has been public, free, and mandatory for both men and women. When we abolished the army 60 years ago, we were able to take that money and invest it in health and education. Today, Costa Rica is able to harvest the investments that it made when we decided to invest in our people, and thanks to globalization and the internet we are able to provide services to the world using our local talent. Today, we provide 75 different types of services and processes in a wide range of areas, from finance and accounting, receivables, human resources, and what are called basic service facilities, to R&amp;D and design. However, there is a lot more demand than supply. Our universities are still graduating people in a lot of fields that are not necessarily in demand in the market today, and something that we push a lot for is to shift those resources to careers that are demanded globally, such as engineering, technical sciences, finance, data analytics, business administration, and bilingual talent. Costa Rica continues to invest in educating its population in a second language, particularly English, which opens doors.</p><h4>Some manufacturing companies have recently left Costa Rica, claiming costs in the country are too high. How can Costa Rica become more competitive and what are the main challenges facing the country?</h4><p>From CINDE's perspective, our number-one challenge and the one we have to work on the most is human capital; we need to produce more engineers, more technicians, and more bilingual professionals. There are, of course, other issues though, such as the cost of electricity, which is high compared to neighbors such as Mexico, the US, and Colombia, which have all invested in cheap and clean technologies. We need to produce clean energy at a competitive price. That is something that is impeding our competitiveness, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Salaries are also high, and the standard of living is fortunately much higher than some of our neighbors, but that also means that basic salaries are almost three times higher than in neighboring countries. We need to retool these people and teach them new skills so that they can be more productive and work in sectors that demand a different type of labor. We also have an issue with infrastructure; we have problematic traffic jams and we are 30 years behind on infrastructure development. The country needs to make a decision and finally embrace public-private partnerships. Unfortunately, many people are still not open to that, but we have a huge deficit and we do not have the money to build those roads, bridges, and seaports ourselves. Even if we did have the money to do it, we do not have the capability.</p><h4>CINDE recently highlighted how the country needs to shift from “Made In Costa Rica" to “Created In Costa Rica." How can this be done?</h4><p>We realize that is the route the country needs to take to learn from Ireland, Singapore, Israel, and so on. This transition essentially entails investing in education to produce more doctorate degrees and attract more foreign talent. We have a small population and we have very few doctors or scientists in specific fields; therefore, we have to make it easier for these professionals to migrate to Costa Rica. We have to build labs and improve our relations with academia. We still need to figure out new incentives to attract companies to come and invest in R&amp;D in the country. We are looking at what models have been successful in other parts of the world to see which of those the country can adopt and put together a basket of incentives for R&amp;D.</p><h4>Companies such as Bridgestone and Bimbo are expanding their operations in Costa Rica. What are the advantages for foreign investors to invest in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Human talent is the number-one factor. We also have FTAs with the contributors to two-thirds of the world's GDP and the world's population, including all of the Americas, Europe, Singapore, China, and Asia-Pacific countries. That platform has also helped companies become more competitive because they can import all of their supplies and export to the rest of the world with lower tariffs. We have a competitive free trade zone regime that offers tax incentives that very few countries do, including zero income tax for companies depending on their particular investment. The geographic location is also a factor, as we are in the same time zone as the US. The level of English and the cultural affinity to Europe and the US has been an advantage for Costa Rica; companies feel at home when they operate here, and they can bring their companies' cultural values and the locals will quickly absorb it and become part of it.</p><h4>The President recently put the Pacific Alliance process on hold. What is your stand on this?</h4><p>We need to be in the Pacific Alliance. Costa Rica is a small country, so alone it is hard to have any real negotiating power with a serious trading partner. It would be a great opportunity for Costa Rica to be part of what will be the eighth largest economic bloc in the world. Obviously, it is a market and a population many times that of Costa Rica; hence, it allows us to not only import goods and services, but also to export and have a much larger market than we have in just Costa Rica or Central America. It is important both from intra-country and inter-country investment perspective. We would be able to attract a lot more investment from countries like Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, as well as from other countries that want to access the Pacific Alliance via Costa Rica.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What legal and regulatory changes are we likely to see in Mozambique in the medium term?</h4><p>One of the important legal changes SAL &amp; Caldeira Advogados expects is new legislation on local content, particularly in the extraction industry, with the inflow of oil and gas projects. The government is keen to create a framework under which Mozambicans are given an opportunity to participate in these projects. There is also the matter of social responsibility, which is becoming increasingly important. There may be some development of legislation in this area. Another important topic is competition and there is a new legal and institutional framework for that. The Competition Regulatory Authority is not yet operational, but we expect it to be in the near future. There is a draft bill for transfer pricing that has been under discussion with the private sector and other stakeholders for some time now. We expect that draft bill to be approved probably in 2016. In the land sector we have a draft bill for new regulations for the assignment of exploitation rights that will again probably be approved later in 2016. In addition, we have some draft special regulations under our labor laws that we expect to be approved in the near future. Mozambique's new insolvency law has also been approved; however, there are some regulations dealing with insolvency practitioners and their fees that still need to be passed. Finally, there is a draft bill for public participation in the legislative process. This is an important piece of law because it is crucial ensure that the private sector is consulted over new legislation, especially when it affects their business sector. This may also be approved in the near future.</p><h4>What should foreign companies looking to invest in Mozambique be aware of before engaging in their start-up phase here?</h4><p>Companies should first look for legal advice to better understand the general legal, regulatory, and institutional framework applicable to their business sector, especially in matters such as taxation, employment, and foreign exchange. They should also seek assistance in terms of a market review in order to understand the market, and seek assistance for designing their business plan. Once they have all that I believe they will be prepared to start the incorporation phase and the project will go more smoothly.</p><h4>What would you say sets SAL &amp; Caldeira Advogados apart from similar law firms in Mozambique?</h4><p>SAL &amp; Caldeira Advogados is a national, full-service law firm that combines local experience with international best practice to offer high-quality services to its clients both for domestic and international transactions. We are structured into eight specialized practice areas where we have motivated and very capable teams, namely corporate and commercial, banking and foreign exchange, labor, tax, litigation, immigration, natural resources, and administrative law. As a firm we work as a one-stop shop. We advise clients from the inception phase and continue assisting them throughout the life of their projects. We are also members of the DLA Piper Africa Group, which gives us access to comparative law and expert knowledge and training and international best practice in different practice areas. We also have offices in Tete and Pemba, which means we can serve our clients in the central and northern regions of the country.</p><h4>How do you cater to foreign corporate clients?</h4><p>We try to understand our clients' businesses and the issues and challenges they face. This way we can come up with tailored solutions to their problems. Apart from that, we have a combination of in-depth knowledge of the legal system, institutions, and policies of the country, and a well-trained and motivated team of lawyers with experience in areas relevant to our clients. When we have clients with multi-jurisdictional transactions or matters that touch on jurisdictions other than Mozambique, we can always work with DLA Piper Africa or its member firms in other countries to give our clients assistance from one firm, but using multi-jurisdictional resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you set for INATUR for the next two to three years to promote tourism in Mozambique?</h4><p>INATUR has defined certain key strategies to develop tourism in Mozambique and targets major source markets such as the UK, Germany, Portugal, and South Africa. We also want to focus more on Asia. We need to reach high standards of service to meet the expectations of visitors and tourists coming to the country. The government has made training in hospitality and tourism a priority, and we have initiated training programs in line with the tourism strategy. We also focus on promoting investment and want to attract international hotel chains. The government has selected certain areas where we will develop integrated tourism projects, like Crusse and Jamali in Nacala, Metangula in Niassa, Quirimbas in Cabo Delgado, and Inhassoro in Inhambane. We want to take advantage of the new international airport in Nacala to link with the Ilha de Moçambique, a recognized UNESCO World Heritage site, to develop a cultural tourism destination. In addition, we would like to develop Vilankulo further. We are seeking partners to develop the site along the marginal facing Bazaruto Archipelago. The plan is to develop the waterfront at Vilankulo and link it with the Bazaruto Archipelago. In Inhassoro, just north of Vilankulo, there is another zone reserved as a special tourism area where we have designed a conceptual project as well.</p><h4>What areas have the most potential for luxury tourism in Mozambique, and which projects will be coming online soon?</h4><p>Starting from the south, Milibangalala is a concession that was given to one of our companies, Mozaico do Ündico, which then entered into a partnership with the private sector to develop a luxury lodge in a conservation area. It will be a top service lodge for high-spending customers, and is expected to be complete by the end of 2016 or early 2017. In the north we have similar luxury lodges in Quirimbas already operational. The Bazaruto Archipelago is also a destination where you can find luxury lodges and is known as a honeymoon destination. Specifically for Crusse and Jamali, since this is within the special economic zone, we are working with Mozambique's Office for Economic Areas with Accelerated Development (Gazeda) to attract investors to develop integrated coastal tourism village across 1,750ha with hotel, retail, commercial, housing, recreational amenities, and land subdivision.</p><h4>In 2014, most billionaires visiting Africa went to Mozambique's neighbor South Africa. How are you working to develop the luxury tourism market here?</h4><p>The main challenge is to attract tourists and visitors to Mozambique, especially the luxury and high-end segment. The issue of visas is being considered by the government and will be addressed appropriately in due course. Easing visa policies and reducing the costs will make more convenient and these will attract more visitors. Another recurring issue is transportation. The airports at Vilankulo and Nacala now make travel to various destinations within the country easier while the new international airport in Nacala will reduce flight time to Europe by two hours. From Nacala, it will be easy to get to Vamizi and the other 32 islands at Quirimbas. We are also working on marketing and promotion, especially for luxury resorts, and are collaborating with travel agencies by developing brochures and related materials.</p><h4>What are your hopes for INATUR in 2016?</h4><p>I have high expectations for the year and I believe we can make great gains compared to last year. We receive about 1 million visitors to Mozambique annually and want to increase that number to 1.5 million in 2016. We will continue to grow, increase revenues, and develop more projects, while increasing overall employment in the sector. From 2010-14, 20,000 new beds were added to the system. Occupancy is only high in Maputo, with the rest of the country still lagging behind. We want to increase the overall number of available beds and improve occupancy rates at the same time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strategic priorities you have set for INATUR?</h4><p>The National Institute of Tourism (INATUR) aims to ensure the promotion and coordination of initiatives and activities related to tourism and to encourage those that relate to tourism or contribute to its valorization and also promote the touristic product. Based on that, all the activities of INATUR are intended to accomplish the Strategic Plan for the Development of Tourism 2015-2025, which aims to make Mozambique the most vibrant, dynamic, and exotic destination in Africa. For this reason, INATUR has been tasked with making the most of the country's existing touristic attractions, whether natural, cultural, and historical heritage, as well as attracting more investment for housing infrastructure construction, restoration, and entertainment. Two major actions set for INATUR for this year are the reclassification of tourist enterprises and the graduation of professionals at hospitality and tourism school. Currently, tourism represents 5.6% of GDP in Mozambique.</p><h4>Is the ministry working on common visa projects like Zambia and Zimbabwe to promote tourism and business?</h4><p>Regarding entry visas, there are two main points to consider. The government is facilitating entry for visitors and tourists, regulated by the Migration Law in 2014 that establishes, among other issues, visas, whose concession obeys certain requirements. In the Southern African Development Community (SADC) the possibility of a single visa system among the countries of the region is being considered. Besides Mozambique, there are some bilateral exemption agreements on visas with other countries in the region.</p><h4>What are the main touristic and cultural initiatives planned in the country for the year 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, in the province of Sofala the IX National Festival of Culture in the city of Beira will take place. It is a festival that brings together all local cultures at a national level. This will range from traditional to modern, from musicians to artists, and from sculptors to poets. This festival will be the highest cultural achievement of the country. We will also hold the largest fair in Mozambique's tourist sector's history, named “Discover Mozambique," which will take place in Maputo. It is a fair that will show the touristic, cultural, and artistic potential of Mozambique.</p><h4>What efforts is the ministry making to ensure the sustainable development of the culture and tourism sectors?</h4><p>Tourism is considered by the government to be one of the four priority areas for the development of the country. Due to its broad character, tourism boosts the direct, indirect, and induced development of other economic and social sectors. Our task is to continue boosting the growth of tourism through the laws, policies, and regulations that drive the sector in the performance of its mission to attract investment and bring tourists to the country. Since culture is a factor of social cohesion, due to the participation of citizens in the same cultural dynamics, it contributes to developing the sense of belonging to the same people, making it such an important factor for integration, pride, unity, and connection between communities at local, regional, or national levels. For these reasons, culture plays an important role in the development of society, through the integration of unprivileged social strata, admitting that their economic integration through learning and practice of an artistic activity is shown to be an effective means of combating poverty. This will enable the empowerment of communities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We want to improve the development of the country's touristic product and implementation of the marketing plan. We also want to make social media and communication strategies better in crisis situations, as well as to strengthen the process of collecting and processing statistical data. Finally, we would like to develop tourist attractions and the promotion of tourism in general. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your strategies to further increase cooperation with other universities around the world?</h4><p>The term university imparts the concept of openness and no boundaries. At ISCTEM, it is important to bring teachers in from abroad. Visiting academics increase the prestige of the institution and bring the added experience that makes our teaching quality stronger. We are now running a master's program in quality control for the teaching process. This program is specifically addressed to our teachers. The coordinator is a professor from the Philippines who holds a PhD in this area, and she heads the program with assistance from teachers from Mozambique and overseas. We have an academic from Brazil to run the master's program in petroleum and gas, again with assistance from local teachers. For our pharmacy program, we have teachers from Portugal working alongside local teachers. For our master's in public health we have teachers from Spain and Ecuador. In our medical program we have a retired professor from the public health sector in Argentina who is here full time at the moment. We also want to launch a master's program in food security. We already have a professor who will be in charge of this new program in conjunction with professors from the University of Barcelona. The program will start in 2016.</p><h4>What is ISCTEM's relationship with the private sector like, and how can private companies support higher education in Mozambique?</h4><p>In the private sector it is much easier to receive assistance from companies. The private sector helps us identify gaps in graduates' skills and performance. This provides us with many ideas we can use to improve the content of our programs. As a result, the programs we offer are dynamic. We have the basics that are standard like any other university running the same program, but there are some specifics I can introduce based on the suggestions and criticisms from the market, which is valuable.</p><h4>How do you think new technologies and social media have changed the way we look at education and learning?</h4><p>First and foremost, institutions have to be aware of biased information coming from these sources. It is important to have strong critical faculties, as you cannot just trust everything you read and see. We usually recommend the main authors and scientists that our students should be researching on the internet to find materials, because today anyone can write anything and post it on the internet. Having said that, new technological facilities are important for distance learning. We have not started yet, but are planning to have distance learning within our public health master's program, as well as other similar courses. We are discussing internally how we can develop that program. We may be in a position to start by 2016.</p><h4>Can you tell us about ISCTEM's high school?</h4><p>We have had a high school since 2004 with two pre-university levels—primary and senior classes. We are proud of our success rate, with students from the high school doing university entrance exams, and have maintained a failure rate of less than 5%. Often students do not fail in all the disciplines, but perhaps just one or two subjects. That is why we are authorized to offer exams here. The quality of our instruction and our standards have been recognized by the Ministry of Education. Some of the teachers at our high school have master's degrees, and some have more than 15-20 years of teaching experience. We also have laboratories that many public primary schools do not have. Apart from the official program approved by the ministry, we have extra programs covering disciplines not covered by the national education curriculum, such as project design. We also published a book of our students' poems. We have initiatives that other secondary schools do not have, and these make all the difference. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which education goals will receive the largest share of the budget in the next few years?</h4><p>The current stage of education in our country requires more focus and investment on several priorities, with particular emphasis on training teachers and education managers to ensure the delivery of quality educational services and subsequently the acquisition of essential skills at all levels of education, above all those of speaking, reading, writing, and numeracy in primary education. The establishment of a healthy and safe school environment favorable for learning will be key, particularly in the areas of school construction and equipping educational institutions, increasing community participation, promoting education for health and the improvement of nutrition within schools and the community, promoting school sports, and providing entertainment and healthy occupation for children and youth, without losing sight of emerging new talents</p><h4>How has the role of women evolved within the education sector? What should be done to empower and unlock the potential of girls and women?</h4><p>We are a country where, for sociocultural reasons, for a long time girls did not need to go to school to become the “reference model“ of woman that communities needed. However, in the last 40 years there has been great investment to reverse this scenario. The placement of female teachers in schools located in communities where attendance in girls school is low has been one of our successful interventions with regard to female involvement in education. Women have stood out in terms of organization and performance, when they occupy management positions at schools or other levels of management. Acknowledging the prominent and invaluable role of female teachers in educating children, and girls in particular, the Ministry of Education has focused on training more teachers by defining strategies for enrollment in teacher training institutions to ensure more gender equity among the teaching staff. At the inter-ministerial level, the government has introduced a range of measures to remove the barriers to girls receiving an education.</p><h4>What role do local languages play in the education sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>Educating a child is more successful when it is done in a language in which he/she is fluent, particularly if it is the mother tongue. Teaching in local languages has contributed a good quality of interaction in classrooms and in the improvement of school performance. It has also facilitated the participation of communities in the school life. We have 16 standardized Mozambican languages, with Portuguese as our official language. Most Mozambican children have one of the 16 standardized languages as their mother tongue. In 2003, we introduced bilingual training in 23 schools and currently there are more than 500 schools teaching in the model. Teaching in local languages requires a lot of institutional capacity in terms of producing and distributing textbooks, as well as training and assigning teachers.</p><h4>What strategies is the ministry considering to tackle the problem of absenteeism not only among students but also teachers and directors?</h4><p>This situation demonstrates the weak performance of not only the management of schools, but also the lack of accountability for the performance of the sector and the learning achievements of students. We have encouraged local leaders to pay more attention and provide support in the functioning of schools in the areas of their jurisdiction. The Ministry of Education is committed to improving local governance by training school managers and strengthening School Councils to become more proactive in school management. Other actions include the institutionalization of the district supervision, the implementation of quality standards and indicators, and the improvement of inspection activities to allow for better local supervision and monitoring. At the same time, we have reinforced our instruments of control and accountability while gradually improving conditions and incentives, especially at the school level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief outline of the hospital's facilities?</h4><p>HCM is a public hospital that will celebrate its 110th anniversary in 2016. We have 1,500 beds, 3,700 staff members, and provide almost all of the main specialties across seven different departments. We have three emergency services, one of them dedicated to adult trauma casualties and a second one for pediatrics. The third service is for problems related to gynecology. Our other departments cover the main medical specialties, with four general wards and additional areas for cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and nutrition. We also have surgery that combines general surgery with cardiothoracic surgery. We have neurosurgery, ENT surgery, facial surgery, and pediatrics surgery, which is a combination of surgery and pediatrics. We then have pediatrics linked with a range of other specialties. We have four units, mostly general orthopedics, and most of our patients have suffered physical trauma. Finally, we have two ICUs, one for adults and the other for children. Our hospital has radiology, one MRI, one CT scan, three digital X-rays, and six ultrasounds. We also have a top-tier laboratory facility, where most of the diagnoses are carried out using different techniques. We have one pathology center, and we have started the process in our radiology laboratory to carry out our assurance program in order to be accredited as a reference center. Apart from the clinical area, we also have the supportive area and have an administrative area that deals with administrative responsibilities.</p><h4>What department is the busiest and uses the most hospital resources? </h4><p>Surgery and orthopedics are resource-intensive, because most of the components are quite expensive for these services. The medicines themselves are expensive, as is the running of the laboratories to deal with test results and data processing. Hemodialysis is costly, and we operate three of these systems.</p><h4>HCM has been operating for 110 years. What are your key strategies and investments for the future?</h4><p>In the future, we would like to be a comprehensive center of medical excellence. We want to provide comprehensive healthcare for the people of Mozambique. That means regularly investing not only in equipment, but also in training our staff so that we can be self-sufficient and work to solve the main health problems facing the country. We are a referral hospital, meaning usually the patient has to come through the system to be served by the hospitals. This is the normal approach. We play an important role because there is no other organization as capable as our own, eeither in the public sector or the private one.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the use of new technologies in the health sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>Increasingly complex technological solutions are crucial for providing modern healthcare services. We have advanced technology and equipment available in our labs, which is necessary for providing accurate diagnoses and cures. For example, we treat malignant tumors with the aid of such technology, and in neurology it is almost impossible to do something of quality without a strong support system. The aim of our investment strategy is to facilitate the workload of physicians and to decrease the length of hospitalization for patients. We are investing heavily in laparoscopic surgery also, and this would allow patients to leave the hospital after just one day. Traditional surgery would require them to remain for five to six days. With improved technology we can balance our resources in a more efficient manner.</p><h4>What is the current level of healthcare training at universities in Mozambique?</h4><p>Providing technical support for training in most of the universities is one of our most important roles. We also have our school of paramedics, as well as a private school of medicine that uses our campus for staff training. In addition, we have a postgraduate program for doctors, with 250 physicians who are doing their medical residence here to later become specialists. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[In the right region]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[in-the-right-region]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose to expand USTM through a delegation in Xai-Xai?</h4><p>When we started the university we focused on Maputo. However, there were so many universities in Maputo that we had to look beyond the capital if we wanted to be relevant throughout Mozambique. At that time, neither Xai-Xai nor the province of Gaza had any higher education institutions, so we wanted to make a difference in that region. Our primary aim is not geographic expansion but to create the best conditions in one place, including an extensive library, good teachers, and student residences, and then leveraging these to attract students from across the country.</p><h4>How have your programs evolved over the last 10 years and what new programs do you have in mind for the coming years?</h4><p>We wanted to start with a medical school, and acquired a 75ha plot of land close to a public hospital at Infulene. However, a school of medicine is an expensive undertaking, and we had to give up on the project and start with courses such as accountancy, management, and sociology, which are all lighter in terms of investment. The only program we have that involves laboratory resources are our IT courses. After 10 years, we are now ready to move into some of the heavy investment courses. We have a new faculty of agriculture and will continue to introduce other resource-intensive programs. The ultimate goal is to create programs in the areas of construction, engineering, and eventually medicine as we always dreamed.</p><h4>How have new technologies and social media changed the way that USTM and others look at education and learning?</h4><p>One of our aims from the outset was to offer e-learning. We believe we cannot teach today using the methods of yesterday. There are few academic institutions using e-learning to deliver education. We are used to education systems where students come to school; we want to invert this and take the school to students. As the country improves its infrastructure, we hope sooner than later e-learning will be the norm of delivering education in Mozambique.</p><h4>What actions has USTM taken in response to the Prime Minister's call to prioritize research and expansion?</h4><p>Institutions of higher learning are graded on the quality and quantity of the research they produce. This is a priority for us but research and development in Africa is a costly enterprise because it does not bring immediate returns. To attend a university solely to become a researcher is not particularly attractive to most students. That is why we have few people wholly dedicated to research in Africa. Students tend to want to start working immediately upon finishing their studies. Making research more attractive to our students is a challenge that we have to overcome.</p><h4>How has more competition changed the sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>There is great competition in Mozambique, especially in Maputo. There are nearly 50 institutions of higher learning in the country. Most of these institutions are in the south. This means all our institutions are sourcing their student body from the same pool of candidates but this will force higher education institutions to offer quality education and upgrade their infrastructures. Very soon, only the best will survive the competition. For us, besides improving our education and upgrading our infrastructures, we have invested in accommodation facilities for students and teachers to attract students from outside the capital.</p><h4>How many students and teachers does the university have at the moment?</h4><p>We have close to 5,000 students, 150 permanent staff, and over 650 part-time teachers. It is difficult, if not impossible, for an institution in Mozambique today to staff its faculty entirely with full-time teachers. Some staff are shared with other institutions. We work on the training of Mozambicans, and this is a job that has to be shared among local institutions. Until the situation changes, the few qualified teachers have to be shared. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is Africa's largest plant nursery to the country and the group's overall activity?</h4><p>This nursery inaugurated by the president represents a fundamental step in the evolution and implementation of this project. We have a planting program that is very aggressive and is presently being ramped up. We require the right infrastructure to produce the number of plants we need and at the quality we expect. Ultimately this infrastructure will be able to produce between 12 and 14 million plants a year. This production will be complemented with satellite nurseries that will be much smaller in terms of production. This will allow us to manage the risks of concentrating too much in one area. Diseases and pests can adversely affect production. It also allows for a more even spread of employment, which will work out better for the locals. We are working across a large area and want to distribute this wealth as widely as possible.</p><h4>How will Portucel's nursery contribute to the local economy?</h4><p>The impact will be enormous. In macroeconomic terms, exports will increase significantly. According to current prices, production will contribute $1 billion to annual exports. Compared to current total exports, that increase would stand between 25 and 30%. Internal added value will be huge, which means a stronger contribution to the quality of life of local families where the project is based. The resulting inflow of foreign currency is also of major importance, contributing to exchange rate stability, which will have a significant impact on controlling inflation. At cruising speed of the project, we may reach 7,000 permanent direct jobs. This indicates the tremendous impact this project will have, both locally and nationally.</p><h4>What is your approach to managing land allocation?</h4><p>Our mosaic approach to landscape management involves a combination of various economic, social, and environmental components. As a result, we have been able to manage such a large area we got from the government without any physical or economic displacement, which are two problems we try to avoid. Our first priority is to guarantee that livelihoods will be preserved, and the second thing is to help them improve. We designed a social development plan that will invest around $40 million over the next seven years to work toward preserving livelihoods and improving food security. In some places more than 40% of crops are lost due to bad storage conditions. Also, the One Community, One Forest program will provide opportunities not only to preserve some natural areas where products and services and essential for livelihoods, but also to plant eucalyptus that they can be used for firewood, construction materials, or for pulp processing. We also help to develop SMEs for the provision of services to the forestry segment, as well as a growing scheme to produce wood for the mills. We encourage agri-business value chains to sustain production increases for farmers and their communities. The third pillar is about quality of life, where education and health are the main concerns, as well as infrastructure. Due to programs in these three different areas, we are convinced that economic displacement will be totally avoided and we believe there will be an improvement in the quality of lives. A fourth area where we are working is empowering communities to better manage activities and assets that will be implemented through the social development plan. This is really something completely new in Mozambique.</p><h4>What partnerships is Portucel considering in order to strengthen operations?</h4><p>We already have a partnership with the IFC World Bank group, and it has a 20% share of the company's capital. We are looking for another potential partner, and in the future are considering working with Mozambican partners, either national companies or private families. Sooner or later the idea is to enter the stock market and offer Mozambicans the opportunity to own the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the development of fish production in Mozambique over the past year and what are your expectations for the upcoming year? </h4><p>In 2015, Mozambique had an annual production of 287,720 tons of fisheries products, comprising shallow and deep-water prawns, tuna, and a variety of demersal and pelagic finfish, crustaceans, and cephalopods from both marine and fresh water environments. This represents a slight growth of 13% when compared to 2014. Looking at the segmental contribution to overall production, around 90% was harvested by small-scale fisheries, while aquaculture accounts for less than 1%. Currently, the country exports nearly 5% of the production (12,877 tons), but there is potential to increase all those figures and maximize the economic benefits for the country. In 2016, the government will continue providing special attention to promoting national and foreign private investments mainly for two underutilized segments—tuna exploitation and mariculture both at industrial and small-scale levels. Investments in aquaculture parks to increase fresh water fish farming capacity and the processing industry are amongst our top priorities. Special attention will also be given to the development of fisheries-supporting infrastructure, thus creating an enabling environment for either long distance or national fishing fleet operations. </p><h4>What action is the ministry taking to promote both local and foreign investments in the fishing and aquaculture industry?</h4><p>A sound institutional and legal framework is in place. We have a new Fisheries Act and legislation on investment in Mozambique (Law on Investment, Regulations and Code of Fiscal Benefits for Investment). These instruments provide incentives for the entry of foreign capital for fishing and aquaculture. We have completed the first stage of mapping of potential areas for mariculture and the same exercise is being done for fresh water/inland aquaculture. In addition, we are reviewing a plan of action for aquaculture development both industrial and small-scale. Complementary to the legal framework abovementioned, the sector is undertaking other interventions toward disseminating the unique environmental potential of the country to encourage private sector investments in tuna fisheries and mariculture.</p><h4>Are fishers conscious of the consequences that climate change, overfishing, pollution, or illegal fishing can have on the industry?</h4><p>One of the main role of the Ministry of Sea, Inland Waters and Fisheries is to ensure the monitoring, control, and surveillance of fishing activity. Our interventions in this field, especially in the form of educational campaigns, have been useful for raising community awareness with regard to illegal fishing, overfishing, and pollution. Additionally, the implementation of specific external co-funded development programs with focus on socioeconomic development helps us strengthen and raise community awareness on issues related to best practices, responsible fishing, environmental sustainability, the importance of preserving ecosystems, as well as the impacts of climate change in fisheries. Currently, the Ministry, in collaboration with relevant sectors, is in the process of drafting an action plan to help minimize the impact of climate change and build resilience in the fisheries sector.</p><h4>The Fisheries Museum opened recently. What is the main goal behind this initiative?</h4><p>The main goal behind this initiative is to disseminate and protect the fisheries cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations. This strategic development objective will be accomplished through a combination of several interventions in the field of research, collection, preservation, maintenance, and disclosure/propagation of fishery cultural heritage. The fisheries museum will have a twofold perspective—science and public education.</p><h4>What are your goals for the Ministry for the next three years?</h4><p>Priority will be given to dissemination of the country's natural and environmental potential for fishing industry development. National and foreign private-sector investors will be given due attention and recommended to consider investment in tuna fisheries, mariculture, and fresh water aquaculture. The processing industry, using artisanal production as raw materials, could also be attractive for the establishment of processing plants. The construction and/or rehabilitation of fishing support infrastructures will be a top priority line of intervention. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What developments does Aujan Group Holding own in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our development history spans island resorts, city hotels, serviced residences, and commercial real estate complementing the hospitality products. We developed and launched the first phase of the Pemba Beach Hotel and Spa in 2002. Today, with its mix of African and Arabian architecture, it operates as the Avani Pemba Beach Hotel and Spa. We subsequently developed a secluded resort on the private island of Medjumbe, and a family resort on the island of Matemo, both in the Quirimbas archipelago. We also developed another island property, the boutique Anantara Bazaruto Island resort. In 2012, in line with the vision for the country, we diversified our portfolio to focus on business tourism and partnered with recognized international partners who would bring a new dimension to hospitality in Mozambique. With the world's eyes set on Maputo, we wanted to develop something very distinct from anything else in the city or country. This is how the concept of our latest and largest development, Torres Rani, was born.</p><h4>What sets the Torres Rani apart from other options in the city?</h4><p>There were two areas we wanted to focus on, namely creating something memorable and different in Maputo and meeting the expected demand of local and foreign companies coming to operate here in the future. Maputo is a growing metropolis and our choice of location, architecture, features, and operators focuses on providing the convenience of major cities around the world while highlighting the beauty of the city and country around us. This large development includes a hotel, an office tower, a retail area, an apartment tower, and the Radisson Blu Residences. We wanted to provide an environment where people can live, work, and spend leisure time with reliable round-the-clock utilities and a natural sense of security—an environment conducive for doing business, raising a family, and entertaining. With all its unique features, we plan to market the development at very competitive prices, opening the doors to a host of companies and residents whose aim is to contribute and participate in the growth of Mozambique.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of the real estate market in Mozambique?</h4><p>Whenever there is a slowdown in the economy, people get concerned. We have been in the country for two decades and will be here for many more to come. The prospects of the economy of Mozambique continue to be very promising, despite the global economic adjustment under way. Research from international entities and large financial institutions point to an economy that will be significantly propelled by hydrocarbon exploration and production in the future. That, and other developing industries, will all contribute to real estate market growth in the country.</p><h4>Will Aujan Group Holding invest in further projects in luxury tourism in the region?</h4><p>We are heading in an environmentally responsible direction. For us, luxury is not just having a beautiful resort and a well appointed room; it is about preserving the environment. In February, we re-launched the Anantara Medjumbe Island Resort and Spa, where we move from 100% reliance on diesel for power to 100% solar. This will be the first private island in Africa to be fully reliant on solar power generation. For us, that is responsible luxury.</p><h4>Is there a lot of interest in Mozambique from the GCC?</h4><p>I have been privileged to participate in a few investor conferences, particularly in Dubai, which were focused on Mozambique. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the level of trade and growth in trade between Mozambique and the UAE. Dubai Ports operates here, and we see a large influx of companies coming through the GCC participating in different industries. Qatar Airways has been flying here for a while, and there are discussions about the possibility of Emirates flying this route too. Moving forward, we want to focus on expanding Mozambique tourism by tapping into these source markets as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been BETAR's most important projects over the past two decades?</h4><p>We designed the Tete Bridge over the Zambezi River and have constructed numerous other bridges, roads, and buildings. We have also worked a great deal in rail for the Sena line, where we had to replace some of the old rail bridges. We designed the new headquarters for Banco Comercial e de Investimentos (BCI) in Maputo, and continue to do engineering projects beyond construction or architectural work. We specialize in structural and electrical engineering, sewers, hydraulics, and related ventures. We also have a supervisory role in projects, in addition to acting as project managers and designing. We have completed a good number of buildings, not only in Maputo, but all over the country.</p><h4>Can you tell us specifically about the Katembe new urban area project?</h4><p>We started the Katembe Project about eight years ago. We were working with the government to find the best solution for urban expansion in Maputo. The city is in a difficult location from a geographic standpoint, with a river to the south and the sea to the west making any expansion problematic. We started by working on a new bridge connecting the south of Maputo, but it became apparent we could not do the work without also taking care of the urban area of Katembe. We had to develop a wider project, including designing roads and the bridge, as well as urban planning for the new area of Katembe. This is the best project in Africa for three reasons: Maputo's city center is close to the river and the new city center is just five minutes away; the bridge is already under construction and will be finished between 3Q2017 and 1Q2018; and the urban planning scheme we developed with a large team is ready to go, two years before the bridge will be completed. It is unusual for planning to be completed so successfully here in Mozambique. The idea is to create a city for 400,000 people, and work has to start now because the bridge will be ready in two years and we are racing against the clock. Mozambique has a growing population, and Katembe will be a city that welcomes everyone. The middle class in Mozambique is not able to afford housing. Therefore, this is a fantastic opportunity to build houses that Mozambicans can actually afford. In addition, South Africa is only one hour away and many South Africans would love a second house in Mozambique, so that is a market we are also going to tap into. The project is sound and there are good reasons for Maputo to grow. There is a market both within and outside of the country, so if we work toward that then success is assured.</p><h4>What are the nuances of creating a new city from scratch?</h4><p>The disadvantage of creating a city from scratch is that we have to be careful not to dehumanize it. The task for architects and engineers is to focus on the lifestyle of Mozambicans and to design a real city for them. Maputo itself is a well-planned city. From a planning point of view, it is one of the best cities on the continent. We have to be sensitive to the heritage of Maputo while planning using modern methods. We have learned from past errors. We are not going to make a central business district; we want a city where residents are not segregated. All the areas will be mixed-use spaces, with some offices and some residential. More importantly, we also do development by the book. All the legal requirements are met, including environmental impact studies, public consultations, and so forth. We truly believe this is the best project in Africa and that within a decade it will completely change Maputo. It will be an even better and nicer Maputo on the other side of the river. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies has the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security implemented to promote local and foreign investment in the agriculture sector? </h4><p>The government is in the process of implementing both its agriculture development strategy and agriculture investment plan. With the new cycle of government, over the coming five years our development strategy will aim to increase production by expanding productivity in agriculture. We want to consolidate what we have done with products where we have already reached self-sufficiency, such as maize and cassava. We have plans to become self-sufficient in other products over the next five years too, and for that a certain level of public investment will be implemented, particularly related to infrastructure like roads and bridges, as well as investment in energy supply to the emerging agricultural industry. Our key goal is to follow through on a sustainable agriculture development strategy. We have developed a package of fiscal incentives and more favorable duty regimes for agriculture. Most imports of agricultural equipment, such as tractors and pipes for irrigation, will be duty free as part of this policy. Spare parts for those goods will face low levels of taxation, and throughout the six agriculture development corridors we plan to develop agriculture duty free zones to make the country more attractive in terms of investment. We want to transfer that experience to the other agricultural corridors, as investors will be more attracted to investments with low taxation for farming imports and the export of agriculture products.</p><h4>What role are women playing in the agriculture sector and how can they be provided with more access to finance for agriculture?</h4><p>In Mozambique, the majority of people living in rural areas are living off agriculture, and the majority of these people are women. There are different lines of credit for agriculture farmers designed to empower the small farmers, so if a man or a woman applies for credit in a given bank in which we operate the soft loan system for agriculture, the priority will be given to the woman's project. Each year the president gives an award to the champions, and this year's champion was the women's association in Zambezia province. This was the general award; however, we also have a special category for women, youth, scientists, and field extension work. </p><h4>What agricultural commodities hold the most potential for foreign investment in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have three groups of commodities, and 15 commodities that we consider to be strategic for agricultural development in Mozambique, as well as six priority commodities to be developed through a special incentive program and three to four commodities, which we want to re-launch. The priority commodities are maize, poultry, beef, rice, cassava, and vegetables.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of sugar and cashew nut production in the country?</h4><p>The sugar industry of Mozambique is advancing rapidly. It is a responsible kind of investment in the country because there is a real smart partnership in which private commercial investors come to invest in sugar and produce sugar cane directly on the farm, but they operate with the local chief and local community on a contract basis who then sell to the industrial interests. It is a successful system, and with sugar there is an incentive as we produce enough sugar for our needs but have a free market system to make sure that our sugar will be competitive. Anyone is free to import sugar as long as they pay the 2.5% import tax, meaning you can buy it cheaper locally. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the country and for the agriculture sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>The biggest expectation for me is to attract more investment. On the infrastructure side of the business this would be in dams for energy, water supply, and irrigation. We also want to attract more investors for agroprocessing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to your company's evolution in Mozambique?</h4><p>Opway Moçambique has been in Mozambique for over 25 years. In 2014 Opway was acquired by Nadhari Lda, a company incorporated under Mozambican law. At the moment we are stable and 100% Mozambican. After this purchase we named the company Nadhari Opway. This change has led to considerable growth, development, and restructuring in the company, something which I have been spearheading for two years now. Our strategy is to grow based on sustainability. More important than turnover, our target is profitability. We have some target projects, such as supporting the country's need to satisfy the demand for housing for the under privileged, infrastructure projects, water supply, sanitation, and road building. Our focus areas are in line with the development of the country. We work with both the government and private sector almost equally. Government projects are usually higher in terms of turnover figures, sometimes even 10 times larger than those of the private sector, so generally we focus on obtaining those contracts.</p><h4>What are some of Opway's most significant projects in the country?</h4><p>We participated in the construction consortium of Tete Bridge. We also built the Mocolumba Bridge in Zambezia, as well as the Xai Xai Bridge. In the education sector, we have completed a university school in Gaza, a secondary school in Moamba, and more than 20 rural schools in Niassa. Also, we recently finished the Centro Shopping Tete for Pylos and we expect to participate in the construction of more. In Tete, we finished the Moatize multisport facility for Vale. We are now working on restoring Inharrime Bridge, and in Maputo we are building a 16-floor, 20,000sqm building for the INSS. In terms of infrastructure we have worked on the rehabilitation of the EN221, Lots 1 and 3 of Namacurra/Nampevo and Alto Molócuí¨/Rio Ligonha, respectively, in Zambezia, and 114km of the EN1 Incoluane/Chicumbane project in Gaza and on urban sewage works in Mocuba in Zambezia.</p><h4>What is your experience in recruiting, training, and retaining your staff?</h4><p>Mozambique already has skilled professionals, although the country faces some challenges related to education. As a Mozambican company, it is our duty to offer this support. We believe our company's workforce should be Mozambican and, as a result, provide training to those who want to expand their set of skills, and then offer opportunities to those who are prepared. To perform our contracts outside Maputo we rarely take professionals from here, opting to always try to hire locally instead. One project for this year is to hire interns here at the company and give them an opportunity to work with us. Since I arrived, we have hired six interns and they have all stayed with us. In total we have 160 staff members.</p><h4>There has been an impressive amount of new buildings springing up around the city in the last year. Do you fear that there is a bubble?</h4><p>This could happen in Maputo with high-end apartments. We focus on housing for the less privileged, and at that level the risk is smaller. We target mid- and low-level housing projects that have high potential not only in Maputo, but also other provinces as well. A large project for the near future in Maputo is the development of the Katembe district, which is something we would be interested in participating in.</p><h4>What sets you apart from your competitors?</h4><p>No other construction company has an African woman in the leading position, which also reflects the nature of Opway and Nadhari Opway's culture, regarding internal and external relations, including leadership, flexibility, delegation, and collective definition of objectives. We are 100% Mozambican, even though we have strong connections with Portugal. We want to help our country to grow. We have all the know-how of an established Portuguese company, combined with local knowledge of the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges is the Mozambican civil construction sector currently facing?</h4><p>The costs related to logistics are one of the main challenges. We expect that with the investments expected in the gas sector, Mozambique will develop better infrastructure, particularly roads and ports. This will certainly contribute to reducing the costs of logistics. Finding skilled local employees is another challenge, especially in the construction sector, and represents a relevant constraint. However, it is the responsibility of construction companies to train these people, which represents an additional cost. To us, it is an investment in people, and one that we make in every single country where we operate. We had very positive results in the construction of Nacala International Airport and a coalmine project in Moatize. Approximately 90% of our workforce comprises local employees. We find another important challenge in materials and equipment space. Most of the goods we use have to be imported, which represents a big burden in terms of costs. Financing is also a big challenge that requires entrepreneurs and the public sector to offer different financial structures and solutions, such as project finance and PPPs.</p><h4>What activities is Odebrecht undertaking in the agroindustry sector?</h4><p>Agriculture is a fundamental sector for the development of the country, and the main priorities of the government are to significantly reduce poverty, increase food security, improve the quality of life of the population at large, and foster the diversification of the economy. We are developing two projects in this area in Mozambique: a poultry production project to be implemented in Zambezia province, and a cassava project in Gaza province. All in all, the required investment for both projects is estimated to be around $85 million. Both are in the final stage of feasibility studies, and we aim to launch at least one of them in 2016. An important social component for the sustainable growth of these projects is the integration in the production process of small and medium-sized local producers.</p><h4>How does Odebrecht approach social responsibility in Mozambique?</h4><p>We take social responsibility very seriously, and I cannot envisage a situation where Odebrecht develops project without considering its impacts on local communities and the environment. In Mozambique, we have developed a series of social initiatives such as agricultural family programs focused on empowering women and the youth to promote the generation of income and improve the quality of life of the local communities in line with the government's priorities. We believe a country can only grow if its people grow as well; this is the main reason why we focus so much on training and education and we do it because we are committed to the country's development. This year in Panama we were hired to develop two projects—one relating to the construction of the second Metro line in the capital and the second for the urban rehabilitation of the city of Colon. The community of Colon requested that Odebrecht be the company to execute the project in recognition of our experience and our capacity not only to deliver, but also work alongside local communities. This is as important a result to us as financial ones, and shows that our operations are truly sustainable.</p><h4>Looking to the future, which sectors are most attractive for Odebrecht?</h4><p>Water, energy, and infrastructure are the most attractive areas for us. More specifically, infrastructure and opportunities related to the supply chain for the oil and gas industry. Currently, we have a few other companies of the Odebrecht Group evaluating on-the-ground opportunities in these areas. In the infrastructure sector, we are set to begin the construction of the Maputo Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project in the first half of 2016. This project will generate around 1,500 direct jobs and it will contribute to the improvement of Maputo's public transportation system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where are you seeing increased demand for your services?</h4><p>DHL has a strategic focus on selected industry sectors, both globally and regionally. We work closely with our customers to acquire a detailed understanding of their specific logistics requirements. In Mozambique, the sectors registering the highest demand for better transportation and logistics services are oil and gas, engineering and manufacturing (construction, industrial equipment), technology, and the consumer sector. Our aim is to build long-term partnerships with customers in these sectors by offering our industry-leading solutions that will ultimately provide them with real competitive advantage in their marketplace.</p><h4>How is DHL's “Strategy 2020: Focus. Connect. Grow." being applied to the Mozambican market?</h4><p>For the past few years we have laid down a solid foundation that will shape our future. Our company vision emphasizes our target to be the logistics company for the world: We want to be the logistics provider of choice whilst also be the first choice for employees and investors alike. We developed strategic initiatives that gave us the right focus to achieve our ambitious targets, not only in terms of revenue and volume but also in terms of the quality of the services that we provide to our customers. Moving into the future we have our new Strategy 2020: Focus. Connect. Grow. to build on our core strengths and service quality whilst seizing new opportunities for profitable growth. We want people who think of logistics to think of DHL. We want our customers to do business with us because they rely on the quality of the service we provide. Since 2011 we expanded our presence in Mozambique by opening more offices and employing more people and have further improved our value proposition towards our existing and potential customers.</p><h4>DHL's goal is to derive 30% of the revenue from emerging markets by 2020. What role will Mozambique play in that regard?</h4><p>Mozambique has the potential to become a strong contender in emerging markets. This is mainly driven by the extractive industries, specifically LNG projects and mining, which should enable the country to compete amongst other emerging economies. However, Mozambique has a great opportunity to learn from the experience of other emerging markets and ensure that the economy is diversified and does not necessarily depend entirely on one or a few industry sectors. All the other industries should be able to benefit from the multiplier effect of these so-called “anchor" industries such as mining and energy.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges facing DHL in Mozambique?</h4><p>There are two main challenges, but these are not only exclusive to DHL. One is infrastructure, which is most likely the number one challenge for all businesses in the country. We require adequate infrastructure to support our product offering, not only in terms of roads, airports, ports, and rail lines but also value-adding infrastructure such as warehouses, cross dock facilities, cargo handling equipment, and so on to allow us to provide world-class logistics services to our customers in Mozambique. Improved IT is another area of infrastructure development that needs to be addressed. The government has its role when it comes to infrastructure development, but the private sector also has a significant part to play in terms of making sure the constraints around infrastructure are adequately tackled. PPP projects are also a great way of overcoming obstacles to infrastructure investment and development, especially in growing sectors. The second challenge is legislation. This needs to be equally addressed whilst keeping up with the pace of development of business—we must have laws that promote further development. In the transportation and logistics industries, the challenges related to customs regulations deserve adequate attention. Mozambique has subscribed to different international and regional organizations agreements but those agreements need to be consistently applied locally in order to benefit trade and business. If the legislation, for some reason does not follow business development and trading trends, we as a country might lose in the long run. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the growth of the company since last year?</h4><p>Growth has been difficult in 2015 due to the current economic conjuncture in Mozambique. We have had thus far a 9.26% growth in revenue, which is below our budget but above the current industry forecast.</p><h4>How many hubs does Skynet have in Mozambique and where are they located?</h4><p>We have a total of 11—one gateway in Maputo and 10 hubs in Pemba, Nampula, Nacala, Lichinga, Quelimane, Tete, Beira, Chimoio, Vilankulo, and Inhambane, while the province of Gaza is serviced through the Maputo Gateway. Next year we are also opening up a hub in Matola.</p><h4>Which provinces hold the most potential for Skynet in the next few years?</h4><p>The provinces with most potential for the future operations of Skynet in Mozambique are Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Sofala.</p><h4>What are your strategies to grow in the B2B segment?</h4><p>We foresee the potential growth to be in two distinct services, international inbound courier parcel express and domestic interprovincial distribution.</p><h4>What is the importance of an efficient logistics and transport network for the socio economic development of a country?</h4><p>A country the size of Mozambique has a great importance for the surrounding landlocked countries such as Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, which all need Mozambique's rail and road corridors to connect shipping routes to their respective countries. Therefore, an efficient network is essential not only for Mozambique's socio-economic development but also for its neighbors.</p><h4>In terms of revenues as well as trading volume, what is the importance of the Mozambican market to Skynet's overall strategy worldwide?</h4><p>Skynet Worldwide Express is the largest independently owned express network in the world providing flexible and reliable door-to-door services. Skynet's international growth is dependent on the success of each individual country to grow its market share. Africa as a whole and Mozambique in particular has huge potential economic growth and Skynet wants to be part of it.</p><h4>Electronic commerce is now a multi-trillion dollar business not only for sellers, but also for express courier services. What is the potential of e-commerce in Mozambique?</h4><p>There is great potential for e-commerce in Mozambique as there is currently very little of it. Skynet has enormous combined e-commerce knowledge and experience throughout the world, which can be rolled out almost overnight into the Mozambican market. We have recently partnered up with a few pilot projects in this field.</p><h4>What are your estimations for the growth of the express shipping market in the country for the next few years?</h4><p>We estimate trading volume growth of International Courier Express and Domestic Courier Express to be in the region of 12% and 8% respectively YoY for the period 2017-20.</p><h4>What differentiates Skynet from its competitors?</h4><p>Skynet being an independently owned express network has the possibility of being more flexible and in turn providing adapted solutions to client's needs. We have full visibility of live track and trace throughout Mozambique, which is a differentiator in regard to the majority of our competitors and our PMR service awards have distinguished us over our competitors for the past nine years. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I expect 2016 will continue to be a slow year due to the current economic conditions that are expected to extend into 2016. We expect similar trading volumes with revenue increased to inflation. However, when the megaprojects linked to LNG start we expect extra trading volumes to take place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On the Runway]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-runway]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your activities in the aerospace industry?</h4><p>Through GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world's largest aircraft leasing company, we work with multiple companies and have leasing arrangements with both AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines (MAS). GECAS was the first partner when AirAsia began operations. We provided the lease for its first two aircrafts, and this partnership has developed over time. With aircraft leasing, airlines with difficulties purchasing aircraft use this model, though leasing is more expensive. We provide these services on a case-by-case basis currently, as airlines try to mix how they own and operate aircraft. As airlines grow rapidly, or when others, like MAS, look to minimize risks, leasing becomes an interesting option. With GE Aviation, as one of the world's biggest aircraft engine providers, we have a significant presence to service the engines of both these airlines as well as Malindo Airlines. For this, we have a facility that has been operating since 1997 and is a joint venture between GE and MAS, with a 70-30% split, respectively. We are currently discussing with MAS the possibility of acquiring full ownership, likely to be finalized by the end of 2016. The facility, called GE Engine Services Malaysia, services over 60 airlines from around the world, from MAS to Southwest in the US. It has a capability predominantly in the narrow-body sector: CFM56-3, for the classic 737; CFM56-5, which powers the A320; and CFM56-7, which powers the 737. We have received clearance to allow the facility to be equipped with the capability to handle both leap-1A and leap-1B, which will power the new A320 Neo as well as the 737 Max. This will make the facility the first outside of the US with these capabilities to do MRO with certification. It will certainly fuel great growth here, and AirAsia will be the first operator of the A320 Neo. We are committed to investing approximately $50 million over the next three years for new capability building. The investment will double the workforce from 300 to 600 employees, upgrade the testing facilities, and improve tools and equipment for repair and maintenance.</p><h4>How do you position GE Aviation in the Aerospace Blueprints?</h4><p>Our MRO activities have always contributed to the wider ecosystem of the industry. If you look at the blueprint, one of the critical areas is how MRO can drive the aviation industry. We have been extremely involved in shaping the blueprint so that we do not compete with Singapore, but rather complement it. Our facility already contributes about 20-25% to the whole MRO market share in Malaysia. With the investments, we look to grow it beyond 30% in the next few years. We are the only engine MRO in the country and thus provide a critical role in supporting the blueprint. We definitely see the spillover benefits of our activities for the country, as we work with over 100 companies in the supply chain—local companies feeding into the growth of the shop—thus expanding the economies of scale within the sector. In addition to arranging third-party jobs to suppliers, we help build up not only the skills and capabilities in the country, but also collaboration with universities. We have a partnership with MARA's learning institute, and many technical capacities in the shop come from their universities. Since 2011, the facility has been operated entirely by Malaysians.</p><h4>Are you looking to work with MARA on its launch of the Asia Aerospace City?</h4><p>We are currently situated within that locality, and the expansion of the ecosystem benefits us. Similar to Singapore, this project will create a centralized space for the various segments of the industry to work together. The beauty of the MRO ecosystem of Singapore is that everything is physically close. If we could model something like that in Subang, even on a smaller level, it would really help bring down costs and create a centralized pool of skillsets within aviation and in the wider industry. We applaud the effort by MARA and the government, although it will take some time for the project to develop fully. It is great to see efforts from the government's side being centralized now, and I welcome the setting up of NAICO to have a more structured approach, to integrate what the different agencies are doing and to have ownership of the industry.</p><h4>How does GE Aviation contribute to the broader portfolio of GE in Malaysia?</h4><p>Malaysia is a billion-dollar country for GE, and we reached that point a number of years ago. Aviation steadily contributes about 25-30% of revenue from year to year. It is one of the most significant contributors of revenue for the company in Malaysia. Our facility here is one of the most cost-effective MRO shops in GE's global network, and this is how we managed to justify the additional investment, as well as the added capacity for the 1A and 1B engines that will be coming through over the next 12-18 months.</p><h4>How will the recently signed TTPA affect your business in Malaysia?</h4><p>From a global standpoint, we are still headquartered in the US; however, we are always a promoter and supporter of trade because we operate internationally. From a manufacturing standpoint, we are balancing job creations in the US and the rest of the world. GE already has significant presence in these TTPA countries, and it will benefit us in the long run. Most importantly we focus on how we work with the country to help build local capacity that could form part of the wider supply chain for GE and the TTPA project, rather than focus on its local effects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>AirAsia will receive its first new A320 Neo—in aviation terms known as Entry Into Service (EIS)—in August 2016. As the launch customer, it is important for us to support the EIS of the engine to ensure that everything goes to plan, as well as capability on the ground. It will be one of the most efficient engines in the world, which is an exciting milestone in aviation history. For AirAsia, as a low-cost carrier, it will be a major cost differentiator. More generally, GE positions itself to become a digital industrial company. We have a Tier 1 business within GE called GE Digital, in which we leverage analytics and big data capabilities to further enhance our offerings to customers and help them drive costs, increase revenue, and ensure zero unplanned downtime. Aviation is one of the key elements of this digital offering, and we work with AirAsia and the Department of Civil Aviation to implement performance-based navigation, helping them to almost literally build highways in the sky when they approach runways for landing. That will be one of our main directions within GE. GE Digital is currently doing around $5-6 billion in revenue, and by 2020 is positioning itself to become one of the top 10 software companies in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Diageo Mexico grown over the past year?</h4><p>After the acquisition of Don Julio in Diageo Mexico, we now have around 820 colleagues in the company. We have a large brand portfolio that is probably one of the world's most complete. We are proud of the fact that six of the top 20 brands in the Mexican market are Diageo brands. In fact, Buchanan's and Johnnie Walker hold the first two positions. Diageo has a leading market share of around 30.7% in the wholesale channel, which is almost twice that of our nearest competitor. Recently, 43 partners within the Wine and Liquor Distributors National Association (ANDIVYL) elected Diageo as the Provider of the Year, at the 12th annual award ceremony of the association. The transformation to our position today from 10 years ago when we were in fifth place has been stunning. We feel proud because Mexico has transformed itself from a local spirits market to an international beer and spirits market. That has been good for us and we have aggressive investment plans not only in brands but in all of our operations, with Don Julio for export and local consumption.</p><h4>What is the importance of Mexico to Diageo's global operations?</h4><p>The importance is that Mexico is a developing market in the more mature stages of development. In general, Mexico has done well. It is a democracy of 120 million consumers, a nice population bonus where the average age is 25-26 and the population is growing along with purchasing power. Even though Mexico is not growing at the rate that we would like to see, it is still doing much better than many of our developing country peers and our location next to the US creates many synergies with the US. We are the 10th largest exporting country in the world; therefore, we see great medium and long-term economic indicators in terms of being an underdeveloped spirits market. There is an interest in exploring international spirits. In this way, we are like Spain in the 1970s or 1980s when it transformed itself with whiskey and gin. Spain is now an international market, so Mexico will get there. We see Mexico as one of the top five or six markets for Diageo. We are ahead of Brazil already, we will soon be ahead of Australia, and Nigeria is a big business for us.</p><h4>How would you respond to critics of your acquisition of Don Julio, who say that international players will destroy the Mexican tequila industry?</h4><p>One interesting fact is that the majority of our 820 colleagues are Mexican. I am as Mexican as tequila, and it starts with Diageo making a statement that we had not had a Mexican GM for 20 years. Bringing in a Mexican GM that is well known in Mexico and Latin America is a big statement. However, the most important factor of Don Julio is that we make sure that everything about it is unique, from the name, production method, artisanship, and even the location in Jalisco in the town of Atotonilco, which is a bit different from the town of Tequila. Don Julio will always be engrained in Mexican heritage. We are investing today in recovering the properties that Don Julio lived in; therefore, we are making sure we maintain that heritage and authenticity. That is key for us because we want to make sure that Don Julio is Mexican, even under foreign ownership. Today there is more competition, but this is good for Mexico. We want to foster competition so that end-consumers will decide who is better, what is the best experience, and what is the best product. Don Julio is fortunately already the third-most loved brand. Though we did not know anything about tequila in Mexico, we still globally distributed Don Julio and Don Julio is now growing at twice the rate that of the consolidated tequila market. It proves that consumers care about quality, the experience, whether or not it is foreign owned or local owned. We want to give consumers the best experience and allow them to choose. The way that we produce Don Julio tequila is the same way that Don Julio did when he founded the business in 1942.</p><h4>What kind of potential do you see to expand the international presence of tequila?</h4><p>Our CEO Ivan Menezes was in Mexico recently, and actually announced we have expanded the footprint of Don Julio to about 60 countries from 30 in the last year. Based on the significant growth we have seen in Don Julio across the world, particularly in the key markets of the US and Mexico, we are investing in our distillation, packaging and maturation to double our sales by 2021. We also plan to accelerate our $400 million investment looking to deliver our investment faster than planned. We have the best brand with the best spirits company in the world by far, which is exciting and I am proud to be a part of this historical moment. Our Mexican operation manages the plant, although half of it is export.</p><h4>What is next for Diageo in Mexico?</h4><p>The big challenges will be to materialize our big dream; we want to double the size of our business in Mexico. We are into the second year of our five-year plan and we are ahead of schedule, but there is a lot of work to be done because the whole industry will grow and we want to grow at a faster and healthy pace. We want to promote the formalization of the industry by fighting illegal spirits—along with the government and industry—which make up around 43% of the market. We want to get that figure down, which will allow the government to generate more tax revenue and create many more formal jobs while attracting FDI. A big part of how Mexico brings in foreign currency is through investments like Diageo and other foreign companies that look to long-term hard assets.</p><h4>Why is Mexico such a good place to invest and do business?</h4><p>As a Mexican, I obviously have a bias; however, we have nonetheless shown the world that this is a place where there are great investment opportunities. People are well educated and investments will give a great return, plus they will be doing the world a service by ensuring the country can develop and grow at a faster rate in order to become a developed nation. It is about doing business and securing returns on investments as well as doing good by investing in Mexico, which will benefit the 120 million Mexicans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the bank's status after completing its five-year strategic plan?</h4><p>We are a relatively young bank with only 17 years of experience. However, we are also among the oldest private-sector banks established after the 1979 revolution. In order to compete with state-owned banks, which are over 80 years old and with 3,000 branches all over the country, Saman Bank started its operations by concentrating on electronic banking services and opening a limited number of branches in strategic locations. We maintain our position as being the pioneering bank in e-banking. That was the banks' strategy until 2008, when sanctions began to be imposed on the banking sector in the country. Since 2008, Saman has been focused on corporate banking and expanded its network of international correspondent banks. I am very proud to say that the status of Saman Bank, particularly in the international arena, is excellent. We are well known internationally and we have a strong reputation among European and non-European banks thanks to being at the forefront in implementing our AML and compliance units as well as quality of our services offered. Wherever we go, they know us very well. For example, I went to Vienna to meet a number of Austrian banks they are very keen to expand their operations with us and start a business relationship. We have noticed that European banks are interested in cooperating with Iranian banks, especially with Saman Bank, now that the limitations created by the sanctions, particularly for correspondent banking relationships, are over to a great extent. </p><h4>What markets are you targeting to expand your network abroad?</h4><p>First of all, we are going to establish offices in Europe. I am happy to say that we have received a license from the Central Bank of Italy to open a representative office in Rome, which will be operative soon. We also met the Italian Export Credit Agency (SACE) when the Minister of Economic Affairs of Italy visited Iran. After some encouraging talks and meetings, we built an excellent relationship to the extent that we signed an MoU in the private sector, in addition to agreements with the Central Bank of Iran. We have already started our relationship through various transactions and levels of credit between Saman Bank and several Italian companies. This agreement shows the close relationship between both countries. After Italy, we are planning to open offices in Germany and the UK. Besides European borders, we are planning to expand to India and Turkey. </p><h4>How do you assess the value of your Investment Advisory Services for domestic companies to develop international trade?</h4><p>We offer trade-financing services to the major companies in Iran. The most important part of our activities during the last six years has been focused on domestic companies involved in basic commodities, as well as pharmaceuticals firms that import raw materials from overseas and deal with major producers such as Bayer or Novartis. In fact, 40% of pharmaceuticals products and approximately 20% of basic commodities imported into Iran are handled by Saman Bank. During the last six years, we have financed an average of $5.5 billion of trade volume per annum. We are going to increase this volume of business, at least along the line of expertise that we have got experience in, but also for industries interested in our services. Moreover, we have designated a special branch exclusively to support exports of SMEs from Iran. We offer various lines of credit and we create export financing for companies that need to buy, prepare, and arrange the shipping of goods. If they are exporting their goods to various companies in the long term, we can finance their shipping documents, discount their bills, lend them, and wait for the maturity of the exchange to collect benefits from it.</p><h4>What importance do you give to the staff training through Saman Academy?</h4><p>Saman Academy is a highly useful institution for training staff. It started two years ago with an exclusive agreement with the French University of Grenoble. Every two weeks, different lecturers from Grenoble come to Iran and give lectures to our staff. The first graduates of the academy went to France to defend their thesis and got their official certificates. We also signed a contract with Euromoney International, which is going to run its third course at our academy. There are also other certificate bodies, like the Retail Bankers Academy from UK, which is going to come and provide bespoke training courses at Saman. We make sure we provide a large enough budget for training activities to ensure that our staff is well trained and hold international certifications.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the first year of operations of Nacala International Airport?</h4><p>The first year registered low amounts of both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue because only one airline was operating domestic scheduled flights five times a week. The airport started receiving international traffic within the second half of December 2015. The passenger terminal at Nacala International Airport was awarded the African Property Awards for 2015/16. As this award was for the architects of the building, it seems that the architectural design of the building, and its comfort and functionality were the most important characteristics being considered. The facility's architecture, design, and localization make this infrastructure unique in Africa.</p><h4>Compared to other countries, the prices of domestic and international flights to and from Mozambique are relatively high. How can the ADM promote greater price competition?</h4><p>Airport and air navigation charges are regulated and cannot be freely set by airports themselves. Regulation models vary from country to country. Our airline charges are not too high compared to other countries in the region. Landing charges and passenger charges are fairly reasonable, for example, but our security charges are considered relatively high. The structure of charges varies among airports. The ADM plays an important role in promoting competitiveness in terms of prices, and our main strategy is to create incentives for airlines and promote the introduction of low-cost carriers to our facilities. We recently announced an incentive scheme to encourage airlines to fly to/from Nacala International Airport. We also reduced charges for the use of passenger boarding bridges at Maputo Airport by 15%. We believe we can in the future increase the overall number of passengers and airlines operating scheduled routes to and from Maputo Airport, increase its attractiveness as well as motivate airlines to extend their operations. We also have an incentive scheme for the operational fees that apply to airport parking fees, landing, air navigation services, jet fuel, handling, and passenger catering. In order to promote the use of Nacala International Airport we propose reducing the tariffs currently in force, such as by 50% for Nacala routes to Nampula and Pemba, by 25% for regional routes to and Nacala-Addis Ababa and Nacala-Johannesburg-Nairobi, and by 25% for domestic routes in the “Ponte Aérea da Zona Norte" (Northern Region Airlift) scheme.</p><h4>How will the depreciation of the metical change trade dynamics and the level of international cargo entering via air?</h4><p>According to the expectations and traffic forecasts of Aeroportos de Moçambique, we expect an air traffic increase of about 8.5% in 2016 over 2015 due to the entry of new companies operating in our airports. They will partner with several economic sectors to achieve greater synergies and work closely with stakeholders to further increase passengers and cargo traffic. The Nacala Airport Cargo Terminal has great potential to boost economic growth. The cargo terminal is located in an economical special trade zone and agrizone and is also near a deep-sea port. The port is also set to become the country's premier logistics platform, providing connectivity to several international destinations and access to local distribution networks. Several projects being conducted in Mozambique will provide a strong impetus to the air cargo sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>As long as the airport is certified, it will work to win more traffic, particularly international routes. The coming year is expected to be one of reforms, with the gas, petrol, and agriculture megaprojects of gas, petrol, coal, and agriculture growing and bringing in increased investment and more exports. The opening of Nacala International Airport and the concentration of international traffic in the north of the country will propitiate a restructuring of flight routes, with more passengers and airline companies flying to Mozambique. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-on-the-line]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of Dalima in Mozambique?</h4><p>Dalima was created six years ago. We started with a simple idea, which was to introduce new and innovative ways to communicate across Digital Out of Home Media (DOOH Media). This is generally considered to be a luxury trend that only works in developed countries, where companies have the money to spend, and would never work in Africa. It was a new and complicated business when we entered the market, and there were no guidelines or business models from any other African Countries that we could apply. We developed our own technology in partnership with our factory. Our screens are now created accordingly to our own specifications, and are perfectly adapted to the special conditions in Mozambique. Our Business model had also to be adapt to the local market., for the first few years we had to battle the value perception of DOOH Media, to educate the market, and to make it clear that it does not have to be expensive, but could instead be approached in a more cost-effective way. Dalima's solutions are directly integrated into the community, and as a result we are a socially responsible company. We see our screens not only as instruments for DOOH communication, but also as a public information provider and a connection with the public. We support and promote several social responsibility campaigns, from driving to blood donation, and we offer a range of public utility information such as weather updates, exchange rates, and news headlines. We managed to create a name for ourselves, and to gather the support of not only the primary Mozambican brands, but also over major international brands. This support made us sustainably grow every year; we started with only three screens in 2009 (in the most iconic corner of Maputo, the Piri-Piri) and currently we have 18 screens in Mozambique, spread across three major cities, namely Maputo, Matola, and Beira.</p><h4>What are your investment and expansion plans for the near future?</h4><p>We are always aware of our clients' needs, and will continue to expand our operations in the other provinces of Mozambique. The DOOH business is a high maintenance and costly operation. To offer the best service and quality to our clients, we have our own specialized team. From motion graphic designers that are responsible for our clients' videos, to the technical team who can assemble and reassemble a full screen from the LED lamp to the cabinet, there are a lot of workers involved in our business. Over the past year we have introduced formats to the DOOH industry in Mozambique. We will continue to build landmarks, like that of the Piri-Piri circus (first curved digital screen, and the biggest in the country), making a mark on the surrounding area and continuing to introduce innovative methods of communication.</p><h4>What types of regulations apply to the digital billboards in Mozambique?</h4><p>Although it may not appear to be, this is fairly new technology for Mozambique. The regulations have only begun to grapple with the term “electronic billboards,“ but it shares the same limitations as any outdoor billboard. There is still ground to evolve, and we need to work together to present a firm and consistent regulatory system for this subject. This kind of media requires a high level of technical skill, and that should be an important element in regulatory decisions. We introduced ourselves many international recommendations, for instance our DOOH automatically reduce their brightness at night, working at full brightness during the day. When choosing the right spot to put our billboards, we conduct intense impact studies, evaluating the light impact on the nearby buildings, and also the physical integrity of the location.</p><h4>What is your strategy for setting yourself apart from your competitors?</h4><p>We always innovate and try out new technologies. Every new DOOH is fully packed, with the latest and best technology available. We know that the best technology is not always right for every situation, and that is because customer care is important. If you ignore your clients, your clients will not care for you and they will soon go somewhere else. We take this very seriously, especially in the Mozambican market. We invest in technology so we can offer a more controlled and reliable service. To achieve this, we also invest in our workers, because without them our technology cannot work properly. They are a vital part of the process. As one of the pioneers in the Southern Africa region, we have created a customized business and services portfolio. At the same time, we have gathered young Mozambican workers and developed and adapted our own technology to suit the environment in which we work.</p><h4>How have new social media technologies shaped the way you work in Dalima?</h4><p>The rapid expansion of websites such as YouTube and Instagram have changed user expectations, and digital content, such as the videos we prepare, must be more appealing. In the coming years, Mozambique will see huge growth in smartphone technology. This growth, combined with that of DOOH advertising, will offer opportunities to interact with these devices. This communications shift is changing the way we connect with the world. We are increasingly subject to more information, and that changes our expectations and needs. We are no longer satisfied with a standard product, but rather with our own version, a customized or tailored service or product. Companies like Google and Amazon are at the forefront of this evolution, and give away the control to their services to those who know best, their clients.</p><h4>What would you say are the main trends in the marketing industry in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mobile and digital are no longer the future, they are the present, and those are the biggest trends in marketing in Mozambique. Digital and social medias will continue to grow at a rapid pace, and you are already seeing a shift of attention from mainstream television and traditional outdoor advertising to a more immersive and personal kind of social and digital media.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Changes in consumer habits and technology growth are altering the effectiveness of traditional marketing campaigns. This creates a new challenge for finding correct and effective ways to reach customers. It will be a year in which we will see the integration of all digital medias. More and more people are immersing themselves in the digital era, and mobile smartphone users are growing in number. Social media and digital outdoor technologies will start to merge together to create stronger interactions and synergies. We are already testing the interactive capabilities of Dalima Digital Outdoor screens, not only on people passing by the physical screens (direct interactivity with users), but also on social media. We are working on our Client Access Program too, and this will include a smartphone application, which will allow for access to client data. We want to start giving more freedom to our clients. You will be able, for example, to see where we are displaying your ads, and can give direct feedback if you need to request changes in locations. In the future you could easily launch and manage your own campaign.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is in store for the MCTESTP in the coming five years?</h4><p>The MCTESTP aims to take a new approach to the integration of technical and vocational education, higher education, scientific research, innovation, and technological development in an articulated, hierarchical system designed to catalyze the development of Mozambique through the injection of knowledge, technology, and quality human resources. This is needed to reach the best possible performance in various socio-economic development sectors. We plan to create a situation in which technical and vocational education can train highly skilled labor for the productive sector, ensuring quality services and the retention of income in the country, which would otherwise be paid to foreign workers. We also want to enable graduates with knowhow to improve their employability and offer higher education to students with higher academic potential.</p><h4>What investments would be necessary to meet your medium-term goals and objectives for science and technology?</h4><p>All Mozambicans should have access to scientific and information technology to improve the wealth creation process and accelerate poverty eradication. Infrastructure is a key component for scientific research, technology transfer, and innovation. Although Mozambique lacks the resources to carry out major investments to this end, it does have infrastructure for conducting science and technology activities. Among those, we can mention are higher education institutions and research centers situated across the country such as the Institute of Agricultural Research of Mozambique (IIAM), the Health Research Centre of Manhica (CISM), and the Fisheries Research Institute (IIP). We have also established five centers for working on technology that will improve rice, corn, and wheat production in the provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Manica, and Tete.</p><h4>What role would you like the ministry to play in establishing innovative technology start-ups?</h4><p>The MCTESTP should continue to promote initiatives aimed at creating a favorable environment for the emergence and development of new technology-based companies. We want to strengthen their ability to undertake scientific research, to foster innovation and technological development, and to encourage scientific entrepreneurship with a view to exploring new ideas.</p><h4>How can the ministry bring science and technology to rural communities?</h4><p>All initiatives undertaken by the government should focus on improving the quality of life of Mozambicans, and special attention should be paid to the poorest people, most of whom live in rural areas. The ministry can approach rural communities through the dissemination and popularization of science and technology at fair trades and bazaars of science and technology, science competitions, and the dissemination of knowledge and local expertise through ICT initiatives.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of research and innovation for the future of developing countries?</h4><p>Scientific research is important for the development of any country, and is necessary to contribute to problem solving in various sectors, such as agriculture, through improved manufacturing techniques for increasing productivity; health, through studies for introducing vaccines for fighting malaria; or the environment, in impact studies of climate change and improving sanitation. Four main factors are necessary to carry out effective research, and the first is training human resources. Between 2015-2019, the ministry will focus on training researchers and the faculty of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) by granting postgraduate scholarships to strengthen the capacity of research to contribute effectively to the country's development and the improvement higher education studies. In Mozambique, there are few companies that invest in innovation to create more competition and subsequently aggregate economic value to their products and increase profits. In order to stimulate research and innovation for development, the ministry will proceed with the creation of an incentive framework for research and development of businesses both large and small. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>South32 was founded last May. Can you tell us about the project and the role of Mozal within the group?</h4><p>On May 25th, 2015 BHP Billiton completed its demerger, which saw the creation of South32 as an independent company. South32 is a globally diversified metals and mining company with high-quality and well maintained operations mining and producing bauxite, alumina, aluminum, energy and metallurgical coal, manganese, nickel, silver, lead and zinc in Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Colombia and Mozambique with the Mozal smelter. The roots of South32 are in the Southern Hemisphere, with a head office in Perth, and regional hubs in Perth and Johannesburg, South Africa. South32 listed in May 2015 and our securities trade on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the NY American Depositary Receipts Programme under the listing code of S32.</p><h4>What implications does this demerger have for Mozal?</h4><p>South32 operates using a regional operating model. Our businesses are run by people who understand their communities and the environment in which they operate. Our African businesses are managed from a regional hub in Johannesburg, with our Australian and South American businesses managed through Perth. There is a lot more attention being given by senior management and the CEO to developing strategies that are most suitable for the assets in operation in Africa. This integrated approach allows us to more closely align our businesses with the needs of our stakeholders and empowers us to optimize support functions regionally to deliver more efficient and productive operations. Following the demerger, Mozal became part of South32, and produces in excess of 560,000 tons of primary aluminum using Aluminum Pechiney AP35 technology to produce standard aluminum ingots. The smelter currently employs 1,200 direct employees and 700 contractors and has been a contributor to many more indirect jobs. Mozal has spent over $34 million on developing more than 200 projects for the benefit of the local community, working to provide a stronger governance framework and address various other challenges.</p><h4>How would you assess your partnership with Midal, and what effects does this partnership have on the local economy?</h4><p>Recently, Mozal signed an agreement under which it will supply 50,000 tons of aluminum to Midal, one of the world's largest manufacturers of aluminum cables. Midal can be a long-term partner for Mozal. The benefit of partnering with Midal is that it will create additional opportunities for the service industry, as certain needs are unique to Midal's operation. For example, they require reels, which they are currently importing, on which to put their cable. This represents an opportunity to produce locally, and this will have an accelerating effect in terms of creating jobs throughout the rest of the industry. There is also an opportunity to setup manufacturing facilities downstream from Midal's operations to produce a variety of goods from the cable that Midal produces. </p><h4>Which are your main export markets? And do you anticipate supplying more aluminum for the domestic market in the coming years? </h4><p>We export mostly to Europe. Of our remaining output, about 50,000 tons per annum goes to Midal. There is of course the potential to supply more of our production to the domestic market, but speculating on these developments is difficult as they depend on various factors of business confidence and the specific markets of related industries. The activities downstream from Midal should be one key area of focus. Developing this aspect would stimulate production that can be utilized in the domestic market. Once this is sustainably implemented, there could be new sources of profitability. </p><p><em>This is an uncut, unedited interview, available only to our premium subscribers.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Escopil's business divided across different sectors?</h4><p>The company is divided along its engineering and industrial activities and its IT operations. We are not a specialized company that only covers automation or focuses on just one area of engineering. We carry out electrical and mechanical maintenance and other types of activities related to maintenance, mainly in aluminum plants and the coal-mining segment. We also provide technologies for certain services like driving licenses. We are also pioneers in introducing the mobile ID technology in voter registration processes in Mozambique.</p><h4>What are some of Escopil's upcoming projects?</h4><p>In 2015 we founded Ka Matsolo Investments, a 100% Mozambican company to help the government implement its strategy of poverty reduction. This entity is meant to identify grey areas in the market that could trigger development in certain areas of industry that could help the development of industrial projects in the country. For example, in Maputo province, where the biggest industrial park in the country is located, there is a shortage of SMEs that can link big industries with the local market. The government has identified SMEs as its main strategy to tackle poverty in the country. Ka Matsolo Investments is developing a small industrial park where SMEs will have the opportunity to implement their projects in an integrated manner where clients—big industries or local companies—will have a one-stop shop for technology, services, and products. This is just one project of many to be identified and implemented in 2016.</p><h4>Diversification is an important subject on President Filipe Nyusi's agenda. What sectors should be looked at in the near future?</h4><p>Speaking as not only a Mozambican but also an African, I believe agriculture is the most important sector. People need to eat, so it will always be important. You do not need very highly skilled people and agriculture can be an industry that provides a large number of jobs. Natural resources such as oil, gas, diamonds, and gold are resources with limited lifespans. We know the oil and gas sector, for example, will not last forever, but it offers us an opportunity to invest in other areas that are more sustainable.</p><h4>How do you envision the role of public-private partnerships (PPP) in Mozambique's development?</h4><p>Many African governments are not strong enough to implement these major infrastructure projects alone, and there is no country that has the complete set of skills needed to do so. We have to work together and share the workload between the state and private entities to develop the skills and resources and ensure that the economy benefits and grows. The relationship will always be there, and although the concept of PPPs is new in Mozambique, it will develop and become stronger over time. Challenges remain, but so far it is working and the challenges are related to the rapid growth rate of these projects. We have experience in other countries where, due to the need for investment and reliable financing models, the only option is PPPs. This will ensure that the investments that are put in place can be paid back and the projects can be run in a sustainable manner.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The biggest factor is peace. If Mozambique can manage to maintain peace then its potential is unlimited. There are so many opportunities here, and all of the necessary ingredients are present. Our main projects are in the oil and gas sector, and this will serve as a major driver in the economy. One area that concerns me is the government's policies on healthcare. Officially, we are talking about 66% health service coverage in the country, and since many African countries are now talking about universal coverage, this suggests that we are far behind. As a country we need to start discussing this issue to understand the challenges and possible solutions the government and private sectors can provide. </p><p><em>This is an uncut, unedited interview, available only to our premium subscribers.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company done over the past year?</h4><p>On an operational level, it has been a good year. Our new products and services are ready to come online. We are still working on those and trying to close some more partnerships to improve these operations, but we are on the right track. In terms of marketing we did not do too well, because we did not have enough resources to complete everything that we wanted to accomplish. On the other hand, we did get some contracts for internationalization. We have been talking with a Japanese company and a deal may be finalized soon. We are also in talks with a bank in Portugal, as well as a call center in Argentina. In terms of public relations and internationalization, we expect 2016 to be much better. Our focus in terms of countries will be mainly Portuguese-speaking countries such as Portugal, Brazil, also Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Sío Tomé &amp; Prí­ncipe. If we can enter the Portuguese market, the rest will be easier to penetrate, because all those African Portuguese-speaking countries already have strong relations with Portugal. We have a good partnership with Vale of Brazil, which is a gateway for Brazilian companies entering the country.</p><h4>How important is finding, keeping, and training human capital for you?</h4><p>Human capital is the most important issue for us. Technology is great, but in five years it is obsolete and you need to replace it with the next thing. You need a good team of people, consistency, remaining  on top of the game, and they go out and figure out what technologies are needed beforehand and then implement it. We are lucky, because every one of our personnel is exceptional and has a direct input in shaping our business. We are continually training people, introducing practices that will benefit the whole company. We have an annual training plan and our own training department. We provide a lot of guidance in-house, and expect everyone to be proficient enough in all fields that they can easily take over from others who might not necessarily be involved in their line of work.</p><h4>What can the government do to further support successful start-ups like yours in Mozambique?</h4><p>They need to just keep doing what they have been doing so far. The new government has a separate department for SMEs, and that is a place where we can voice and address our issues. It tries to provide a gateway and a link between us and the organizations that are willing to help us. In IT and telecoms, the government should pay attention to improving the basis for future development in the sector. We need infrastructure that is strong enough to act as a foundation for future development and growth. For example, we want to do VOIP calls, and so there is a need for regulation in that area. Without the right regulations, it would be a mess. We need strong broadband for that, and require training for people who can provide VOIP. One of the problems in Mozambique is that very few people pay taxes, and the ones who do pay taxes, pay for everybody else. The government has to work on that. On the other hand, the government has been good at helping companies like us establish contacts outside of Mozambique. Every time the President travels, he takes a large group of businesspeople with him. That gives us an opportunity to talk to him and voice our issues, and it gives him a chance to see us talking to businesspeople from other countries, and understand what priorities he can put on the table for his government. Overall, they are doing a good job, but certainly more can be done. </p><p><em><br></em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[step-by-step]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress are you making in terms of meeting your targeted increase in annual production from 3 million to 10 million tons?</h4><p>We were expecting some improvements in the market last year, but unfortunately that did not happen and we are still producing at an annual rate of 3 million tons. The currency has been a challenge in this country and it is influencing the whole business cycle. The price of oil has dropped to well under $50 a barrel as of late 2015. Costs are increasing, especially for labor, because we have to increase salaries. We realized it would be difficult to survive without focusing on adding value. In our case, we want to convert thermal coal into consumable energy, and are collaborating with EDM and the Ministry of Minerals, Resources, and Energy. We have made some substantial progress on that project. We have received environmental clearance for the power project. We are discussing with the EDM plans to establish a power-purchasing agreement, and with the ministry to secure concession agreements. Both initiatives are important for moving ahead on the power plant. Once these phases are completed, we will move on to securing financing. We will hopefully secure financing by the end of 2016, after which point we start the construction of this project. In the first phase, we plan a 150MW production capacity, which will carry an initial estimated price of $350-375 million. By the end of this year, a report will be generated and we will have a clear idea of how much investment it will require.</p><h4>How does Jindal contribute to socioeconomic development in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have already begun construction on our planned 577 houses. Under our agreement with the community and local government, we have 60 houses under construction, with 60-70% already completed. We try to engage more contractors to expedite construction. At the same time, we are also providing compensation of around 2,000 meticals per family to help support the local community. The mines employ 650 workers. Out of those 650, almost 200 people come directly from the local community. Our first priority is to engage more people from the community. This is a remote area and finding skilled labor in the community is difficult even though we have certain training programs as a part of our CSR goals. We trained 35 people last year, and every year we work with the community hand-in-hand to help equip the youth with specific training experience from a technical institute in Tete.</p><h4>What impact does the company's restructuring in India have on the operations in Mozambique?</h4><p>We need support from our parent company in India. Of course the impact is there, but we try to optimize our cost here so that our dependence on India is minimized. We have a minimum of $2 million that we need to sustain our operations here. I do not foresee any major problems as a result of the restructuring because this is a small business compared to our overall operation. Our current investment in Mozambique is just $250,000 in the context of an $18 billion company. We only generate 2-3% of the total group revenue, so the impact of the restructuring will be minimal.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Our plan is to sign the agreement and concession for the power plant in the next three to four months. As soon as that happens, we will move forward with securing financing for the project. These are the major two targets for 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the growth of the company since last year?</h4><p>Growth has been difficult in 2015 due to the current economic conjuncture in Mozambique. We have had thus far a 9.26% growth in revenue, which is below our budget but above the current industry forecast.</p><h4><br>How many hubs does Skynet have in Mozambique and where are they located?</h4><p>We have a total of 11—one gateway in Maputo and 10 hubs in Pemba, Nampula, Nacala, Lichinga, Quelimane, Tete, Beira, Chimoio, Vilankulo, and Inhambane, while the province of Gaza is serviced through the Maputo Gateway. Next year we are also opening up a hub in Matola.</p><h4>Which provinces hold the most potential for Skynet in the next few years?</h4><p>The provinces with most potential for the future operations of Skynet in Mozambique are Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Sofala.</p><h4>What are your strategies to grow in the B2B segment?</h4><p>We foresee the potential growth to be in two distinct services, international inbound courier parcel express and domestic interprovincial distribution.</p><h4>What is the importance of an efficient logistics and transport network for the socio economic development of a country?</h4><p>A country the size of Mozambique has a great importance for the surrounding landlocked countries such as Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, which all need Mozambique's rail and road corridors to connect shipping routes to their respective countries. Therefore, an efficient network is essential not only for Mozambique's socio-economic development but also for its neighbors.</p><h4>In terms of revenues as well as trading volume, what is the importance of the Mozambican market to Skynet's overall strategy worldwide?</h4><p>Skynet Worldwide Express is the largest independently owned express network in the world providing flexible and reliable door-to-door services. Skynet's international growth is dependent on the success of each individual country to grow its market share. Africa as a whole and Mozambique in particular has huge potential economic growth and Skynet wants to be part of it.</p><h4>Electronic commerce is now a multi-trillion dollar business not only for sellers, but also for express courier services. What is the potential of e-commerce in Mozambique?</h4><p>There is great potential for e-commerce in Mozambique as there is currently very little of it. Skynet has enormous combined e-commerce knowledge and experience throughout the world, which can be rolled out almost overnight into the Mozambican market. We have recently partnered up with a few pilot projects in this field.</p><h4>What are your estimations for the growth of the express shipping market in the country for the next few years?</h4><p>We estimate trading volume growth of International Courier Express and Domestic Courier Express to be in the region of 12% and 8% respectively YoY for the period 2017-20.</p><h4>What differentiates Skynet from its competitors?</h4><p>Skynet being an independently owned express network has the possibility of being more flexible and in turn providing adapted solutions to client's needs. We have full visibility of live track and trace throughout Mozambique, which is a differentiator in regard to the majority of our competitors and our PMR service awards have distinguished us over our competitors for the past nine years. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I expect 2016 will continue to be a slow year due to the current economic conditions that are expected to extend into 2016. We expect similar trading volumes with revenue increased to inflation. However, when the megaprojects linked to LNG start we expect extra trading volumes to take place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Orlean Invest plan to expand in Mozambique?</h4><p>We started a new project in Mozambique establishing a joint venture with DNH, the local LFS, to construct the Pemba oil and gas terminal to support exploration and production activities. This project is about to begin and represents an investment of $150 million for the first stage. We hope to somehow replicate our business model from Onne, Nigeria, in Mozambique in the coming five to 10 years though this will be subject to market requirements. In Pemba we know the first phase should be ready by the end of 2016 because the new drilling campaign for Eni will start at the end of the year or early 2017.</p><h4>In the past, Orlean has concentrated on Nigeria. Do recent expansions to new markets represent a change in strategy?</h4><p>These new initiatives mark a departure for us. Until a year ago we concentrated our efforts on Nigeria because it is our main market but then our board of directors decided to continue expanding. Mozambique is considered the new “El Dorado." If you look at prices today in Mozambique, they are huge in terms of values, but still cannot be compared with Nigeria. These are two very different markets. Mozambique may be larger than Nigeria in 10 to 15 years, but not at the moment.</p><h4>In Nigeria, Intels, under Orlean Invest, is investing in Eko Atlantic, one of the largest real estate projects in Africa. What are Intels' plans for this undertaking?</h4><p>We have started phase one, which involves constructing the first three buildings. These are slated for completion by year-end 2017, and each will have on average of 220 two-bedroom apartments. We remain flexible on the number of apartments that we will put on the market as they are subject to client requests. Customers may look for anything between a one to four-bedroom apartment. We anticipate market demand being mostly for two-bedroom apartments. Our plan is to complete the entire 45 hectares and build a complete camp inside the Eko Atlantic area. To maintain a certain level of output, we need investments in the country for infrastructure. Additional investment will be come in by the beginning of the next year, subject to market trends, of course.</p><h4>What are some of Intels' other major projects?</h4><p>In Lagos we are involved in the construction of the Badagry deep sea port, which is located 16km outside the city on the way to Benin. We formalized a consortium comprised of Orlean, Oando, APMT, Maersk, and the Mediterranean Shipping Company, and Grimaldi will likely join us well. The idea is to build a new 16m draught mega port with specialized terminals. We will use Maersk, APMT, and Mediterranean Shipping Company for containers and container terminals, and, if there is need for an oil tank farm depot, we can go through Orlean. Intels can be used for shore-based facilities. Port Harcourt is in a far better position to support the industry compared to Lagos. One never knows, however. If there are significant finds close to Lagos, an oil tank farm depot could be necessary. Besides that, we are likely to be involved in the new Lekki International Airport, a project followed and managed by the Chagoury Group. The project is likely to kick off in 2016.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We hope in 2016 to see an increase in activity and the continued approval of projects. The country requires significant infrastructure development to enable the utilization of gas in the domestic market, as well as the generation of electricity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the relationship with Barclays enhance Global Alliance's branding strategy?</h4><p>We have a strong and sound relationship with Barclays, and ultimately we are part of the same group. Barclays is a household name globally, and we are trying to leverage all the opportunities that we can in terms of banking and insurance, maximizing cross-selling and bancassurance opportunities on three fronts in retail, corporate, and investment, as well as business banking. With so many competitors coming into the market, we also understand healthy competition will come with the growth of the market. If the market is not growing then dumping will come along and this brings a rollercoaster effect on the entire business and economy chain. Competition will always be there and increase, either quality or quantity wise, which is excellent for both the customer and the economy. It also brings the innovation side of businesses. We have to go back to basics and keep doing what we do best, which is offering the best services and keeping our promises to clients. The rest will come with the correct attitude in and to the market.</p><h4>How is Global Alliance's portfolio evolving?</h4><p>When the market is not growing at desirable levels and in the face of challenges, it is necessary to either maximize the productivity of the customer portfolio through new products and services, or create a new market. We have seen that the insurance market is dominated by corporate insurance and that there is a market gap in retail insurance, so we are considering tapping into this gap. Everyone talks and is waiting for oil and gas to kick in, but this is too much fuss about something that we have not yet banked; there are so many uncertainties about it. As a business, we have to think about sustainability so we can balance our earnings and growth in order to remain relevant. All businesses should devise strategies that will keep them in the game in a sustainable way, when oil and gas materializes it will be a bonus for everyone.</p><h4>What industries hold the greatest potential for growth and development?</h4><p>There are opportunities in all sectors. For Global Alliance, agriculture represents great opportunity with some 80% of the population working in the sector, although we are interested in insuring the assets for now, there is opportunity in insuring crops also. However, because of the volatility of this business, if the government could create a sort of back-up, the way that other countries have, to the insurance companies, I believe that this would be of interest to the market as a whole. We do this by working together and not individually, like a syndicate where the government is there and presents security and guidance. </p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for the local economy?</h4><p>Every single business needs to devise sustainable strategies. My personal opinion is that the expectations for oil and gas are too high for something that is still in the embryonic stage and has not materialized—there are huge uncertainties to it, and this should not be the case. We have to carry on with our businesses and if everything goes well, we all have a bonus. This is a tough year for most businesses, as there is a combination of internal and external factors that are affecting the economy. However, whenever there is a slowdown or crisis I see new opportunities, because if we are losing on one front, we have to look for another segment to compensate. From now on things can only get better. Mozambique has a bright future, and in the long term there are many opportunities to be exploited by everyone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main factors behind MOZRE's rapid growth in its early years?</h4><p>Being the first reassurance company was a major factor. People used to depend on reinsurance companies based outside of Mozambique, such as in South Africa, Mauritius, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Europe. We are not just here for the business, but also to develop the market in terms of skills development. We found that there was a gap in the market for insurance knowledge and training. We started to run short seminars in insurance for one or two days and invite insurance companies who are our clientele. We share ideas, teach, and share experiences. In addition to that, this year we introduced the Portuguese version of Certificate of Proficiency (COP) , which is the basic insurance certificate. Before that, in 2010, the Insurance Institute of Zimbabwe, which is an affiliate of the Chartered Insurance Institute of London, started providing COP and then diplomas in insurance examinations here in Mozambique, both in English. These are facilitated by MOZRE. Since 2010, over 100 people have successfully completed COP examinations. Before that, only about 20 people had the qualification.</p><h4>Do insurance and reinsurance companies have the resources to ensure large-scale projects, such the LNG project?</h4><p>We are working toward building capacity and a number of seminars have been conducted involving other reinsurance companies. For example, Africa's biggest reinsurance company, based in Lagos, conducted training in Maputo on underwriting oil and gas risks. These are major projects, and even when we do not have enough capacity in terms of capital, we spread the risks. We need to get involved, by starting small somewhere and then growing year-by-year as we build our capacity. In some cases, insurance and reinsurance companies can come up with a pool, where companies come together to build capacity in terms of capital base. They put their capital into a pool to insure petroleum interests, for example, and that pool can buy reinsurance to protect itself. It is also another way of making sure that a significant portion of the business is shared in the market. </p><h4>How competitive is the market in Mozambique, and what are the implications?</h4><p>Among our clients, the actual insurance companies, competition is tough. The reason is that there have been a number of new entrants. When we started operating in 2007 there were only five insurance companies, now there are 17. This is because there has been a lot of attention focused on Mozambican economic growth and potential investors see it as an opportunity; they want to come here and get a share of the market. The price wars among insurers are bringing down prices, and when the price is reduced, so is the profit margin. The exposure to risk is still there; however, profits are diminishing.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year has been tough for the insurance industry in Mozambique, as GDP growth has slowed. Expectations for GDP growth have fallen to 6.3% from 7.5%; therefore, we do not expect too much growth for insurance companies. When we talk to local insurance companies they say that their growth is quite slow, at 5% or less. In our case, as a reinsurer, we are protected to some extent because 45% of our business comes from outside of Mozambique. We have actually experienced growth of 22% as of September, and by the end of this year I expect our growth to be somewhere between 15-20%. The other issue is the effect of the US dollar, not only in Mozambique, but for all regional currencies. Much of our business from outside will be in dollars; therefore, when it comes here it will boost our premium in local currency. Now that the new government is in place, the major projects need to get done, and if the government is spending money, this will also be good for the insurance industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Moçambique Previdente received a prestigious award in London for the Best New Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique for 2014. What factors led to this success?</h4><p>We were the first pension fund company in Mozambique, and we started a new business with different processes and a new way of thinking. We apply our expertise in terms of technical capabilities, marketing, and human resources, and have gained a high profile. The Global Banking &amp; Finance Review commended us for our professional conduct. Our new marketing and communication strategies are expected to expand the size of our portfolio. We started off with three pension funds of around $1.4 million and then doubled that amount within a year. Among the companies doing pension funds in Mozambique, there is no ranking available. The statistics are hard to come across; however, we know for sure that we are at the forefront and we have the largest market share. In 2015, we want to not only be the Best New Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique, but the Best Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges Moçambique Previdente currently faces?</h4><p>One of the issues we are facing is a lack of understanding about saving. We have a national social security scheme and our pension funds are complementary, essentially voluntary schemes. Some people do not understand what this is or lack the required financial understanding. The other issue is that the country lacks investment. Our stock exchange only has five companies right now; hence, there are not a lot of opportunities for sourcing funding. Aside from the real estate sector, there are not many instruments for in-country investment. These will ultimately hinder the profitability of the funds. We try to seek out alternative ways of putting fund money into safe investments with good returns.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the benefit system Moçambique Previdente instituted?</h4><p>We basically understand what a client wants, what they need, and what they are doing, and we create a tailored pension fund for their system. We are working with final contribution funds and final benefit funds and in some cases, we are actually creating hybrid funds with added benefits. We include risk benefits such as funeral coverage, group life insurance, life insurance, disability, and death.</p><h4>In practical terms, how are you aligning your operations with government initiatives to further develop the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>One of the things about being a complementary pension fund is that we deal with people wanting more than what the INSS offers. They often look to us for an alternative solution. Our service provides added coverage compared to what the INSS is doing. The government wants to provide social welfare and benefits to people in the formal sector. We are also trying to increase the number of funds and increase asset value. We have to bring profits to the funds we serve and in a way we have to see where the government strategy is going.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For 2016, we are trying to provide solutions for the formal sector, such as establishing pension funds as well as providing unique products for individuals. These are our biggest aspirations for this year. We want to consolidate in terms of our investment portfolio and want to venture into real estate, not only because it dictates the growth of the country but because it is also a profitable market. We are also trying to provide solutions for SMEs, and are working to this end with a network called REDE PME. We are not only providing pension funds and social welfare to their members, but on the investment side we are looking to see how we can invest more in SMEs. We do not have a stock exchange that it active itself; however, we can invest part of our funds in their venture capital and in new businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors can benefit the most from your expertise?</h4><p>The main sectors benefiting from FirstMetical's services are the strategic sectors of the Mozambican economy: energy; infrastructure; transportation and logistics; oil and gas; as well as SMEs. We focus on bridging strategic projects to develop the Mozambican economy and the main financial markets as well as FDI. We assist SMEs to establish strategic partnerships with companies with a global action, thereby allowing the viability of their investment projects.</p><h4>How do the needs of private-sector clients differ from those of the public sector and the government?</h4><p>The private sector is still relatively undeveloped for various reasons, one of which is related to the difficulties of accessing finance and the low capitalization of SMEs. Almost all the private-sector firms have the state or public enterprises as their main customers. Private intra-business is almost nonexistent and the state is the largest purchaser of goods and services. However, the Mozambican economy has registered growth in the last 10 years and shows signs that the private sector could develop quickly, which can stimulate private intra business. Another issue is the lack of trust and information asymmetries. Service providers have greater confidence in state institutions, even though there is a delay with respect to the payment process—“state delays, but always pays.“ We would like to see a more robust Mozambican economy whereby the private sector is the driver market, as in South Africa.</p><h4>As a young company, how would you rate the overall environment for startups in the country?</h4><p>It is great that the Mozambican economy has been growing at an accelerated pace of 7-8% in the last decade, which is above the average for sub-Saharan Africa, a situation that has been accompanied by the emergence of small- and medium-sized  enterprises, even if progress is still slow. However, the business environment for startups is still tough as many entrepreneurs have great difficulties in terms of access to finance. The lack of venture capital institutions is one of the main barriers to SME development. The requirements for commercial banks to grant credit do not facilitate the development of SMEs or startups; everything revolves around collateral.</p><h4>What is your midterm outlook for the local economy?</h4><p>In the midterm the Mozambican economy will register significant growth linked to large investments taking place in energy, infrastructure, oil and gas, and mining. But it is important to continue to improve the business environment through extensive reforms, particularly with regard to the licensing of companies, the capitalization of SMEs, and ensuring a climate of peace where all are called to contribute to the development of the country. I hope there is a mobilization of the population, especially the young, to invest in the real economy, or productive sector, beyond the widespread perception that most entrepreneurs only bet on providing services or supplying goods to the public sector. It is important and urgent to mobilize young people around agriculture and livestock production to make the country less dependent on imports of basic products such as tomatoes, onions, potatoes, and meat.</p><h4>What are your main targets and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The main objective of FirstMetical for 2016 is to consolidate its position as a company of excellence in the Mozambican market, and for regional and global action through strategic partnerships. We want to position ourselves as a leading business advisory service provider in Mozambique focused on corporate financial consulting, strategic investments, and corporate transactions. We expect the country to grow and the planned investments in the sectors of natural resources, including oil and gas, mining, energy, and transport and logistics infrastructure, to be implemented in the medium term. We want the market to view FirstMetical as a company committed to helping customers achieve excellence and competitiveness in their business, thus contributing to the growth and development of the Mozambican economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-best-not-the-biggest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights for Barclays in 2015?</h4><p>We had two main goals for 2015. One of these was to build and expand our brand. We reshaped our strategy at the beginning of 2014, and one of the ideas that emerged from that was to position our brand in a different and unique way in this market. Last year was really the first complete year of this new strategy. Our other goal was more related to redesigning our financial operations, given that in recent years our operation was not as profitable as before; therefore, it became critical for us to create a more sustainable business model. We have succeeded in both of these goals. According to the midterm results, and our end of year projections, we have returned to fourth position in the sector, when measured by total revenue, which is our benchmark. Our revenue line is growing faster than the market average, and we are gaining business in sectors and places where we were not that competitive before. We have what we call a corporate-led strategy, and our franchise is in fact quite strong, and certainly ready to continue growing in the coming years.</p><h4>What is the role of innovation at Barclays, and how do you assess the receptiveness of the Mozambican market to new technologies?</h4><p>There is innovation that is visible to the customer but also innovation that we introduce to gain more efficiency and eventually to provide a more convenient service to our customers. Banks are increasingly exploring the potential of digital services. Mozambique is growing so fast that there is a lot of competition in chasing new business and retaining existing business. Throughout 2014, we introduced a number of digital platforms and some quite interesting innovations that we were still busy rolling out in 2015. The one that is unique is an ATM with deposit taking functionalities. No other bank in the country offers that. We have seen a lot of uptake from customers, though it did take a little while. In the fourth quarter, we also looked at rolling out more products and unique initiatives, such as the World Miles Platinum Credit Card, which Barclays has been introducing around the world. There are also some other sophisticated platforms that we are bringing to corporate customers, but they are not so evident in the marketplace. We have brought in BARX, which is a trading platform for foreign currency, wherein large corporates can trade different currencies online from their offices, linked to the Barclays systems. Other solutions are very much designed to meet the needs of large corporates where, for example, it integrates with SAP on clients' accounting systems, in which orders introduced in the banking system will be reflected in their own accounting systems. This is a major convenience for organizations that have millions of transactions and manage treasury functions centrally.</p><h4>What are Barclays' goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal is clear—we want to be the best bank in Mozambique, not the largest. It is important to know how we measure ourselves, and not just focus on the market challenges and competition. We want to affirm our presence as a truly local, regional, and global bank, as we understand the country and believe we offer services at the same quality level, if not better, than all of our competitors in the market, especially in the corporate and investment sectors and toward our affluent customers. We have gained of a lot from the knowledge about specific sectors and markets from which we operate. We really want to make 2016 the year in which we consolidate this ambition for corporate and investment banking, for commercial clients, and for premier and prestige clients. We are on the right track and I have no doubt that we will be able to fulfill our vision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the current state of Mozambique's transport and logistics infrastructure?</h4><p>Expansion in transport infrastructure, ports, roads, and railways is recognized as fundamental to Mozambique's development plan for mining, agriculture and tourism. Traditionally transport and logistics infrastructure provided for half of Mozambique's annual revenue, transporting mining and agro-products from its landlocked hinterland to Europe and Asia. However due to historic reasons, investment and expansion of ports, railways, and roads has not been consistent and the business shifted to South Africa. Grains, metals, and minerals exported from Zambia and Zimbabwe are routed through Durban and Richards Bay, even though Mozambican ports still handle some of the import requirements such as fuel. There have been some expansion investments in Beira, such as the new coal terminal. However, enhancing the ability for Ports such as Maputo and Beira to receive larger vessels would make them more competitive. Aligning the management and concession policies for transport infrastructure to ensure investment in port, rail, and road infrastructure to compete with South African ports will bring back iron ore, coal and commodity exports to Mozambique.</p><h4>What is the role of Anfrena in Mozambique's ports infrastructure development?</h4><p>Anfrena was involved in the engineering and construction of the Maputo Fuel Terminal and added LPG and Bitumen Terminals to Maputo Port and is currently constructing it in Beira Port. Anfrena has designed and constructed the tank farm expansion for Petromoc and Puma in Maputo and Beira and the bulk fuel terminal and tank farms for Vale in Moatize. Anfrena is one of the few Mozambican companies specialized in terminal design and development of Petroleum downstream distribution infrastructure design and construction. </p><h4>Mozambique has vast unexplored mineral resources. What are Mozambique Holdings' current and future initiatives in the mining industry?</h4><p>Mozambique Holdings' role as a developer in the mining sector is more long term, because of the depressed values for metals and minerals and the comparatively large and long term investment required. However, opportunities exist for our engineering division as EPC contractors.</p><h4>Potable water facilities were available to less than 25% of Mozambican population in the early 1990s. What role did Afrodrill play in the significant increase of that number?</h4><p>We have been involved in water resources development through Afrodrill for over a decade. Due to the adaptability and comparative cost advantages of Indian technology, and skilled manpower for rural water resources development, we have been very successful in Zambezia, Nampula, and Sofala. The National Directorate of Water (DNA) has maintained ambitious water coverage targets to ensure access to drinking water for every citizen. We have worked with DNA to develop project profiles and geotechnical studies and have presented these to potential donors and investors for funding support. The government of India and other donors like UNICEF and World Vision have responded and are funding rural drinking water resource development, executed by Afrodrill, in Zambezia, Nampula, and Sofala since 2004. This effort coordinated by DNA has raised the drinking water coverage from the 25% percent in early 2000 to current levels of over 60%.</p><h4>Mozambique jumped 15 places in the Ease of Doing Business rank. It currently ranks at 127 out of 189 economies. As a foreign businessman, how would you rate regulatory efficiency in Mozambique and what changes would you like to see in the regulatory framework?<br></h4><p>Mozambique, at the political level, intends to attract and encourage foreign investment and entrepreneurship to develop its resources through imported technology and services. It has to be streamlined and reconciled with the aspirations of local Mozambicans to be skilled and employed, and encouraging indigenous entrepreneurship. The imported technology and manpower should adapt and evolve into a Mozambican concept in the local context over time.</p><h4>What will be the main focus of Mozambique Holdings' strategy for the years to come?</h4><p>Our medium-term focus will be to consolidate our strengths in core sectors to provide more efficient state-of-the-art design, technology, and services and at lower costs through skills and efficiency accumulated over time.</p><h4>How will you envision Mozambique's mid-term economic future?</h4><p>Mozambique is blessed with plenty of resources that have yet to be explored and exploited. However, there are also challenges related to attracting investments and technology to develop these resources and train and equip Mozambicans to become entrepreneurs and skilled technicians, thus becoming profit centers contributing to the cost of governance. Policy and planning have to balance the expectations of the population for immediate consumption and betterment of their living standards. There will be austerity and astute planning to apply limited resources to the more essential requirements. I believe Mozambique's progress and future is well planned on sound fundamentals and that the government has the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to the teething problems of this young economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Many South Africans are accustomed to the Mozambican hospitality. It is a hospitality that always reminds us of our past, a past that should never be forgotten. We speak of a past when hundreds of South Africans, escaping the cruel apartheid system, descended onto the shores of this great nation. These South Africans were warmly embraced with solidarity by the Mozambican people. This is a country that played a critical role in the fight against apartheid. We talk of Mozambique, a country that lost a leader and a President to that regime. The only sin of President Samora Machel was that he took a principled stand against the unjust system of apartheid.</p><p>This history needs to be told and retold to the current and future generations. This is a history that tells a story that we are indeed one. We share the same history, culture, and ancestry. We speak the same languages and, most curiously, we share the same dreams, those of socioeconomic prosperity for all of us. That political and historical bond must now translate into improved economic cooperation.</p><p>Our partnership over the years has yielded satisfactory results as evidenced by the existence of 60 bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding. These legal instruments cover a wide range of sectors, including transport, trade, investment, energy, security, and the environment, as well as tourism, science and technology, water, immigration, communications, sports, arts and culture, and agriculture and mining.</p><p>There is still a need to provide momentum to further strengthen our economic relations by enhancing cooperation among our respective government departments and institutions. This would inevitably result in increased trade and investment between our two countries and importantly also further promote intra-African trade.</p><p>We also encourage more robust interaction between our respective business sectors. We are of the strong opinion that their interaction will further strengthen our economic ties and bring us closer to the achievement of our aspirations of growing our respective economies for the mutual benefit of all.<br>We are particularly encouraged that to date there are over 300 South African companies doing business in Mozambique, resulting in the steady growth in trade and investment between our countries. We believe that these companies have in no small measure contributed to the growth and development of the Mozambican economy.</p><p>For a decade now, Mozambique has been one of our top trading partners on the continent. This demonstrates the interdependency of our countries. Our bilateral partnership was enhanced in 2011, when we signed an agreement establishing a Bi-national Commission between our two countries. This means that every year the heads of state will meet to discuss strategic issues of bilateral importance.</p><p>There is no doubt that this will create the required momentum for the implementation of all the signed agreements and memoranda of understanding. Mozambique and South Africa share common values of democracy, respect for human rights, and social justice. We should continue to build on our historical relationship to pursue these values. These shared values provide a firm foundation for cooperation beyond bilateral relations. We pursue these values not only within the broader SADC family but also at a continental level.</p><p>Our collaboration is epitomized by our work together within the SADC in pursuit of regional integration, peace, security, and stability. We need to double our efforts for regional economic integration. As a region, we have demonstrated a collective resolve to do that pursuant to the adoption on April 29, 2015 of the SADC Industrialization Strategy as well as the Revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan.</p><p>The full implementation of these noble and visionary strategies and plans cannot be overemphasized. We need to decentralize industrialization through the identification of cross-border projects. The involvement of the private sector is inevitable and as governments we need to encourage their involvement and participation.<br>I also remain encouraged by our common partnership as reflected in our shared vision for the promotion of multilateralism, continental integration, South-South cooperation, and the reform of the UN and its institutions. We are committed to working hard each day to ensure that current and future generations benefit from the historical bonds of our two nations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much progress has Mozambique made in the past five years in terms of improving the ease of doing business?</h4><p>By various metrics, including the World Bank's Doing Business report, Mozambique has made tremendous progress. In Doing Business 2015, Mozambique climbed 15 steps compared to 2014, bringing the country to 127th position, in contrast with the 142nd place it occupied in the previous year. The World Bank highlights progress in areas such as property registration, availability of credit, and resolving insolvency as areas with the most significant improvement. The process of company incorporation has been simplified over the years. Today, you can complete all the necessary steps in a matter of just a few days provided that the investor presents all the required documentation. It is far simpler today than it was 10 years ago.</p><h4>What is CPI's strategy to attract medium-sized international businesses?</h4><p>Large projects play a major role in Mozambique's economy by boosting national production and exports and by creating jobs, both directly and indirectly. Indirect jobs appear as a consequence of many small and medium-scale enterprises that emerge as suppliers of goods and services for these megaprojects. CPI will continue to play a role to attract and, more importantly, retain private investment in Mozambique through various platforms. We also provide institutional assistance to investors from project inception to implementation. Substantial fiscal incentives are also provided under the Investment Law for investors. The government has also established special economic zones throughout the country where investors can enjoy special fiscal benefits. These zones include the Beluluane Industrial Park, home to one of the largest aluminum smelters in the southern African region (MOZAL), Beira Mungassa in the central province of Sofala, and the Nacala Special Economic Zone in the northern province of Nampula. We also have what we call rapid development zones for investments in agriculture, agro-industry, industry, tourism, lumbering, and other sectors that, according to feasibility studies, can bring high returns.</p><h4>What can be done to transform the agricultural sector from subsistence farming to a more efficient and productive agro-industry?</h4><p>Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in Mozambique due to its potential in terms of a tropical climate, abundant and competitive labor, and availability of arable land—currently estimated at 35 million hectares. Agriculture has had major impact in the economy through the production of various cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, soy beans, and others, as well as strategic food crops such as maize, rice, and different vegetables and fruits. We need more investment in order to boost this strategic sector of the economy, which is also the source of livelihood for about 80% of our population. We need to attract commercial farmers from our region and from other parts of the world who can involve and employ subsistence farmers through various mutually beneficial schemes. The local population is provided with adequate inputs such as tools, seeds, and fertilizers. In fact, Mozambique alone could feed the SADC region and Africa at large with the crops that are unique to the country.</p><h4>What are CPI's goals and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect more investment at levels much higher than last year, as well as the implementation of a large number of projects approved in areas such as logistics, mineral resources, and energy. In 2014 alone, we approved 500 projects with a total value of $7 billion. We also expect to have more Mozambicans trained in different strategic areas, such as oil and gas, geology, and mining some of the sectors where we still lack human capital. We hope to expand our presence within the country and abroad to further facilitate the investment approval processes. We also hope to see collaborations with the different institutions involved in the process of investment project approval so that the process can be much faster. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-relationship-that-unites]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In the year of the 40th Anniversary of Mozambican independence, the relationship between our two countries has acquired a dynamism never before seen, and we now enjoy an undeniable proximity. We have, on both sides, the political will necessary to promote the deepening of our bilateral relationship and to facilitate contact between the various institutes, entrepreneurs, and artistic and cultural leaders, and, above all, between our brother nations. The ties that bind us together have an exceptional character, because they are fundamentally based on friendship and mutual respect.</p><p>The visit of His Excellency represents another important contribution to reinforce the political, cultural, and economic links between our nations. I would like to highlight the dedication that we have put into the Portuguese Presidency of G-19 in relation to our support for Mozambique's State Budget. We will try to contribute to the strengthening of the country's development as promoted by the Mozambican Government. The Portuguese commitment to remain a trustworthy cooperation partner of Mozambique's is equally serious. <br>We live in times marked by a certain level of instability and of serious threats to the rights, values, and freedoms that have represented such a remarkable contribution to the improvement of living standards throughout the world. In the face of challenges such as terrorism, human trafficking, and other brutal demonstrations of intolerance, the example of relationships between countries that search for stability, friendship, mutual respect, and the common good has become increasingly important. These are the relationships that unite Portugal and Mozambique. In this changing world, it is difficult but necessary to reinforce—especially among young people—the values of stability and dialog, as well as the basic principles of peace, democracy, human rights, and economic and social development. </p><p>This is also the reason why the relationship between our countries can be considered a unique asset, both from a political perspective and from the perspective of the contacts between our citizens and of world of commerce. The Mozambique-Portugal Business Forum clearly contributes to the encouragement of commercial and investment links between both countries. In a time when Portuguese enterprises have been evidencing their capacity and competitiveness by opening up to new markets and by establishing new partnerships, Mozambique deserves special attention. The economic dynamism foreseen for Mozambique in the coming years, further strengthens the opportunities that tend to emerge from its economy. Most of the Portuguese enterprises had chosen to invest in Mozambique long before the exciting perspectives of natural resources became known. Portuguese entrepreneurs did not wait for the coal and gas discoveries to give proof of their trust in Mozambique as a country that is really worth investing in.</p><p>Statistics from the Investment Promotion Centre in Mozambique have allowed us to analyze how the Portuguese community and their investments have contributed to the Mozambican economy. Portuguese direct investment has reached almost $1.745 billion, and Portuguese investors have created the most jobs in Mozambique out of all foreign investors. The number of jobs created by Portuguese investors has reached 42,000 since 2008. I believe that this data is sufficiently expressive and exemplifies our entrepreneurs' faith in Mozambique. We are convinced that together, we will go further, with a sense of partnership and mutual advantage. Although the economic dimension is naturally important in the relationship between Portugal and Mozambique, our connections are far from merely commercial in character.</p><p>As I have already had the opportunity to mention, Portugal and Mozambique are also united by friendship. This friendship is only possible between nations that know each other well, and which value and respect each other. The relationships between the civil societies of both countries bring, in this matter, an essential benefit. However, it is the cultural and artistic creators that are the ones we have to thank for fostering the knowledge and admiration which we have for one another. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Mozambique and Angola are connected by deep historical ties, particularly in terms of the solidarity reached through the fight for the liberation of our people, which led to independence of both countries in 1975.</p><p>Sons of our nations, such as Eduardo Mondlane, Samora Machel, and Agostinho Neto, who cleared the ground for the independent and sovereign states of today, must keep the flame of dignity and prosperity alight for future generations. Now that we have overcome the worst period of this struggle, we must focus our attention on the consolidation of peace and economic cooperation, founded on the excellent political and diplomatic relations that exist between these two countries. We are also both entering the same geopolitical space in the same sub-regional organizations. </p><p>Ever since the 1978 and the General Agreement for Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation, which led to the creation of the Bilateral Cooperation Committee, our diplomats and functionaries have been meeting regularly. These organizations are needed to improve and expand our relations, especially in institutional and managerial terms, through the public and private sectors. </p><p>We already developed bilateral cooperation in many sectors, and this is improved through mutual effort. We hope that these efforts help to support agriculture, fishing, tourism, banking, geology, mining, commerce, security, and public order. We also wish to promote an exchange of experience in the areas which we have seen success, such as education, combating hunger and poverty, and the exploitation of oil and gas. </p><p>We have noticed with satisfaction the benefits of activities related to Cooperation Protocol between Angola's Ministry of Territory and Mozambique's Ministry of State and Administration. It would be desirable to extend this cooperation experience in terms of jobs and professional formation, which are crucial for the ongoing economic diversification and promotion of small and medium sized companies, to increase production of services and goods in our countries. As a partner country, Angola will maintain support and be trusting and available to engage in initiatives that will benefit both countries. </p><p>Being in the same African region, we have a common fate. As a result, we must share reflections to adopt common policies, which can handle the wishes and expectations of our people. Our institutions are open to dialog at all levels, aware that from the discussion a light will shine to guide our paths in the search for solutions to our challenges we face in the process of peace consolidation, stability, security, development, and prosperity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are things changing in Peru's education sector?</h4><p>The Peruvian postgraduate university system is poorly positioned in Latin America and the quality of the service needs to be increased. This is closely related to the academic level of the teachers and the need to update the curricula, infrastructure, and equipment, all of which are necessary to improve the conditions of teaching, learning, and scientific research. In Peru, there are 142 universities, which is more than in the UK, where there are only 123; however, in the prestige rankings only one Peruvian university appears among the top 500 in the world. Among the first 700, 10 are Argentine, 12 Brazilian, seven Chilean, five Colombian, two Uruguayan, two Venezuelan, and only three Peruvian. Where are the other 139 Peruvian universities? No matter the cost, all Peruvian universities should be subject to quality assessments by organizations, such as SACS in the US, to have an accurate diagnosis of their academic status and their future. CENTRUM developed a strategic plan for the entire education sector in Peru, and it has identified six opportunities to be taken into consideration that are related to the variety in the market, competitive prices, increased demand, greater access to ICT, increased quality of education, and specialization. Nevertheless, we also identified seven threats; among them are the low education level of teachers, students, professional talent leakage (brain drain), inadequate research regarding environmental management, and schools with no international accreditation.</p><h4>How would you characterize access to higher education in the country?</h4><p>Not all professionals can have access to higher education for two reasons: school costs and lack of proximity. CENTRUM Católica is in 10 of the largest cities of Peru. It is also present in Colombia and in Ecuador, with programs tailored to their respective realities and needs. CENTRUM is one of the most expensive schools in the local market, although its prices are well below our peers abroad. The quality and nature of our programs are at the level of those offered by the most respected schools in the world. With the PUCP being a nonprofit university, the prices of our programs are directly related to the costs of maintaining the high quality and standards that we hold, while giving students the necessary guarantee of the product they are purchasing. We understand that whoever joins our programs is making an investment. </p><h4>What are the main milestones that CENTRUM has achieved over the past years? €¨</h4><p>The quality of a business school is reflected in its accreditation; the main business school accreditation associations are AACSB, EQUIS, and AMBA. The processes for accreditation take years, concluding with a series of audits by renowned business school directors and deans. One of the most important achievements of CENTRUM Católica is to have achieved all three accreditations in just 10 years, something that has not yet been accomplished by our local competitors that have more than 54 years of existence.</p><h4>In terms of academic programs, what additions have you made recently to keep CENTRUM competitive? <br></h4><p>In 2014, we launched a MBA program with a tri-continental component that includes five months of courses in two business schools in North America and Europe, as well as intensive co-participation with students from around the world during seven months at CENTRUM Católica. In 2016, we are about to launch a double-degree program (CENTRUM Católica and another school) that brings together the MBA degree as a Master of Science in Food Management. This intense, bilingual program is aimed at managers or executives of companies in the global food industry who look forward to strengthen the managerial skills. In 2014, standing at the forefront of Online Education, we launched centrumX, which has become the meeting point for professionals, entrepreneurs and students looking to improve their skills at a management level through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) plus graduate courses. The CentrumX platform is an online classroom where participants can learn at their own pace, from wherever they are, whenever they want and free of charge. We currently have 11 MBA courses and five executive education courses. We will be adding another 16 MBA courses to the system before the end of the year.</p><h4>In which research areas is CENTRUM supporting the development of the country? </h4><p>CENTRUM Research has five research centers specialized in the areas finance and economics; leadership, innovation and strategy; social responsibility, entrepreneurship, and sustainability; and industry and marketing. All the research centers strike the fine balance between the academic and the applied research in their concern for the needs and betterment of society. The expert faculty members are from various countries from all over the globe, and they actively participate in the weekly seminars organized by CENTRUM Research, as well as in exchanging their research outcomes through conferences, newspapers, television, radio, etc. The activities of CENTRUM Research are national and international, and include conducting joint research projects with schools such as Cornell University and the University of Malaya.</p><h4>What are you doing to further attract the international community to CENTRUM? </h4><p>By being simply the best we can be. In 2015, CENTRUM was recognized by the Financial Times of London for our GLOBAL MBA program in Colombia and Peru ranked No. 52 among the top 100 schools in the world in its Executive MBA Ranking. Furthermore, our Virtual International Managerial MBA Program was ranked 13th worldwide in its Online MBA Program Ranking, and our Executive education was ranked 75th in the world in that category. Likewise, the rankings of Eduniversal Ranking (2011 - 2012), (2013 — 2014), (2014 — 2015) placed CENTRUM Católica as the No.1 in Latin America. These rankings position CENTRUM Católica at an academic level of global excellence. CENTRUM Research produces on average 25 peer-reviewed ISI-category journal publications, 24 peer-reviewed non-ISI-category journal publications, 25 books, 20 book chapters, and 45 additional articles. It also organizes international research conferences in association with the Eastern Academy of Management - International, the Operational Research Society of India, and others. One of its achievements has been the creation of a regional competitiveness index. Furthermore, CENTRUM Research has been conferred several awards for its theoretical and empirical contributions, adding to our attractiveness to our international community.</p><h4>What are your main goals and targets for 2015? What is your vision for CENTRUM for the coming decade? </h4><p>CENTRUM is working hard to position itself among the top 50 business schools in the world by strengthening its relationships and programs, increasing its production of research, and gradually having all our programs taught in English. Regarding infrastructure, a 15,000sqm expansion of the campus is planned. In addition, before the end of 1Q2016, all classrooms will be technologically updated as part of our ongoing effort to stay ahead with the latest technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about BTS Group's origin and how it came to own and operate the only privately held mass transit track in the world?</h4><p>My father started the company 40 years ago. We used to be exclusively in property—including hotels and residential developments—but he decided to bring our company to the next level and link it with mass transit. We signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for 30 years with the government to build and operate 100% of the mass transit system, making it the only privately run mass transit system in the world. We receive all the income for 30 years and will later transfer it to the government. Frankly, we were fortunate with this contract, as the government no longer does contracts like this, whereby it gives a private company 100% control of a major project like mass transit. This is our dominant business currently, accounting for 40% of revenue. However, the company now operates three other business pillars, namely property, advertising, and services, through our payment system Rabbit Card. </p><h4>How do you think the mass transit system can expand further?</h4><p>There are ambitious expansion plans with new routes to be added to the network, with some of the expansion planned to integrate with other systems like the underground or trams. Bangkok currently has 85km of mass transit lines; however, the government's target is 515km in 15-20 years, which is a massive expansion plan. Right now, the economy is not doing too well, but the government continues to invest in infrastructure, and expansion will continue in line with the government's plans over the next 30 years. In Bangkok, only 6% of people travel on rail, with 90% using buses. Compared to other cities like Singapore, Hong Kong, or Seoul, where 40-50% of people use rail transit, 6% is tiny and indicates a huge opportunity. As the system expands, people will shift more from road to rail. Currently, we are operating 36km of mass transit lines in the city but the target in the next five years is to add an additional 108km. That figure will, of course, grow as the system expands in subsequent years.</p><h4>Are there any other major rail projects that you are looking at? </h4><p>There is the High Speed Rail project, which will pass through Bangkok; however, it is a huge investment that has to be a government-to-government project. A private company on its own would not go into that, as the returns would not be great and the costs would be extensive. Governments could do it and make returns through the long-term impacts of that system, through taxes, transport, trade, tourism, and so on. One project that we are, however, interested in is the dual track project. We have the expertise and the experience for that project, and we are also ready financially. We are in close discussions with the government on that project. The new government has been aggressively pursuing mass transit and railroad projects, which will benefit the Thai population, and so we expect significant development in the coming years.</p><h4>You have four distinct but integrated sectors that you operate in. How do you see these evolving in the future?</h4><p>In property, we have a strategic alliance to develop 25 projects in the next five years, worth about THB100 billion with our joint venture partner Sansiri. These projects are all in close proximity to mass transit lines. Three projects worth THB11 billion have been launched and fully pre-sold.  An additional six projects valued at THB 23bn will be launched this year. On the media side, through our subsidiary, VGI Global Media, we are evolving from a Bangkok-centric media company to a nationwide integrated media platform with six key segments, namely transit, office, outdoor, aviation, digital, and activation. In particular, we are looking to enter the upcountry media market that has been long under served. Finally, as mentioned, we have the Rabbit Card, a payment card that you can use on our transit system as well as with our retail partners. We are now extending this to become an e-wallet. In addition to being a payment platform, it gives us information on people's behavior, such as where they eat, shop, and travel, which can feed back into our advertising operations. The social media platform LINE, which is extremely popular in Thailand, offers a payment solution called LINE Pay. We will start a partnership with LINE Pay, and by the end of 2016 we will launch Rabbit LINE Pay, which will replace LINE Pay and Rabbit Card. That gives us nationwide coverage and with LINE we can cover 50% of the population. While the sectors in which we operate are distinct, our evolution and the integration of these operations have been natural.</p><h4>What are your expectations for BTS Group in the year ahead?</h4><p>Mass transit is still our core business and we want to secure the upcoming green line extension projects and others, including the pink line. We are also eager to participate in the dual track project, where we have the expertise to run the dual track trains, although we do not yet have the experience in cargo and logistics. The government has stated strongly its intention to expand investments and projects in mass transit and other transportation projects, and I believe it is extremely serious about it. The purple line will open this August, while the green line extensions have been transferred back to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). All these demonstrate the extent to which the government is pushing mass transit forward. We have recently signed a train procurement contract to purchase an additional 184 carriages, the largest single purchase of trains in Thai history. We plan more investments in rolling stock for both existing lines and the lines projected to be added to the mass transit system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The number of electronic Health Cards issued by the Ministry of Health in the first half of 2015 alone has increased by 13.5%. What data is stored on these cards, and how does this system contribute to the development of healthcare infrastructure?</h4><p>The application of this system started in December 2007. The objective behind the introduction of this system was to improve control over people's health and quickly create a database of public health. The data stored on Health Cards accumulates in the Health Ministry's Information Center. The data (date of an illness, examination, treatment, medication prescribed, inoculations, medical insurance, etc.) allows the card holder the opportunity to undergo prompt and precise examinations. Data on newborns is uploaded to the system by maternity hospitals or maternity departments of other hospitals that subscribe to the system. The data stored on the microchips of these plastic cards gives holders the opportunity to undergo quality, effective, and prompt examination and treatment and enables the registration of medicines provided to the vulnerable population. To date, a total of 1,060,803 people have received electronic Health Cards and the process is under way.</p><h4>How does the Ministry assist aspiring medical students in Azerbaijan to study at medical facilities and universities abroad, and how does this help advance the domestic medical industry?</h4><p>Governed by the objective enshrined in the State Program on educating Azerbaijani youths in foreign countries, numerous Azerbaijani medical students have attended courses at leading European clinics. In addition, doctors of medicine from Europe have organized different theoretical and practical courses in Azerbaijan. In 2015, a total of 335 medical students took advantage of this state-funded program and medical students from Azerbaijan were involved in theoretical and practical exercises organized by specialists from the Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Studies, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Minsk Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, and the American Heart Association. Azerbaijani doctors also attended courses held in Turkey, Japan, Italy, Russia, Israel, and Belarus. As part of our efforts to expand international relations, we organized a residency program for young doctors in Germany and Turkey. The overall level of healthcare in the country very much depends on the knowledge and competence of doctors. This is exactly why the Baku branch of Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University was established in 2015. Addressing the opening ceremony, the graduate and honorary professor of this University, Mehriban Aliyeva, said the opening of Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University in Baku would contribute greatly to the training of qualified medical doctors in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How has cardiac surgery progressed in Azerbaijan in recent years?</h4><p>Cardiac surgery, including pediatric cardiac surgery, is developing rapidly in the country. The head of state always keeps this area in the spotlight. Operations on the heart require immense resources and a high level of professionalism. In the past, Azerbaijani citizens would go abroad for heart surgery, but now citizens of a number of neighboring countries are now coming to Azerbaijan for operations of this nature. The cardiac operations performed in leading European and American clinics are now carried out with equal success at the Azerbaijan Children's Surgical Center. In 2015 alone, the medical institutions of the Health Ministry carried out around 2,000 cardiac operations. There have been newborns who underwent surgery on the first and fourth day of their lives, or weighed 2.5kg. The Surgical Center currently performs operations on such congenital heart disorders as Tetralogy of Fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, cardiac ventricular insufficiency, transposition of the great arteries, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome, for example. Our doctors are not lagging behind their foreign counterparts and we intend to further expand on this. The government continues to create suitable conditions for our doctors to brush up on their knowledge and skills in foreign countries.</p><h4>How is the Health Ministry involved in the organization of the Formula One Grand Prix in Baku?</h4><p>The Health Ministry is taking all necessary measures related to the organization of the Formula One European Grand Prix in Baku. Qualified teams of doctors and clinics with the latest medical equipment will be available to representatives of all teams, participants of the competition, and visitors to Azerbaijan during the competition. Our doctors are already experienced in providing services during high-profile events. The inaugural European Games held in Baku last year were also a huge test for Azerbaijan's healthcare system. Around 900 doctors were involved in the provision of medical services during the Games. Medical aid stations were set up in the Olympic village, as well as competition venues in Baku and Mingachevir. A total of 6,381 people applied for and received qualified medical aid during the Games. International health experts gave a very high assessment to the level of medical services provided. Our health workers are ready to provide visitors and participants with a high level of service during the Formula One European Grand Prix in Baku.</p><h4>The 2015 parliamentary election in Azerbaijan signaled the beginning of a new era in the country. What objectives does the Health Ministry intend to accomplish in 2016?</h4><p>The effective social policy pursued by the government has paved the way for the dynamic development of healthcare in Azerbaijan. A number of important health laws, state programs, and other regulatory acts have been adopted on the initiative and under the leadership of the head of state. The material and technical infrastructures of health facilities have been upgraded, new medical technologies have been built, examination and treatment methodologies were applied, and measures were taken to train qualified medical professionals. New medical facilities fitted with the most sophisticated medical equipment are being established throughout the country as part of the State Program on the socioeconomic development of the regions of Azerbaijan. This work is financed from the state budget and the state investment fund. In 2016, we plan to commission the Scientific Research Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Central Reference Laboratory of the National Station for Town's Disease, central hospitals of the Agsu, Bilasuvar, and Zardab districts, and other medical facilities. Thanks to the improved infrastructure of our existing medical facilities, the introduction of new technologies, and the stable provision of medicines and food, the volume and quality of our services has dramatically improved. The level of services provided in priority spheres of healthcare have signification improved, especially in areas such as mother and child health, diabetes, hereditary blood diseases, chronic kidney insufficiency, tuberculosis, and immunological prophylaxis of infectious diseases. The adoption of state programs on the protection of mother and child health has led to a reduction in child diseases and infant mortality. Regular medical examinations of children have also played an important part. According to our initial estimates, more than 92% of kids underwent checkups as part of this campaign in 2015. Of these, 6% required treatment, and half of those have been discharged following relevant treatment. Major strides have also been made in treating hereditary blood diseases within the framework of state programs. More than 15,000 people applied to the National Thalassemia Center in 2015. At present, more than 2,500 patents are receiving regular treatment at the Center. I am proud to say that the National Thalassemia Center can successfully conduct bone marrow transplantation operations, which represents a radical methodology of treating hereditary blood diseases. In 2014-2015, a total of 25 children underwent bone marrow transplantation surgery. The material and technical infrastructure of medical institutions specialized in oncological treatment has been improved and the installation of positron emission tomography, which is considered to be the most advanced diagnostic method, has been completed at the National Oncological Center. The number of people suffering from chronic kidney insufficiency and receiving hemodialysis treatment has also increased in Azerbaijan. Despite this, the problem of hemodialysis treatment in the country has been fully resolved. A total of 2,800 patients are provided with hemodialysis treatment in 34 hemodialysis centers, including 26 in the districts. The number of kidney transplantation operations, which represents a radical method of treatment of such patients, is also increasing. The number of surgical operations involving the application of advanced technologies is growing by the year. In 2015, four children with congenital hearing problems underwent cochlear implantation operations for the first time in our history. Such surgical operations have been possible thanks to the availability of adequate infrastructure and qualified professionals. One of the key directions in the development of healthcare is education and personnel training. This area too has seen great progress. The specialized training of medical personnel in the country is carried out during residency. Residency is now provided by 40 clinics, which is four times more than in earlier years. The development of modern information technologies and the application of electronic software are among priority directions of the Ministry. With this aim, a single database of the healthcare system has been developed and work is now under way to enable its linkages with other databases. The electronic system of monitoring infectious diseases, which has received praise of the World Health Organization, is always being improved. Azerbaijan is now regularly represented on legislative bodies of the WHO. From 2005-2008, Azerbaijan was represented on the WHO's Executive Committee, in 2007-2008 was its Vice President, in 2009-2012 was a member of the WHO Permanent Committee for Europe, and from 2012-2015 was its Vice President again. Although Azerbaijan completed its tenure in the WHO Executive Committee, we maintain working and expert contacts with it. The implementation of annual action plans together with the WHO, the UN Population Fund, and the UN Children's Fund was continued in 2015, and will be continued in 2016 as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ernst &amp; Young participates in many different conferences and events in Azerbaijan and was the consulting partner at the first Azerbaijan sustainable development and CSR conference. How does participating in these events contribute to your mission in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Participation in conferences and events is an effective way to strengthen our presence and voice as a leader, expand our network with clients and stakeholders, and build awareness of our company. Moreover, in times of legal and institutional reforms, active participation in such events provides an opportunity to build an open dialogue between entrepreneurs and state authorities to discuss challenges faced by entrepreneurs, to share valuable experience, and contribute to Azerbaijan's attractiveness for investors. The EY Tax &amp; Law Department has also benefitted from such opportunities, and we not only participate in conferences as sponsors and speakers but also hold our own events. EY Azerbaijan organizes annual Tax &amp; Legal Update seminars for clients and, by virtue of this, provides insights into tax and legal updates and their practical implementation in Azerbaijan. Following current market and legal trends and updating clients on issues crucial for their businesses boosts our close ties with them and contributes to our mission of building a better working world. Taking into account an increasing interest in sustainability in Azerbaijan, EY considered the first Sustainability and CSR conference in 2015 as an extremely important initiative to familiarize the business society with the concept of sustainability and integrate the latter into the management of companies. EY was a consulting partner for the event and had a major role in building the conference's content. The conference covered major aspects of sustainability, such as economic and environmental sustainability, the role of education in sustainability, green economy, and so on. We believe that in the near future, business society in Azerbaijan will realize the importance of integrating sustainability into business strategy and it will play a necessary role in the formation of a sustainable society in the country.</p><h4>What is the regional significance of Azerbaijan for Ernst &amp; Young?</h4><p>EY has been present in Azerbaijan for more than 20 years, successfully blending the best global practices with local expertise, sharing our knowledge through rendering high-quality services to our clients, and supporting a great number of initiatives. Azerbaijan is a vast emerging market within the CIS and retains its position as one of the highest-ranked countries among the republics of the former Soviet Union according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. There is always room for improvement and Azerbaijan is steadily moving along the path of reform, creating new growth opportunities for companies working in the country. As an emerging market, Azerbaijan does not only have significant potential for rapid economic growth, but also implies a higher return potential and is expected to expand faster than mature markets. Relying on all of these growth opportunities, EY is determined to focus further on the development of its practice in the country, to invest in the enhancement and perfection of its range of services, and to contribute to the community in line with its global mission and policy.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the development of the non-oil sector?<br></h4><p>Azerbaijan is one of the most attractive locations for foreign investments in the region. Out of the $20 billion invested last year in Azerbaijan, half were foreign investments. At an early stage of Azerbaijan's independence, foreign investments were largely in the oil and gas sector, which is still the driving force generating the most interest from foreign investors based on statistical indicators. Today, the volume of foreign investments in the non-oil sector is also growing due to the government's latest legislative reforms. Foreign direct investment in the non-oil sector is mainly focused on construction, services, transport, telecoms, and manufacturing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the leading authority on football in the country, how would you assess Azerbaijan's football performance in the European Games beach soccer event?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to note, with the organizing of the European Games at a high level, Azerbaijan again demonstrated that the country is one of the most competent at holding important events in the region. As the President of the Republic, Ilham Aliyev, noted, in fact, that Azerbaijan has set standards at the European Games by organizing an unforgettable tournament. As for the performance of the national beach soccer team at the tournament, of course we would have liked to win. But there are objective reasons for it. Teams that had previously gained great victories during Beach Soccer World Cups and European Championships competed at the European Games. As you may know, beach soccer is one of the newly emerging sports in Azerbaijan. It was very important for Azerbaijani players to gain experience at the European Games. The Azerbaijan Beach Soccer team gained the necessary experience and increased proficiency playing against such strong teams. In this regard, the games, which Azerbaijan lost at the European Games, did not discourage us; quite the contrary, it offered a powerful incentive to win by drawing lessons from defeats.</p><h4>AFFA will be hosting the UEFA Under-17 Championship Finals in Baku. What are your expectations for this event?</h4><p>It is a privilege to be trusted to host the UEFA Under-17 Championship Finals. Historically, this is the tournament where many football stars have jumpstarted their careers. With 16 competing teams, it will be interesting to witness players' pathway after the event. Some of them may even come back to Baku for UEFA Euro 2020 matches. This tournament is also a great opportunity to promote youth football in the country. We hope the legacy of the event will carry on to future generations, who will love football even more. We are experienced in organizing similar tournaments. The 2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup was held in Azerbaijan. FIFA defined the tournament held in our country as "one of the all-time best FIFA tournaments." I believe the UEFA U-17 Championship Azerbaijan-2016 will be no exception in this regard and the country will go down in history as the organizer of another successful international tournament. There is a bit of symmetrical sequence in our hosting of international football tournaments: the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in 2012, UEFA U-17 Championship Azerbaijan-2016 this year, and four games of UEFA Euro 2020 four years later. In other words, a great football festival takes place in Azerbaijan every four years.</p><h4>As an institute that works to promote sport throughout Azerbaijan, what are your thoughts on the Formula One Grand Prix coming to Baku in the summer of 2016?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has become one of the main centers in Europe and hosts large-scale local and international events. Baku Marathon will be held on May 1 by the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and with the organizational support of AFFA, and the Formula One Grand Prix is to be held in June 2016. We hope that people will enjoy these and the future events that will be held in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Together within Bakcell, AFFA has announced the enrolment of the preliminary training group for the Manchester United Soccer School in Baku. How will this initiative help spur an interest in football among children and develop their skills at a young age?</h4><p>Manchester United Soccer School was opened in 2014 in Baku. This is a great opportunity for Azerbaijani boys aged 6-12 to receive thorough football training with one of the leading football schools in the world. We have already witnessed high interest in this project. This means that children have interest in football not only as a leisure activity, but also as a potential future career. Currently, we have five talent groups at school with over 40 boys: three player development squads and two player foundation squads. Players train two times a week and also take English lessons for more effective communication with coaches.</p><h4>One of AFFA's priorities in Azerbaijan concerns education about sport. What kinds of educational opportunities exist through AFFA for prospective specialists and coaches?</h4><p>AFFA organizes and participates in education development events on a regular basis. Each year we organize one UEFA A, two UEFA B, and 5-7 C license training sessions for football coaches. UEFA Pro is organized once every three years. In 2016, we will hold UEFA A Goalkeeper license training for the first time. Additionally, technical and administrative staff always participates in other professional qualification training and workshops.</p><h4>What are you most looking forward to for AFFA over 2016 in particular?</h4><p>We strive for the successful organization of the UEFA Under-17 Championship Finals. Experience gained during this event and the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup will be carried on to the organization of three group stage games and one quarterfinal of EURO 2020. We will also continue our work toward education and infrastructure development in the years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Currently, UNEC's main strategic target is to become a truly modern and world-class university, which can fulfill the aforementioned functions.</p><h4>English language programs are expanding quickly along with demand. How is UNEC approaching this?<br></h4><p>English has become a global language. English is also the common language of business in the world economy. Our approach to this matter is that all students studying at UNEC must learn English to a high level. We also do a lot of work in terms of English language specialization. For this purpose, we have established a new school at UNEC called the International School of Economics. This school boosts both English-language capacity and strengthens UNEC's global integration. We hope that the school will increase the flow of international students to UNEC and enhance its participation range in international programs. The same expectations lay on our English MBA programs, built up according to world standards. Today at UNEC, a joint bachelor's degree program is realized with the University of London/London School of Economics in English and, this year, we have started a dual diploma program with Montpellier University.</p><h4>What are you doing to strengthen your teaching staff?</h4><p>For the past two years we have been recruiting young professional and experienced specialists with educational backgrounds in the US and Europe, as part of our Young Teacher project. We hope that this project will help us to bring on board at least 10 professors under the age of 40 within the next few years.</p><h4>What are some of the international cooperation networks that connect UNEC with other universities across the world?</h4><p>UNEC is enhancing its global research competitiveness through cooperation with international universities and research institutions as well as student exchange programs. The international relations of UNEC are visible in various areas. Currently, within direct cooperation agreements, UNEC cooperates with more than 100 universities from all over the world. We have recently signed bilateral agreements with 14 universities from 12 countries. Our bilateral cooperation and partnerships with foreign universities was established in two directions: student and staff mobility and the creation of joint education programs. If students pursue part of their education outside Azerbaijan, they can choose an exchange program with one of our partner universities. In parallel with that, UNEC encourages more staff to take advantage of education within international cross regional capacity building projects such as Erasmus+, and supports staff trainings abroad. Within the Mevlana Exchange Program funded by the Turkish government, UNEC cooperates with 36 universities.</p><h4>What are some of the ways UNEC works to compete with the quality of education offered by Western universities?</h4><p>For the last two years UNEC has taken first place in the Webometrics ranking of world universities among Azerbaijani higher education institutions evaluated for their presence on the web. This is an important step toward becoming international. In fact, we are the first ISO-certified Azerbaijani public university. 2016 has been declared the Year of Quality at UNEC and we are working on improving quality standards.</p><h4>What plans does UNEC have for the coming year?</h4><p>In the field of internationalization, we will expand our relations with leading universities. Our first goal is to complete integration into the European Higher Education system to meet the demands of the Bologna process. Our second goal is to modernize the curricula, teaching materials, and subjects. In accordance with labor market demands, we are going to continue to find new opportunities with companies for internships and training for our students. Our strategic plan includes the application of scientific and technological achievements and the introduction of advanced systems for university management. We plan to expand our research activities to strengthen the position of UNEC in the international rankings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Speaking at the Education World Forum in London, you emphasized the importance of attracting talented and qualified personnel to work in Azerbaijan. What are some of the ways that the Ministry works to realize this goal?</h4><p>We are firmly convinced that one cannot have an isolated educational system that demonstrates efficiency in a globalized world. This thesis has been duly reflected in the State Strategy on the Development of Education in Azerbaijan, which was one of the first conceptual documents approved by President Ilham Aliyev after his successful re-election to his new term in October 2013. The State Strategy mentions such elements as integration into the world, something that our country has been deprived of for a lengthy period of time, and the internationalization of education. With this in mind, the higher education institutions in Azerbaijan were given broad autonomy powers, including in the field of developing international links. The Ministry encourages Azerbaijani universities to establish efficient long-term partnerships with recognized foreign entities. We welcome the cooperation projects and programs designed with a view to bring in required international experience and best practices to Azerbaijan in the required fields. The strategic vision is to build the capacity of the local institutions and thus raise the quality of education and research in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>The Baku branch of the First Moscow State Medical University is in its first year of operation. How do partnerships with international education institutions like this help improve the domestic education sector?</h4><p>The Baku branch of the First Moscow State Medical University was established in 2015, while the branch of the Moscow State University has been operating in Baku since 2008. We are glad to host the branches of these two distinguished institutions, with their recognized international reputation. The mission of these arrangements is to provide the citizens of Azerbaijan an opportunity to study at these universities without having to cross the border. We consider this to be a good long-term investment in the capacity-building of the domestic education sector, internationalization of higher education, and diversification of educational opportunities. The establishment of university branches does not represent the only way toward this goal. This effort includes the intensification of academic exchanges for students, faculty members, and researchers. An important track is the establishment of joint degree and double diploma programs. We are glad to note that many Azerbaijani universities made good progress on this path, establishing programs with counterparts in the UK, Germany, Turkey, and other countries. We are conducting active talks with foreign partners aimed at opening joint departments or schools in specific fields at individual Azerbaijani institutions. We encourage foreign students to study in Azerbaijan in various formats, be it a full-scale degree program, a short-term stay under academic exchange, or other arrangements. The Azerbaijani education sector has a lot to offer, particularly in the traditionally strong fields such as oil and gas engineering and oriental studies. We are not resting on our laurels, but working hard to develop other relevant fields as well.</p><h4>With the ongoing directive to strengthen the non-oil sector of the economy, a new focus is being placed on ICT and the industrial sector. How does the educational system in Azerbaijan provide opportunities for students to thrive in these innovative sectors?</h4><p>The State Strategy on Development of Education emphasizes the concepts of a knowledge-based economy and information society. The ongoing global economic and financial crisis makes the task of developing the non-oil sector increasingly relevant. This includes the fields of ICT, agriculture, tourism, and other industries, where Azerbaijan has a good potential and comparative advantage at the regional and international scale. Education plays a key role in this. The first step is to adjust the educational system to the needs and requirements of economic and social development. The educational system must be able to prepare the workforce needed today. It is equally important to ensure that this workforce will be able to adapt to the constantly changing environment. Therefore, students must develop critical thinking and have tools for life-long learning. We are working with the local higher educational institutions to make sure they adopt a flexible approach in designing their respective study programs, which must evolve to provide a better response to the new challenges. Here I would like to stress the SABAH Group's initiative. This innovative project's mission is to bring together the best performing students, provide them with new educational programs, and eventually create a spillover effect on the entire higher education sector. The toolbox here includes, but is not limited to, the deeper study of foreign languages to access global knowledge sources, the creation of business incubators to promote a start-up culture, and the establishment of career centers to help the students plan their employment strategies. We see an interaction between education, research, and innovation, or a so called “knowledge triangle,“ as our pathway to a knowledge-based economy. The Ministry encourages universities to strengthen links with employers, who should play more active roles as major stakeholders in the education process. This track involves not only internship opportunities in industry, but also the engagement of non-academic stakeholders in preparation of curricula in order to make it more suitable to the labor market's needs, and offer much closer cooperation in industry-driven research. The creative scientific capacity of universities must contribute to the development of the economy and job-creation.</p><h4>As the State Program for Azerbaijani Youth Education Abroad ended in 2015, how will the Ministry continue to address this subject within the new framework of the Azerbaijan 2020 Strategy?</h4><p>The State Program was launched upon a personal initiative by the President of Azerbaijan. It was designed to address the short to mid-term needs of Azerbaijan's development in selected fields, and we have sufficient reason to believe it was a success. Hundreds of students have already graduated, while the rest continue their studies at the best foreign universities, with the last student expected to graduate in 2021. The program's alumni are in high demand on Azerbaijan's labor market, with 60% of them employed in the private sector and 40% in the public sector, respectively, including at senior positions. We are taking active steps to ensure that the knowledge and skills acquired by the alumni can find the most efficient application in Azerbaijan. Those wishing to join the civil service are waived from the initial test exam. We encourage the local educational institutions to recruit the Program's alumni for teaching and research. In June 2015, the Ministry launched a pilot project to create a framework for internships and career services for the graduates of the State Program, as well as for current students. We intend to expand this project in the near future to cover other students as well. We are also proud to have 18 alumni on the Ministry's team.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has been routinely hosting very large sporting events like the 2015 European Games, and the Formula One Grand Prix is upcoming. Amidst this national movement, how does the Ministry work to get young students engaged in sporting programs?</h4><p>We are proud that as a result of visionary policy initiated by the President of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan has become a host of regular large-scale international events, including sports. I am proud to note that out of the 18,000 volunteers engaged at the Baku 2015 European Games, 14,000 were students. The Ministry worked to create favorable conditions for the volunteering movement, which turned the Games into a great festival of sports and friendship. We initiated the SABAH Volunteer project, which covered social activities and the improvement of teaching in higher education. Hundreds of students were involved in volunteering activities within the project and contributed to a number of events. Based on this successful experience, we decided to expand the format through the Student-Volunteer program under the brand “One“ in higher education institutions. Creating a single database for student volunteers, the program helps with the appropriation of new skills, abilities, and habits, and facilitates new projects held in Azerbaijan. The upcoming Formula One Grand Prix Baku circuit will be a new opportunity in this dimension. Improving student's physical health, psychological sustainability, and training achievements by physical training and sport represent priority directions. The projects that further the development of sport and physical training are supported by the Ministry. The Ministry implements various programs to promote a healthy lifestyle among students, raise their interest in sports and physical training, and improve education on physical training. The Ministry also promotes programs like the Olympic movement TOPs, which is involved in the creation of modern education technology on physical training, and "Healthy Education-Healthy Nation." National competitions in Olympic sports were held between pupils in the framework of an awareness-raising campaign conducted prior to the First European Games and more than 10,000 school kids participated.</p><h4>After the parliamentary elections of 2015, what is the Ministry's outlook for working with the new Parliament on strengthening education in the country? </h4><p>The Ministry of Education attaches special importance to developing good working relations with the Parliament, including its Committee on Education and Science. Education is not a static structure, but rather a perpetually evolving phenomenon. This dynamic necessitates a flexible approach, including through legislative adaptation. The Ministry has already initiated a few legislative changes with a view to remove bureaucratic obstacles and raise the overall efficiency of the educational system. A constructive dialogue with the Parliament is vital in this regard. Relations with Parliament also play an important role in the context of engaging the general public in the reform process. Directly elected by citizens, the Milli Majlis is an important channel to learn about the attitudes and reactions of the public to existing problems and reforms carried out by the Ministry. A timely and objective feedback communicated by Parliament is a helpful tool in the overall reform strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Ganja was chosen as the European Youth Capital of 2016 (EYC2016), can you explain the aim of the Ganja European Youth Organization?</h4><p>The title of European Youth Capital is given by the European Youth Forum to one European city for a period of one year. During this year, the city gets a chance to showcase its youth-related policies, activities, and opportunities for the young people of the city. Ganja city applied for this title in 2013 along with 12 other cities. We won the title in November 2013 in Thessaloniki, Greece. Ganja city was different from other candidate cities. The aim of the Ganja EYC2016 program was also different from other candidates: our aim is to use the title of EYC2016 as a chance to create new opportunities for the youth of the city, put the youth in the center of our focus, and bring attention to youth-related problems. To manage and coordinate all these programs and youth-related projects, the Ganja European Youth Capital 2016 Public Union was created in February of 2014 and was added to the implementation of the program as a main actor.</p><h4>What are some of the large-scale projects that Ganja will implement over this year?</h4><p>Ganja EYC2016 has a major action plan for 2016 that calls for 43 projects—25 international and 18 local. All these projects are related to five main priority areas of the Ganja EYC2016 program: youth employment, volunteering, active participation, education, and social cohesion. The projects will start taking place after the Opening Ceremony of Ganja EYC2016 in April. 2016 is promising to be a busy year full of events and projects. The Opening Ceremony itself will be one of the largest held, together with a large-scale international festival that will be organized in October 2016. The festival will bring hundreds of young people from all over Europe in order to discuss a common solution for general youth-related problems and strengthen the intercultural dialogue among Caucasus and other European countries. There are numerous large-scale projects designed by different youth related institutions such as the Ministry of Youth and Sport, local representative of the European Commission, European Youth Parliament, and so on.</p><h4>What makes Ganja a unique city to be featured as part of the European Youth campaign?</h4><p>The main difference of Ganja compared to other European Youth Capitals is the fact that Ganja is the first EYC that represents a country outside of the EU. The city was supported by the National Youth Councils of the region, including Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. The title of European Youth Capital has been presented since 2009 and during this time every city selected as EYC has been from the EU. We believe it is an important chance to highlight not only Ganja, but also the whole Caucasus on the map of Europe and to show that the borders of Europe are much wider than the EU. Even though Azerbaijan is only a part of the Council of Europe, it is still a European country that can be an example of a city with a successful youth policy.</p><h4>What are some challenges that you anticipate over the course of Ganja's tenure as the European Youth Capital?</h4><p>In general, the whole initiative of being the European Youth Capital is something new for the city. During the first steps of candidacy, it was important to get the support of local youth and youth organizations. Later, we needed to establish a link between the initiative and state institutions and authorities. We can consider ourselves a lucky team, because the whole initiative was highly supported by the youth of the city and the state. One of the main problems that the European Youth Capitals face is difficulties in establishing the budget. It is important to promote the title among foundations, companies, and the public sector in order to attract enough finances for covering the expenses.</p><h4>How will Ganja use major sporting events to promote sports among its youth?</h4><p>The interest toward sports among young people has rapidly increased after hosting the European Games in 2015. We found that it is important to use this interest in our projects as well. There is a long-term, sports-related project that will be organized during the year featuring healthy lifestyle trainings, marathons, and championships, for example. The city has launched new infrastructure projects through the building of bike roads in public areas, special places for outdoor sport activities, and more. The European Games also established a base for the volunteering movement in the country. Thousands of young people volunteered for the European Games. We believe it also affected the number of Ganja EYC2016 volunteers in a positive way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Baku was the inaugural host of the European Games in the summer of 2015 and the Formula One Grand Prix is set to take place in Baku 2016. How will hosting international events like these help to promote Azerbaijan as a tourism destination?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to highlight the role of mega events in the promotion of tourism destinations. Azerbaijan has hosted a number of international events such as Eurovision 2012, U17 Women Football World Cup, The Crans Montana forum, the European Games in 2015, and many others that could serve as an example of the maturity of our hospitality industry and its capability to host large-scale international events. According to the feedback from the organizers of all previous events, they reported that the events were all organized and implemented successfully. There were many positive opinions about the event-hosting standards in Azerbaijan. Events such as these are considered long-term investments into crafting the country's image as an emerging tourist destination that is capable of catering to different tastes and expectations. We also expect these events to attract tourists from all over the world. We are hosting many events in the near future, including the Formula One Grand Prix 2016, Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017, matches of Euro 2020, and many other sport and cultural events. Today, we can proudly claim that, thanks to the events mentioned above as well as other events such as the Baku International Humanitarian Forum, World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue, and many other international events, Azerbaijan has earned a positive international reputation and successfully promoted its image around the world.</p><h4>How does the lowering of travel-related prices and the construction of new inexpensive hotels fit your vision for the future of the tourism sector?</h4><p>It is clear that lower prices will contribute to an increase in the number of tourists coming to Azerbaijan from all around the world. At the end of 2015, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan introduced the floating exchange rate that immediately devaluated the manat to the US dollar by 47.63%. We believe the devaluation of the manat will undoubtedly affect incoming tourists and further develop tourism in the country, as the prices in foreign currencies will be lower. In addition to the world famous luxury hotels such as Four Seasons Hotel Baku, Hyatt Regency, JW Marriott Absheron Baku Hotel, Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel, Fairmont, Hilton Baku, and Kempinski Hotel Badamdar, there is now a strong and increasing demand for middle class and budget hotels in Baku and the regions of Azerbaijan. As the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan, we do our best to analyze the market, perform the research, and inform all stakeholders about new trends.</p><h4>What can you tell us about current visa procedures and connectivity in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In past years, visa and connectivity issues were the main challenges to overcome for the thorough development of the tourism industry in Azerbaijan. In early 2013, Azerbaijan began a new practice of issuing electronic visas, which became useful for attracting more tourists to our country. Access to this system was granted to the majority of tour-operators and requires only a passport photocopy and an individual photo from the tourist. The visa fee is $20 and it is delivered in five working days. This visa opens a new page in the development of incoming tourism and facilitates the accessibility of travel to the country. Apart from that, starting from February 1, 2016, citizens of Bahrain, China, Kuwait, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE have the opportunity to obtain visas upon arrival at international airports in Azerbaijan. Regarding connectivity, every year we see the opening of new direct flights from Baku, as well as from the regions of Azerbaijan, to different destinations. Azerbaijan Airlines, the national airline of the country, makes flights to more than 20 countries, which include flights to Paris, Dubai, Milan, New York, Beijing, Prague, Tel Aviv, Tehran, Kiev, and many other cities of the world. Our Ministry is in permanent contact with Azerbaijan Airlines on exploring new opportunities for development and cooperation. In order to coordinate marketing activities, our Ministry and AZAL decided to establish a joint Working Group. Currently, there are also flights to and from Azerbaijan by Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot, and several other airlines from Russia, Lufthansa, British Airways, Qatar Airways, China Southern Airlines, and many others.</p><h4>When compared to numbers from the previous year, the hospitality and catering sector proved to be the most dynamic sector of Azerbaijan in 2015. To what can you attribute this impressive rate of growth?</h4><p>Today, we can proudly say that the number of foreign tourists traveling to Azerbaijan has reached more than 2 million, with their expenditure around $1 billion per year. The direct share of tourism in country's GDP is 4.1%, and the number of employees in the industry reached 42,000 people. Tourism is one of three non-petroleum economic sectors identified as a priority for the national economic development plans in Azerbaijan. The year of 2011 was proclaimed the Year of Tourism. The industry got strong support from state leadership and personally from HE President Ilham Aliyev as a result. This high level of commitment contributes significantly to the development of tourism and the associated infrastructure, elaboration of new policies and standards, international cooperation programs, development of dialogue between the public and private sector, and the attraction of domestic and international investments. The role of tourism in economic development is indisputable. Understanding the importance of the tourism sector, the government in Azerbaijan aims to achieve further diversification of the economy, balanced and sustainable socio-economic development in the regions, and to reduce unemployment and poverty through the tourism industry. Azerbaijan has all the necessary elements for a tourist destination: hospitality, rich historic and cultural heritage, beautiful natural landscapes, delicious cuisine, and a very favorable geographical location. These unique characteristics make us an all-year round destination and we now have almost all types of tourism activities in our country. We do believe that the tourism sector in Azerbaijan will continue its development in coming years.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to promote Azerbaijan as a country of remarkable culture?</h4><p>The rich historical and cultural heritage of the country attracts visitors from all over the world.  Despite of the size of country, the culture and heritage of Azerbaijan is very diverse and colorful. I would like to emphasize that cultural tourism is one of our main tourism products. I believe that increasing international awareness of Azerbaijan owes a lot to its well-maintained culture, traditions, and arts. Today, the culture of Azerbaijan is well recognized at the international level, with masterpieces and cultural and historical monuments included into UNESCO's lists of World Heritage and Intangible Cultural Heritage. Azerbaijani carpets, mugam, ashugs, the Novruz festival and many other cultural elements received well-deserved recognition and attention as part of many international cultural events worldwide. The Ministry, in the framework of participating in major trade fairs and advertising Azerbaijan via world mass media on CNN, Euronews, and many other international channels, is using the culture of Azerbaijan and cultural tourism in the country as one of its main promotion tools. Among the most important elements of this cultural development and expansion of international links is the special role of the UNWTO Silk Road Program, a significant factor in the development of international cooperation in many fields of economy, transportation, trade, cultural exchange, and tourism. The World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue is also regularly organized in Baku on a biannual basis. There is a special platform dedicated to tourism at this Forum where the main topic was the effect of tourism on the dialogue between cultures and societies. Apart from that, Azerbaijan will host the 7th Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in April 2016. This Global Forum will become another historic event to ensure peace, understanding, harmony, and dialogue between cultures and civilizations in the modern world.</p><h4>With a new Parliament elected in November of 2015, what are the Ministry's priorities for 2016?</h4><p>As the tourism industry develops, it needs more advanced legal tools to cover the needs of all involved parties and business processes. With kind assistance offered by UNWTO and other international experts, we have developed the Draft Law on Tourism, which is supposed to replace the current Law on Tourism adopted in 1999. This new document is supposed to cover the needs of the industry not only for today, but also for at least the next 10 years, foreseeing its development path and resolving current and future challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>With the 2015 European Games hosted in Baku, what is your assessment of the development of the sporting activity and Olympic athletes of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is a country that has always had sports at the center of the government's care and vision. When President Ilham Aliyev was selected as the President of the National Olympic Committee in 1997, our country greatly increased the attention given to sporting activities. The number of young people participating in sports increases every day. As an example, at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 (23 athletes), Azerbaijan won only one silver medal. In Sydney in 2000 (31 athletes), Azerbaijan raised its medal count to three (2 gold, 1 bronze). A few years later at the Athens Olympic Games (37 athletes) our team won 5 medals (1 gold and 4 bronze). Success at these Olympic Games carried over to other Olympic Games as well. So, at the Beijing Olympics (44 athletes), Azerbaijan won 7 medals (1 gold, 2 silver, and 4 bronze), and in London the number of athletes was 53 and the number medals won was 10 (2 gold, 2 silver, and 6 bronze), which was a record in the history of Azerbaijani sports. Also, I would like to present the difference in the number of medals won by Azeri athletes over the last 10 years; in 2005, the number of medals won by Azeri athletes was 213 (Olympic 122, non-Olympic 91), and in 2015 this number reached 823 (297 Olympic, 526 non-Olympic). At the first European Games, 50 European countries participated in this event. Azerbaijan placed second after Russia in terms of the number of medals won with 21 gold, 15 silver, and 20 bronze. Seeing the evolution of Azerbaijani athletes over time, it was not a surprise for us to place second among 50 competing countries in the First European Games with 56 medals.</p><h4>The Formula One Grand Prix will be the biggest event to take place in Azerbaijan in the summer of 2016. Attracting viewers and fans from all over the world at an unprecedented level for Baku, how are you preparing for this event? </h4><p>All preparation efforts for the event are currently proceeding on time. The track preparation is fully on schedule, and we are incredibly excited to see F1 cars racing through the streets of Baku this summer. It will be a great opportunity to show the world the beautiful, welcoming, modern, and exciting city of Baku. We have already reached one of our first major milestones when we launched ticket sales for the event on December 19, 2015, and the international and domestic interest levels have been positive. From the moment this project was confirmed, we have been learning as much as we can to help us deliver the best possible race weekend. The BCC team has already visited several Grand Prix races to study how different hosts deliver this major event. A key lesson we took from this was learning how to align all the stakeholders—hotels, retailers, and transportation services—in Baku and Azerbaijan in the promotion of the race weekend to help maximize the huge potential for the city and nation that comes from hosting such a major event. We are determined to deliver a race weekend that is uniquely ours, and one that showcases Baku and Azerbaijan to the world as a modern, exciting, and beautiful place. We want the Baku race weekend to be unlike any other on the calendar and to become a highlight of the annual F1 season. Moreover, we are currently planning an incredible entertainment program for all visitors to ensure that when they are not enjoying all the racing action, they will be suitably entertained throughout the weekend. We plan to offer various fan engagement activities throughout the circuit and live concert performances by major acts every evening. Like most races in new markets, we accept that F1 is not fully established in the country. However, after carrying out independent research over the summer, we found that awareness levels of F1 in Azerbaijan were high. The challenge for us now is to convert this awareness and general level of curiosity into genuine excitement and passion for the sport. Ideally, we want to create a new generation of F1 fans here in Azerbaijan, and hopefully one day we may even see an Azerbaijani driver.</p><h4>The World Chess Olympiad is also coming to Baku in 2016. What are your expectations for this event? </h4><p>Azerbaijan has achieved many accomplishments in chess and has a strong chess tradition. By the initiative of our former President, Heydar Aliyev, more than 70 chess schools were built across the country. President Ilham Aliyev has continued this policy. We have chess schools and centers in every region. Many children and young people show great interest in this game and it is very important for Azerbaijan to hold chess events like this one. This event offers serious input into the development of chess in the country, with spectators getting to watch the world's strongest players perform. Azerbaijan was the winner of the European Chess Championship two times, in 2009 and 2013. In 2015, Baku hosted the Chess World Cup, which attracted 128 well-known chess players from various countries. I was happy to see how Shakhriyar Mamedyarov played in this tournament. During one of the days, more than 600 spectators came to see the match, showing the high level of interest in chess. I believe that the Chess Olympiad in 2016 will be held at the highest level. Almost 2,000 chess players from 175 countries will do their best to win first place. Baku will have 3,000 guests for this event, putting Azerbaijan at the center of the world.</p><h4>How has hosting sports events, like the F1 race, become a useful tool to increase the visibility of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The importance of the F1 race to Baku and Azerbaijan cannot be underestimated. After successfully hosting the European Games in 2015, this is the next major global event to be staged in our capital. This will help establish Baku as a home of major international sporting events, which is something that can only be a good thing for the city's international reputation and tourism prospects. There are many advantages to be gained from hosting a major sporting event and in particular a Formula One Grand Prix. There are few other sports that can bring the same amount of exposure that Formula One does. Beyond simply getting spectators through the turnstiles, there are many potential benefits that arise from hosting such a major sporting event. The economic benefits are clear: increased tourism, increased spending in the wider hospitality industry, and increased investments from international companies. It is in this latter benefit that Formula One really stands out as a hugely positive addition to any country/city's economic strategy. Formula One creates an open environment for B2B and business-to-government (B2G) networking with key decision makers. The challenge for Baku is to maximize the ways in which we can build upon the spike in economic and tourist activity during the upcoming race weekend to extend into the rest of the year and beyond. We want people to come to Baku for the race and stay for the culture, excitement, fun, and beauty this city has to offer. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the upgrades or benefits that took place at Atropatena as part of the Year of Agriculture reforms of 2015?</h4><p>In line with the Year of Agriculture, the government offered some great incentives and provided significant subsidies to the sector. Governmental compensation for purchasing agricultural machinery reached 40%, for example. These initiatives are put in place because Azerbaijan is not yet fully self-sufficient in terms of food. We are still importing grain, dairy, and meat. The shocks in the international economy over the past year have forced us to make some changes. For decades, we had a stable market and enjoyed greenhouse-like conditions that we were hoping to have forever. We believe that the shocks of 2015 will actually increase the competitiveness of business. Businesses are reconsidering their approaches and practices, cutting down expenses, diversifying, and working on import replacement to become less dependent on currency fluctuations.</p><h4>Atropatena is implementing a project to produce poultry products and feed in Azerbaijan. What are the details of this new plan and how will animal feed production help reduce the price and cost of products?</h4><p>We have a dairy production business, a farm (about 4,000 heads), and, on top of that, last year we shifted toward poultry production. Much needs to be done to develop our Sesame Broiler brand. We are studying the production process in depth and are thinking about producing all the essential components within the country within 2-3 years, which will eventually allow us to reduce our costs. When our currency was expensive, it was not good for us as a producer; it was difficult for us to compete with imports. In this sense, the devaluation has boosted local production and had positive effects in the long run. The coming transition will be a difficult task. Azerbaijani citizens' purchasing power is decreasing because disposable income is not growing. However, within a few years it will level out.</p><h4>Is Atropatena looking to expand its product range, both as a distributor and as a producer?</h4><p>Yes, we are now working to expand our product range. We are focusing our current investments in two main areas, and we have new dairy and poultry brands in the pipeline. We will also be moving toward deeper production. Since 2015, we have been considering replacing imported ingredients to reduce our costs.</p><h4>As the country looks to expand the agricultural capacity and promote agricultural exports, what are some of the international markets into which Atropatena is looking to expand?</h4><p>We currently have some exports, but they are not significant. We are doing marketing research on neighboring countries as well as in the Middle East—countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Russian market is huge, and we are seeking to export products that are not sold there yet, such as white cheese, which is a local specialty. It is a natural, high-quality product and it will definitely appeal to Russian customers. It can be followed by ayran, kaymak, and more. As for the Middle East, it has a limited dairy industry and enjoys high purchasing power. It is also important to consider the expiration date for products exported to the Middle East because of its distance. We are now considering various logistics options in this regard.</p><h4>Atropatena launched a number of products for the European Games. What are your thoughts on Formula One Grand Prix coming to Baku and does Atropatena have any similar plans for this event?</h4><p>Our marketing department is currently working on that. We are thinking of producing a special campaign related to ayran, as we are the market leader in this segment. Ayran is a healthier alternative to fizzy drinks that you can have on the go.</p><h4>Atropatena is partnered with many transnational corporations, such as Nestlé and Danone. What is the value added by these partnerships to your company?</h4><p>We consider distribution as a sort of a transition to business. If you look at large companies, they operated as distributors at some point. Such examples can be found in Japan and South Korea with Samsung or Hyundai. The distribution business allows us to pick up best practices and quality standards. We are already producing together with Danone and in 2016 we want to expand this partnership. Because our currency is cheaper, larger companies find it more feasible to produce locally in Azerbaijan and export to neighboring countries from here. In this sense, the market is becoming more and more interesting. I believe that the experience Azerbaijan gained in developing the oil and gas industry can be applied in other industries. Since we have attracted global players, we have also gotten introduced to new technologies. This has allowed us to enter international markets and developed local talent. It is the optimal mode. In my opinion, to overcome dependence on oil dollars, it is necessary to make investment in Azerbaijan more beneficial. This will attract large companies. If we consider the Russian dairy market, there are two main players: Danone and PepsiCo. The latter purchased WBD, the market share of which was about 30%. The two of them cover about 70-75% of the Russian market. Dairy produced in Russia is exported, which brings money to the budget. We should be doing the same in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Coming out of successful parliamentary elections at the end of 2015, what is Atropatena's outlook on 2016?</h4><p>This year will bring better dialogue and understanding between the government and business. Different options to support business were discussed during the last meeting with the president on January 26. Dialogue with the authorities and ministries became a lot more intensive after that. The government is seeking the advice of businesses on what needs to be done. The government is putting a lot more thought into ways to develop the non-oil sector and create more jobs. I believe that 2016 will become a critical year in this regard. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>At a time when the oil factor of the economy has significantly weakened, what steps are being taken to stimulate sustainable socioeconomic development and provide social protection for the population?</h4><p>First of all, let me note that Azerbaijan has had a strategy to eliminate its dependence on oil ever since it accounted for a major share of the national economy. As a result of the judicious reforms carried out by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, the country has managed to build a strong socioeconomic capacity over these years. Azerbaijan has repeatedly passed the tests of global recessions and secured the sustainable development of its economy. We have been witnessing that even in the early months of the current year. Extensive measures have been taken to prevent external adverse impacts on the economy and encourage the development of the non-oil economy at a time when oil revenues are in decline. It is no coincidence that the non-oil economy has increased by over 5% in the first quarter of this year. This sector is expected to grow even faster in the coming years. This is underpinned by important non-oil sector development reforms spearheaded by the President, the ample opportunities for private enterprise development, the stimulation of non-oil exports, and the favorable conditions for the implementation of new projects worth around AZN2 billion. We have also observed improved welfare indicators in the first months of the year. Population incomes in January-February 2016 have increased by 10.2% in comparison with the same period of last year to reach AZN6.460 million. Per capita incomes constitute AZN673, or an average of AZN356.6 per month. In order to increase the purchasing power of the population, in particular the low-income families, and mitigate the consequences of the national currency devaluation and price fluctuations, President Ilham Aliyev signed more than 25 executive orders and resolutions in January 2016 to increase different social payments, including wages, pensions, benefits, scholarships, and compensations. Therefore, all social payments have been increased by 10% as of February 1, 2016. These payments cover 3.6 million people, or 38% of the country's population. Relevant changes were made to the 2016 state budget and additional funds allocated to enable the financing of the mentioned activities. These measures are intended to enhance the social protection and improve the welfare of the Azerbaijan population, which is further evidence of the fact that this is a priority area for the President. The head of state said at a Cabinet meeting dedicated to the results of the first quarter of this year and objectives for the future, “The social policy has always been and will continue to be a priority. The steps taken in the first quarter show once again that Azerbaijan is a welfare state. Our policy is centered on the people of Azerbaijan. The interests of Azerbaijani citizens are above everything for us. All economic reforms and our successful oil and gas policies are aimed at improving people's lives." The implementation of important social programs is also well under way. In the first quarter of 2016, a total of 112,730 families, which equals 492,000 people or 5.1% of the country's population, received targeted social assistance from the state. The average monthly amount of such assistance as of April 1 has increased by 5.6% to reach AZN151. In this period, 395,000 people have received monthly and one-off social benefits, and 55,000 people were provided with monthly pensions of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. A total of AZN84 million has been spent from the state budget on the payment of social benefits, pensions, and compensations. The social program on improving the living conditions of handicapped war veterans and martyr families is also gradually expanding. In continuation of the measures taken in accordance with the President's order dated 20 June 2014, a total of 104 handicapped war veterans and martyr families have been provided with fully renovated apartments.</p><h4>How have the economic reforms changed the country's labor market for the better?</h4><p>The reforms initiated by the President to accelerate non-oil sector growth, boost regional development, provide comprehensive support for entrepreneurship, and improve the business landscape have certainly contributed to maintaining stability on the labor market. For example, the programs on the socioeconomic development of districts and on non-oil sector growth have led to the creation of more than 1.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has dropped to 5%. Work is still under way to continue this process. In particular, a total of 37,000 jobs were created in the country in January-March 2016, including 31,000 permanent ones. In particular, the effective efforts of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population together with those of other state agencies have helped us to dramatically reduce and maintain the rate of unemployment and expand employment opportunities in Azerbaijan as per instructions of the President. Thus, a total of 33,300 people who applied to employment agencies of the ministry in January-March 2016 have been provided with jobs. In addition to maintaining stability on the labor market, these processes have led to an increase in the number of hired workers. Let me note that the system of electronic tracking of employment agreements introduced by the Ministry in 2014 allows us the opportunity to promptly and objectively monitor the labor market and make employment relations more transparent. According to the information obtained from this system, the number of hired workers has increased by 6,600 people year to date to reach 1,256,700 people as of April 1 (except for the Nakhchivan AR and cases when employment agreements were signed on paper only). Also, in order to enhance the social protection of the jobless population, the amount of minimum unemployment benefits has been increased by 36.4% since February 1. This has more than doubled the amount of budget allocations for this purpose.</p><h4>What innovations are being applied to the sphere of social protection in addition to the system of electronic registration of employment agreements?</h4><p>In accordance with the instructions of the President, we have also put in place a modern and transparent mechanism for the electronic tracking of two other important activity directions of the Ministry: provision of targeted social assistance and identification of disability. An Integrated Electronic Subsystem for Applying and Assigning Targeted State Social Aid (VEMTAS) has been designed within the Ministry's centralized information system. It was commissioned on February 15, 2016. People have been provided with the opportunity to electronically apply for targeted assistance. The system also ensures automatic data acquisition from relevant state agencies. We have thus created a modern and transparent system that completely rules out the interference of an official. Another tool the Ministry has created is the Subsystem for Medical and Social Expertise and Rehabilitation (TSERAS), which provides persons with a disability the opportunity to apply for an assessment of their disability. Information on such applications, the examinations conducted, and the decisions made are uploaded to the system in real time. Access to the system by examined individuals, employers, and state agencies using this information has been ensured through an e-government portal. Besides, the system automatically extended the duration of the active 1st group disability for lifetime and 2nd and 3rd disability groups - for 5 years. The system also automatically tracks the duration of different degrees of disability. This has made it no longer necessary for some 200,000 people to undergo medical examination every year, which has also contributed to minimizing the relations between officials and citizens.</p><h4>According to an Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated April 7, 2016, a total of AZN6 million as allocated to the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection to assist in encouraging self-employment among the population. What exactly do you plan to do to implement the Order and what would be the anticipated outcomes?</h4><p>First of all, let me note that the mentioned presidential Order signals a departure from passive assistance to the low-income families to sustainable employment programs for the able-bodied members of such households. In fact, several pilot projects implemented in cooperation with the International Labor Organization (ILO) were a tremendous success, as they helped 21 low-income households set up family businesses and expand self-employment opportunities. They now run their own small family businesses and can at least provide for themselves. Therefore, in an effort to expand on this positive experience, we are now studying the relevant practices of other countries in this area. We are extensively using the ILO data in preparing labor market programs. The presidential Order from April 7, 2016 has actually provided a financial and legal framework for these activities. The families currently receiving targeted social aid include those that have either of the parents, have no able-bodied members, limited health opportunities and disability, people above the age of 65, as well as families with four or more children. Such families will continue to receive targeted aid from the state. In general, 70% of the families receiving targeted social aid live outside Baku and 75% of them have private land plots. More than 50% of recipients of targeted social assistance are above 18 years of age. Such families will receive support in the amount of AZN4,000 to set up their family business. ILO experts are expected to provide their assistance in this. These experts will train two local specialists in every district, including the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, i.e. a total of 146 experts across the country, on how to identify such families and help them establish their small businesses. After the experts complete the organizational work, active self-employment programs will start. The tools and livestock to be provided to the families will also be insured. Some 1,400 households across the country are expected to benefit from self-employment programs. This explicitly shows that President Ilham Aliyev's socioeconomic development strategy is intended to improve the welfare of the country's citizens, enhance their social protection, and facilitate progress on the path to further economic growth. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Azersun Holding recently constructed a logistics center in Aktau, Kazakhstan. What advantages will this new logistics center offer to your company and to Azerbaijani businesses?</h4><p>The steps toward non-oil sector development are being taken by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, and have played a major role in facilitating the access of various local goods to external markets. The order recently signed by the President of Azerbaijan to encourage non-oil exports has been of tremendous help to business people, ushering in ample opportunities in terms of private enterprise development. Azersun Holding, one of the country's leading non-oil sector players implementing a number of export-oriented projects, is expected to launch a production and logistics center this year. Covering an area of 4.2ha, the center houses 5,000sqm of dry and 5,000sqm of cold warehouses, which is helpful for the storage of agricultural produce, food, and non-food products. Fitted with equipment from Europe's leading countries, the logistics center will be well-suited for exports to various Central Asian countries. This brand new enterprise will be instrumental in delivering Azerbaijan's non-oil products to new markets and play a positive role in promoting the goods made in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Azersun Holding created a joint venture in St. Petersburg to supply food from Azerbaijan to Russia. What is Azersun's role in this joint venture, and how will this move help ensure the availability of Azerbaijani agricultural products in Russian markets?</h4><p>A delegation led by the Governor of St. Petersburg, Georgi Poltavchenko, visited Azerbaijan in October of 2015. During this visit, the framework and a meeting was arranged with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Azersun Holding, Abdolbari Goozal. Members of the delegation also visited the enterprises of our Group. We have been cooperating with Russia, Azerbaijan's strategic partner, for many years. For example, about 80% of the agricultural produce we are cultivating in our Greentech greenhouse complex in the Bina settlement is exported to Russia. St. Petersburg accounts for most of this volume. However, according to the latest agreements, Azersun Holding will be represented in this market with a wider assortment and greater volume of products. Our Group currently sells its products throughout the Leningrad region and is expected to cover the entire North-Western federal region in the near future.</p><h4>As an official partner for the 2015 European Games held in Baku, what are your plans for the Formula One European Grand Prix, which will once again put the country in the international spotlight?</h4><p>Azerbaijan plays host to prestigious international events on a regular basis, which contributes a great deal to enhancing the country's credibility in the world. The inaugural European Games event held in Baku in 2015 was organized at a remarkable level. We are extremely proud to have been an official partner of the Games. The network of Bazarstore supermarkets within the Azersun Holding umbrella acted both as a merchandising partner and as an official supermarket. Azerchay tea was the official supplier of tea for the Games. In 2016, too, Azerbaijan is expected to host a number of major international events, including sporting ones. I can already state that our Group will support the organization of the U-17 European Football Cup in Azerbaijan. Some games of this football tournament will be played at Azersun Arena, which was put into operation in 2015 and is currently used by FC Garabagh. In addition, our Azerchay tea brand will be the sponsor of the European Cup. As one of Azerbaijan's leading companies, we will take part in the organization of all other international events in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>Azersun Holding is looking to increase its agribusiness investments particularly in the Krasnodar region of Russia. In which particular projects in this region will you focus your investments? </h4><p>Azersun Holding operates sales offices and enterprises in different countries. Our northern neighbor holds a special place among them. In Russia, the Group owns a tea factory, a cannery, and extensive acreage in the Krasnodar region. As a result of our successful operation in Russia in 2015, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Azersun Holding, Abdolbari Goozal, was awarded with a gold medal for an important contribution to the development of Krasnodar region and a Certificate of Merits from the Russian Minister of Agriculture Alexander Tkachev for a contribution to the development of Krasnodar region. A large delegation comprised of representatives of the Russian State Duma, the Federation Council, the Ministry of Agriculture, and Krasnodar executive authorities visited Azerbaijan to present these awards to Abdolbari Goozal.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for Azersun Holding in 2016?</h4><p>The year 2015 was declared the Year of Agriculture in Azerbaijan. In 2016, Azersun Holding is taking further steps to expand the geography of its exports. We have recently commissioned a new, fully-automated feed factory with an annual capacity of 200,000 tons. It has been a great help to farms and farmers dealing with animal husbandry. However, we all know that the world is experiencing an economic recession. The unpleasant developments unfolding in neighboring countries are also affecting Azerbaijan. Under these difficult circumstances, Azersun Holding is rendering full support for the policies of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev. The group is taking steps to enhance its export potential and earn the confidence of external consumers. Despite the challenges we are facing, I am confident that we will manage to maintain the momentum of our development and find success in this situation. At the same time, we intend to commission one or two new industrial sites in the Azersun Industrial Estate in 2016. This will also help create new jobs. The paper recycling factory and plastic processing factory, both based in the Sumgayit Industrial Estate, are expected to increase the collection of domestic paper and plastic, which will put an end to our dependence on imports. We will provide ourselves with raw materials, thereby preventing the outflow of currency from Azerbaijan. Another project will be implemented in Imishli. The commissioning of a sugar factory there has turned this district into a fully self-sufficient region. Our enterprise has played a crucial role in that, and we are very proud of that. We intend to build a greenhouse complex on an area of 30ha in Imishli this year. We will cultivate different agricultural products and provide hundreds of people with employment opportunities. Another major project is associated with the establishment of a livestock farm in Padarchol, covering an area of 5,000ha. This farm will store 2,000 heads of cattle. It will also be commissioned this year and contribute a lot to improving the wellbeing of the local population. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As 2015 was declared the year of Agriculture in Azerbaijan, how would you evaluate the modernization of agricultural production and how can agriculture contribute to economic development in the future?</h4><p>
	In order to expand agricultural development opportunities, Azerbaijan entered a new stage of agricultural reform in 2014. In an effort to deepen this reform and expand on the UN initiative to declare 2015 an International Year of Soils, HE President Ilham Aliyev made the decision to declare 2015 the Year of Agriculture in Azerbaijan. Comprehensive measures are being taken to meet new development goals in agricultural reforms. In addition to expanding the scope of state support for agriculture as part of the agricultural development program, new mechanisms for providing state support have been put into place. State support in the concessional sale of fertilizer has been increased from 50 to 70%, a mechanism has been applied to finance 40% of the value of agricultural machinery and state-of-the-art irrigation systems on the part of AgroLeasing, the amount of subsidies for the acquisition of fuel and motor oils has been increased by 25%, and a procedure has been introduced to provide a subsidy in the amount of AZN100 for each head of cattle born through artificial insemination. In addition to strengthening state support for agriculture, approximately 100 regulatory documents have been adopted to substantiate agricultural reforms, complete transparency has been ensured in the provision of subsidies, and public awareness has been improved. As a result of the measures taken in the last two years, the number of producers with agricultural machinery has improved, crops have been collected in a timely and prompt manner with minimum losses, and the difficulties farmers used to face have been eliminated. We are now analyzing the structure of our agricultural depot and its distribution among the districts. This is expected to help us identify the need for specific machinery and equipment in different districts. At the current stage of the agricultural reform, the construction of laboratory buildings in 52 districts and cities is drawing to a close. Along with the administrative staff, these will bring together agro-chemical and seed laboratories, diagnostic offices, seed inspectorates, technical control, and other services. In addition, the establishment of the necessary information technology and infrastructure will facilitate the implementation of our plans. As part of these reforms, a Veterinarian Camp meeting ISO requirements has been set up. The refurbishment of a laboratory of the State Service for Phytosanitary Control is also in its final stages. To ensure the sustainable development of agriculture, work has also been carried out to build up institutional capacity in the area of seed-growing and livestock breeding. The State Seed Fund has been set up to ensure the reliable and uninterrupted provision of producers with seeds on concessional terms. The legal framework of the fund has also been developed. Using the funds allocated from the state budget, the Center for Artificial Insemination has been modernized with the participation of French and German experts. The laboratories of scientific and educational institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture have also been overhauled. The process of establishing farmer houses has begun to address the problems of agricultural producers. The attention in the regions is now focused on the provision of consultation services. Extensive measures have been taken to expand the agricultural infrastructure. The expansion of wholesale markets—for example, a network of “green markets" and farmer shops, the commissioning of modern butcher shops, and the establishment of logistical centers—have enhanced the efficiency of the market infrastructure and created a favorable market environment. Tangible steps have also been taken to set up agricultural parks based on advanced business technologies. In addition to the establishment of Shamkir and Yalama agricultural parks, different sections of the Khizi agricultural park are under way at the moment. These reforms, carried out in accordance with a long-term agricultural development program, have already started to bear fruit. The volume of agricultural production has increased by 6.6% in comparison with last year. This includes an 11.3% increase in the production of crops. The exports of fruits and vegetables, which form the backbone of agricultural exports, have increased by 7.2%, while the exports of cotton have risen by 34.8%. The increase in agricultural production over 2015 was not caused by cultivating much more land or a rise in the cattle head count, but by intensive factors such as an increase in productivity.
</p><h4>The Ministry allocated AZN4.8 million for electronic agriculture programs in 2015. What are some of the achievements in this area and how would you evaluate the progress of this initiative?</h4><p>
	The development of an electronic information system is one of our priority tasks. The Ministry of Agriculture has already created the necessary institutional capacity with support from the EU. Thanks to these measures, the relevant software and technical infrastructure has been developed in accordance with the EU's integrated administration and control system (IACS) to conduct the identification of land parcels, keep a register of farms, and operate other modules. This system is being designed by an Italian company, while technical support is provided by the EU. The electronic agriculture information system has already been tested and pilot applications of it have been launched in the Khachmaz, Guba, and Goygol districts. Work is currently under way to develop a database of aerial and satellite images of arable lands. We have also designed an electronic register of all leasing transactions carried out by the Ministry's AgroLeasing, including the concessions provided to farmers. The entire system for the registration of agricultural machinery in the country has also been digitalized. In cooperation with the World Bank, we have started working on a system of livestock identification. The initial electronic database of all livestock farms has already been prepared. As part of a project being implemented jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a continuously updatable electronic database of wholesale and retail prices of all agricultural products has been prepared. This database covers market prices both in Baku and the country's regions. The online database is available for everyone to see.
</p><h4>
	An EU delegation has visited Azerbaijan and reaffirmed its interest in seeing more Azerbaijani products in European markets. What is the Ministry doing to expand agricultural exports to the EU and other countries?
</h4><p>
	Unfortunately, EU countries account for only 4.9% of Azerbaijan's total exports of agricultural produce, worth $37.6 million. In addition to the volume of exports being too small, the assortment of goods being exported is not particularly large either. For example, 90% of the agricultural and food products exported to EU countries is made up of nuts, 3% nut butter (chocolate butter), and 4% pomegranate juice. The main reason for that is because our quality assurance system and existing standards are more in line with CIS requirements. Therefore, our products are mainly exported to CIS countries, especially Russia. However, the head of state has recently urged the government to strengthen the country's traditional markets and access new ones to the maximum extent possible. This is why we are now in the process of establishing a network of modern laboratories to align our quality assurance system with European requirements. We have also started procedures to obtain international accreditation of these laboratories. At the present time, most of the public investment allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture is channeled into the modernization of laboratories. The establishment of a quality control system in line with modern requirements is a priority direction in our cooperation with international organizations.</p><h4>How can the Formula One European Grand Prix bring new benefits to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>
	This is certainly an important international event that will promote our country in the world. One of our key missions in the policy of expanding the non-oil sector is to promote and popularize the “Made in Azerbaijan" brand abroad. The government has started the application of new mechanisms for promoting the country in order to enhance our investment attractiveness. From this perspective, the Formula One European Grand Prix due to be held in Baku is one in a series of events serving this goal.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to support and expand the once well-developed cotton industry?</h4><p>
	The President of Azerbaijan has issued new instructions in this regard and we have already started implementing them. In particular, meetings have been held with representatives of cotton-producing enterprises, their needs and proposals have been discussed, specific decisions have been made, and new mechanisms have been introduced. For example, in order to facilitate the development of cotton breeding, the transportation costs of processing enterprises will be reimbursed, while 90% of production expenditure will be paid in advance. To achieve this, concessional loans and leasing services provided by the state will be used extensively. In addition, processing enterprises in 2016 will significantly increase the price of raw cotton in comparison with previous years. All these activities will lead to the sowing of cotton on an area 30,000ha more than last year, which represents an increase of 80%. This will double the production of raw cotton by an additional 70,000 tons. The number of people involved in this sector will be twice as high as 2015.</p><h4>After last year's successful parliamentary election, what are the Ministry's expectations for 2016?</h4><p>
	Last year's parliamentary election ended in a victory of the party led by President Ilham Aliyev. This attests to the popular support of the government's policies. Azerbaijan is entering a new period of non-oil sector development, in particular the period of agricultural reforms, and this result is also evidence of people's approval of reforms. This is an important precondition for the success of any reforms. Therefore, the expectations of the Ministry are very positive. We are fully confident that agricultural reforms will be successfully continued and remarkable results will be achieved. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some unique services that your company provides to oil and gas partners?</h4><p>We are involved with the transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous goods for the oil and gas industry, including all onshore and offshore drilling. We have one of the largest fleets of ADR vehicles in Azerbaijan. ADR certifications are required for transporting hazardous goods, because in the oil and gas industry these goods can be classified all the way up to Group 8. Therefore, this requires unique trucks that meet ADR requirements. We deal with the waste transportation of onshore and offshore, because there is a lot of waste generated through the pipelines and our vehicles are used to transport this material. Since we are working with clients like BP, we need to meet all of its requirements.</p><h4>What kind of vehicle fleet is in operation at AZ Logistics?</h4><p>We have many different types of vehicles. We have a large fleet of ADR-certified road tankers, hook trucks, skip trucks, and all-purpose trucks. We need all of the necessary equipment to deal with the high Western standards. We have a large fleet of vacuum machines, which are involved in tank cleaning operations. As the ships come from offshore projects, they need to be cleaned of their oil marks. We are involved in that cleaning process, and we have mechanical personnel on-site for vehicle recovery and repair services. We have over 110 vehicles in our fleet, which need servicing. Since we have a team that performs this service on our own vehicles and because we have pick-ups and vans with special equipment, we decided to offer this service to third parties as well.</p><h4>Does receiving international certifications offer a competitive advantage for AZ Logistics over domestic competitors?</h4><p>Yes, having the best equipment is an advantage. However, the team and the company's system are also important. We were working to the standards of BP and the system was there, but we were not certified. Last year we applied for ISO certification and this year we got it for quality control as well as an OHSAS certification. Our experience working with BP has allowed us to get these certifications, which also offers our company the opportunity to find work outside of the country. Our company is able to offer complete customer satisfaction to ensure customer loyalty while providing high-quality services. We have many years of experience in transporting hazardous and non-hazardous goods. AZ Logistics and Management Services LLC now is ISO certified. We were awarded certificates for ISO 9001 in 2008, ISO 14001 in 2004, and OHSAS 18001 in 2007. We were also awarded the Best Logistics Company of the Year 2015 within Azerbaijan, making us the number-one choice when it comes to logistical needs such as transportation, relocation, multi-modal operations, heavy equipment logistics, and much more.</p><h4>What kind of international network do you have in place that helps you operate outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>At the moment, we are trying to expand internationally through the transportation of cargo, but not dangerous goods. We have a couple of contracts with companies in Moscow, we have a contract in Istanbul, and we are working toward the European market. We have some contracts from companies in Azerbaijan that are distributing cargo to Italy and Germany. However, this is a new field for us, so we are trying to build up a network. At the moment, everything is going as planned. In 2015, we added refrigerated and wagon trailers to our fleet, which now allow us to transport any type of goods, from food to building and construction materials. It seems that 2016 is going to be a hard year, especially for oil and gas; the price of crude oil is going down and things have slowed down. As a company, we need to diversify and move into different sectors. We are moving into the food industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact did the announcement of 2015 as the Year of Agriculture have on Ganja Sharab-2?</h4><p>The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, is fully aware of the importance of agriculture for the implementation of the food program. This is exactly why 2015 was declared the Year of Agriculture in Azerbaijan. Taking advantage of this situation, Ganja Sharab-2 has increased attention to its viticulture department and taken measures to expand areas for grapes. In particular, a new vineyard covering 23ha has been established in the Samukh district and the relevant agro-technical activities have been launched to set up another on an area of 16ha. This has increased Ganja Sharab-2's grape plantations to 425ha. In order to address our need for grapes, close contacts have been established with grape-growing farms in adjacent districts. We have been purchasing and processing grapes from it, which contributes to agricultural development in these districts. Our company employs about 200 people in its agricultural division, and this accounts for half of our total workforce.</p><h4>How much wine and vodka does Ganja Sharab-2 produce annually?</h4><p>Our company has prepared and is now implementing an action plan on how to increase the sales of wines and vodka. According to this plan, Ganja Sharab-2 produces high-quality products. Our merchandise is competitive and popular both in and outside Azerbaijan. During 2015, we produced 40 varieties of wine and vodka of 10 denominations. In total, our company sold 288,300 decaliters of wine and 168,300 decaliters of vodka in 2015. In 2016, we plan on further expanding work in this direction, increasing the assortment of our products and taking other measures to meet consumer demand for our merchandise.</p><h4>How does the application of advanced European technologies contribute to the greater efficiency of your company?</h4><p>In 2015, our enterprise commissioned a processing workshop operating on the basis of cutting-edge technologies and meeting international standards. All equipment in this workshop was manufactured in leading foreign countries. This has made it easier both to produce quality products and to increase volume.</p><h4>As a company exporting 50% of its wine, how do these exports help you manage your Azerbaijan operations?</h4><p>It is true that we are exporting about 50% of our products. The revenues fetched by these exports are channeled into the further development of our enterprise. In particular, a significant portion of our profit is spent on new process equipment. This, in turn, is important to ensuring continuous development and retaining a stable workforce. In order to increase our exports, we regularly participate in international competitions. Our products have repeatedly been awarded with medals and diplomas. The most notable of our products include Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Hillside, and Yeddi Gozel (Seven Beauties). We are working with a number of countries to expand the geography of our exports.</p><h4>What is Ganja Sharab-2 doing to promote its brand name and reputation?</h4><p>Ganja Sharab-2 is doing a lot to enhance its reputation and strengthen its market positions. Continuous quality improvement is one of top priorities. Our company produces wines with a broad price range in order to appeal to population categories with different levels of income.</p><h4>How will the Formula One Grand Prix of Europe, due to be held in Baku, contribute to the development of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The fact that Azerbaijan will be hosting such a prestigious international event attests to the tremendous authority President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva are enjoying in the world. This competition will give a major boost to the development of tourism. Of course, the numerous visitors to Azerbaijan will get acquainted with our customs and traditions and abundant food, including our wines. Many of them will share their impressions with others after returning to their countries, and this will contribute a great deal to the promotion of Azerbaijan in the world.</p><h4>What are Ganja Sharab-2's plans for 2016?</h4><p>Our company is committed to solidifying our achievements, expanding the assortment of our merchandise, further improving the quality of our products, and making its modest contribution to the overall development of Azerbaijan. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Abu Dhabi Terminals facilitated growth in the Emirate's maritime sector?</h4><p>We expect YoY growth to come in at roughly 35% for 2015 over 2014. That means that we are going to handle around 1.5 million containers in 2015. On top of that, we are looking at 10-11% growth for 2016 in terms of our forecast. The Abu Dhabi export business is the most important segment for us, along with transshipment. Those two segments really drive the bulk of our growth. On the imports side, growth is much more moderate, as it is related to GDP and government spending. Therefore, we are looking at fairly normal growth percentages of 3-5%. The major industries for us on the export side are steel, aluminum, polymers, and also food processing and agriculture. All of these activities have been invested in a great deal over the last couple of decades. The authorities have been ramping up capacity and producing a lot on the commodities side. Most of this goes out through Khalifa Port and drives our growth. We have also been expanding the transshipment business, moving cargo for other ports in the region. Whether that be from here to Kuwait, or India or Bahrain, the UAE is still the hub that most shipping lines and traders choose within the Gulf area.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your relationship with the pivotal government-linked companies that you work with here in Kizad, and how you are facilitating trade for them?</h4><p>We take a direct approach and spend considerable time and effort on building market intelligence via door knocking, data from ship manifests, stowage plans, and so forth. We use all the information we collect to map out the markets and the origins and destinations for all the companies that are importing and exporting in Abu Dhabi and the surrounding markets. Then, we talk directly to those companies to find out what they need. We look at whether we have all their business, and if not what we have to do to get it. We use that same approach from the small companies up to the large government accounts. Obviously, we cannot talk to them all at once as we have 10,000-15,000 trade customers at the port ranging from sole operators importing two containers up to companies doing 200,000. Once we figure out what the customers need in terms of service and coverage we try to translate that into a network that we can provide. We map that network up and match it to the shipping lines' networks. This way, we can accurately measure whether we are servicing the economy and the trade satisfactorily. It also allows us to identify opportunities that we would not otherwise know about, such as the packing plant, which is not an obvious activity to do at a container terminal. There is a trend, especially with the major industrial accounts, wanting to go back to the basics of what they do, such as creating aluminum or polymers. They do not want to deal with transport, storage, inventory management, ordering, and packing. This is an opportunity for us to integrate and capture more value out of those industries than we otherwise would. It is becoming more of a differentiator for us as well because most ports do not go this far. They usually stop at services to ships, i.e. getting the containers in and out. We go much further than that and it is becoming our edge.</p><h4>What can we expect in 2016 from Abu Dhabi Terminals in terms of expansion, development, and major names coming in?</h4><p>At the moment, there are 45 different companies setting up at Kizad. That industrial zone will continue to grow, it just takes time to build and get all the permits in place. Brazil Foods (BRF) is celebrating its first anniversary at Kizad, and once companies are there and it starts developing, the integration will really begin to work. The companies there typically look at supplying the UAE market, then add more capacity and go into the Gulf market. We are adding the final stage of Phase I in 4Q2016-1Q2017. We will be getting another three automated stacking ship-to-shore (STS) cranes from China, because we are starting to become full in terms of the footprint we have. In 2016, we are going to be 85% utilized, which is a lot for most ports. Then, we will go into Phase II, which is the full build of the man-made port island. We expect to start investing in that in 2018. By that time, we will be up to over 2 million TEUs and there is a lead time of about 18 months from investment to commissioning. Then, we will have another 2.5 million TEU capacity to grow with. We have been enjoying a fantastic growth profile over the last five years. The container volume in Abu Dhabi grew from 500,000 to 1.5 million TEUs in four years. We will have another one or two years with double-digit growth, and then it will moderate after 2017. There are a number of wild cards at the moment with low oil prices and budget deficits in the Gulf states, which is relevant for everyone. Having said that, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have more stamina than some of the other countries when it comes to cash reserves. No doubt there will be pressure on government spending, and that will slow activity down somewhat, or at least make the growth profile more moderate.</p>]]></richbody0content>
