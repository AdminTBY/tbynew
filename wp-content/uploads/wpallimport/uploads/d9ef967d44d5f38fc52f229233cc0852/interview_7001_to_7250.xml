		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ATC evolved in the past year?</h4><p>We were originally founded to foster the relationship between the US and Turkish defense sectors, but as the Turkish defense sector has become so much more mature in recent years and is becoming very capable on its own, we see that the ATC needs to expand itself. We need to branch out into a lot more of the emerging sectors. Accordingly, there have been changes to our flagship event, the Annual Conference on US-Turkish Relations. This year we intentionally changed the date of the event to September. Usually it's been in the summer time, as Congress winds down its year before leaving Washington, but this year we moved it to stay out of the elections here in Turkey. We also expanded the event to encompass broader economic and political communities that are part of the US-Turkish relationship. We are making a very strong effort this year to generate broad interest in the bilateral relationship, by going into some other industries we haven't been much into the past, like education or the energy sector. We are really looking at the renewable sector this year whilst agriculture is also important. We are excited this year to promote a more diverse group and conference, with which we are hoping to attract a wider audience.</p><h4>In which other sectors do you see potential for increased cooperation?</h4><p>We are seeing potential in the services sector. One of our members—ATU Duty Free, Turkey's leading duty free operator chain—was recently awarded its first duty free retail concession in the US with a 10-year contract to the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Texas. We've also seen companies like Borusan invest in the US and establish manufacturing facilities related to gas exploration. To a lesser extent, the food, manufacturing, and textiles industries tend to be strong for Turkish exports. However, I think therein lies a lot of the growth potential for exports to the US. I don't think it's near the potential that it could be. We'd like to see how we can encourage trade and open doors. Some of it is literally just navigating the US market because it's a rather large and sometimes ominous market to get into. One service we'd like to get into is business development consultancy. It will not necessarily be ATC doing the nuts and bolts of business development, but connecting our members to credible business development services and consultancies inside the US to help them grow.</p><h4>What is your view on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)? What can ATC do to manage some of the concerns Turkish companies have about that?</h4><p>At this point, the ATC is educating and advocating for Turkish inclusion in TTIP. We feel that TTIP, without Turkish involvement, will further complicate US-Turkish trade. These types of agreements are all about the economy, but they have everything to do with politics. Turkey needs to continue to do a couple things; reform the economy and do what it can to quell political uncertainty that off balances its economy, as well as address structural concerns like account deficits, low savings, high debt ratios in the country, and government transparency and accountability. Rules of laws and integrity are the things the government should address in a fairly quick timeframe. Moreover, all these reforms are just good economics. It's good for the Turkish economy regardless of the TTIP or any FTA. It is also good for the 2023 goals that Turkey has set for itself. Equally as important is repairing, rebuilding, and establishing its relationship with the US Congress. There are clear concerns there regarding the democratic process here in Turkey. Congress is one of the most important aspects regarding TTIP accession. It's one of the biggest things that Turkey needs to improve for that, or indeed any FTA, to happen. The US government is consistently saying that it understands Turkish concerns, but these reforms and issues need to be addressed first before any realistic talk about free trade can be entertained. The other aspect of Congress is not only the bilateral relationship, but Congress also has a business constituency in the US and business-to-business relationships between Turkish and US companies should happen to influence members of Congress to advocate for trade liberalization with Turkey is really crucial to moving that forward in any degree.</p><h4>Should there be more outreach from the Turkish business community to Congress?</h4><p>I don't think it would hurt. It's got to be done smartly, though. I think the way to do that is not through direct Turkish business outreach to Congress, but through business-to-business relationships and building business constituencies. That's done in many ways, such as joint ventures, and by establishing closer economic relations on a daily basis. That will translate to a higher level of trust and collaboration, which will find its way into Congress. Since I took over, I've been trying to promote inclusiveness. Most organizations that are in this sphere have a voice. At the ATC, we are really excited to work with these other organizations when our interests align. Relevant, timely events are really what we're going after, but they don't have to be large. Some of our members prefer smaller, more focused events for specific topics or sectors.</p><h4>What role can US businesses play in supporting Turkish companies' ambitions to develop their own defense products?</h4><p>We are in a transition phase now. Our Turkish members often tell me that they want to be partners, not customers. That is a very accurate way of putting it. Turkish defense companies want to do things with companies like Roketsan and Lockheed-Martin, who last year agreed on a missile deal for the F-35. Inherent in these types of joint ventures is technology and skills transfer. The impending Tor missile system is another example. The primary concern from the Turkish defense sector is that of learning new technologies and skills. Turkey has the manufacturing capacity, but it still lacks a certain amount of technology and engineering capacity. There are some incredibly well educated folks here in Turkey, of course, but it's the nuts and bolts of applying the knowledge they have and adopting their own indigenous products. Through joint ventures and other partnerships, I believe US companies can help Turkey on its road towards indigenous technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[As Managing Director of MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe is responsible for developing strategies that have resulted in the growth of local content and increased capacity across product portfolios. In addition, he has driven a mass-market strategy that has recorded substantial business expansion in a very short time. His leadership has given rise to increased customer touchpoints across Nigeria, thereby easing the burden on MultiChoice customers by building a distribution network to effectively manage and shape customer buying patterns. Also along the lines of easing the burden on the customer, John spearheaded various payment initiatives, ensuring that customers could now pay their bills at their own convenience. A key focus area for John as Managing Director of MultiChoice is sports development in Nigeria. For him, sports is a natural tool for youth engagement as it keeps them focused on a viable extra-curricular activity. The quest to raise awareness about sports in Nigeria has led to the sponsorship of the increasingly popular sport basketball and the rebirth of the one-time national favorite; boxing, which had gone into near extinction. John Ugbe is an active fundraiser for community development causes.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business evolved to its current stage?</h4><p>MultiChoice Nigeria has been in the country for 22 years. From the beginning, we believed in bringing the best entertainment to people's screens. We are a video entertainment company, so even if it meant initially bringing in foreign content, we then started developing local content—music, movies, sports—that met international standards. Over the years, we have been able to build a local business, one that both imports and exports content. Nigeria is a cultural powerhouse, and is attracting greater interest from around the world, with the ongoing cultural revolution. MultiChoice has been at the forefront of taking what the country has and distributing it beyond our borders. Through the AfricaMagic group of channels, we have showcased our locally developed, bought, and acquired content around Africa. This makes Africa integrate better because now we are more aware of one another's cultures, and are breaking down barriers across Africa.</p><h4>What are your greatest successes in Nigeria in terms of content creation?</h4><p>The soap opera Tinsel is a good example. Over 1,500 episodes have now run, making it the longest-running content to come from Nigeria. It is a large-scale production—it has literally impacted Nigeria's GDP, as it has created jobs both in front and behind the camera. The projection of the next five years is around 70% growth in our sector. We created a market—which didn't exist previously—and, in turn, we created demand. With demand, we now have people keen to work and put content on the table. Some people were willing to buy, and we were the first to buy and commission local content from Africa. We have a lot of people in the industry. People only see the actors, but there are all sorts of people—carpenters building the sets, wardrobe people, people holding mics—we've seen notable growth in the entertainment industry in Africa. Initially, this market didn't exist, but now people are suddenly recognizing the growing contribution of entertainment on the economy. We are still in our infancy, and need growth, development and supervision to ensure that we create quality that can compete internationally. “Nollywood" produces more movies than Hollywood per annum. Once the quality begins to match the quantity, we will have a much bigger movie industry coming out of Africa.</p><h4>What percentage of MultiChoice's African business does Nigeria represent?</h4><p>It is growing relative to the total share YoY. One way to look at it is at the amount of content coming out of Nigeria. The content generated here is being consumed across the continent. That is testament to the sheer opportunities that exist to grow the business locally. We have not peaked yet.</p><h4>What are your plans to move content to a global scale?</h4><p>We have an offering that is serving Europe and the US with an online VOD content. I think we have managed to develop a taste for the content beyond the continent. We have always believed in Africa and that is why we operate in many African countries. We believe in Nigeria, which our operations here confirm. We have impacted the quality of screen media through classes, commissioning, training, and equipment. We have implemented the AfricaMagic Viewers' Choice Awards to reward hard work and help people to aspire, which can positively affect the quality because now people are hungry for success.</p><h4>How do you adapt to the online content trend?</h4><p>I do not see us as “adapting;" we are ahead of the curve. We set the pace. When we introduced mobile TV through our mobile brand, Nigeria was the first in Africa to do so, and actually ahead of Europe. We have an app for phones called DStv, which enables DSTV premium subscribers to watch their favorite programs and take the content with them. We think ahead and strive to give our subscribers the best. We are a paid-for entertainment company, which means we are not tied to one platform or the other, but we need to ensure that we study the habits and give the best service to our subscribers.</p><h4>How do you package the content to fit the taste of a country as diverse as Nigeria?</h4><p>We cater to the market not only from a pricing perspective—we have a variety of subscriptions from affordable to premium so that we do not leave anyone out—but also by taking region and language into consideration. We have AfricaMagic channels in Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo. We also study the trends, establish what needs there are, and introduce programs that fulfil demand.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In the entertainment business it is all about emotions. The change in government promises exciting developments in terms of new infrastructure, which will positively impact our organization and every business in Nigeria. Everyone is looking forward to better infrastructure because, with that, the size of the economy will grow. And as long as you are effective in business you, too, will grow. We will be developing more content. We launched a new Igbo channel some months ago, which has substantial demand for content. Many content producers had not been producing in the Igbo language, yet now we have created demand for a new class of movies, documentaries, and other content. We will also be opening new studios shortly here in Lagos. That again confirms long-term commitment. Innovation being developed, we believe, will expedite economic recovery. Through Nollywood and other productions, Nigerians have proven their creativity. We may not have the biggest industries and we may be behind the curve in certain sectors, but we can get ahead in terms of entertainment through investment and curatorship. In terms of Nollywood, we consume more than 80% of what is produced. We are the enterprise that puts the Nigerian movies and content into African markets. That industry is only going to grow, and we are developing a structure. For example, we have a product that allows you to rent a movie from your couch, that's our BoxOffice. Nollywood has struggled with distribution and piracy—the key challenge in our industry. Our product allows the movie producer to have their movie rented from someone's couch, which means he gets paid for rentals. We think that structure is an example of what will drive growth. As producers get paid, they have the confidence to produce more content. And as they do so, quality improves, allowing us to compete with Hollywood.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At last year's WEF Saudi German Hospital was awarded the Global Growth Award. What impact does this have on the objectives of Saudi German Hospital going forward?</h4><p>International recognition from the WEF always gives a positive push. International recognition by a platform such as the WEF gives reassurance that we are on the right track. Our group vision 28 years ago was to establish a successful healthcare organization, and we began by building hospitals in cities throughout the GCC. To expand in the healthcare industry is complicated, and successful implementation is very difficult. Considering SGH's aggressive rate of expansion, recognition is therefore rewarding and will only propel our efforts forward.</p><h4>What is the objective of SGH here in Dubai?</h4><p>After establishing ourselves in Yemen, we expanded to Dubai with the same objectives; it was a strategic move. We want SGH in Dubai to be a successful part of the Group and also to be part of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision for healthcare within the Emirate itself. Dubai is a healthy environment for investment with much potential. We have given a tremendous level of importance to developing our hospitals from scratch, and we have a unique vision for how we will grow in Dubai. Phase I of our establishment is complete; a 300-bed tertiary hospital. Our long-term plan is to create a Saudi German Healthcare City in Dubai, which will consist of a general hospital, main hospital, and six sub-specialty hospitals, along with a medical tower. We are already in Phase II of our plan, which includes adding three specialty hospitals. Our hope is to have the Phase II completed by World Expo 2020.</p><h4>In Dubai's competitive healthcare landscape, what strategic advantage does Saudi German Hospital possess?</h4><p>Of course it is very difficult to enter a market that is already saturated. We have had to prove ourselves in a very short amount of time in order to capture and keep a customer segment; this has been a driving factor for establishing our reputation. To enter a market already dominated by private and public-sector players and establish ourselves, we had to put a tremendous amount of energy into building a management team and a base of skilled, world-class physicians. We used this combination of talent and experience to identify market needs and work closely with government regulators and players. We feel that we are all partners in the development of a world-class healthcare city.</p><h4>How does SGH see medical tourism as an opportunity for growth?</h4><p>The UAE in itself represents a great opportunity for growth. Due to our reputation and expertise, we are able to attract what we call domestic medical tourists, meaning those living in other Emirates who travel to our hospital for treatment. Within this segment of customers, we are able to attract referrals from other hospitals within the UAE whose patients need advanced or specialized procedures. With the growing population of Emiratis travelling abroad, we have also seen an influx of what we call reverse medical tourists; those patients returning from abroad to have medical operations done here or continue their treatment plans. Finally, we see a tremendous opportunity in the traditional medical tourism segment coming from the GCC, Africa, and Asia.</p><h4>Recently the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) imposed a price-cap on the increased cost of healthcare services at 4.22%. Looking forward, how will this affect operations at SGH?</h4><p>We understand the rationale behind the DHA's decision. However, we want to underscore the importance of two-way communication between hospitals and the authorities, to ensure that the price-cap is implemented in a way that benefits everyone. Insurance companies and other players as well will be affected. Due to the recent announcement of these regulations, the healthcare investment climate has chilled slightly because investors are concerned about their returns; the same goes for SGH. While there are many concerns about these regulations, ultimately we are confident that through free-flowing communication between all industry stakeholders, we can ensure that the sector continues to be both profitable and socially beneficial.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru's GDP growth slowed to 2.4% in 2014, the lowest since the financial crisis. What fiscal measures can the government use to stimulate growth over the coming year?</h4><p>The current market and multilateral agency forecasts predict that Peru will lead growth among the LA6 economies (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) in 2015, amid challenging international headwinds. According to the April 2015 survey by Consensus Forecasts, Peru accelerated from 2.4% in 2014 to 3.7%, followed by Chile (from 1.8% in 2014 to 2.8 %), and Mexico (from 2.1% in 2014 to 2.9%). Colombia decelerated from 4.6% in 2014 to 3.4%. We expect that primary GDP will contribute with 1.2 percentage points to economic growth in 2015, while fiscal policy will contribute 1 percentage point. Peru is using various tools to stimulate aggregate demand, such as an expansionary 2015 Public Budget, tax reduction for firms and households of 0.7% of GDP, Public Financial Management (PFM) measures to flatten the learning curve of incoming subnational authorities in order to accelerate public spending at a subnational level, and easing the pass-through from international oil price reduction to domestic prices. The country will also increase the amount of resources allocated for public infrastructure maintenance in subnational governments to 0.2% of GDP, and issue sovereign bonds to finance prioritized public investment projects and other additional measures to increase public spending. The government has recently proposed measures to boost private consumption with a potential economic impact of 0.7% of GDP, and temporary exemption on social security and pension contributions for salaries. The temporary availability of a fraction of the Unemployment Insurance Deposits Surplus (CTS) extension of measures on fuel price stabilization frameworks will also help, in addition to a price range system for selected agricultural imports, which has already been approved by Supreme Decree.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to encourage economic diversification and reduce dependence on commodities?</h4><p>The IMF has cut its GDP growth forecast for 2015 for the world and much harder for EM, with the biggest revisions made for Latin America and the Caribbean from 2.2% in October 2014 to 0.9% in April 2015. Peru has considerable mineral reserves and commodity potential, and is one of the leading countries for mining in the world. In Latin America, it is the number one gold producer and the second copper producer. The sector accounts for 12% of GDP and represents 55% of total exports. Despite the current metal price shock, the mining sector will remain one of the key engines of the Peruvian economy, while the introduction of new projects such as Toromocho, Constancia, and Las Bambas, as well as extensions such as Cerro Verde will bring more production and new investment opportunities. To reduce the dependence on mining for fiscal revenue, the Peruvian Government has been working to broaden the tax base and increase the number of taxpayers and offset the fall in metal prices since 2011. In addition, the new macro fiscal framework is separating public spending from the volatility of commodity prices. The influence of resource-related revenues in the planning of public spending was lowered through this new macro fiscal framework. With this new institutional framework, fiscal policy is in line with international best practices for commodity-exporting open economies. In Peru, the process of industrialization continues beyond the extractive industries. For example, in the non-traditional sector, between 2000 and 2014 the number of products exported at a value of at least $10 million has increased fourfold from 35 to 144 products. In the same period, the chemical industry recorded a fivefold increase in the export of medicines, perfumery, and personal care products. In addition, between 2002 and 2013 the number of destination countries increased from 145 to 174, and the number of exporting companies increased from 4,513 to 7,782. Finally, over the past decade, the total contribution of productivity to potential GDP growth was 2.4 percentage points.</p><h4>Peru has been praised in recent years for its pro-business reforms. What do you see as the next steps in this regard, and what longer-term reforms are necessary?</h4><p>We are aiming to standardize the tax system to OECD averages and reduce excessive tax related costs, streamline procedures and eliminate obstacles and other “transaction costs" for the investor, to boost investment, productivity, and employment, and to increase predictability regarding regulatory costs. Also, Peru's accession to the OECD will serve as a trigger for structural reforms. Peru is already part of the OECD's Country Program. The OECD established Country Programs as a new instrument for supporting dynamic, emerging economies in designing their reforms and strengthening public policy. In November 2014, the OECD's Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved Peru's Country Program 2015-2016. The working areas of the program include barriers to economic growth and development, public governance, and the improvement of the institutional environment, strengthening transparency and fighting corruption, and fostering human capital and higher productivity.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to encourage SMEs to integrate into the formal financial system?</h4><p>Peru recognizes the importance of SMEs in the growth and economic dynamics of the country. In this regard, the various policies aim to minimize the asymmetries and distortions in the market with regard to access to financing and the resolution and mitigation of information problems and transaction costs, among others. The main measures include strengthening of the Alternative Securities Market, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) fund.</p><p>The Alternative Securities Market has also been strengthened, and in June 2013 the regulatory framework was improved with the passing of a law to promote the entry of new issuers and improved market efficiency, which has enabled companies to access longer and medium term funding at lower costs. It should be noted that this market targets small and medium enterprises with the ability to issue debt or equity capital in the capital market, with lower costs and fewer requirements than larger companies.</p><h4>Peru is cited as having an infrastructure gap of between $30-80 billion. What role can fiscal policy play in accelerating infrastructure development?</h4><p>Peru is actually working to boost investment to reduce the infrastructure gap through the increased use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects, subject to an ex-ante evaluation of underlying fiscal risks, the strengthening of inter-institutional governance for investment, and unlocking of infrastructure projects delayed by red tape and permits. The Ministry of Economy and Finance together with Proinversión have established mechanisms for technical assistance to public entities. The Ministry has control over the fiscal implications of every PPP contract. Additionally, the definition of PPPs has been expanded to other services related to public services and infrastructure, as well as to projects in the field of applied research and technological innovation. There is also a better definition of the term “cofinancing," which today refers to any use of public resources and involves the operation phase of the project. Today, investors have the opportunity to submit what we call “Co-financed Unsolicited Proposals" during the first 45 days of each calendar year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind the partnership with Spanish company Ulma?</h4><p>Ulma is a cooperative group with 4,000 members and six divisions; one of them is specialized in flanges. About 250 people work in this particular division, with annual sales of $78 billion and with 40,000 tons of production a year, covering 47 countries worldwide. Exports account for 97% of Ulma's production. We have been Ulma's partner in Ecuador since 2008, when we faced a problem with Chinese flanges. We saw the opportunity to increase the quality of our services thanks to this partnership. At that time, Ulma did not have a partner in Ecuador and it was a risky decision for us in terms of production costs. We have been able to position a high standard brand as well as introduce a product that did not previously exist in the Ecuadorian market, a “golden flange" at a highly competitive price. The partnership with Ulma evolved very well after that and they have come to see us as the strongest partner they could have in this market. Over the years, Ulma helped us with very valuable know-how transfer and we have been able to increase volumes year by year, entering key national projects such as Petroamazonas, where these flanges are homologated. We target several key projects in the country, such as the pipeline that runs to the Pacific Refinery. Ulma has put a lot of effort into Ecuador enabling us to work hard on positioning and consolidating their flanges, which are the most valuable and reputable products.</p><h4>Is the company looking into other market niches?</h4><p>We have become a strong brand in the oil and gas industry thanks to our sales and post-sales services. The combination of these two elements is what helps to make the difference in the market. We look at the possibility of expanding into the mining industry, potentially for a large pipeline project in neighboring Peru. This would be our first project beyond our borders, and we are proud to be on the right path. We would like to make the move abroad alongside Ulma and I truly believe it will happen shortly.</p><h4>Where do you see Juan Cevallos in five years?</h4><p>I feel very attracted to business opportunities in Peru. The oil and gas industry in Peru is like the Ecuadorian industry a decade ago. We have a lot of experience to share alongside international partners such as Ulma. This pipeline is an Odebrecht project, with whom we have already partnered in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are some of the key projects you have lined up for the near future?</h4><p>We currently work on a highly interesting project regarding the shift in Ecuador's production matrix; a spiro metallic production plant. This idea originated from an analysis of the imports we do as a company and we will partner with Argentinean Flexim. We already have the physical area where we would locate the plant and I plan to set up Ecuador's first spiro metallic production plant.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>We closed 2014 on a $7.5 million turnover and after the 1Q2015 I can proudly say that we posted 10% growth on the same period in the previous year. This has been possible thanks to our entering several tenders. For 2015, we plan to relocate our headquarters and warehouse. The current facilities are rather small when we are fully staffed—25 people. We have grown at a rapid pace and have consequently exhausted our existing facility. I intend for construction work to commence in early 2016. And meanwhile, on the social responsibility front, we will open our first football academy in 2H2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><a>Diamond Bank</a> is among the region's newest and most ambitious players and has a unique take on the Nigerian banking arena; can you explain how it fits into the larger banking sector?</h4><p><a>Diamond Bank</a> started by building a platform that would enable people to transfer from one place to another in real time. The middle market, which is mostly trade across Nigeria, was physically carrying cash from one place to another to exchange. This helped drive our business and acquire new customers in a short space of time. When you are facilitating payments it also helps you to understand the customer's business, and when you understand their business you can lend. We were one of the first banks to start lending to a segment of the economy that was not structured that consisted of one man businesses and entrepreneurs. Technology has allowed us to reach SMEs and the unbanked, but the application is more important. We see ourselves as a retail organization with a banking license. Mobile is a big bet for us; for example, customers that use mobile banking do seven times more transactions.</p><h4>Last year Caryle Group took a stake in <a>Diamond</a>, its first in any Nigerian business and one of the largest private equity transactions in Africa last year; can you talk about what the capital will help the bank to do and what the significance of that level investment from an internationally recognized private equity is in the Nigerian banking space?</h4><p>There is strength in the Carlyle brand, which gives us global respect. Carlyle is one of the biggest private equity firms that has invested in Africa, after doing their due diligence, and so that speaks volumes. That allows us to leverage their global reach. They made an equity investment, and their goals are to continue to optimize our technology and to increase our footprint. In terms of branches, we have covered most of Nigeria, but we will invest in modernization, ATMs, and connectivity. Once the majority of our customers no longer feel that they need to come to the bank to perform transactions, they are going to be used for advisory services. It is particularly through SME customers that we are trying grow, access to advisory services and access to markets will ensure that they are sustainable and to help them build that capacity from a governance perspective.</p><h4>The first half results from <a>Diamond</a> are strong, the bank has managed to grow its revenues overall, but profit has fallen slightly; what strategic decisions and what head winds in the larger economy have contributed to these results in the first half?</h4><p>Quite a few regulatory policies came into play: in the first half of the year there were three. The cash ratio played a large role in the harmonization of private and public sector funds, which hurt us due to our portfolio. And then of course, the new foreign exchange laws have not helped. We command quite a lot in terms of trade and business that goes on, and there has been a vast drop in trade as a result of the availability of funds. And then in light of the economic situation, and of course the drop in oil prices as well. What's more the individual States lack the resources to investment, whereby contractors have not been paid, having to provide adequate provisions on that front, too. The upside is that we have a diverse customer base and customer business and do not have extensive public sector involvement. Meanwhile, we have also observed that our mobile business channel will help us withstand any shocks to the system.</p><h4>You have invested in mobile technology and are recognized as a bank in West Africa with a unique take on that concept in Banking. What is the way forward?</h4><p>We cater to mainstream customers numbering 4.5 million, half a million of which have signed up for mobile banking. We intend to reach the 1 million mark by the end of this year, and double that by the end of 2016. The cost of the internet is declining, as is that of smart phones, and we are even lending to facilitate aquisition. An interesting example of our strategy is Better Proposition, a product mainly aimed at women. When you travel around Lagos or indeed elsewhere in Nigeria you come accross markets where women hold the authoritative role. You find in many cases that while they may be close to bricks-and-mortar branches, they never enter a bank. In fact, they lack a bank account, relying instead on an informal system fraught with high interest rates and uncertainty. What we did was do displace this with inclusion in the formal financial system by taking the bank to them. We built a proposition wherby we hired and trained sales agents, and built a cloud-based banking application to be linked to our main server and then signed customers up with interswitch to then be followed up with a SIM card based bank card. Basically, the agent identifies the potential customer at the market and has a banking application on his mobile phone. He takes a photograph of the applicant, keys in their name and mobile number, and the woman receives a text message on her mobile phone saying that the account has been open and revealing the account number. Once she hands over 10,000 naira to deposit in the bank, the agent keys it in the system, she receives a text informing her of the balance, and vice versa, whereby if she makes a subsequent withdrawal, that also happens. We launched it 24 months ago and today have 200,000 customers, according to 100 branch locations, with over 3 billion naira in total balances and an engagement rate of 97%, where the average balance is comparable to mainstream savings account holders, and bear in mind that we are talking about mobile banking. So what we are trying to do with our banking and application perspective is to go beyond banking and make our mobile banking application in particular, more of a lifestyle app.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>It is going to be a tough year for many reasons, the first being that there are a few policies that have been put in place that will come into play and really start biting. Essentially, as an economy we need to suffer before we see that light at the end of the tunnel. We have entrepreneurs, and wealth and human capital to really leverage Nigeria's resources. But next year is going to be challenging and tough, where <a>Diamond Bank</a> will need to weather conditions beyond its control. We have, however, invested substantially in technology and can still provide services at a flat cost. We also have sufficient capital, which means that we can absorb unexpected losses and also have adequate liquidity. In challenging times there are also opportunities and you have to see the opportunities and take them, and we are positioned to take advantage of opportunities in this depressed economy and also when it picks up as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BTH been transformed since your tenure as director?</h4><p><span></span>BTH is a family business that I took over from my parents. For the past eight years, I have been working to develop new hotel concepts that distinguish the company in the market. Before, BTH was a traditional hotel that was not particularly innovative. Traveling in Europe exposed me to different business models, and inspired me to bring this new concept to the Peruvian hotel industry. In Peru, the hotel industry is rigid and pragmatic, and has not evolved significantly over the years. Therefore, the industry needs to understand that the habits and needs of users are constantly changing. Nowadays technology enables consumers to better keep up-to-date on the latest trends be they in fashion, cars, or hotels. This means that consumers are more demanding. It became clear that we needed to reinvent BTH as an avant-garde establishment. And now, after eight years of work, we have developed a hotel concept that has been acknowledged both locally and internationally. </p><h4>What specific changes needed to be made to the hotel once you took over?</h4><p><span></span>Our hotel had to be completely restructured, and we did not consider local architects sufficiently innovative for the task. Ultimately we settled on a celebrated Peruvian-Spanish architect for our redesign. The overall project has taken almost 10 years to get to where the hotel is today.</p><h4>What role do you see for BTH in Lima's hospitality sector?</h4><p><span></span>There are two main types of travelers in Peru: corporate travelers and tourists. Tourists come to Peru with their family, spend days planning, and are perpetually off to visit touristic sites. On the other hand, corporate travelers come for work, and stay in Lima. Their consumption habits are different; they are generally single, without children, and tend to prefer a more businesslike environment, and naturally we want them to feel at home. We offer them a chic, elegant and rewarding stay, where, for example, our restaurant features an open kitchen with 80% of what is served being organic in nature.</p><h4>What led you to target high-end business travelers?</h4><p><span></span>Eight years ago, BTH was called the Business Tower Hotel. At that time, our hotel was no different from many others in the city. Yet having analyzed and identified consumer habits, it became apparent that BTH was suited to a new category of guest. We essentially kept an eye on fresh design and offerings that would appeal to both younger guests and more seasoned business visitors. Moreover, in order to be able to cater to even the most exacting of corporate events, we equipped our establishment with six meeting rooms. Additionally, the hotel is located in central Lima, in the San Borja district which is becoming a key part of town. </p><h4>What are the next steps in the expansion of your brand?</h4><p><span></span>Although we changed our name from Business Tower Hotel to BTH, our customers still know that we are a business hotel because 80% of our market remains corporate. Therefore, our success depends on Peru's economic performance. And because we have successfully grown our business, as substantiated by real numbers, there are considerable expectations on the part of investors. We are confident in leveraging our brand equity for expansion beyond Lima, possibly even abroad as we perfectly reflect the life of the international executive.</p><h4>What is your vision for 2016?</h4><p><span></span>The elections are close now, and as Peru sustains its growth, so too will BTH. Innovation will continue to underpin everything we do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What role does PromPeru play in promoting Peru internationally and domestically?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Our mandate is essentially the promotion of our country, both domestically and abroad. In recent years, domestic tourism has played an important role for our country and an increasing number of Peruvian operators have turned their attention to the domestic tourist. In the past, it was much less of an interesting market. However, since infrastructure and income has improved, so has the capacity to sell holidays to Peruvians. We don't just promote, we also develop strategies to boost competitive destinations. On the other hand, we are focused on the diversification of Peruvian destinations. In this sense, our responsibility is not only to promote traditional destinations, but also to identify new and less-known alternatives. With regard to promotion abroad, we are focused on the Latin American market and the US. The latter represents 16% of the market.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>How important is tourism from neighboring countries to your strategy?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Over the past year we have been working to increase interest among our neighbors Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia. We have more than 800,000 Chilean tourists crossing the border annually. Most of them visit Peru because of health, commerce, and tourism. Gastronomy is also becoming an important attraction. Our advertising pool is focused on the north of Chile and southern Ecuador.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What are the biggest challenges confronting Peru in terms of tourism promotion?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>The challenge is the diversification of our offer. We are well positioned with Cuzco and Machu Picchu as the main cultural attractions. We also have nature, beaches and a varied geography that allows for interesting adventure tourism. At the moment, we are focused on eight regions. In the south, Machu Picchu will always be the star. But we are else promoting aggressively Arequipa and Puno. Arequipa with the deepest canyons in the world, is our second city, and aside from international tourism, attracts the greatest number of domestic tourists after Ica. This city is also gaining attention because it is going to host five important international events, placing it in the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) ranking. In Puno, we have rural tourism due to the lake and we are hoping Tacna will become a gastronomy hub.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What efforts have you been making to promote domestic tourism?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Three years ago we were evaluating possible strategies to encourage Peruvians to take their holidays locally and all year round. We wanted to make traveling a habit, and years ago, Peruvians traveled regularly and then the numbers decreased because of internal problems. We wanted people to reengage with traveling and make it easy and stress-free. We started an online campaign called “¿Y tú qué planes?" in 2012. Today, the travel search-engine that we created for “¿Y tú qué planes?" is the second most used among travelers after Google in Peru. We worked with operators in each region to create accessible information. We won an award from the World Tourism Organization for the campaign and domestic travel in Peru grew 4% last year.
</p><h4>What makes Lima a good destination for MICE tourism?</h4><p>
	<span></span>Lima is an international hub in a privileged location. The capital city has great infrastructure and many international brands are attracted to the city. The cuisine is world class, and the city's political environment is generally stable. The quality of services is respected and well known and infrastructure and investments in the city are increasing.
</p><h4>Could private investors play a larger role in developing Peru's tourism industry?</h4><p>
	<span></span>Yes, and not only in infrastructure, but across the board. Spain is one of the most important investors in Peru. The corporate sector is growing and flight connections are increasing. Lima is not the only destination attracting investor interest, as Tacna has done so, too.
</p><h4>What are your key goals for 2016? </h4><p>
	<span></span>We want to attract four million tourists to Peru. We have to consolidate markets such as US and Latin America, and will increase our work in these strategic markets through trade and campaigns. It is important to mention that there has been an increase in competition from regional states. We have to stay attractive in order to sustain growth at the same pace. We will keep working on innovative strategies and new products in relation to nature, adventure and culture depending on the demand of the different markets.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Peruvian Corporal Jorge Arnaldo Hernandez Seminario is a hero from the Paratrooper Brigade of the Spanish Army, which is an elite unit that has participated in most of Spain's peacekeeping operations. He received the Military Merit Cross with a Red Distinctive and a NATO Medal for his participation in the International Force for Security Assistance (ISAF) in Afghanistan.</p><p>Jorge Arnaldo was born in Chapica de Campana, a small hamlet of Chulucanas, the so-called capital of mangoes, lemons, and ceramics, in the state of Piura, Peru. He was 26 when he died on July 8th, 2006 on duty in Bakua, Afghanistan. From the Paratrooper Brigade, he sent savings to the village where he was born. He financed meals for one hundred children, and his dream was to build a clinic in his village and rebuild the primary school. Jorge Arnaldo: we will not forget you.</p><p>Almost 200,000 Peruvians live in Spain, with 112,000 having been granted Spanish nationality since 2000. This gives proof of their exemplary integration, their commitment and spirit of solidarity: They defend both freedom and our shared values in the most dangerous international missions of our armed forces, and with their special warmth, they take care of our sick and elderly. They are discreet heroes.</p><p>As President, I want to recognize and acknowledge the contribution of Peruvians to our development and what is now Spain. On behalf of all Spaniards, I would like to thank you. We owe you a debt of gratitude. Like Jorge Arnaldo, you are an example of commitment and dedication.</p><p>Peru's greatest asset is its people, as is evident from its talent pool. In opera, Juan Diego Florez's voice led Pavarotti to consider him his successor. In cinema, we remember Claudia Llosa's Oscar nomination. In haute cuisine, both Gaston Acurio and Rafael Osterling are renowned. In the upper echelons of science, Peruvian scientist Barton Zwiebach, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is one of the world's referents regarding the ambitious String Theory, called the “Theory of Everything." This theory unifies the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to explain the Universe in a revolutionary way. Zwiebach and his colleagues contend that matter is composed of strands of energy, or “strings" that vibrate, each producing their own tune, as if the Universe were a great symphony.</p><p>The dedication of Peruvians to our common language deserves special recognition. The Nobel Prize Mario Vargas Llosa is the beacon of a literature that is regularly updated with new names, some of whom live in Spain, like Santiago Roncagliolo (Alfaguara Novel Prize), Fernando Iwasaki (Don Quixote Journalism Prize), Jorge Eduardo Benavides (Torrente Ballester Prize), José Luis Torres Vitolas (Alfonso the Magnanimous Prize), or Sergio Galarza (Cortes of Cadiz Prize for Stories). In Spain, Peru is read, heard, and felt permanently.<br>The history of Spain is rich in contributions from Peru. In the sixteenth century, the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega was the first writer from the Americas who lived in Spain, brilliantly assuming his two cultural heritages. We can also highlight Pablo de Olavide, who was the promoter of the first organized and legal emigration in history, when many Europeans (mainly Germans) emigrated to Andalusia in the eighteenth century.</p><p>This outstanding human capital explains the development of Peru in recent years and projects the country into the future with huge potential. Spaniards believe in Peru: in 2010, our cumulative investment in the country was almost ‚¬2 billion; in only four years, despite the financial crisis, it increased by 100%, now moving around the level of ‚¬4 billion. Peru emerges strongly as an economic platform, thanks to its extensive network of Free Trade Agreements with the four cardinal points, including China. Peru takes advantages of its Asian heritage: it belongs both to the Pacific Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), and participates in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) free trade negotiations. Peru is a clear success of miscegenation, which in a global environment, easily merges with other cultures.</p><p>In recognition of Peruvians, my government was able to include Peru and Colombia on the list of countries whose nationals do not need the Schengen visa to enter the European Union. Nobody believed that this initiative could thrive in a time of crisis, but Spain could not allow Peru, along with Colombia, to become the only Latin American country with a visa requirement despite having signed a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, the so-called Multiparty Trade Agreement. Immediately after its entry into force in August 2013, Spain requested the removal of the visa requirement for Peruvians and Colombians. After an intense diplomatic offensive, in Autumn 2015 they will no longer need visas to enter the Schengen area, which is the biggest area of free movement for citizens in the world.</p><p>We could not discriminate against exemplary countries, which in the face of globalization have opted for openness rather than protectionism. When facing the adversities of drug trafficking and terrorism, their institutions have prevailed, proving to be sound, by overcoming such conflicts with the rule of law, through justice, negotiations and forgiveness. These processes of national reconciliation are an essential part of the new face of the region: peace and progress.</p><p>Spain has shown with facts, not rhetoric, that it never forgets Latin America. Even during a period of crisis, Spain has demonstrated that it defends Latin Americans and makes justice prevail for them, eliminating any existing stigmas. This great diplomatic victory is not ours: it belongs to you, Peruvians, it is yours. Thank you for your efforts and sacrifices, and to your ongoing contribution to our development.</p><p>As a Spaniard and Ibero-American, I feel a great satisfaction when standing up for discreet heroes such as Corporal Jorge Arnaldo Hernandez Seminario, and for all of you, Peruvians. I am a Hispanic of Europe, and I believe in Latin Americans. I have proved this, and I will continue to do so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the target demographic for tourism in Oman, and what are your targets in terms of tourist numbers?</h4><p>Historically, the GCC has been the main region that Oman has drawn its tourists from. Europe is another major market and, with some of our developing projects, we believe we are going to attract tourists from other areas especially in regards to family travel. We are also in the process of looking towards far eastern markets such as China. In the long term, it is also our aim that the US will become a target market. We are very happy with the demographics coming in; however, with our ongoing tourism strategy, we are also focused on the premium tourist, the responsible tourist who respects culture and environment, and the tourist who can add value to the economy as well. This is what we have built our strategy upon.</p><h4>In terms of family travel, can you elaborate on what areas you will be promoting opportunities in this area?</h4><p>To start with, it is to be noted that there has been a huge increase in domestic travelling. In 1Q2015, we had an increase of domestic travelling of 24%. Good revenue is coming in from four- and five-star hotels, and the demand from families is also increasing as well. More facilities, both indoor and outdoor, have been launched in a number of regions. Many tourists want to enjoy Oman's nature and see what the outdoors have to offer. A good number from the GCC have come to Oman with their families to experience this. During the holidays, we have also seen more traffic from European countries, with families enjoying tourism in the outdoors. The increase of the number of families coming to Oman is showing a healthy growth pattern moving forward.</p><h4>What can you do to promote people coming to Oman in the hotter and drier months?</h4><p>Many have the perception that Oman is only seasonal. However, we are creating activities during the off-season period because of the different weathers to be experienced in our country. We have been working hard on this, and are seeing the successful outcome of projects to promote Oman as an all-season destination. The weather in the summer months remains pleasant in the mountains, in addition to the autumn Khareef season in Salalah. Now we have cruise liners coming in all the time because of an extended season. We have more facilities being developed, and a number of major projects are catering to the needs of year-round tourism. A lot of people want different experiences rather than just a winter getaway, which is why there are different projects in the pipeline, which will cater to Oman being an attractive destination throughout the year.</p><h4>In what way is sustainable tourism being promoted, and are there any specific projects that are being focused on?</h4><p>Most of our projects now are either done by the Ministry directly or by OMRAN. We are working towards being sustainable because it is the future of tourism. We already have a lot of successful projects that have won some awards, and we have environmental projects to correlate with them. We work with investors to ensure that there are sustainable ways to maintain the environment. We also engage in projects with SMEs that are 100% environmentally friendly, and have started to build up that initiative as a pillar of our culture and a main driver of tourism. The diversification of our economy is important, and if we are going to make tourism a pillar of Oman's economy, we need to ensure that these areas are being addressed with the importance they deserve.</p><h4>In terms of the Ministry's focus on the environment, how can you coordinate with environmental companies to make sure that tourism supports this aspect?</h4><p>All of our projects must be authorized by the Ministry of the Environment, which is an important and unique feature as far as Oman is concerned. To make sure that all of our projects are environmentally friendly and keep within the guidelines of His Majesty, we do not want to be in an industry where you would have a negative impact in the long run. All of our costs are taken into account for each situation, and we regularly review requirements since global standards are constantly changing.</p><h4>In terms of the projects that are being developed as the Ministry, what effect has the oil price reduction had?</h4><p>The country has been working for a long time towards diversifying the economy. The tourism industry is one of the major pillars of the economy, and in the last five years our budget plan has shown a massive increase in funding from the government. Tourism and infrastructure expansion has certainly been a major part of their plan, and the infrastructure expansion was intended to invest on building up the industry of tourism. This country takes planning ahead seriously, which is why we ensure that investments are well planned and supported. The oil prices may have even helped with investments in the tourism sector. The sector is taking more credit in terms of development, and we now have over nine offices in the various regions of the country. Offices have been opened abroad, and the whole vision of the government is reflected in the tourism sector. The expansion of the airports has shown positive growth for the tourism industry as well. The oil prices dropping certainly pose challenges, but we now have an opportunity to work on our five-year plan. We also have a long-term plan tourism vision for 2040, which we are executing with the government.</p><h4>Can you give us an example of the types of strategies you are working on for 2040?<br></h4><p>The main target is to bring in 5 million international tourists to Oman by 2040. The scope of the strategy focuses on jobs, and we are working closely with the government and stakeholders to ensure that we have a good platform for industry and education. Tourism jobs worldwide are one in every eleven right now, and the job creation will hopefully show continued growth through both direct and indirect supply chains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KAMCO's strategy aims at maintaining its leadership position in the asset management and investment banking sectors. What trends have you seen dominating your investment performance in recent years?</h4><p>After 2013, KAMCO emerged from a difficult period following the financial crisis. We undertook significant restructuring and focused on building our core business areas: asset management and investment banking. We returned to profitability in 2013 and started achieving several key objectives and set milestones. The markets also supported us in their upwards tends. The key geographical focus areas for our clients were the MENA region including Kuwait, the GCC, as well as other targeted parts of the region. Several of our clients are increasingly observing Europe, North America, and the Far East but remain cautious and highly selective. The first half of 2014 was also positive while the second was more volatile due to a loss of investor confidence stemming from the drop in oil prices and increasing geopolitical instability, reasons that continue to affect markets to date. Despite numerous positive indicators, especially in the GCC, we see that capital market activity remains volatile, leading to a downward trend. This has affected the investment sector and KAMCO in our Capital Markets business. However, we successfully launched a new Fixed-Income Fund in March 2015 that is focused on the MENA region investment grade bonds and sukuks. KAMCO achieved KD5.1 million in Fee Income in 2014 compared to KD5.3 million in 2013. The company reduced its debts by 17% to KD24 mil in 2014 compared to KD29 mil in 2013. Our AUM registered a significant growth of 23% in 2014 to reach KD3.5 billion ($12.2 billion) in 2014, compared to KD2.9 billion ($10.1 billion) in 2013. KAMCO's results during 2014 reflected the company's balanced and consistent performance at the operating income levels in our main activities. By the end of 2014, we had successfully completed over 82 cumulative investment banking transactions worth over $12 billion.</p><h4>Who are your target clients and how are you tailoring your investment products to their needs?</h4><p>We believe that by creating products that give investors market access at lower costs with proper management and appropriate risk measures, we can benefit from tapping into the significant liquidity that is already there with medium to high-net worth individuals and corporates, as well as sovereign and semi-sovereign investing entities in the region. The product cycle we launched and are continually developing primarily focuses on these types of clients.</p><h4>To what extent has the new phase of privatization in Kuwait's capital markets supported the country's transition from frontier to emerging market status?</h4><p>Kuwait has been actively pursuing this strategy through significant upgrades in the regulatory framework and improvements in the laws that allow companies to be established or privatized under a new private-public sector framework. Processes such as these take time and issues related to fine-tuning regulations and making sure people adapt to and abide by the new codes of corporate governance and ethics may delay development. The government is taking the necessary steps to expedite this process. Unfortunately, market conditions are bearish in general, which appear to be affected by the regulations, but in reality they may show some kind of reaction as people adjust, it is more about a lack of investor confidence than anything else. Some of the initiatives taken recently by the CMA were aimed at encouraging investment, building investors trust, increasing the capital and encouraging creativity among investment companies. The CMA is working on making the financial market follow international measures in all of its activities by cooperating with specialized international organizations. The National Assembly recently passed a law amending several articles in the capital markets law to boost transparency in bourse dealings, provide more independence to the CMA and grant it more power to stop irregularities. Under the new amendments, the authority is trusted with the power to regulate the stock market based on justice, transparency, and competitiveness. They also provide the authority with the sufficient power to guarantee the protection of dealers and reduce typical risks expected in capital markets. The authority will ensure full disclosures to achieve transparency, prevent conflict of interests, and the use of insider information for personal gains. The authority is also trusted with uncovering crimes and referring cases to the public prosecution.</p><h4>How competitive is the Kuwait Stock Market compared to other Capital Markets in the region?</h4><p>The Kuwait Stock Market is one of the oldest in the region. There are still some structural issues regulators and major players are looking into. The loss of liquidity in the past few years since the financial crisis has resulted in the Kuwait market possibly becoming less competitive than others in the Gulf. The Kuwaiti market was second in the region in terms of size and liquidity but it is now fourth. There is an opportunity for Kuwait to capitalize on its positioning in the frontier market segment. If that is carried out appropriately then whenever the transition to emerging market status happens and the corresponding rules and regulations are established, competitiveness will grow rapidly.</p><h4>Where do you see potential for the investment sector in Kuwait to develop even further?</h4><p>The whole investment sector is still young in Kuwait and the region and the managed fund space is still small. Kuwait is probably one of the most active in terms of managed fund activity. If you compare the percentage of managed funds to GDP, the region is one of the lowest in the world, so there is ample potential for professional asset management products and services. That is where we see the greatest opportunities being presented and where people like us basically manage and hire the appropriate teams, establish the correct risk frameworks, and offer opportunities and access to investors they cannot easily identify.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for FDI into the Kuwaiti market and economy? </h4><p>Having one of the highest GDP per capita rates in the world means that the country's spending ability is greater than its size. This provides opportunities for multiple international companies to look at areas in which they can invest and receive a reasonable return. The areas that we see are centered around placed government development plans such as infrastructure and defensive projects. Healthcare and education are two key industries that require significant development and investment. Consumer spending and retail opportunities emerging from this are another area of potential. There is still scope for the industrial sector if more commercial land is released and the development plans are allowed to prosper. Great potential for growth remains in the industrial sector as labor regulations remain quite flexible in Kuwait. The tax environment is attractive, allowing for competitive manufacturing and industrial activity especially in oil and gas. More investment in infrastructure would be beneficial in healthcare, education, and transport. There is also a major push for housing at present to resolve the populations pent up demand. The government is working on resolving the lack of land supply with the increasing availability of residential and commercial land in effort to allow for more home ownership in the country. International businesses can look into these exciting new prospects in the Kuwaiti market. In addition, according to the UNCTAD's World Investment Report-2015, Kuwait approved new rules permitting foreign banks to open multiple bank branches in the country. According to the report, Kuwait attracted inward FDI flows of $486 million during 2014 resulting in a total inward FDI stock of $15.4 billion by the end of the year. Kuwait has also put in new measures to attract major multinationals to establish fully owned operations in Kuwait with IBM recently being one of the first to actually do so.</p><h4>In the context of Kuwait's growing economy and with major government development plans in place, what role do you see KAMCO playing in Kuwait's future growth?</h4><p>We believe that the government plans will produce a strong trickle down effect to the private sector and will further allow businesses to focus on efficiency and the enhanced delivery of products and services. To kick-start an economic revival, the government approved a new five-year development plan for Kuwait, which envisages spending KD34.15 billion on development projects in the years 2015/2016-2019/2020. The plan is part of Kuwait's long-term vision of becoming a regional trade and financial hub. It includes projects like the construction of a metro system, a railway network and a large number of mega oil projects, along with a new refinery. We expect KAMCO to be heavily involved in the capital market transactions that will result from this, possibly on the advisory, mergers, and acquisitions side. We hope that this increased investment activity will result in more investment banking activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role that CENTRUM Católica has played in transforming business education in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>CENTRUM Católica changed the sector when it was established in 2000. The first business school in Peru, ESAN, was created in 1963. Until 2000, the business education offering was conservative. At the end of 1999, the directorate of the Pontificia Universidad Católica, the leading university in Peru, decided to create a business school. Doors opened on January 1, 2000, in conjunction with the turn of the century. This implied a disruptive change to the industry; double-degree and bilingual programs that involved travelling to Europe. The campus was built in 2000, within six months. We signed agreements with several universities: Tulane University and Boston College in the US, Maastricht School of Management in the Netherlands, and the EADA and the IE Business School in Spain. We modernized this sector, which benefitted Peru, creating in its wake a new generation of business leaders. Today, we have a campus in Lima and programs in nine cities in Peru. We are present in Bogotá, Medellí­n, and Quito. We also offer an online program available worldwide. CENTRUM Católica is the only organization in Latin America offering massive open online courses (MOOCs). Our school is creating the leaders that Peru and the region need. Our influence is region wide. We are the only school holding the Triple Crown in Peru, namely three key accreditations: AACSB international from the US; Equis from EFMD, the European Foundation for Management and Development; and AMBA, the Association of MBAs and DBAs of the UK. This is unusual for a business school. There are seven such institutions in Latin America and 57 throughout the world, from which, less than 1% are Triple Crown. This means that we are peer-reviewed and audited. We are the only institution in Latin America to make it into the Financial Times' list of 100 best executive MBAs. CENTRUM Católica ranks number 52.</p><h4>How did you achieve such high standards so quickly?</h4><p><span></span>We should credit five factors for our rapid success. The first is that we belong to the best university in Peru, which has existed for a century, and we are recognized as part of it. Secondly, all our programs are international. There is no program in which students do not travel abroad as part of their studies, and all programs lead to double diplomas. Thirdly, we have an outstanding faculty. Professors come from different parts of the world, such as India, the US, and Honduras. Fourthly, we have a state-of-the-art campus, and possibly the best to be found in Latin America. Finally is the degree of autonomy that I have at my disposal. I am free of the bureaucracy frequently found in a university system, where decisions must clear the provost, vice rector, and president. We are providing Doctors to Peru and to the region, publishing in the best journals, and moving other universities to do research as well.</p><h4>Does research play an important role in contributing to teaching?</h4><p><span></span>The idea of research is to actualize classroom learning, to bring in new ideas, new models, and new ways of working. Business Administration is a constantly evolving practice. Research keeps training current. For example, we have spent almost 10 years studying leadership. At the beginning of MBA programs, we deliver a questionnaire about leadership, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and personality to the students. The same questionnaire is delivered by the end of the program in order to see to what extent has the MBA changed them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With its two institutes and two universities, what role does Laureate play in the higher education system here in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>We are now one of the biggest educational groups in Peru with 100,000 students enrolled in our institutions, UPC, UPN, CIBERTEC, and ITN. Yet, when you look at the overall higher education market, we make up less than 10% of private enrolment. There are 1.5 million students at the tertiary level nationwide, albeit the private education systems slightly less than a million. We entered the sector in 1983 with CIBERTEC as pioneers in IT training and education in Peru. To this day, we remain one of the most prestigious institutes specializing in technology, although we have successfully introduced programs in the areas of business and design. Technology, so to speak, remains the common denominator. As a group of higher education institutions, we have always pursued a dynamic academic model characterized by innovation. We were the first to offer an undergraduate focused in the music and in the fashion industries (UPC).</p><h4>What innovations are you exploring to integrate technology into the educational experience, particularly at UPC?</h4><p><span></span>At UPC, we are developing a new model; the country's first digital university. We aim to find new ways to deliver higher education. We will strive to become a leading university in the use of technology in the classroom. The delivery of education needs to be more accessible to students with different needs. The higher education industry is evolving, and we believe in being bold in our stance. We are currently in the design and pilot phase of the digital model. We have already started by encouraging our students and faculty to leverage such technology as smartphones and tablets in the learning environment.</p><h4>What role can the private sector play in increasing access to higher education for people of lower income in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>UPN is keen to make higher education more affordable for a large underserved market that has long lacked access to education. This is vital for the future of a developing country like Peru. In this country, participation in higher education remains low. We have come a long way over the past 15 years; only three out of 10 students leaving school today have access to higher education. We need to push for a 50-60% participation rate. There are those who dismiss the key role of private education in society arguing that education should be free and guided by the state. I myself have been engaged in this debate throughout my professional life of over 30 years. Today, when we look at Peru, we find that private education accounts for 70% of enrolment. Had we not secured private investment in the education system over the past 10 years, we would be in a critical situation, lacking the required pool of professionals that Peru's development requires. And so private education has played a major role in providing higher education to more and more people in Peru.</p><h4>Do you think the reform of university regulations to improve low-quality private institutions has been positive for Peruvian education?</h4><p><span></span>The issue of quality is a separate issue from whether a school is a public or private institution. There are good and bad quality institutions in the public and private sectors. The students' best interests have to be at the center of the debate. Both public and private institutions need to manage their financial resources effectively and efficiently in order to invest in better infrastructure and academic quality. I can understand why there has been pressure for new laws and regulations regarding higher education in Peru. When you look at this sector, sure, some bad institutions do not focus on the best interests of their students. This is a very asymmetric sector where the student has a limited ability to decide where and what to study. Effective regulation must be built on setting reasonable, minimum, or baseline standards focused on the outcomes (employability) of institutions rather than just the process (percentage fulltime faculty). My concern is that the regulatory body, SUNEDU, may become highly bureaucratic, led by people with traditional paradigms and set in the ways of the past. Too much regulation is the best way to stifle innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Tecnológico de Monterrey's role been in the education sector in Peru?</h4><p>Tecnológico de Monterrey has been in Peru since 1998, and we came to Peru after having started off in Ecuador in 1996. Our operations in Peru were solely virtual and online until 2003, with our first program being a business degree, and we started with just five students. That number has risen through the years and now we have 90 students. Growth continues apace, which shows that there's a lot of potential in the market here in Peru and demand is very strong. Not all applicants are accepted onto the program, because the requirements are quite high. Whether its our undergraduate or postgraduate courses, certificates, and diplomas, our objective is one and the same; to transform lives. We have many graduates who are in important places in the Peruvian economy today, because people actively seek and want Tecnológico de Monterrey graduates. So I think we're doing things right.</p><h4>Tecnológico de Monterrey seemed to fill a gap in the Peruvian education sector. What was the situation like before Tecnológico de Monterrey's arrival in Peru?</h4><p>Before we came along, there was no international dimension when it came to education, no options for studying abroad; the only options were local programs and degrees. Tecnológico de Monterrey offers courses that are internationally recognized, and to complete one of our postgraduate courses you are required to study abroad, be it in Chile, Costa Rica, the US, or in Europe. So we filled a certain need and demand in the country for an international scope to higher education in Peru. Tecnológico de Monterrey changed the higher education landscape, and since then more foreign schools have come to Peru offering similar programs, universities like Adolfo Ibanez from Chile along with INCAE of Costa Rica. They offer an executive MBA that is direct competition for us. In the last three years, various European and US universities have also arrived, albeit more in a virtual sense. In Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, Tecnológico de Monterrey has positioned itself excellently. In fact, in Colombia and Ecuador, the Tec is seen as the Harvard of Latin America. That's why we came to Peru as well, because of the local potential, and because we're able to leverage our international name and prestige here.</p><h4>Does being a Latin American-based school uniquely position Tecnológico de Monterrey when compared to North American and European institutions?</h4><p>Yes. On the one hand, we have all the accreditations for Tecnológico de Monterrey EGADE Business School, all of which are recognized in North and Latin America and Europe. On the other hand, we have partnerships with some of the world's top universities, so if you wanted to do a Master's in China or Europe or the US, you could do it through us. This international dimension is what puts Tecnológico de Monterrey at the top of most Latin American university rankings. Every student already has a certain number of foreign exchanges during the course of their undergraduate studies at Tec. We have, for example, a one-week study trip to the US, and also one to Mexico City. But apart from that, students can also take optional summer courses during Global Network Week, with 500 universities to choose from, and they can take specialized courses in any one of those universities all over the world. An international dimension is very important, especially when it comes to business. Most of our alumni and postgraduate students work in multinational or “multilatina" companies. Therefore, it's important to adopt a global perspective and the have ability to work and live anywhere in the world. This is also true for our academic staff. Our staff is required to at least hold a PhD to give classes, but we also require them to have experience from the business world. Indeed, many have been business consultants or directors at various levels.</p><h4>How important is Peru for Tecnológico de Monterrey?</h4><p>Our EGADE Business School is second in Mexico in terms of number of students. To give you some context, the Tecnológico de Monterrey has 26 campuses in Mexico, as well as campuses in Panama, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, as well as partnerships with universities in Asia, Europe, and North America. EGADE only has campuses in Mexico, Peru, and Panama. So there are just six EGADEs in the whole of Latin America. Right now we have 175 active students in Peru, and the level of our students is very high, since we have a very rigorous admittance procedure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[taking-the-initiative]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the university's main achievements since its foundation in 1962?</h4><p><span></span>This university is an academic, independent, non-profit institution, comprising teachers, students, and graduates and managed by a civil association, which is a private legal entity. We develop professionals to reputable standards. Our origins date back to the 1960s, being founded as a result of the industrial sector taking the initiative to develop alternative academic options to those of the time. Public universities had been highly politicized up until that point, and the decision to create the university was made in the 1962 by a group of university professors along with important commerce and industry representatives. This has given our institution an entrepreneurial character from its first day, and we should highlight the leading role of our first rector, Antonio Pinilla Sanchez-Concha, whose vision was essential to the character of the university today. Along with the Universidad del Pací­fico, Universidad Cayetano Heredia, and Universidad Católica, we are part of a consortium of the top four private universities in Peru. When these institutions came into being they represented a new vision of the country, one which was more pragmatic, forward-looking, coherent, and transparent. Fortunately, Peru has taken these values into its overall political and economic development, and these four universities have become key elements of the country's growth. They have set the standards by which the nation governs itself.</p><h4>What programs does the university currently offer?</h4><p><span></span>We offer 11 Bachelor's degree programs and we are looking into increasing this by offering both civil engineering and industrial design. The most demanded courses at our university are industrial engineering and communications. Engineering is one program that we are particularly proud of, and many engineers building the new generation of national infrastructure have been trained here. We are also the oldest university offering communications studies in Peru. As with industrial engineering, we have been the most innovative university in this area, and have become the most reputable higher education institution for this course. We offer a curriculum that is focused on business, and our work has helped Peru to develop the extremely strong independent print and broadcast media that it has today. Our curriculum has evolved to deal the demands of new media, which is mediated by the internet, and we are investing heavily in new equipment and new real estate to house our programs. Overall, we have become a leading university thanks to the fact that we respect freedom of opinion and strive to uphold a high standard of media.</p><h4>How has the university incorporated technology into its curriculum?</h4><p><span></span>New technologies change rapidly, and therefore it is a key element in our strategy and in our courses. We invest a lot in new technologies, especially in courses such as communication studies, which is one of our main fields. We have invested in equipment and facilities, with a cinema room, TV studios, and editing areas, among other amenities. We invested $5.8 million in new technologies in the 2013 and 2014 academic years. We also have plans to develop a digital production center as part of a Master's degree program in creation and management of content.</p><h4>What kind of infrastructure plans does the university have for the future?</h4><p><span></span>We have finally got the green light to build two new towers in our campus. We have plans to expand facilities, and we have land on the current campus designated for this. We also have plans to build a dormitory in order to host the many international students who come here every year. This project is a key undertaking for us in terms of sustained growing for the future and offers other advantages to our students and professors. We have a 10-year plan to develop new facilities such as this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does SENATI play in technical and vocational education in Peru?</h4><p>SENATI was founded under an initiative from the National Society of Industries. At that time, the National Society of Industries analyzed the national economic situation and drew attention to the lack of adequate technicians for the industry. It submitted a bill to congress to help the industrAy be part of the training in new technicians. The goal of SENATI is to train technicians for employment. It adopted the German dual system, in which the student is better prepared by undertaking work experience. Because of this, SENATI has been able to establish 82 educational centers in Peru, develop 64 three year professional technical training careers, and serve around 75,000 students a year. We also have 450,000 worker enrolments in short-term training programs of one or two months. The secret to our success has been the participation of the private sector in the education process.</p><h4><span></span>What does SENATI do to maintain strong links with the private sector?</h4><p><span></span>The structure of leadership in SENATI is composed of people in the industry. For example, currently we have 14 zone managements at the domestic level. We are located in different areas of the country, such as Arequipa, Chiclayo, and the jungle regions. They have boards of directors that are composed of industry members who are nominated by business chambers. These businessmen provide data to SENATI on their needs in the educational arena, because they are in the market and are best positioned to know it. We use this feedback from the businessmen to create our own academic programs for various courses. Besides the participation of the business community, we have consulting boards for different specialties that are also composed of businessmen, who consult on the selection and design of the programas we are set to teach. Among all our graduates, around 12,000 to 13,000 students a year, that is 90%, are immediately employed. The other 10% usually set up their own companies, or will pursue alternative options. We also conduct industry surveys to assess the degree of satisfaction of our students. Through this, we have learned that there is 95% satisfaction of our graduate's overall performance.</p><h4>What is the importance of international links for SENATI, and what kind of international programs are you developing?</h4><p><span></span>I recently made a trip to Germany to promote links with different universities there. We are establishing links with those German institutions operating the dual system. I also contacted German companies that have the dual system as well. Universities like Mannheim and companies like Bosch, Festo, Mercedes Benz, BMW, and others have the purpose of creating student and faculty exchanges as well as work internships. Independently of those international contacts, we have direct contact with companies such as Komatsu-Mitsui, which has donated $1 million to SENATI to instruct 105 students in the area of heavy machinery. We have also established contacts with other international companies keen to prepare technicians for their domestic operations. In the mining sector, we also have agreements with various companies for heavy machinery maintenance.</p><h4>Why is having international links important for technical education?</h4><p><span></span>It is important because it updates the field of technology, which is constantly changing. SENATI wants to be the leader of this technological education in Peru precisely by being linked to the international market and education. Generally we have constant contact with all the technical agencies of countries, like GIZ form Germany, French cooperation, JICA from Japan, the Spanish agencies, and also the Brazilian Agencies. We realize constant exchanges to improve our technology in Peru. Annually, an average of 30 foreign experts comes to SENATI to work with our teachers and students.</p><h4>What are your goals for SENATI?</h4><p><span></span>In the short term, we want to consolidate the investments we have made in infrastructure and equipment. In addition, we want to provide facilities for our students. Most of them come from public schools, and we want them to become first class students and to have all the facilities at their disposal that any other university would provide. On the other hand, we want to boost our Escuela Superior de Tecnologí­a where we aim to position our best students in the development of new technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru committed itself to increase public expenditure in education, from 3% to 6% of GDP. How will this enable opportunities for future generations?</h4><p><span></span>The Peruvian government took the decision to increase its budget by Soles 4 billion for the education sector by 2015. With this, the education budget now amounts to 3.5% of GDP. This increase is significant but still insufficient. By the year 2021, the year in which we will commemorate the bicentenary of the independence of Peru, spending per student must increase significantly. International evidence shows that there is a positive relationship between higher spending per pupil and performance in learning tests. This relationship occurs in an investment of up to $5,000 per student per year, after which there is no clear relationship. In our country we invest around $1,000 a year in each student. </p><h4>What are the main guidelines of the education reform Peru currently implements?</h4><p><span></span>The education reform is composed of four lines of action: 1) Evaluation of the teaching profession; 2) Improvement of the quality of learning for all; 3) Modernization of educational management; and 4) Closing the gap in educational infrastructure. We are building the teaching profession based on meritocracy, mechanisms of attraction, selection, and promotion and career development. The aim is to double teachers' salaries by 2021, linked to performance. In early childhood, we have expanded the coverage and we have developed new educational materials according to the needs of children. In primary education, we are working on a comprehensive intervention that (i) distributes sample lesson plans for teachers to guide and facilitate their work, (ii) accompany the teachers with more experienced teachers, (iii) provides tutoring for students with learning difficulties (iv) carries out close work with families. Also, in secondary education we are implementing a new pedagogical model with more hours of study and greater assistance from tutors, psychologists, social workers, better infrastructure, job training, English, and the use of information technology for learning. Weekly teaching hours will expand from 35 hours to 45 hours. These interventions are already underway in a large group of schools; but the challenge is to universalize them. The director is the leader who manages the school as a safe and inclusive space. Therefore, 15,000 principals and assistant principals have been selected based on their capabilities. They are receiving training in management and will be better able to decide on resources and staff. All students, teachers and principals should have ideal environments for learning. In the last three years we have invested nearly Soles 10 billion, an all time record, for the construction or strengthening of more than three thousand school buildings. The challenge is immense; the gap in educational infrastructure totals Soles 60 billion (more than 10% of GDP).  As far as the higher education segment goes, recently, we created the National Superintendency of Higher Education (SUNEDU) that allows us to verify compliance with basic standards of quality in all universities. Also, we are encouraging advance accreditation of universities to adopt processes to constantly improve quality and academic excellence. We are about to launch the observatory "Put yourself in the Race" which will provide information to help young people to make better decisions about where and what to study. As part of these reforms, we are also making some preliminary changes in technical education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru's healthcare sector has been underserved for many years. Clinica Delgado, your most recent project, is unique as it includes funding from several investors. What does Group Auna represent for the sector in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>At Auna, there are more than 2,000 people who are really inspired and committed to work in a different way to make our vision a reality and transform the healthcare experience in Peru. We are proud to have Delgado Clinic as our flagship, not only because it is our most important project, but also because it represents the essence of thought and philosophy of our founders and shareholders who aspire to deliver higher quality healthcare services to Peruvian citizens. This means offering Peruvians the highest possible level of patient security, integrated processes, medical technology, and professionalism of medical doctors and clinical staff, and all of this in a world-class healthcare facility. These offerings exceed the standards we have seen in the country until now. For us, Delgado Clinic is a tipping point in the evolution of private healthcare services in Peru and it should stimulate competition and that is very good for Peruvian families. We have noticed that this is already happening, and some of our competitors have already invested in improving their facilities and are now claim to offer better services. We believe we have started a chain reaction in healthcare here in Peru. This in turn is leading to a transformation in relationships between hospitals and medical doctors, the interactions between insurance companies and healthcare providers, and the way in which the general population is being introduced to medical services.</p><h4><span></span>Group Auna has a very successful oncology program, Oncosalud. What impact has that business had on the sector in Peru since it started and the quality of cancer care available?</h4><p><span></span>Oncosalud has 720,000 members in its pre-paid cancer program. We are the largest provider in the prepaid cancer service sector. This scale allows us to invest in scientific research, prevention centers, and clinics specializing in cancer treatment, as well as being a center to attract the best doctors and nurses in the country. Over these last 25 years, Oncosalud has developed vast expertise in cancer protection, not just in terms of financial security, but also in medical coverage. We offer our affiliates early prevention programs and opportune treatment. We can proudly say that two out of three patients at Oncosalud go into remission or are cured after five years. Over time, Oncosalud has set the benchmarks for quality and level of cancer prevention and private treatment in the country. We remain the market leader in cancer protection. Our strategy is to expand our coverage and services in the provinces, where there is still much work to be done.</p><h4>Only around 30% of the country's population lives in Lima. What are your plans to expand outside the capital?</h4><p><span></span>Auna's challenge is to develop an offer providing value healthcare to as many people as possible. Certainly some provincial cities are growing rapidly, driven by mining, agriculture, retail, and tourism. We are convinced this is an opportunity so we have developed clinics in Piura, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Arequipa, and Callao. We are evaluating several, but I can say that there are cities near Lima that are demanding our services. These are areas that have seen impressive growth, and where people from around the country have been migrating for generations to find work in Lima's rapidly growing service industry. These new facilities will be modern but different from Clinica Delgado, where we offer a one-stop shopping experience. These other clinics will meet a demand for primary outpatient services. Our facilities network will focus on the mainstream sector, while internationally accredited Clinica Delgado targets a different high income and international patient sector. However, Auna intends to have province facilities services such as radiology, linked and informed centrally from Clinica Delgado in Lima. This telemedicine will help to provide second opinions and maximize the use of our professional resources. This integration comes also via the shared Electronic Medical Record, another first in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much progress has Peru made in achieving its goal of reaching universal healthcare coverage?</h4><p>We expect to achieve universal coverage in 2021. Right now we are seeing an increase in insurance coverage. The biggest advance so far is that every child born without any other insurance will be affiliated with the SIS, which is the government insurance program that covers low-income children up to five years old. </p><h4>What are the main challenges that the country is facing in order to reach universal coverage?</h4><p><span></span>First, we must increase the insurance affiliation. It is important to modify the law that created the SIS. The SIS was created to help poor people, but we have to broaden the target population to reach other vulnerable populations. Nowadays, the SIS helps more than 15 million affiliates. We have to make the SIS available to the most vulnerable people; that is the main challenge.  The reality is that better, universal healthcare provides net benefits on a national level. </p><h4>What role do you see for private insurance in Peru's health insurance mix?</h4><p><span></span>People will have the opportunity to choose. As the economic formality rate increases, the amount of people with access to insurance will grow. That path depends on the country's economy, but it should not restrict insurance access. As long as there are people with informal jobs, public insurance will be needed. We want to promote and support private insurance. The important matter is that citizens have the opportunity to choose, depending on their conditions. The private sector still has many advantages, but the gap between the public and private systems is shrinking. </p><h4>What efforts is the government making to improve healthcare infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>Instead of constructing more hospitals, we have tried to upgrade then to improve the quality of service. One of the first things we tried to do was improve the personnel and the equipment quality. We want to specialize at the regional hospitals, and create intermediate facilities. The Ministry wants to transform the health posts into health centers, which will improve the operative capacity. We estimate that the construction of 11 new national hospitals, 23 regional and 170 provincial ones will require an investment of more than $3 billion. We want to make more specialized centers because high complexity hospitals are already overcrowded with ordinary emergencies that could be handled elsewhere. Peru also lacks specialists. We are now working on a system that allows specialists to work more hours, or in other locations. Our system also includes a team of 15-20 specialists that visit hard to access locations every 15 days, where they undertake complex procedures. If we do not have the ability to solve a problem, the SIS will find a solution in the private system. It is very difficult to construct and offer services in the most remote areas, so we have developed alternate solutions. One of our strategies is to invest in transport infrastructure.  We are working with the Ministry of Defense and Interior to develop a system of air transport to extract critical cases from the least accessible areas in the case of an emergency.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the future?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry wants to improve the quality of our services across the board. We have created the National Superintendence of Health, which will supervise the quality of the services, and protect the rights of the citizens. People were not protected before, and their only means of defending themselves was through the courts. Now, complaints are also handled by the superintendence, which has personal dedicated to attend those demands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[no-beans-about-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Peru fit into the global cacao industry?</h4><p><span></span>The country, alongside Ecuador, is the only growth markets for cacao production in the world due to the CCN 51 clonal material available for planting and ideal growing conditions. As a sector, cacao is facing a structural deficit.  This deficit has been a long time in the making and is not easily solvable given the long lead-time to production for the cacao tree. The only areas of growth in cacao production are in Latin America; specifically, in Ecuador and Peru, and that is in large part due to optimal soil, sufficient and evenly-dispersed rainfall with no dry season and our genetic material. The availability of deforested land and a zero export tax policy also benefits us.</p><h4>Why is Latin America not currently the leader in cacao production?</h4><p><span></span>Brazil is the world's 4th largest producer of cacao (however internal demand has exceeded their internal production recently) and Ecuador is the 6th largest globally. Peru is the world's 9th largest player. So collectively the Latin origin markets are already meaningful producers. Within the next five years however, we expect Ecuador to overtake Nigeria, Brazil and Indonesia and become the world's 3rd largest producer.  Peru is a lower cost cacao producer than Ecuador but the industry is younger here and doesn't have the government's backing and support like in Ecuador.</p><h4>What is the current status of the project?</h4><p><span></span>We expect to have 2,000 hectares planted by the end of the year making United Cacao Limited SEZC the largest cacao plantation in the country. We currently own over 3,500 hectares and employ over 500 people on-site, making us the largest cacao plantation in Peru and in the Americas. When we reach our goal of 3,250 hectares we expect to be the largest cacao plantation in the world.</p><h4>Is this move from a smallholding model to a large plantation model something that will transform the cacao industry?</h4><p><span></span>Large-scale cacao cultivation on estates is more efficient and results in higher productivity making a smaller environmental footprint. Many tropical crops are cultivated on large estates such as palm oil, rubber, banana and sugar so cacao is really the outlier. 99% of the cacao industry is small farmer and they are not able to meet the growing demand worldwide so there is a clear market role for larger estates such as United Cacao's.</p><h4>What do you say to criticism that you should be supporting small farmers rather than establishing larger plantations?</h4><p><span></span>It is important to do both as the small farmers benefit from the skill-set, resources and experience of a larger corporate estate. Supporting small farmers, through our PAPEC program, is the right thing to do and will double the revenues of United Cacao over time. Part of our role to encourage the development of the cacao sector in the country is to not only develop the corporate plantation, but also stimulate small farmer planting of cacao.  To achieve this goal, we have recently announced the launch of a small farmer program for the nearby communities called PAPEC (Programa Alianza de de Produccion Estratégica de Cacao). It is a microfinance program in which we will offer credits to small farmers in the form of seedlings, materials, fertilization and proper training. The farmers then sell the wet cacao beans to the company, which, in turn, will process the beans. This program is set up to help hundreds of people in the poorest areas of Perú get out of poverty once and for all through a sustainable, environmentally-friendly development of their own land.</p><h4>Where do you expect to see the future of United Cacao in 10 years' time?</h4><p><span></span>In 10 years, the project will be fully planted and yielding the crop volume that we have projected to the market. We also see a vibrant small farmer program that will contribute to overall production volume.  We recently announced the goal to expand the PAPEC program to up to 3,250 hectares of small farmer land which will double the production volume in the region.</p><h4>What makes Peru a solid destination for investment?</h4><p><span></span>Thanks to its recent history of stability, freehold land titles, and its favorable demographic trends, the country is an attractive place in which to do business. When you consider the age profile of the workforce and the steady track record of sensible macroeconomic policies that the Central Bank has followed, the outlook for the country is extremely positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company grown in Latin America, and what are some important ongoing projects?</h4><p><span></span>We initiated our activities in Mexico and Panama 15 years ago, and since then our company has had continuous growth in this area. Recently we extended our presence into South America, specifically in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil.  Getting established is a slow process that requires adaptation to the laws of each country and the setting up of your operational framework. The main work at the beginning has to do with commercial activities and liaison with private sector companies. In parallel, we also establish relations with the public sector, which we often first work with in a market. Given our structure, the public tender process is more suitable for an international company. In this context, we hired a local workforce, and have trained them according to the culture of FCC Construction. Luckily, we have had a successful adventure so far in Peru, having developed several projects. For example, in Trujillo we recently finished a project involving the upgrade and improvement of a sports complex, and we are currently working on the expansion of the Northern port of Callao. This project has a budget of $165 million and is 50% completed. One of the competitive advantages of our company when entering new markets is that we do so with a local partner for a better understanding of the market. This puts us in a better position to access key projects for Peru in the future, such as the Lima Metro. For this project, we formed a consortium of companies to be in a position to provide more comprehensive solutions and submit competitive bids. FCC has the power to attract some of the best professionals across a diversity of fields. Also, we have a certain degree of experience in Peru, which was a factor when bidding. We were awarded the metro project, and are now in the process of finishing the design and commencing the construction phase. </p><h4>What are the main challenges regarding the construction of the Lima underground project?</h4><p><span></span>The challenge has to do with the implementation of new construction technologies and processes. The training we provided to our workforce and that we will provide in the near future is a key elements of project success. Cooperation between all companies that submitted the bid is vital, too. This project involves a concession contract, where financing, construction, and maintenance are all included. </p><h4>How would you assess the business environment for foreign investors in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>The Peruvian market has been opened to foreign investors over the past few years. The country has a clear vision of the need to attract foreign investment to boost economic and social development. Companies like ours see Peru as an attractive market, and we feel welcome to be a part of its development. The regulatory framework is well established, and we are treated as any other local company. </p><h4>How will the new transport infrastructure project impact national development?</h4><p><span></span>Lima needed an underground transport system to ease traffic congestion, and our 35-kilometer underground line will improve transport mobility issues in Lima, a city of close to 10 million inhabitants. The underground also has a huge positive impact on the environment. I believe that Lima is at the right moment to develop such large-scale projects. As Peru grows the country is positively implementing key transport infrastructure projects that will leverage its potential and growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Ministry played in the development of the agricultural sector over recent years?</h4><p>The agricultural sector has become one of the less volatile economic sectors, growing at an average of 4% annually over the past few years. The non-traditional agricultural exports, as well as the poultry industry are two of the most dynamic segments within the sector. The private sector has played an important role in the development of the agricultural sector over the past decade, and the Ministry of Agriculture focused its activities on being a promoter. We introduced the Law on Agricultural Promotion to make exports and labor regulations more flexible, and in doing so, boosted development of the agricultural sector in different regions of the country. This also meant investments in irrigation and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). The Ministry has also invested significantly in health and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)—our goal has been to eradicate several diseases affecting livestock and fruits. In this context, the coffee segment has been one of our priorities, and coffee exports currently total $1 billion. We also have increased investment to boost small and medium-sized producers' activities and help them with irrigation issues.</p><h4>What are some of the other near future priorities for the ministry?</h4><p><span></span>The ministry provides technical support to small and medium-sized producers, as well as support in terms of cooperation such that small producers can combine efforts to make their activities more profitable. We have as a main focus the promotion and development of alpaca, a type of meat the world has yet to fully discover. We also have plans to reforest some areas of the country for different purposes—wood production and simple reforestation of affected areas. All in all, our priorities and investment target infrastructure, credit lines, disease eradication, and the simplification of administrative and bureaucratic processes. In addition, boosting exports is one of our top priorities, and we closely work with the Ministry of Foreign Trade.</p><h4>What are some of the highlights of the Ministry's activities regarding the protection of the environment?</h4><p><span></span>The country is in the process of adapting itself to climate change, especially in the agricultural industry, and we are investing heavily in related activities and policies. We are investing in large water reservoirs, especially at river headwaters. We also attend to vulnerable communities in the mountains who are affected by extreme weather conditions. Reforestations and agroforestry processes are another aspect of this drive, especially for coffee plantations; but this also includes rice plantations along the coast, and promoting a change in cultivation and irrigation to foster greater efficiency.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the ban on transgenic products?</h4><p><span></span>We are keeping a close eye on transgenic products and evaluating their implications the country. At this time, they do not seem to be something that would affect the country in terms of export volumes, because we have a wide variety of export products and show great potential for growth in the near future. We have several specific projects based on these products that have great potential, and development will boost R&amp;D and generate added value. This research is also aimed at reducing the usage of pesticides, and related costs. We have done a great job already with plantations of asparagus, for example, where the usage of high technologies has enabled us to reduce pesticides, optimize production, and become a world leader in this segment.</p><h4>Where do you see the Peruvian agricultural industry in five years time?</h4><p><span></span>Agriculture, including forestry, is set to become the second most dynamic sector of the economy after mining. We will continue improving as long as we are introducing modern agricultural techniques. Our strategy is to boost cooperation between small and medium-sized producers, and link them to exporting companies.  We have a wide range of products and activities, which puts us in a highly favorable position to target foreign markets. We have great agricultural potential, and businesses here enjoy a stable economic and political community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What kind of impact has the new leasing and property law had on the country?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>It is not just a leasing law, but also one that encompasses renting, selling, and the financial leasing of properties. The aim of the law is to add depth to the leasing market in Peru. For a country of Peru's level of development, leasing and renting should account for approximately 20% of total savings. In Peru, the leasing market is somewhat distorted. Until this new leasing law came into effect, a tenant had certain rights that could actually override the rights of the landlord. So, for example, even if a tenant failed to pay rent over an extended period, the owner still could not have them evicted. Now with the new leasing law, the landlord has a right to evict tenants that are in arrears. This law also adds dynamism to the construction sector and enables a larger part of the population to have access to good, dignified housing. Furthermore, there is a large informal economy in Peru, and this new law will help address it. By far the largest source of income for lower and lower middle class people in Peru is in the informal economy, be it working as taxi drivers or street vendors. These people earn money, however little, but they are off the grid as far as banks are concerned. They have no access to credit, and certainly no access to mortgages or housing credit. The new law enables these people to start by renting with monthly payments, which can then lead to buying once they have a credit history for the banks, or in more complex processes, a certain quota is put aside from each month's rent, which then goes into a fund that can be used to buy the property one is renting at a future date.
</p><h4>The demand for housing has exceeded the amount of housing available in Peru. What is the government doing to address this situation?</h4><p>
	<span></span>Firstly, the sector has developed new and innovative mechanisms to provide more people with easier access to financial instruments, with the poorest urban segments and rural areas receiving considerable subsidies when it comes to acquiring housing. In fact, subsidies are virtually 100% in rural areas, and 80% in the poorest urban areas. For example, in the Fondo MIVIVIENDA, we have two types of subsidies: the first is “Techo Proprio." In this case, if the house is worth up to $25,000, the state gives a bond worth PEN 18,000-19,000, which is about $6,000. This bond is basically a subsidy, which the buyer does not have to repay. If they opt for a cheaper home, this bond could be a much higher percentage of the price. For a house right at the limit, the bond is a smaller percentage of the price. The other type of subsidy is for those who can make slightly bigger investments, people from the lower middle class. These people are eligible for the “Nuevo Credito MIVIVIENDA," by which families have access to easier and cheaper lines of credit than they would normally. This type of credit also includes an important subsidy, and is designed for houses priced between $25,000 and $50,000. If the house is cheap, the bond is more expensive, at around $6,000. However, if the house is more expensive, the bond is smaller, at $4,000.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the initial motivation for founding inPERíš, and how would you characterize the organization's progress so far in “exporting Peru to the world"?</h4><p><span></span>The initial motivation was and still is to promote investment in our country. It is common knowledge that the fastest growing economies in the world have achieved such results due to years of significant investments—investments that have represented more than 25% of their GDP each year. inPERíš has reached more than 6,000 investors with eight roadshows around the globe thus far and has visited almost 20 of the most important cities in the world.</p><h4>The recent decline in mineral prices has led to a slowdown in the Peruvian economy. Has this led to a decline in international interest in Peru as an attractive investment destination?</h4><p><span></span>The decline of mineral prices has affected our economy, and the mining industry in particular as it has seen a decrease in investments. Fortunately, our economy is not solely dependent on mining: it only constitutes one-third of our total exports and of these exports, 50% are mining products. Our mineral exports are diversified which provides a natural advantage in varying environments. We are ranked among the world's top five as an exporter of minerals such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, and lead. In the context of the global economy, we are still an attractive market to investors. </p><h4>In 2015, inPERíš's Road Show is focused on Asia (particularly China, Japan, and Korea). Why did inPERíš choose Asia for this year and what is the importance of these markets for the Peruvian economy?</h4><p><span></span>Our business model operates on the belief that we need to return to the regions we visit every one to two years. We were last in Asia two years ago, so now is a perfect time to revisit. Asia remains the fastest growing region, as countries like China have been very aggressive in acquiring companies around the world as part of its  strategy to ensure enough resources for its growing population. Peru's largest mining, fishing and oil and gas companies are Chinese.</p><h4>Which sectors of the Peruvian economy have attracted the most interest from international investors at recent inPERíš events?</h4><p><span></span>inPERíš's approach is inclusive, meaning we present every possible business opportunity in our country without an emphasis on a specific industry. It is hard to deny that our lack of infrastructure is the most attractive opportunity for investors. Asia has a special interest because they have built everything over the last decade and now need to find new places to invest.</p><h4>What makes Peru a good destination for international investors?</h4><p><span></span>We present many attractive conditions for investors because our economy continues to grow, we have sound fiscal and monetary policies and constitutionally-protected investments. We are conveniently located and rich in natural resources. We also have a young population, and our middle class is expanding.</p><h4>What are your goals for inPERíš over the next year?</h4><p><span></span>We need to keep revisiting the most important cities in the world while bringing large delegations comprised of both private and public representatives. We also need to ensure our association grows so that we can guarantee the necessary resources to remain sustainable over time, which will allow us to assist governments in the future, despite their political or economic status.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Grupo Digamma's main areas of activity?</h4><p><span></span>We have a 10-year history behind us starting with our magazine Rumbo Minero, which is now the leading publication in the Latin American mining industry. It comes out every 45 days and is over 400 pages in length. We also stage targeted events within the mining industry to boost networking and cooperation. For example, we have a boutique membership event to bring the mining companies and suppliers closer together. We also launched Expomina, the largest mining fair in the country with over 1,000 stands and more than 18 participating countries. Meanwhile, we have moved into the construction sector, having launched the magazine Perú Construye, and are set to organize Expo Arcon, the most complete construction business event in the country. In addition, we issue newsletters, hold promotions, and operate web pages and social media related to our mining activities. For example, we have two television shows for entrepreneurs—Rumbo Minero and Perú Construye that are aired on one of the main TV channel in Peru. These shows have enabled us to offer the entire package of editorial, broadcast, and advertisement services to our clients in these two sectors.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Grupo Digamma?</h4><p><span></span>Today, we have around 1,500 clients and are the main business tool, on which they rely. This is because there is no other company in the country, and probably in the region, offering a complete editorial and broadcasting packaging with such a high level of specialization that addresses whatever the client wants to achieve.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about Expo Arcon?</h4><p><span></span>This is an event that will be held for the third time in early July 2015 from 9 to 11, and will develop simultaneously three fairs. We have leading entrepreneurs and businesspeople on our advisory board, including former ministers and current presidents of the sector associations in the country. We also have our working committee, which includes the main presidents of national and international chambers of commerce and construction. The event will include a section for heavy machinery, consultancy firms, and developers. Over 10 countries are taking part in the event. We will also be organizing the International Infrastructure Forum, the International Technology Forum, the International Real Estate &amp; Construction Forum, the International Architecture Forum, the International Construction Projects Forum, and the International Purchase Management Forum. Moreover, we will be organizing a series of national awards for the most important infrastructure and construction projects. We also have strategic partnerships with the main professional associations in Peru.</p><h4>What is your medium term outlook for the industry?</h4><p><span></span>I think Peru will grow at a faster pace in 2015; we have 10 key mining projects underway and the government is committed to significant infrastructure investment. I believe that the economic slowdown of 2014 has been due to the fall in foreign investment and certain inactivity on the part of the authorities. This has now changed and we foresee a positive 2015, all ahead of the presidential elections in 2016. In this context, if the mining and construction sectors grow, we also grow as a company because these are the two main sectors for us. We decided to focus our business activities on them because we knew they underpinned the future of Peru. In 2014 we sent the message to our clients that in times of crisis it was important to diversify your portfolio, and we focused our events on that goal. It proved to be a great success, and we became a useful tool for clients in a time of crisis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated SAS to expand its presence in the Peruvian market?</h4><p><span></span>Currently, Peru is an attractive market to do business. We are also very comfortable operating in the national IT sector, which is a growing steadily. The industries of telecommunications, banking, insurance, mining, IT, and manufacturing are very important and in SAS we know that business analytics can make a difference in every one of them. Peru, in cooperation with the rest of the countries in the region, has a lot of potential, due to its stable economy; therefore, it is an excellent market to invest.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Peruvian market for SAS?</h4><p><span></span>Latin America is an important market for us. And while SAS has offices in many of the countries in the region, Peru will become an important place to invest in over the coming years. Our idea is growth in the next 10 years, and to position ourselves in the market. This is the reason why SAS establishes an office in Peru.</p><h4>How can business analytics change the way Peruvian companies do business?</h4><p><span></span>Business analytics change the way that people make decisions. It covers the way individuals and firms analyze and distribute data. In this way, they can make the right decision in real time or near real-time. Based on that recommendation, companies adopt business analytic strategies that help them generate information based on the data and allow them to be more efficient in the market. Doing so differentiates companies from their competitors. These advances work brilliantly in telecom, mining, retail, and banking. For example, in the retail sector, we have solutions oriented to price optimization. The idea is to define the best price and best margin for the product. This means that the market contribution for the company is better and increases. Firms can increase the margin when you implement these kinds of solutions. They can generate the best price for their final customer. In the Marketing area we have solutions that we allow marketers to design and execute contextual customer interactions based on insights gleaned from big data and analytics. Measure and optimize the customer experience in both the digital and physical worlds. And link customer-driven strategies to your business goals. Our Customer Intelligence solutions solve the most critical challenges that modern marketers face. In the banking sector, there are different solutions related to risk, fraud, and anti-money laundering. We can provide them  solutions to increase real time fraud detection and decrease risk exposure.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of technology integration in businesses in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>We have excellent technology and integration here; however, the level of data analytics is not appropriate for a market of this size. For example, in the financial sector, banks have massive quantities of data and technology; however, they lack a high level of analysis. We have an opportunity to provide them with more information, and assist them in making better decisions. For the average company, 80% of the data is not used, and this is a huge loss. The analysis would decide which parts of the data are important and unimportant, and which data can be used to make a better decision. There are cases where the company tries to analyze all the data and make a decision with all of it, which is impossible. Part of our solution is to take the information and separate it into categories that are important to make decisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What actions have been implemented to spread the culture of research and innovation among society?</h4><p><span></span>The current government has put a special emphasis on the promotion of science, technology and innovation (STI), not only by increasing funding for existing funds, but also through the implementation of new funds for research and development, STI and innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. In all, the resources allocated to these funds add up to over $360 million, and several public entities are involved in their implementation and execution. Also, in a complementary effort, the government has also focused on strengthening human capital through scholarship programs for higher education and technical training.</p><h4>What role does innovation and science play in the country's growth strategy?</h4><p><span></span>In July 2014, the National Plan for Productive Diversification was approved. This plan aims to create new engines for sustainable economic growth, leading to productive diversification and sophistication and an increase in productivity. Innovation is a key element of the plan, which recognizes that without innovation it is not possible to diversify and grow. This is a lesson learned from the experience of more developed countries, where innovation explains much of their medium-term sustainable growth.</p><h4>How have research and innovation funds evolved over time?</h4><p><span></span>The Innovation for Competitiveness Project (FINCyT) was established in 2007 through a loan agreement between the government of Peru and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Overall, $36 million was allocated to the fund, with $25 million coming from IADB and $11 million from the state. That was the first step we took in Peru to finance STI activities. In 2009, the government established the Fund of Research and Development for Competitiveness (FIDECOM) with almost $70 million to finance innovation projects for SMEs. In 2012, FINCyT was increased from $36 million to $100 million ($35 million from IADB and $65 million from the government), including funding lines for innovation and innovative entrepreneurship. In all, today there is funding available from the Peruvian government for up to $360 million for science, technology, and innovation funding lines, of which $151 million is assigned to innovation funds.</p><h4>Could you talk us through some of the successful projects supported by the innovation program in recent years?</h4><p><span></span>In terms of commercial success, an outstanding case is that of an agro industrial company in Piura which adopted several technologies from abroad and made their grape production much more efficient and able to yield at seasons in which the product is not available from regular providers. The company had commercial success as a result of this, and paid taxes worth up to 12 times the amount invested by the public fund. It was estimated that in the period 2013-17 this project will have contributed almost $50 million to the country's GDP. There was also a successful project related to seaweed in Arequipa where a new farming area was developed. The company extracts algae for commercial purposes, creating a product which is high in protein and exported to Chile. There is also a poultry project with a company called San Fernando and the Cayetano Heredia University in which they utilize waste to produce fertilizer and organic antibiotics.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the future?</h4><p><span></span>We are working toward identifying which sectors of the Peruvian economy have the greatest potential for growth or could be considered potential economic drivers, and which can lead our country to sustainable economic growth. This will allow the government to focus on and align innovation efforts from different actors, both private and public. In this way, these sectors should become the engines that will lead the Peruvian economy to growth in the medium-term. Results of our current innovation funds show that for every dollar invested in an innovation project, there is a return of $7 through the generation of employment or taxes. For the next five years FINCyT has a budget of $151 million, with $114 million for innovation and $24 million for entrepreneurship, and a further $13 million for complementary services, such as quality infrastructure and technology diffusion. The success of the program, and the contribution of innovation to achieving sustainable economic growth in the medium term, has to be ensured through appropriate funding, calls for projects, and dissemination nationwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the company founded and how has it grown to date?</h4><p>Tismart started eight years ago when I was working at another company in the systems area. I had a startup idea and started to build the company. Tismart began serving three large enterprises; those formed the first target. After that Tismart started looking for additional customers, and we decided to start a portfolio. In the third year of Tismart, more clients established a relationship with the company. By the end of the third year, we had 15 clients, and by the fifth year our portfolio had grown to 50 clients. From the fifth year, we saw that there were major opportunities and started planning to expand beyond our country and open an office in Bolivia. When we started there, we went directly into the financial network. Our clients were banks that were requesting mobile apps and web applications to manage their system and for the users to manage their accounts. In Bolivia, we currently have 32 clients and 60 people working there. After Bolivia, we started operations in Panama with a commercial office to sell the product we develop here in Peru and in Bolivia. We entered Bolivia in 2013, and in 2015 we entered Panama. We have already set up a company in the US and are opening a commercial office there, too. </p><h4><span></span>What is the formula for a good app? </h4><p><span></span>The user experience area is formed of a team of designers and illustrators and they have the experience and knowledge to achieve exactly what the user needs. It is important that they produce a unique design for the application and make each product user friendly. We are careful with the development of the application because it not only needs to look good, it has to work well and be useful for the client. It is not only going to be a public application, but also a critical application in client decisions; therefore, we are especially careful.</p><h4>How would you describe the level of human talent in Peru's technology sector?</h4><p><span></span>It was hard in the beginning to find talent familiar with new technologies; however, we started looking for developers that have the basic skills and technological know-how. Our team has enough experience in the market, and we coach all new employees. Within time, they were able to program in the new technologies according to our development process. When we hire people, it is important for them to be passionate about what they do as without passion they are not going to achieve great things. It is important to create a good working environment.</p><h4>Do you think the government should do more to cultivate technology education in Peru to build a base of technology expertise?</h4><p><span></span>At this time, the government has empowered the technology sector for the enterprise. However it would be great for us if the government empowered more in the education of new technologies, because there is a lot of talent on the street that cannot afford a career. They have no financial resources so they have to work to survive instead of studying. They cannot achieve their dreams because they have not been given the opportunity. We are sure there is untapped talent here in the country. The Peruvian people are resourceful because they know how to do things even when they do not have enough resources, or when something is missing in their jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-it-to-win-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made Peru an interesting market for Geoservice Ingenierí­a?</h4><p><span></span>We have been providing engineering services for two decades, and our clients include mining firms such as Volcan, and Antamina, and energy industry players like Electroperu. We design the hydraulic systems in dams, canals, tunnels, and similar structures. Meanwhile, a sister company exclusively handles environmental projects for mining operations. We developed an environmental impact project for Tia Marí­a, which was approved by the Ministry of Mining. Furthermore, we supervise the construction and realization of our designs, working closely with the companies involved in this, but do not pursue our own construction activities.</p><h4>Has the drop in mineral prices impacted your business activity?</h4><p><span></span>We work with certain mines that have been significantly impacted by the drop, and have been obliged to discontinue operations. Some projects have been completely paralyzed by these developments. Fortunately, this has not impacted our activities and we remain actively engaged in large-scale projects, such as the ones developed for Consorcio Minero Horizonte. </p><h4>Does the company plan to expand activities in the construction management segment by taking advantage of the foreseen rise in infrastructure investment?</h4><p><span></span>We are trying to expand our activities in this segment in order to diversify our business portfolio. There is interesting potential in the transport and energy industries. For example, we have major studies underway for hydroelectric power projects and national development will bring many opportunities for us as an engineering company. Our strategic planning for 2015 will focus on servicing the needs of large mining operations, while diversifying our business portfolio. We have created a sister company that specializes in the studies of hydroelectric facilities to meet the domestic energy demand. Peru is set to become a leading constructor of hydroelectric energy and gas terminals. We are currently working on four hydroelectric plant studies that are currently at the design stage.</p><h4>What are the company's competitive advantages?</h4><p><span></span>Our competitive advantage is our detailed knowledge of the geography and topography of Peru, and our employment of state-of-the-art hydraulic technology. This allows us to offer our clients competitively priced solutions, and puts us at an advantage against foreign firms, which generally have higher costs. We have seen an average annual growth rate of 8-10% as a result.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the company's social program?</h4><p><span></span>Not only are we actively involved in running our own social programs, but we also encourage our clients to invest in programs that will benefit the communities and people in the areas in which we jointly operate. We also provide detailed and comprehensive studies on environmental impact and propose the most efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives for our partners. One of the main social challenges we face in the sector is the lack of effective communication between communities and the public and private sectors, resulting in the former having little knowledge of ongoing projects. This engenders higher levels of opposition from marginalized, or isolated communities, especially in the Andean regions. In these cases, we offer awareness programs to local communities so they are convinced of the benefits that would mean the implementation of a project</p><h4>What are some of your key projects of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>In our strategic plan for 2015, we will continue working with large and medium-sized mines, as we see such companies propelling the development of the industry here in the near future. There are many potential projects to be pursued with such companies. In fact, we fully expect the mining and energy industries to drive the broader economic growth of Peru over the coming years. Peru has energy projects that will contribute to economic growth as they come online. We are set to play an important role in this context. I expect Peru to exhibit impressive levels of growth over the coming decade, but we first need to solve particular social problems in order to meet the real potential of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Peru a strong market for BASF?</h4><p>We have been in Peru for 59 years. It is an economy with strong growth opportunities. We are involved in pigments, homecare, cosmetics, mining, water treatment, construction, automotive coatings, and agrochemicals. We are involved in many different segments, but our main business is agricultural and construction chemicals, as it generates most of our sales.</p><h4>This year has seen a slowdown for the Peruvian economy. How has this affected your business in Peru, particularly the fall in commodity prices?</h4><p><span></span>Mineral and commodity prices have been falling internationally, and domestically, national elections and corruption issues have played a part in this slowdown. We are very optimistic about 2015, however, as sales are growing in our main businesses, and next year, especially in mining and in the economy overall, there will be likely be a rise in consumption. BASF expects to grow about two percentage points above Peruvian GDP growth forecasts for next year, so around 8%.</p><h4>Agrobusiness is a new sector in Peru, and the government plans to diversify into niche products like avocado, cacao, and coffee. What products do you supply to the agricultural sector, and what do you expect to see in terms of growth there in 2015 and the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>We provide agrochemicals, including fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides, as well as biological products, but we do not provide fertilizers. Today, the agro-export business is not more than 30% to 35% of the agrochemicals market, but it will become the most important business in the next two or three years due to new irrigation plans in Arequipa, Lambayeque, and Jequetepeque. We work very closely with traditional crops as well, because those account for a significant part of the economy and a large part of the work force. The traditional sector is very important for us. We work to efficiently and effectively transmit innovations in the production of traditional crops, and we work closely with the government and agro-export companies to promote the traditional crops, which are potato, quinoa, rice, and corn, mainly. What we can offer are the agrochemicals that can defend and protect these crops and keep yields high.</p><h4>How does Peru figure in BASF's regional Latin American strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is a healthy and growing economy in South America, and we have a lot of opportunities here. The social structure is changing. As the economy and society develop and as living standards rise, people spend more on detergents, for example, and we can provide the right chemicals to make detergents more efficient, clean, and green. There are a lot of opportunities in homecare. On the construction side, major infrastructure projects are in progress in roads and transport, seaports and airports, logistics, and energy. In mining, Peru has the advantage of lower production costs, with a much lower break-even point. I think investments will start up again next year, and once those projects are in full production in a few years, there will be a lot of opportunities there too.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2015 and what projects will you be undertaking next year?</h4><p><span></span>This year we want to concentrate on our distribution channels, focus on developing a new generation of talent, and to work more closely with growers. We will grow around 10% in agrochemical products next year. We will also launch three or four innovative products in the Peruvian market, and most of our new products are fungicides and herbicides. In homecare, we are introducing a new technology, which is an innovative new way to reduce energy costs as well in the cosmetics sector. We want to lead by example, encouraging countries and companies to reduce pollutants and contaminants, and to reduce energy and water use. This year we celebrate BASF's 150th anniversary worldwide with a new slogan, “We create chemistry." These are exciting times for BASF, and 2015 will be an important year in Peru and all over the world for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The year 2014 was marked by several challenges and opportunities. How is the Ministry is responding to the new conditions in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>The government is responding proactively to the economic slowdown, and is implementing a series of measures that will drive economic growth in 2015. In July, we launched the National Productive Diversification Plan (PNDP). Peru's growth has been driven mainly by the mining sector, though we have other potential sectors such as agricultural exports. Fundamentally, our diversification strategy needs to stimulate other sectors. In that sense, we have begun work on technical committees with representatives of private associations to collect their proposals in terms of public assets.</p><h4>What are some of the tools and initiatives implemented to improve productivity?</h4><p><span></span>We have a group of formal, modern, highly-productive enterprises and a larger group of SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) that are characterized by informality and low productivity. We look forward to working with both companies because we need to increase the average productivity of the whole economy. In order to achieve this we have created the Centers for Technological Innovation (CITE), which aims to support technology transfer to SMEs. Currently, Peru has five centers, however, our goal is to reach at least 30 in 2015 and 47 in 2016. This model has already yielded results, but we are extending it to make it viable on a macroeconomic scale.</p><h4>What is the importance of the availability and expansion of credit to SMEs?</h4><p><span></span>The economy as a whole has high liquidity, but the cost of funding for some SMEs is very high. We are addressing this situation from at least two fronts: in July, the Congress approved the law that allows us to improve the financial market for SMEs through factoring. We need to ensure that when an SME will go to a large company, you can use your bill in a bank or similar institution for liquidity at a lower rate. What we are doing is to ensure that, in accordance with the law, it is clear and established that the invoice can be used as a guarantee statement. This will significantly reduce the cost of working capital of SMEs that provide goods or services to larger companies.</p><h4>How have improvements in infrastructure investments helped to increase economic growth, particularly in the industrial sector?</h4><p><span></span>Peru has a huge gap in infrastructure as there is about 6% of GDP spent on public infrastructure, and this will continue. We have a plan to increase productivity and public procurement for SMEs. If a government institution requires something that the local industry can provide, it should do so. Better infrastructure and better business conditions will reduce business costs further and make the country more competitive.</p><h4>The fishery sector has experienced a costly slowdown this year. What is the future of this sector in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>We need to encourage aquaculture, since currently only 1% of Peruvian production belongs to this segment compared to almost 50% in the rest of the world. There is high potential in this sector, as we know that fish stocks in the oceans are not growing and there is a limited amount that can be drawn if we maintain sustainable levels. Further growth needs to come from aquaculture, and the Ministry is establishing an innovation center and a technical committee to find new ways to work with the private sector. Besides anchovy, Peru has other options that can increase fishing significantly.</p><h4>What is the importance of diversified industrial and fishing sectors for the economy?</h4><p><span></span>Diversification is extremely important because we want to reduce our exposure to volatile commodity prices. Peru has the right macroeconomic conditions such as low and stable inflation and a strong financial sector. We still have several industries that have not taken off yet, and to consolidate growth, we need to ensure that these industries emerge and contribute to the economic growth of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What significance did the 2014 COP 20 have for Peru?</h4><p><span></span>This Ministry is fully aware that issues related to the climate and a green economy are a mainstay of the agenda for global development. We knew at that time that it would be good to be part of the global debate by hosting the COP 20 climate change conference in Lima, despite the cost involved. We invested public resources to organize it at a cost of around $80 billion, but it was crucial for our legacy not only domestically, but also internationally. Moreover, the event was a vehicle with which to lay the foundation for a more responsible climate policy with growth focused on this global topic. The COP 20 showed different governments haveconfidence in Peru and also showcased the ability of Peruvians to deal with a very complex debate. We are 10 months ahead of the Paris COP 21, for which we are still discussing one of the core topics of this climate agenda. We have developed two or three key things in this debate; first was the participation of non-state actors. For the first time here in Peru, there was a high-level session on climate action in which the government and non-state actors worked together. Secondly, what Peru did in terms of working with indigenous people was a very important step towards increasing their participation in civil society. In terms of our domestic legacy, we are just finishing with what we call the “Perú Compromiso Climático." It is our domestic agenda for the next two years. That will be part of our commitments at COP 21. It includes not only the different actions that we are seeking to show our climate responsibility, but one of the core activities is our national contribution. </p><h4>What amendments do you envisage for the regulatory environment in Peru in order to reduce carbon emissions?</h4><p><span></span>For a country like Peru, our main source of carbon emission is deforestation; it is very difficult to deal with the problem because much deforestation is not related to formal economic activity. Deforestation is more a result of the poverty and the immigration of the people from the Andes to the Amazon. That is why we need to work with the private sector, but indirectly because it is not responsible for deforestation. We need to create better conditions, opportunities, and wealth for people living in the Andes to avoid that kind of harmful immigration. We have already advanced a lot because we are part of the forestry investment program, working with the IDB and the World Bank, as a pilot project with different countries. Secondly, we are working to establish our reference level, as the only way to maintain the forest as an asset is by recognizing what opportunities it provides. Thirdly, we are going to deal with some of the major threats, like illegal mining. </p><h4>What is the government doing to improve environmental oversight of mining and petroleum projects?</h4><p><span></span>We have created new agencies to process permits and to create more confidence among the people about gas licensing or environmental studies. That is why we created the public agency Servicio Nacional de Certificacion Ambiental para las Inversiones Sostenibles (SENACE). I hope that by the end of this year, the faculties to approve the environmental impact studies in Peru will be completed. </p><h4>How can environmental policy ease social conflict in areas with these projects?</h4><p><span></span>We are working through different dialogues in trying to deal with different conflicts and also clarify what the environmental situation is in different parts of our territory. We want to promote sustainable investment in a sustainable manner, which will do much to foster confidence in the government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted the company to diversify its portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>We have recognized the need of the market and clients to establish a total service solution for the development of a project.  We needed to provide such solutions, and we did, which aids us to perform nationally. This development opens the doors to foreign investment and strengthens Peru's competitiveness as a mining country. However, more can be done, and we have not yet reached our full potential. We saw great opportunities within the mining industry and the several projects the industry had lined up. We wanted to meet its demand for equipment and machinery. That pushed us to diversify our business operations. We are a pioneering company; we imported technologically advanced equipment and machinery into Peru that was previously unavailable in the country.</p><h4><span></span>Has the fluctuation of mineral prices impacted the company?</h4><p><span></span>We have a presence in all the main mining projects in the country and our operations do not depend primarily on market mineral prices. There are several projects that have slowed down over the last year; however, all of these are still in development, and we are proudly part of that. The decision of the company was to expand to other markets, such as energy, oil and gas, and construction, with the same vision of providing the high quality service we provide in mining sector.  Our company has diversified. Today, we also have presence in other countries like Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, among others. We aim to diversify our global operations and ensure our fleet is available across these regions.</p><h4><span></span>What role does the mining industry have to play in the Peruvian economy?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is a mining country, being the main venue of money insertion for the country.  The government has a strong will to diversify the economy, which is understandable. However, the mining industry is the largest wheel that enables the smaller sectors to also advance and develop. Thanks to the mining industry, the country can invest in road and logistics infrastructure, as well as other sectors as the energy industry, tourism, and agriculture, and others. The mining industry has not yet reached its full potential. </p><h4><span></span>How has the company expanded its international profile?</h4><p><span></span>Foreign markets offer plenty of opportunities and when we decided to move internationally, we first launched operations in Chile. We decided to offer the same services there, based on the idea that the main foreign companies operating here were also there. We took similar steps in Ecuador and Bolivia. Our main advantage is that we have a strong brand, Grupo Vivargo had built a name in the industry and our clients recognized us as a dependable company. This helped us to enter new markets in which international mining costumers are the same in Peru. Additionally, when looking at the possibility of going internationally, we have considered our neighbor countries due to the fact that we manage heavy machinery and equipment, and proximity is an important factor when it comes to transporting our fleet. We see Colombia and Brazil as our next steps.</p><h4><span></span>How would you see the company further developing in the future?</h4><p><span></span>Our main focus is to maintain our brand as strong and dependable as it is now. For that, we are in constant development, learning and growing every day, strengthening the brand with solid structures. We have already achieved very good milestones and reached our yearly goals. I can proudly say that at Vivargo we are a family.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the region and around the world there is a question of declining quality. What have you seen here in the mining sector in terms of the decline in copper?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is currently producing 1.2 million tons of copper per annum. With the expansion of Cerro Verde and the construction of Las Bambas and Constancias, we will be producing 2.5 million tons within two years, which means more than a doubling of production. This still lags far behind Chile, which produces 5 million tons of copper. </p><h4>There has been much talk about infrastructure investment this year and a lot will be implemented in 2015, while the new mineral port has also opened in Trafigura Beheer. How do those developments affect you?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is a country that still lacks infrastructure, and from a geographical standpoint it is a difficult one when you have low-population coastal areas and the high Andes. Then, there is the Amazon jungle to contend with. In order to generate the necessary infrastructure to connect the country, you need economic activity that justifies it. Mining is part of this justification, and obviously Peru had been doing well to improve its infrastructure with roads, electricity, and communications, although the country still has a long way to go. In the case of the port specifically, through our subsidiary, Sociedad Minera El Brocal, we are also part of this process, and it is set to become an important facility that will reduce the costs of shipping, while the vessels themselves will arrive and depart faster than at present, all of which vitally reduces costs. </p><h4>Earlier in 2105, The National Academy of Sciences Journal published a study on mining and hydrocarbon projects across the world misjudging the inherent political risks of large projects. Buenaventura has had problems with Yanacocha and Conga. How would you judge the political risk of Peruvian projects?</h4><p><span></span>A country like Peru that is regarded as a star generates expectations. The rural population naturally has expectations of sharing in the benefits of national growth rates. The problem is how to deal with those expectations, especially when they have to do with the distribution of wealth. The mining sector, as part of the private sector, generates wealth, taxes, and production, and the resulting wealth and taxes have to be redistributed by the authorities. The problem in countries like Peru is that the state is absent in some rural areas and mining companies have to assume the role of the state, which is almost impossible. That generates conflict, which we have to address. Expectations need to be met through additional infrastructure, and by providing opportunities, services, education, and healthcare. </p><h4>For the next three years, how do you plan to increase production during a time of falling mineral prices, and how do you plan to keep costs low in that environment?</h4><p><span></span>Many believe that the mining industry develops in times of high prices, and that is indeed part of the story, although overall mining essentially develops with political and economic stability. Mining develops when there is security for the people and when there is infrastructure. Peru is on the right track, and we are improving infrastructure. The fact is that Peru has signed free trade agreements with two thirds of total global GDP—55 nations worldwide—we have an investment grade rating, and we are part of the Pacific Alliance, which makes us part of a group of successful companies in Latin America. Meanwhile, we have finalized all sea border disputes with Chile, which means that Peru is stable, economically and politically.</p>]]></richbody0content>

This way we can provide a secure and dependable power distribution network that can sustain a variety of different industrial and economic needs, and also solidify Peru's long-term growth as a competitive player in the region. </p><p><span></span>At the same time, we must work toward providing universal access to electricity and power for our entire population, and have set a goal of 95.6% coverage by 2016 to this end. We must reach every corner of the country, no matter how remote, and we have to overcome some serious geographical challenges. We already have projects underway, one of which is the provision of 150,000 solar panels for homes in remote regions that don't yet have access to the national grid. </p><p><span></span>When it comes to mining, it's crucial to support and attract greater investment in the sector, while at the same time guaranteeing that these investments are socially and environmentally sustainable. It is important to ensure that mining operations are socially responsible as they can integrate business interests in the communities in which they operate. This will help counter the negative image mining has had in the country, based on past experiences in which mining companies failed to respect the rights of communities and the environment. The current dynamism we see in Peru's mining exploration and production activities is important, especially in copper, as projections for 2016 rank Peru as second worldwide in terms of annual copper production.</p><h4>Peru is currently highly dependent on hydroelectric energy and natural gas. Is Peru planning on expanding its renewable energy sources like solar and wind power?</h4><p><span></span>We have a legal framework in place to promote and develop renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass. But as we see in most markets in the region, these technologies are still in the development and maturing phase, and we have to go step by step and use our own and neighboring countries' experiences to chart the best course possible in terms of integrating renewable technologies into the Peruvian energy grid—technologies that are economically viable, environmentally responsible, and of benefit to each and every final consumer. Our goal is to supply 5% of national energy generation from non-conventional and renewable sources. For this purpose, we hold tenders every two years to attain electricity fees that can help us reach that 5% target. We received three tenders for renewable energy contracts, with a fourth due in August. The tender in August covers 1,300 GWh of renewable non-conventional power and 450 GWh of hydroelectric power, with each hydroelectric power station to produce less than 20 MW. </p><h4>How does Peru find a way to develop its abundant mineral resources while at the same time respecting the rights and well-being of local communities where mining operations are located?</h4><p><span></span>The sector is operating under a new set of guidelines, ensuring that companies promote concepts like early intervention, transparency, decentralized attention to unrest, and articulated multicultural intervention, in extraction operations. The role that mining has played in the reduction of poverty and the promotion of economic and social development in the country is undeniable, and it's clear that mining must continue to be one of the driving economic motors of Peru, especially in terms of achieving our goal of true social inclusion. </p><p><span></span>We now have a legal framework that is in the interests of both the investor and the Peruvian state and people. It is a new policy and approach to mining that ensures respect for the environment and promotes social inclusion through a trinomial Investor-Community-State model in which the state accompanies the investment process from the beginning of the project to guarantee sustainable development. As such, mining continues to be a motor of the national economy.</p><h4>What is it that makes Peru such an attractive destination for foreign investment in the mining sector? </h4><p><span></span>Besides the huge mining potential that Peru holds in terms of proven reserves and production levels, Peru is also a safe country for investments, offering excellent opportunities in mining and energy on a global level. Peru is among the world's biggest producers of silver, copper, gold, lead, zinc, and tin. </p><p><span></span>The consistency, stability, and clarity of our judicial and regulatory framework is fundamental to attracting investment in the mining sector, considering that mining is a capital-intensive industry that requires extensive resources which mature in the medium to long term. Peru has carried out extensive reforms to mining legislation, which has led to a legal framework that promotes both national and foreign investment in the mining sector, guaranteeing equality of rights, top facilities, and security. This is what has sustained a vibrant and dynamic Peruvian mining sector that is also one of the most competitive and attractive in Latin America.</p><p><span></span>The Peruvian mining sector isn't just committed to the responsible use of natural resources, but it also seeks to create real and palpable gains for local populations and communities through their efforts to develop socially and economically sustainable growth. Modern mining pays special attention to environmental conservation, utilizing the most modern technologies, with clearly defined and planned operational frameworks for this purpose.</p><h4>What are your main policy priorities for your term as Minister?</h4><p><span></span>The priorities of the mining sector are to promote the new concepts with greater efficiency and efficacy, with the aim of contributing to Peru's long-term sustainable growth while focusing on issues of social inclusion, security, and professional safety and health standards. We are also working diligently to regulate informal mining operations, and create high and sustainable quality standards throughout the industry. </p><p><span></span>At the same time, we are working to ease the bureaucratic regulatory process so as to facilitate a growth in investments and attract more investors. We've been simplifying procedures, reducing terms, creating uniformity in application processes, introducing more flexible criteria for the authorization and licensing of construction and functioning in all stages of mining operations in a sector that is now worth $64 billion. </p><p><span></span>We also have certain priorities in the energy sector. These include diversifying the energy portfolio; ensuring sufficient power generation to meet the country's needs in the medium and long-term; improving the quality of the national power distribution grid; extending access to the national grid in rural and remote areas; guaranteeing a dependable power network for the people and industry; and advancing further reforms in the distribution of electricity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fenix Power recently commenced commercial operations. What lay behind your entry into the Peruvian market, and what makes the market an attractive one?</h4><p><span></span>In 2008 AEI acquired Fenix, which was called Egechilca at the time, and was developed by Panamanian investors, Grupo Lakas. They started the project in 2004, purchasing the gas turbines and securing the requisite permits. The financial crisis of 2007 prevented their strategic investors from completing the project. Under those circumstances, AEI reached an agreement with Grupo Lakas to purchase these assets, and AEI completed the project development, although it took a while to start construction due to a gas and gas-transportation crisis in 2009. The government stepped in with a competitive bid for their gas supply company, which we won. We had already acquired the turbines and related permits, and winning this bid took care of the gas supply. Construction started in 2011, and was completed in early 2014. Commercial operations began in May 2014, but at 50% capacity utilization. From May to December 2014, we were operating at 280 MW capacity, and 2H2014, we received COES approval for a Commercial Operation Date (COD) with full capacity of 570 MW registered on December 24th. With full capacity at our plant, we are now contributing 10% of electricity consumed by Peru. This will push prices in the right direction, reducing consumer prices with the huge capacity we add to the system. Fenix Power is proud of the major contribution it is making to the Peruvian economy by reducing electricity prices, while increasing supply. We also feel proud of our social impact in Chilca, a community of 17,000 where we operate. Fenix Power has built a potable water system at the power plant, of which only 20% is used for our own purposes, including desalinization and potabilization. The remaining 80% is distributed to the local community in Las Salinas, Chilca. This water supply can only gain in importance over time. </p><h4>Assessing political risk is a crucial factor for companies seeking to invest in foreign markets. How did you carry out that assessment and what challenges did you face?</h4><p><span></span>The political scene has been highly encouraging overall. At the executive level, the government has delivered on all its pledges. In the broader arena, local politics and political associations now and then oppose infrastructure in their regions. Taking these organizations into consideration, we have faced certain problems, especially in the early years when such groups masqueraded as environmentalists to conceal their political agenda. Fenix Power does what it commits to doing, and stakeholders notice and respect our commitment. This is despite the changes seen at the energy ministry over the past few years. Every administration has supported our project, and we have been unhindered in that regard. This is because what we are doing on both the social and economic front is of too much national significance for any official or government to oppose. All in all, I believe that what differentiates Fenix Power from other companies that produce thermal energy using gas-combined cycles is our social commitments and what we give to the local population. </p><h4>How are you able to provide low prices to the market, and how does your plant compare to other power sources in Peru at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>Fenix Power was not the first energy company to use a combined-cycle power plant, although we were the first to announce that we would build one. When others began putting their power plants into operation, they were open-cycle, simple-cycle plants that came into operation in 2006-2007. But the threat of the new power plants being combined-cycle facilities forced many simple-cycle plants to convert to combined-cycle facilities. Today we have about 2,500 MW in combined cycle plants using natural gas. Various companies converted their simple-cycle plants to these combined-cycle plants, but we did it quicker, since we started out by building combined-cycle plants, whereas others had to undertake the whole conversion process from scratch. The entry of these combined-cycle units is certainly having a major impact by reducing the price of electricity in Peru, although it must be said that the drop in oil prices is also a major factor. That being said, thanks to the combined-cycle power plant, we can generate 40% more electricity without requiring additional fuel. That has led to a huge increase in supply over the past three or four years, which has reduced prices significantly, especially in light of the fact that demand has not grown as expected, with Peru registering GDP growth of less than 3%. In a nutshell, lower demand, higher supply through the introduction of combined-cycle plants, and lower oil prices, have all brought electricity prices down in Peru. We now see spot prices of below $20 per MWH.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Peruvian electricity sector, and are you worried that the current economic climate and recent government policies will make it more difficult to pursue new projects?</h4><p><span></span>In the government's efforts to increase gas power-generation they have supported the development of gas infrastructure. The government has also artificially maintained prices at what it calls “ideal" levels. Its model assumes there are no restrictions, and that energy in any amount can be supplied at ideal rates. Although these policies served a purpose a few years ago when the government was keen to diversify electricity supply, setting these artificial price levels with no time limits can create prices that fail to represent the true cost of generation. While this works for short periods of time, extended periods of artificial pricing send a distorted message to the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role of Secrex in trade and credit insurance in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>We are an affiliate of the Spanish state-owned company CESCE, which historically served as the Export-Import Bank of Spain, but which has since become more of a credit insurance company. We have guarantees in construction and public works for our customers and clients who deal with government and companies in the public sector in segments such as mining, construction, and transportation. </p><h4>What is the importance of Peru in comparison to neighboring markets?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is one of our most interesting markets where we play a competitive role. The share of incomes of CESCE Latin America comes from Peru where, after the banks themselves, we are the leading company for bond trading. Peru is important for us and we are performing well predominantly offering bond services.</p><h4>Why is the market for this so underdeveloped right now?</h4><p><span></span>Credit insurance was seen only as an instrument for export, and was not taken into consideration at the beginning because the first thing that governments wanted was to develop export and trade. Ultimately it has become an instrument for covering domestic sales in which credit is involved. There is a risk of non-payment, and we are seeing that it is being used for internal and domestic cases, but only between companies and end-users. We must be able to analyze and access information on companies to include balance sheets and figures. It is quite complicated in these countries and it rather difficult to obtain a frank picture of what an individual does or does not have. </p><h4>What do you see as the biggest potential source of growth for credit insurance in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>The French and Germans are prominent players in credit insurance. In this part of the world we are one of the big players. We are the second or third group in Latin America to engage in this segment, but other countries are also interested and are doing well. Developing credit insurance is our biggest goal for the future.</p><h4>Do you see potential for bonds to become a larger part of your business?</h4><p><span></span>There has been a boom in public works, which is helping to develop this area. It is important to say that the public offerings have been scarce in the first part of the year because of the change in administration and the overlap of new officers. They have been unable to draft the budget in a timely fashion. Bonds are mainly used for guaranteeing the feasibility of a contract, so people can place a bond to guarantee that this work will be finished in time and successfully. We organize and assess their expertise and growth potential. We then go ahead and write down these risks and place the bond. Our loss ratio is quite good in these areas, at about 30%, which is manageable considering these markets. </p><h4>What steps are you taking to refocus the business on these areas?</h4><p><span></span>We want to become more competitive with our closest customers, those we consider our core and portfolio customers. We have decided to be competitive in the way we work on this. We are growing very fast in the fields of technology, databases, and sharing among the companies in the group. We are setting up decision-making offices in broader Latin America, which are important in that we are geared at being local and global at the same time. The only way to do this is to have a regional office for different purposes in several countries where we have the most know-how. </p><h4>What is your vision for the company's growth in Peru over the short term?</h4><p><span></span>We have developed staff teams and technological tools that work effectively. These are not yet normalized because we are just starting the network. We are earning and are well placed in the market share and profitability rankings. We will try to enlarge the share of the company in the insurance market in step with the pace of overall market growth. It is still a small market, but we will try to grow it and take whatever market share we can in the bond industry, as we want to be seen as the main player and leader, improving services and accountability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Having recently assumed your position, what do you see as the main challenges confronting Petroperu today?</h4><p>I officially took over as Chairman of the Board on March 30th, 2015 and a month later I also became the company's General Manager. This was a decision made by the shareholders to expedite the implementation and effectiveness of strategies, decisions, and actions within the company. Nowadays, the organization faces three main challenges. First is to efficiently bring forward the Talara Refinery project within the stipulated time frame. This project has an investment of $3.5 billion and should be finished in June 2019. One of its main challenges is the economic reality of the town in which this large project is located. We also aim to consolidate Petroperu's economic and operative activities; in fact, we hold the concession for Lot 64, and we are looking at the possibilities of entering to lot 192, which is already in operation and will allow us to double current volumes (10,000/bpd). We also aim to modernize our corporate structure, as Petroperu needs an institutional boost to improve profitability. We are currently in the process of developing the modernization plan for the government's approval and its implementation by the end of this year.</p><h4>Some analysts have predicted that the current trend of low oil prices will continue for the next few years. In this context, does the large investment required to replace the Talara refinery make sense for Petroperu?</h4><p><span></span>The oil industry is an economic sector that requires a long-term vision and an efficient operation, taking into account the volumes we move. We expect oil prices to rise in the near future; however, our objective is to have a modern refinery that will work with oil that has high viscosity levels, which are the most common ones in the Amazonian area of Peru. Petroperu produces fuels with high sulfur levels; therefore, the modernization of the Talara refinery is something required by law. In conclusion, we need this type of project to be more efficient from the operative and environmental points of view.</p><h4>Why did Petroperu decide not to participate in the tender of Lots III and IV?</h4><p><span></span>The main reason was that the documentation did not comply with the requirements of the previous directory of the company. They foresaw the participation in operations of these two lots as long as we reached an agreement with the operating company of each lot and the analyses of contingent liabilities. These were not ready within the time frame initially expected, despite organizing several emergency directories—regardless of the additional information provided by the other parties—we decidednot to take part in these projects. From a business point of view, we did not have all the analyses and information we required to make a positive decision. We prioritize things well and such decisions must comply with the company's standards. We are extremely rigorous in this context; therefore, we always require analyses of contingencies, socio-environmental issues, and market research, among other stipulations. The list of requirements is strict; however, it is an assurance for us for doing things well.</p><h4>What role does a public company like Petroperu play in the oil sector of the country?</h4><p><span></span>A company is always a company, regardless of it being public or private. The main difference has to do with who the owner is. All companies have the same goals: to achieve their own objectives and to be profitable. Our vision and objectives for the company are very clear. In spite of the fact that Petroperu is currently a consolidated and reputable brand in the country, our goal is to make it a beloved brand. At the same time, we want to expand our international horizons.</p><h4>Why has the decision to take the company public on the Lima Stock Exchange been postponed? </h4><p><span></span>Peru's Law 30130 points out that Petroperu can sell up to 49% of its shares; hence, the state will always remain the main shareholder. This is a way to obtain capital to finance projects and sustain growth, and has to be done when a company is most attractive to investors. Therefore, when the company achieves solidness and requires money for a key project, the directive body of the same will make the decision to sell the shares.</p><h4>How does development of Peru's gas resources fit into Petroperu's strategic plans for the upcoming years? </h4><p><span></span>This is not one of our top priorities because the company is not yet ready to take this step. There are other projects that are more important for the future development of the company such as the refinery.</p><h4>How do you see the company in five to ten years?</h4><p><span></span>We should achieve higher levels of integration at all levels. This refinery will also enable us to diversify our activities and products, enabling the company to provide finished goods to the retail market. We need to create more synergy within all departments of the company, to become more efficient. Finally, we will increase our international presence.<span></span></p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy shaped your initial entry into the Peruvian market, and what was unique about your approach?</h4><p><span></span>Our goal for implementing new financing here was to help middle-income people buy new cars in a difficult environment. A line of credit is hard to come by, due to conservative banking policies. We are conservative, but we do extend credit to suitable customers in a workable manner. For example, we have a product called “Renueve" which allows our customers to enjoy a new car every two or three years, letting them take advantage of the best part of the useful life of the car with the lowest down payment and the most convenient monthly payment on the market. This represents a 45% saving in monthly payments when compared to conventional credit. The benefits of this product with MAF are innumerable. Those who have thought about buying their first vehicle at a lower price will be able to opt for a much more expensive vehicle with a more convenient payment. More importantly, when it comes time to replacing the car, the client doesn't pay the cost of the depreciation of the vehicle because the remaining value of the vehicle is turned into the down payment for the next car. Finally, our clients pay only for what they use and not for all the additional costs that can be generated through the use of a car over the years, such as depreciation and maintenance costs, for example. Products like this are possible because we know firsthand what the residual value of that car will be in the future. The way that banks evaluate the credit-worthiness of customers is totally dependent on their credit history and record, as well as their revenue profiles. Our focus on middle-income people is entirely new to Peru. I saw the potential in this market early on, and we transformed a former Mitsui's leasing company into a new finance company obtaining the license from the SBS (Banking Superintendency) in 2010 after a three-year period, which has given us a substantial head start against our competitors.</p><h4>How did the market respond to your model?</h4><p><span></span>In 2011 we placed relatively few loans, as was the case in 2012. However, 2013 was our first year of real operations, and we had $100 million worth of loans on our portfolio. In 2014, too, we placed more than $100 million worth of loans. Indeed, MAF closed 2014 as the second largest auto loan provider in the country.</p><h4>What other flexibility does your form of finance represent beyond the facility of a large down payment? What due diligence do you perform on clients?</h4><p><span></span>We have a presence in the dealership. As you know, the car dealers identify the opportunities and establish relationships with customers. We establish a close relationship with them because it is a key part of our business. That is why we have a presence in every Toyota dealership in Peru. We make a quick assessment of the client, taking less than an hour. If customers go to a Toyota dealership and are introduced to our loan executive, they leave the dealership knowing whether the car and financing will work out. That is vital because ultimately buying a car involves an emotional decision.</p><h4>How do you make that credit decision?</h4><p><span></span>We take available credit information and essentially interview the client about their income, and make a decision based on the data on hand. Customers must support their data with documentation, but once cleared, the credit is approved, and we deliver the loan. What makes MAF different is our ability to respond quickly, delivering both the loan decision, and where the outcome is positive, the loan itself.</p><h4>How does technology support your business?</h4><p><span></span>We brought our technology from Chile where we developed our systems and our entire web-based capabilities. We deliver the application approval quickly because all systems are linked. MAF also supports its business through an efficient collections process and quick repossession of cars to repay the outstanding amounts. At the end of 2013, our group consolidated an Auto Loans portfolio exceeding $400 million in Peru and Chile. In 2014, even after a difficult foreign exchange rate climate in South America, we further increased our portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core focus of Credicorp Capital?</h4><p>Peru has been growing significantly over the past decade. Most of our Peruvian clients were well served inside Peru, registering domestic market growth followed gradually by a regional presence in such markets as Chile or Colombia. While we could serve them well in Peru, we lacked the necessary resources to help them enter regional markets. That is when we thought there would be a space for what is going on in the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (MILA), or this part of the Pacific Alliance. Every day numerous Colombian, Chilean, and Peruvian companies are investing in the other markets. What is happening in the real sector in terms of investment is that we have built this investment banking platform to support not only companies, but also individuals and institutional investors that are starting to invest all over our region. That is why we first created BCP Capital, an investment banking group, in Peru, as a spin-off of assets out of BCP. Later, we acquired a majority stake in Correval in Colombia and IM Trust in Chile. These acquisitions plus BCP Capital became Credicorp Capital. If you look at South America, you have Brazil on one side, which is huge but has its own dynamics, and then Colombia, Peru, and Chile, all having similar economic and political models. Individually, we are quite small, but if you add up the three nations' populations, there is a total of 90 million inhabitants with a GDP of $800 billion.</p><h4>The Bolsa de Valores (Lima Stock Exchange) is heavy on mining currently and some predict negative effects from the recent drop in commodity prices. What do you think?</h4><p><span></span>The Lima Stock Exchange (LSE) has always been a mining exchange. About 50% of the market capitalization or more has been weighted on mining companies. I would like to have other sectors get into the market and weigh in, but the situation is that we have been a mining country and we will continue to be a mining country. A lot of what happens at the LSE will depend heavily on what mining companies do. Last year was a particularly hard one amid declining commodity prices, and you saw this reflected in the prices of equities traded on the LSE. The mining companies' prices lost around 40% of their value, which given their value at the bourse, affected the index overall. There has been a slender rebound this year as prices have stabilized and some of them have even gone up. Nonetheless, the performance of those companies often depends more on external factors more than on the plight of Peru.</p><h4>What is the climate in Peru for international investors?</h4><p><span></span>The LSE recently reduced trading costs by 70%, which is significant. But, with this 70% we are not as competitive as we should be. Actual volumes haven't increased substantially as a result of this price reduction, as on top of these costs, brokerage costs are also incurred. In the past, infrastructure cost was 20 basis points (including SMV and Cavali). That came down to 10 basis points, but if you add 50 basis points on top of that from brokers, the reduction is much smaller… the second thing is that Peru is the only one of the Pacific Alliance to levy a 5% capital gains tax, which renders us less competitive than the other two countries. Liquidity simply moves to a more efficient market. On a typical day at the LSE, the average traded volume will be around $15 million. But for Peruvian companies trading in New York, it is going to probably be $150-200 million.</p><h4>What role do you expect the bolsa to play in the broader development of the country over the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>The main advantages that the stock exchange brings are transparency, liquidity, and good pricing. This said, transparency in particular is key. If we are going to have investors, both internal and from abroad, we need to make sure that companies, be they listed on the LSE or not, are complying with the highest standards of governance. Something we should be focusing on, and indeed, something we are still working on as a market and as a nation is corporate governance and transparency. As long as we are seen as a highly competitive, transparent, and well-governed exchange, more companies will be keen to come and list on it, and that culture will permeate throughout the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Inversiones La Cruz in the financial sector of Peru?</h4><p>We are specialists in offering microcredits with collateral ranging from $100 to $2,000 that are repaid within between one and four months. We offer these credits nationwide and concentrate our services in Lima and Peru's provinces.  Inversiones La Cruz has grown both geographically and in volume terms, and today has more than 75 agencies and with a future projection of 90 by the end of 2015. We are the first financial entity in the Alternative Stock Exchange (MAV), which has more flexible procedures than the Bolsa de Valores de Lima (BVL) and allowed us to do our first issuance just six months after embarking on this project.</p><h4>Are you focused mostly on individual clients or do you also provide credits to SMEs?</h4><p><span></span>Today, 100% of our customers are individuals. Throughout the years, we have been able to 'bank' many customers who relied on informal channels. One should bear in mind that we have been working in Peru for 20 years, in Bolivia for 15, as well as in four other countries in Central America.</p><h4>Why has Inversiones La Cruz been so successful given heavy competition?</h4><p><span></span>Ours is a niche business model, and has been successful precisely because we have satisfied a clear demand. Around half of our clients are unbanked, and when seeking credit, they lack a credit record, which is where we come in. We have succeeded through specializing in credits with collateral such as gold jewelry, vehicles and diverse articles such as electronic devices, kitchen appliances, and mobile phones.</p><h4>Peru's economy suffers from a high level of informality. Does competition from informal lenders present a significant growth challenge?</h4><p><span></span>On the contrary, the informal channel and moneylenders are a great opportunity, since potential and regular clients prefer an institution that offers them better terms and conditions, transparent operations, and the security we offer for their possessions, jewels or vehicles. We see this opportunity growing on the outskirts of modern Lima and in many provinces of Peru.</p><h4>Some critics have said that this type of short-term lending is “predatory" because of its high interest rates when compared to standard bank loans. What would you say in response?</h4><p><span></span>Standard bank loans are much higher than ours and are long term. Ours is a short-term loan that averages $400 per loan, and is mainly used for emergencies. Moreover, our clients cannot resort to a standard bank. Over the years, we have been able to help more than 100,000 people overcome inconveniences, or secure a small loan for necessary purchases.</p><h4>How do you explain the positive impact of this sector on Peruvian society?</h4><p><span></span>To the general public, this credit is an opportunity to step forward. However, having so many entities it is possible that the client will start working with many of them, and eventually not fulfill their promises. For the client it provides an opportunity to do business. Every business must look forward, but in our business, we have to cover our backs as well. A bank will know when to decline a client, but if there are too many entities, eventually one will say yes.</p><h4>What trends do you predict for the sector?</h4><p><span></span>There will be a consolidation process of microcredit companies because there are a great variety of them. This is because actual and potential clients prefer such credits from businesses that have better support, provide security and inspire trust.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru is one of South America's top economic performers, but before this decade, it had experienced monitory woes. However, during your tenure the sol has seen stability and growth against the dollar. What role have the Central Bank's policies had in this transformation?</h4><p><span></span>We have a highly turbulent monetary history. Back in the 1980s, both monetary and fiscal policies in Peru were very poor. Since 2001, when we adopted an inflation target regime to conduct monetary policy, we became the first country to adopt this regime with negative inflation rates. The credibility in the new regime allowed the central bank to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy, without affecting inflationary expectations. The second country to apply inflation targeting under negative inflation was Japan, in 2014. Since introducing inflation targeting, core inflation in Peru has been at 2%, and headline inflation at 2.6%, on average. That is the lowest in Latin America, which is consistent with fact that we have the lowest target of inflation in the region. </p><h4>How is the bank acting to stimulate growth in the context of lower mineral prices, and what has led you to keep the rate constant over the past two months?</h4><p><span></span>Inflation has been high, that is the main reason why we have been reluctant to cut rates. Instead, we reduced reserve requirements so that financial institutions can increase their lending at a faster pace. The Central Bank has adopted an expansionary policy stance since May 2013 when it started cutting reserve requirements. Since that time, we have also cut the policy rate three times up to 3%, which implies a real interest rate of less than 1%.</p><h4>For many emerging economies the rise in the dollar, coupled with a fall in commodities, may come as a shock. How do you plan to insulate Peru from that trend?</h4><p><span></span>In 2008, the emerging markets recovered quickly, because China was growing rapidly in 2009, which pushed commodity prices up. In addition, the Fed extended sub-lines to certain important emerging market economies like Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore. This allowed them to limit exchange rate pressures, whereby credit resumed flowing to emerging markets. Those conditions are not going to exist this time around, as commodity prices are falling, and the US is set to tighten its monetary policy. Expansionary policies will remain in place in Japan and Europe, which will partially compensate the impact of the FEDs tightening in emerging market economies. Last year Peru was the only country in the region with a fiscal surplus. Peru saved during good times and now we can use those savings to pursue a more aggressive counter-cyclical fiscal policy. We have a large level of international reserves, so if there is pressure on the currency, we can use a good chunk of those reserves to limit the risks of an abrupt depreciation of the sol. This gives us some leeway. The third important factor is that many important projects, particularly in the mining sector, will enter production in 2015-17, which will nearly double copper production over the next three years.</p><h4>Do you have any thoughts about Peruvian debt markets and on the effects of quantitative easing?</h4><p><span></span>We are the emerging economy with the largest participation of non-residents in the domestic-currency government bond market.  This participation reached 58% in the past, nowadays is less than 40%. Besides this reduction, the yields of government bonds have not increased, reflecting the high demand for these bonds of domestic agents. Private Peruvian pension funds that had increased its investments abroad are moving it back to Peru. In the case of corporate bonds, the issuance in emerging markets have increased substantially recently, particularly in the last three years. Last year for example, we accounted for almost a fifth of total bonds issued in South America, Brazil, and Chile each one for 31%, and Colombia for the 14% of the total issuance during 2013. Those bonds have been typically been issued in dollars at a historically low interest rates. They are bullet bonds, typically issued with a maturity between seven and 10 years, therefore the rollover risk is relatively low. As part of policy to smooth the credit cycle in Peru, during the period of QE, we increased the reserve requirement in dollars, in the case of deposits up to 50%. This policy increases dollar lending rates, particularly for small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) and households, as corporates have access to international capital markets, this type of reserve requirement affects them less.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you begin your term as Minister, what do you see as the key challenges confronting Peru in terms of foreign policy priorities?</h4><p>During the most recent Summit of the Americas, held last April in Panama, President Humala underlined the two key challenges the region faces. He highlighted the crucial importance of reducing social and economic inequalities. We must address those gaps to strengthen the social fabric of our nations. Our foreign policy must respond by contributing to spur economic growth focused on social inclusion and poverty-reduction. Achieving said goal requires modern partnerships abroad aimed at improving Peru's public services, human capital, job market, and productivity, by increasing trade, foreign investment, and international cooperation.</p><p>President Humala also stressed the need to adopt—by consensus—concrete steps to mitigate climate change, a major global challenge that already affects Peru and other Latin-American countries. Peru's firm commitment to this issue was clearly demonstrated while conducting negotiations at the COP20 meeting held in Lima last December, which led to adoption of the Lima Call for Climate Change, a major step forward heading to the 2015 agreement. We hope to sign a comprehensive and effective multilateral agreement this year when we conclude the COP21 meeting at Paris.</p><h4>What are the next steps in deepening Peru's integration with Pacific Alliance countries, and what economic and political benefits will this bring to Peru?</h4><p>The benefits brought by the Pacific Alliance are already being enjoyed by our citizens. Nearly 92% of our trade today has tariff-free status. We also have a joint stock-market agreement in place that allows free share trading among its members. And meanwhile, Mexico's recent inclusion to the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) will make the Pacific Alliance stock exchange market the largest one in Latin America. Likewise, several innovating cooperation projects have been launched, including a scientific web to tackle climate change and an exchange program for voluntary work by youth organizations.</p><p>The Alliance aims at deepening integration by increasingly including new actors and fields in the joint effort. We are convinced that integration has to be an ongoing inclusive process. For instance, this year we have held meetings to promote commercial exchange by SMEs, which today only account for 5% of our trade. We intend to continue promoting exports by including suggestions made by the business sector in our policies. The full entry of our trade agreement into force will boost intra-regional trade to integrate production lines and produce more intermediate and final goods by the Alliance as a unit.</p><p>Peru will chair the Alliance starting in July. Peru intends to give priority to strengthening our institutional framework, deepening the integration process, and expanding decisively our relations with the Asia-Pacific region. We expect to see the Alliance's framework agreement come into full force under our chairmanship. We will also review the progress of our integration process and establish new goals, and we will work closer with observer states—which amount to 32 today and will soon expand to 39—as well as with international institutions.</p><h4>At the COP20, President Humala and his Pacific Alliance counterparts presents a Declaration Against Climate Change. What steps can Peru take to ensure that the fight against climate change is integrated into its foreign policy priorities?</h4><p>Peru remains at the forefront of the multilateral process working closely with France to ensure success for COP21. We are focused now in defining the key elements to be included in the final draft of the text to be approved in Paris. At the regional level, Peru is seeking to find common positions on financing and adaptation measures within the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Pacific Alliance. Bilaterally, Peru is establishing joint programs aimed at conservation and management of its biodiversity, and also at enhancing national capacities to combat climate change.</p><p>Peru announced its contribution to the Green Climate Fund last December at the COP20. We are now preparing our national contribution. A national commission is preparing a proposal based on five areas identified as those with larger climate change mitigation potential: forests, agriculture, transport, industrial processes, and solid waste management. Well-funded and scaled-up financing, technology, and capacity building from developed countries and the world's largest economies are vital to enabling the developing world to move ahead in cutting-down greenhouse gas emissions, while building strong economies for the well-being of future generations.</p><h4>What makes Peru a favorable destination for international investment?</h4><p>Foreign investment has been a cornerstone of Peru's strong economic performance for over two decades. A combination of stable rules, political stability, fiscal responsibility, and sound policies attracts major foreign investments in diverse fields of Peru's economy, including mining, energy, utilities, retail, and agriculture.<br>Our regulatory system rests on non-discriminatory treatment for foreign and national investors. Foreign firms can invest in all economic activities and have unrestricted access to national and international financial sources. Access to international dispute-settling institutions is also guaranteed. This ample set of favorable business conditions remains unchanged and provides a suitable environment to welcome international investment.</p><p>Currently, PPPs offer new opportunities for investing in infrastructure, transport, and communications. We believe that working together with transnational enterprises is an effective way to increase the use of scientific and technological knowledge in Peru's economy, and to strengthen our competitiveness.</p><h4>What are the key foreign policy priorities you plan to pursue during your tenure as Minister?</h4><p>Persistent efforts to maintain cooperation and integration flows with neighboring countries are of utmost importance to improve the livelihood of our citizens. Likewise, regional integration is an essential foreign policy guideline in playing a significant role in the world economy. Nurturing our strategic associations with the US, the EU, and China, as well as with other international powers, is also a major priority. We underscore the need to focus cooperation with said countries on increasing human capital and the use of science and technology in our production lines.</p><p>The Pacific Alliance reflects the high priority we grant both to deepening regional integration and to bolstering relations with the Asia-Pacific region. Peru hosts the 2016 APEC Summit to strengthen ties with the US and Asian-Pacific countries. At the same time, we will work to open new roads by increasing engagement with BRIC countries, as well as with growing economies in Asia and Africa.</p><p>Finally, it is also a priority to address global challenges by implementing global responses agreed upon within multilateral institutions. Peru seeks to maintain an active role in multilateral efforts to promote sustainable development with social inclusion and to combat climate change. In this light, next October we will host the annual IMF and IDB meeting, and also the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Lima, while in 2018 Peru is due to host the Summit of the Americas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has motivated Cervesur as it has invested and grown in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>After long doing business in Peru, we had to develop the skill of growing several businesses, while addressing a variety of risks. When risks are presented that are unrelated to your business, it is a sign you should be more diversified, which is one of the characteristics of Cervesur as a holding company. We have invested and diversified in cotton textiles—the entire production of the garment—which is seldom seen in the world today. This gives us strength to cope with the variations in the market. We are in several businesses that are dedicated to services. We invest in the main importer of machinery in Peru and in the main steel plant. Our policy is to try to be present in the businesses and the activities where Peru has a comparable advantage, to ultimately develop into a competitive advantage. </p><h4>Have you been concerned about the fall in mineral prices and its effect on the Peruvian economy?</h4><p><span></span>In the last decade, China has become a country that demands goods and services in foreign markets. Now, after decades, China's growth is slowing, bringing prices comparatively lower than what they were 1½ years ago. That diminishes the possibilities of growth in Peru and there is also the challenge of producing out of the advantage of having this base of growth in mineral exports. So we should excel in other products that we can produce, not only for the national market, but specifically for exports. Peru is a country that has a small national market and to attain considerable growth, it needs to export. That is what we should do in the coming years, although it will not bring us to the growth rate we achieved in the last ten years. Now, we will focus on developing the market for goods where we can be competitive.</p><h4>What role you do see for agriculture as a larger part of the Peruvian economy in the future?</h4><p><span></span>With the necessary framework, it should be one of the legs on which Peru's growth can be developed. Economies grow steadily if they have different bases of growth. The base of growth for Peru has been mineral goods and raw material, and based on that, there are some developing industries. 17% of Peru's GDP is dependent on industry and it should be 25%, but there is no industry today without technology. Investment in technology is necessary to drive any industrial venture. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the textile industry, now that international companies have moved away from Peru and are now sourcing in Central America and Asia?</h4><p><span></span>We have to differentiate the textile businesses across the entire textile business. One segment is weaving, which is something that has to do with high standards of production technology. Production of cloth, on the other hand, is the other end of the business. More sophisticated production processes with higher value are things in which Peru has skill. Our raw material is also better than other alternatives. Peru has a relatively high gross export value of cloth, whereby we produce expensive garments. We cannot compete with China on high volume, low-priced goods. </p><h4>What potential do you see for the Pacific Alliance to play a transformative role in the Peruvian economy?</h4><p><span></span>That is beginning to be seen as an alternative, specifically to arrangements like Mercosur, or any other alliances in the region. One of the advantages of this alliance is that the partners have a clear idea of a free market economy. The markets, ventures, and companies that develop in each country can compete for better conditions in a free economy setting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's your economic outlook for Peru for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We will have a better year than 2014, especially in terms of improving Peru's GDP. At the beginning of 2014, we anticipated a 6% GDP growth and we finished the year with 2.4% growth. One of the main reasons was the drop in commodity prices of traditional exports, which represent 75% of Peru's exports. However, I foresee positive trends in 2015, because 2014 was also a tough year for sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and fisheries. In the latter, we expect two peak moments in terms of exports throughout 2015. Peru faces the challenge of becoming more competitive and diversifying its economy and industry, and we also must become more dynamic with our traditional and non-traditional exports. In my opinion, GDP growth for 2015 will register around 4%. It will be difficult to reach that, but tax incentives, public expenditure, and non-traditional exports can help to reach the goal. The speed with which we implement such actions and strategies will drive our growth this year. Overall, I am optimistic for 2015 and 2016 and I anticipate rapid growth in the second half of the year, despite 2016 being an electoral year. We also need to put this in context, because 2015 is a difficult year for Latin America in general, with Brazil experiencing slow growth rates and many other countries are being hit by scandals or low oil and commodity prices. Latin America has an expected 1.3% growth for 2015. Oil and mineral prices will have an impact on the region's economy and their development. In this context, Peru is a leading regional copper exporter and in two years time, it will become a more powerful international exporter. We are a country with vast reserves of tin, silver, zinc, and gold. Each of these metals has particular behavioral trends and that has an impact on our economy. In the past couple of years, Peru has seen high levels of investment in the mining industry and this trend will continue with projects such as Tia Maria. We will soon start seeing the results of such investments already. We expect the US to have a strong economy through 2015-16, and that should drive up demand again, especially for Peruvian copper. Our challenge here is to provide the volumes needed, as well to better control the cash costs. On the other hand, energy costs in Peru are 50% lower than in Chile for example, and labor costs are 20-40% less expensive. These are two of Peru's competitive advantages. Nevertheless, our rugged geography makes transport costs higher. Overall, we have certain efficiencies and advantages, but at the same time inefficiencies based on infrastructure and transport, which need to be tackled and improved in the next two years.</p><h4>In terms of infrastructure, how would you assess the overall development of the economy?</h4><p><span></span>The Association for the Promotion of National Infrastructure has calculated the infrastructure gap in the country to be approximately $87 billion. This includes all types of infrastructure, but the main problem has to do with road infrastructure. This sector has a lot of potential and it has been labeled as a strategic sector. However, we have to be more dynamic and provide investors with more advantageous conditions. Peru should be completing infrastructure projects every year at a rate of $15 billion in order to close this gap faster. However, we need to assess the capabilities of the government and the industry, and assess the kind of bureaucracy investors will have to deal with. We need to evolve to meet our potential. For example, we need to build bridges between the public and private sectors. The development of this sector will boost other strategic sectors for the country.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Peru as an investment destination?</h4><p><span></span>The country offers macroeconomic and political stability, and it has a very favorable business environment for foreign investors. There are some things that need to be addressed such as bureaucracy and the licensing process. We need more outreach towards foreign investors too, because many only get to find out about our culture and our particularities once they are here.</p><h4>What is the potential to boost exports in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>Agriculture has huge potential. In fact, agricultural exports increased by 19% from 2013-14, reaching $5 billion. For 2015, we expect them to reach $7 billion, which is on par with Chile's 2014 output. Agriculture is attractive for foreign investors as well. Peru has vast amounts of prime agricultural land, all over the country that have the capacity to boost agribusiness. However, investors need to know how to choose. Retail and poultry are two sectors with huge potential for investment and export. Tourism also has great potential. I think we need to boost cooperation between the public and the private sectors, as the state and the private sectors should develop the national agenda and main projects for the country in collaboration with one another.</p><h4>How will the Peruvian sol perform in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>It is not easy to make a solid prediction, but I would say that the sol would continue to devalue because the US economy is growing and the dollar is getting stronger. The challenge is to strike a balance between these currencies in a way that benefits both importers and exporters. I am talking about US dollars, which play a very important role in our economy. In 2008, Peru had 52% of its economy dollarized. Today, this figure has decreased to 38% and the government wants to further reduce it to 33%. This makes our economy more attractive in the international arena. In general terms, I think the country will become stronger with the further de-dollarization of our economy, especially if we do it gradually. In my opinion, the secret for success is that changes are gradual and sensitive to economic realities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015 for Ernest &amp; Young?</h4><p><span></span>We are the leading business services company in Peru, and we are thankful for the trust of our clients. Our challenge is to continue growing and to develop knowledge in the areas in which we operate, including auditing, consultancy, taxes, and corporate finance. We develop business guides that provide technical knowledge for those who need it. We also have teaching tools and initiatives in place with workshops, round tables, and university courses. Our aim is to be close to businessmen at that moment when they need us the most. Our growth in the last few years has been three to four times the rate of growth of the Peruvian economy, which is our economic segment standard. In 2015 growth will continue at this level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What values does CONFIEP promote in the Peruvian economy?</h4><p><span></span>We promote the principles of an open and free economy. It is important to differentiate principles from interests. Usually, each union takes care of their own interests, but as an umbrella organization of all industry organizations in Peru, we try to promote more universal principles of democracy, free market economics, respect for the environment, and fair trade. </p><h4>What does this mean in terms of practical actions?</h4><p><span></span>We strongly support free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. FTAs are not only a market access issue, but have also helped labor unions obtain much better conditions in Peru, having fostered improved relations between business people, companies, and producers. The private sector, especially CONFIEP and others have played an important role in promoting FTAs and informing citizens what an FTA is and how it benefits the nation. Once public support is in place it becomes easier to proceed with negotiations. Now, 95% of all our exports are under FTAs and we export to around 195 countries.</p><h4>What are the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) for Peru?</h4><p><span></span>Around 95% of our exports are already going duty-free to 195 countries, which confirms our commitment to FTAs, and the TPP is set to become the largest commercial platform in the world. I am sure that the government is taking care of the situations we may have in the future within TPP because we already have FTAs with Canada, the US, Chile, and many other countries that were part of the TPP; there are many other countries that we were not linked to. It is important to send a message that the whole APEC should benefit from an FTA, with an open economy and open opportunities. There are always people who will oppose free trade agreements, but as I said, the important consideration is not merely market access, but the nature of our interaction with all our partners. We should ideally also move on from open markets to the free movement of people and labor, rather than goods alone. Financial integration is also an interesting issue, guaranteeing the free flow of capital. We also need to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS).</p><h4>What efforts does CONFIEP make to improve conditions for SMEs?</h4><p><span></span>In Peru, we face the challenge of shifting from an informal economy to a formal one. Unfortunately, 70% of our labor still works in informal conditions. The major challenge for Peru is be to reverse this trend, as formal workers are three times better off than their informal counterparts. If we really want to become a developed country, let's say in 20 or 30 years, then we must develop a better perception of taxation, because 30% of citizens cannot fund the entire 100%.</p><h4>How would you characterize the extent to which environmental issues are integrated into public policy in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>Despite considerable informality and the need for greater institutionalization, it is clear that one of the most pressing issues is to convince the public of broader national concepts. People often have doubts, and while environmental issues are something that developed countries take seriously, developing economies have yet to reach that stage. There are many serious efforts underway; however, people have a tendency only to remember the mistakes of state-owned companies. Some private companies have done the same. I remember when I was young and the government struck oil in the Peruvian jungle, the most published picture in the news that day was people in the middle of the jungle bathing in the jet of oil spouting from the ground. This was just 25-30 years ago. Respect for environmental issues is something that every citizen in the world should have. We still have more to do, not only in Peru, but in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It has independent and specialized functional bodies that are responsible for the investigation and resolution of cases on matters within its competence. Such as the Commission of Defense of Free Competition for the defense and promotion of competition and the Commission of Consumer Protection for consumer issues; additionally, we have offices responsible for matters related to intellectual property. In that sense, each subject is in charge of a specialized body or office, making the work of INDECOPI more efficient, because it allows progress on each of the issues in a balanced and parallel form. It must not be forgotten that all disciplines in charge of the institution have as   common ultimate goal, which is the welfare of consumers; therefore, their relationship and direct relevance is to the functioning of the economic model of social market economy. The challenge is to bring all these activities under a common denominator that is timely, independent and technical resolution of the matters in charge to give assurance to enterprises.</p><h4>Peru ranked as the second best place to do business in Latin America in the 2014 Doing Business Report. What factors in recent improvements in Peru's regional position underpin this ranking?</h4><p><span></span>An important factor that Peru is in this position in the ranking has been undoubtedly the performance of INDECOPI in strengthening the country's institutions through the exercise of its powers. Indeed, the work that has been done is important companies and for our institution in eliminating illegal and/or irrational bureaucratic barriers for market access. In this regard,  INDECOPI made an estimate for the costs of barriers unapplied in 2013 and concluded that the complainants traders would have had to assume approximately $44 million. Another important factor has been the promotion and defense of competition, which has been allowed into the Peruvian market to create a more dynamic and efficient place. Indeed, we should punish anti-competitive practices such as abuse of dominant position and agreements so that it allows more operators in the market; thus, they can compete in the quality of their products and services, which benefits citizens. It is important to note that between 2006 and 2014, INDECOPI solved a total of 79 cases by issues related to competition. In Peru, the investor has the guarantee that INDECOPI is a strong and active competition agency, which actions are technical and independent. That contributes to rank the country as the second best place to do business in Latin America</p><h4>What are INDECOPI's plans for the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>In recent years, INDECOPI has implemented a series of improvements that have strengthened the capacity of the institution in the administrative aspect and functionally. For example, we have opened offices in all the regions of the country and have strengthened the capacities of the functional bodies to perform better and more investigations. This is reflected in the results obtained regarding the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and initiating investigations of anticompetitive conducts, it also result from further competition advocacy and the activation of the leniency program as an important key to detecting cartels. However, we aim to further strengthen our capabilities to better serve businesses and citizens in general. To do this, we plan to implement technological tools to improve internal processes and thus serve users more efficiently. We are also presenting a series of legislative proposals to strengthen the powers of INDECOPI, including the proposal to improve the defense of free competition system, which is looking to enhance research capacity and the time frame to solve cases, as well as improve the bankruptcy system. It is important for companies to exit the market in an orderly manner. In addition, in the field of intellectual property, we are presenting a proposal to strengthen the protection of biodiversity and collective knowledge of indigenous communities of our country, which represents a major source of business. Finally, considering the importance of INDECOPI for the economy, we expect in the coming years propose a series of public policy related to matters of our competitors that can serve as a road for action by our institution and to harmonize the needs and objectives of each of the actors operating in the market: the State, businesses and citizens in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Association transformed itself into an essentially public organization?</h4><p><span></span>The AMOF-PNP was established on November 5th, 1992 as a Mutual Association, a company to provide benefits and services to the officers of the National Police of Peru (PNP), who are civil servants. The Association, however, develops itself in the private sector, i.e. no public entity of the Government is involved in management activities, and we are governed by our own statute and regulations. Today, we are comprised of more than 9,500 Official PNP associates and considering that the police in our country has about 100,000 troops, this means that about 10% are associates. Financially, the Association is based on the monthly contribution of its Associates - equivalent to 3.5% of the salary of Alféreces; so contributions are dynamic, the higher the salary, the higher the contributions. Now the monthly contribution amounts to $22. Over the past decade, our heritage has grown from about $4.3 million to about $25.2 million. At the beginning, income came from the contributions of associates and then we expanded that as we ventured into other business segments within the real estate sector, particularly real estate surpassing significantly the profitability of contributions from associates. This new business unit in the real estate sector (renting of PRIME offices to top companies) has allowed us to capitalize the company, accelerate the growth-development, and strengthen the Associated Pension Fund.</p><h4>What kind of benefits does the AMOF-PNP offer to its associates?</h4><p><span></span>Among the benefits the association offers, the principal is the Mutual Benefit for Retirement (BMR) and occurs when the state makes Renewal of Troops and Associated Pensioners move into retirement. AMOF-PNP gives the Mutual Benefit for Retirement plus the profitability generated during the time the officer was on active duty. The responsibility of the government is to make profitable the Contributions Fund during that period. In this sense, we have developed and marketed real estate projects. We also provide Mutual Benefit for Death (BMF) and the Mutual Benefit for Disability (BMI) to officers and/or family, meaning that it works as a family insurance at low cost (deaths of associate, spouse, children, parents and disability of the associate). In addition, we grant associative loans, taking as collateral the amount accumulated by the Associate Contributions.</p><h4>How has AMOF-PNP involved itself in the real estate sector?</h4><p><span></span>We have developed four real estate projects intended to associates and the general public, what actually enhanced profitability. The fifth project is the Premium AMOF-PNP Business Center, which has an approximate floor area of over 10,000sqm, on a 1,050sqm area. To date we have invested more than $10.75 million in this building, expected income will allow us to pay the debt acquired with Banco Scotiabank in Peru for construction and increasing and improving benefits and services for our Associates. With the development of real estate projects, we gained knowledge and experience in this sector, and we now have premium office in the heart of the upscale district of Miraflores. This allows us to obtain high rental return of the same, between 15-16%, because the value of land in the area has increased from $1,800 per sqm when we acquired it to $5,000 per sqm. We did not have to resort to extraordinary contribution quotas from associates.</p><h4>Does the Association have international partnerships?</h4><p><span></span>We have created the International Institute for Research and Development against Organized Crime (IRDAOC), an NGO aimed to harness the knowledge and professional experience of the police in several countries. As technology advances, the crime does as well, and this NGO aims to strengthen the powers of the associates through academic events such as courses, seminars, and forums, among others. With our new offices in the Premium AMOF-PNP Business Center, we will go ahead with this project and achieve the goals we set for ourselves four years ago in its creation. Part of the project is to strengthen international cooperation and technical assistance in support of the institutions involved in the fight against organized crime. There will be an exchange of experiences and knowledge, which will strengthen the position of the police not only in Peru but also internationally. For example, a few years ago, the UN proposed a new approach to address insecurity and combat violent crime, called: Human Security. We must train cadres, a “critical mass" that would contribute to enhance, optimize, and maximize this new approach, considering that the most important thing that each company has is its human capital.</p><h4>What is your vision for the growth of AMOF-PNP over the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>Being the leading institution of its kind, quality standards and excellence in the provision of benefits and services that provide added value, and meeting the needs and expectations of associates and their families. In this context, we face several challenges, and one of these is to consolidate our corporate identity, and to consolidate our projects and generate revenue to work with more financial leverage. We are evaluating opening new business lines such as clinics for PNP Officers. We are also venturing into the stock market with our promissory notes for up to $3.07 million to transform these into commercial paper notes that can be traded publicly on the stock exchange in order to obtain new credit lines and meet the demand for loans to associates. We also aim to maintain the system certification on quality management ISO 9001: 2008, because since 2009 we have 10 audited and certified processes. Once we start working in our new facility, the goal is to expand the current scope and certify the maximum number of processes possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru's GDP growth slowed to 2.4% in 2014, the lowest since the financial crisis. What fiscal measures can the government use to stimulate growth over the coming year?</h4><p><span></span>The current market and multilateral agency forecasts predict that Peru will lead growth among the LA6 economies (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) in 2015, amid challenging international headwinds. According to the April 2015 survey by Consensus Forecasts, Peru accelerated from 2.4% in 2014 to 3.7%, followed by Chile (from 1.8% in 2014 to 2.8 %), and Mexico (from 2.1% in 2014 to 2.9%). Colombia decelerated from 4.6% in 2014 to 3.4%. We expect that primary GDP will contribute with 1.2 percentage points to economic growth in 2015, while fiscal policy will contribute 1 percentage point. Peru is using various tools to stimulate aggregate demand, such as an expansionary 2015 Public Budget, tax reduction for firms and households of 0.7% of GDP, Public Financial Management (PFM) measures to flatten the learning curve of incoming subnational authorities in order to accelerate public spending at a subnational level, and easing the pass-through from international oil price reduction to domestic prices. The country will also increase the amount of resources allocated for public infrastructure maintenance in subnational governments to 0.2% of GDP, and issue sovereign bonds to finance prioritized public investment projects and other additional measures to increase public spending. The government has recently proposed measures to boost private consumption with a potential economic impact of 0.7% of GDP, and temporary exemption on social security and pension contributions for salaries. The temporary availability of a fraction of the Unemployment Insurance Deposits Surplus (CTS) extension of measures on fuel price stabilization frameworks will also help, in addition to a price range system for selected agricultural imports, which has already been approved by Supreme Decree.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to encourage economic diversification and reduce dependence on commodities?</h4><p><span></span>The IMF has cut its GDP growth forecast for 2015 for the world and much harder for EM, with the biggest revisions made for Latin America and the Caribbean from 2.2% in October 2014 to 0.9% in April 2015. Peru has considerable mineral reserves and commodity potential, and is one of the leading countries for mining in the world. In Latin America, it is the number one gold producer and the second copper producer. The sector accounts for 12% of GDP and represents 55% of total exports. Despite the current metal price shock, the mining sector will remain one of the key engines of the Peruvian economy, while the introduction of new projects such as Toromocho, Constancia, and Las Bambas, as well as extensions such as Cerro Verde will bring more production and new investment opportunities. To reduce the dependence on mining for fiscal revenue, the Peruvian Government has been working to broaden the tax base and increase the number of taxpayers and offset the fall in metal prices since 2011. In addition, the new macro fiscal framework is separating public spending from the volatility of commodity prices. The influence of resource-related revenues in the planning of public spending was lowered through this new macro fiscal framework. With this new institutional framework, fiscal policy is in line with international best practices for commodity-exporting open economies. In Peru, the process of industrialization continues beyond the extractive industries. For example, in the non-traditional sector, between 2000 and 2014 the number of products exported at a value of at least $10 million has increased fourfold from 35 to 144 products. In the same period, the chemical industry recorded a fivefold increase in the export of medicines, perfumery, and personal care products. In addition, between 2002 and 2013 the number of destination countries increased from 145 to 174, and the number of exporting companies increased from 4,513 to 7,782. Finally, over the past decade, the total contribution of productivity to potential GDP growth was 2.4 percentage points.</p><h4>Peru has been praised in recent years for its pro-business reforms. What do you see as the next steps in this regard, and what longer-term reforms are necessary?</h4><p><span></span>We are aiming to standardize the tax system to OECD averages and reduce excessive tax related costs, streamline procedures and eliminate obstacles and other “transaction costs" for the investor, to boost investment, productivity, and employment, and to increase predictability regarding regulatory costs. Also, Peru's accession to the OECD will serve as a trigger for structural reforms. Peru is already part of the OECD's Country Program. The OECD established Country Programs as a new instrument for supporting dynamic, emerging economies in designing their reforms and strengthening public policy. In November 2014, the OECD's Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved Peru's Country Program 2015-2016. The working areas of the program include barriers to economic growth and development, public governance, and the improvement of the institutional environment, strengthening transparency and fighting corruption, and fostering human capital and higher productivity.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to encourage SMEs to integrate into the formal financial system?</h4><p><span></span>Peru recognizes the importance of SMEs in the growth and economic dynamics of the country. In this regard, the various policies aim to minimize the asymmetries and distortions in the market with regard to access to financing and the resolution and mitigation of information problems and transaction costs, among others. The main measures include strengthening of the Alternative Securities Market, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) fund.</p><p><span></span>The Alternative Securities Market has also been strengthened, and in June 2013 the regulatory framework was improved with the passing of a law to promote the entry of new issuers and improved market efficiency, which has enabled companies to access longer and medium term funding at lower costs. It should be noted that this market targets small and medium enterprises with the ability to issue debt or equity capital in the capital market, with lower costs and fewer requirements than larger companies.</p><h4>Peru is cited as having an infrastructure gap of between $30-80 billion. What role can fiscal policy play in accelerating infrastructure development?</h4><p><span></span>Peru is actually working to boost investment to reduce the infrastructure gap through the increased use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects, subject to an ex-ante evaluation of underlying fiscal risks, the strengthening of inter-institutional governance for investment, and unlocking of infrastructure projects delayed by red tape and permits. The Ministry of Economy and Finance together with Proinversión have established mechanisms for technical assistance to public entities. The Ministry has control over the fiscal implications of every PPP contract. Additionally, the definition of PPPs has been expanded to other services related to public services and infrastructure, as well as to projects in the field of applied research and technological innovation. There is also a better definition of the term “cofinancing," which today refers to any use of public resources and involves the operation phase of the project. Today, investors have the opportunity to submit what we call “Co-financed Unsolicited Proposals" during the first 45 days of each calendar year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Chile's position on the convergence of Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance (PA) trading communities? What are the next practical steps for maximizing the process?</h4><p><span></span>In the process of regional integration in Latin America, Chile has emphasized "convergence in diversity." Today's world is more complex, and cooperation and integration are unavoidable if progress is to result by successfully addressing the challenges of the global economy. Therefore, Chile will encourage the exchange of ideas between the PA and Mercosur. A specific step in this proposal of convergence was the realization of the “Dialogue on Regional Integration: Pacific Alliance and Mercosur“ seminar, held in Santiago in November 2014. The next step was to prepare a plan of action for the PA and Mercosur around a common agenda.</p><h4>What is Chile's comparative regional advantage in its relations with the PA?</h4><p><span></span>The PA represents an opportunity to enhance the exchange and economic development of the countries located along the Pacific. In that space, our contribution is manifold. Chile has an extensive network of trade partners, having generated 24 agreements covering 63 markets. This network is enhanced by the PA and in turn serves to boost member countries. The globalization of the Chilean economy is undoubtedly attractive to our partners. For example, accumulation of origin in the Pacific Alliance will allow Chile to facilitate linkages and productive diversity, improving the position of our region in global value chains. In addition, Chile is an active participant in organizations such as the OECD, where it is recognized for working on good practices and international standards for public policies, and APEC, a regional technical cooperation platform with more than a three-decade relationship with Pacific Rim economies.</p><h4>The Pacific Alliance has emerged as one of the region's most promising unions. How do you plan to expand Chile's contribution to the Alliance and its ability to work with neighboring Peru to grow the region's exports? </h4><p><span></span>Chile will continue to work on strengthening the Pacific Alliance through the main features of this mechanism of regional integration, which are the high degree of flexibility and pragmatism. From convergences between the four countries, Chile will look to achieve achievements covering issues that go beyond the purely commercial sphere and nonetheless have clear commercial purposes. Likewise, we are working to strengthen technical cooperation with the 32 observer states by developing projects related to the pillars of the PA (free movement of persons, goods, services and investment, and cooperation); and looking to link these projects to the 18 existing technical groups, including the newly established Education and Mining Development. Regarding working with Peru, longtime we're advancing in the deepening of intraregional trade, first through bilateral trade agreement and then, in the initiatives of the Pacific Alliance and TPP. This will encourage the regional trade and generate greater opportunities for our investors.</p><h4>TBY recently spoke with Gonzalo Alfonso Gutiérrez Reinel, Peru's minister of Foreign Affairs. He expressed a desire to forge closer ties with Asia. Trade with Asia is one of the Pacific Alliance's major goals; how is Chile working to liberalize trade and open new markets to Chilean and regional exports?</h4><p><span></span>Chile works to strengthen trade and open new markets and regional exports through different areas: FTAs bilateral negotiation; participation in the multilateral system via the World Trade Organization; and our incorporation in plurilateral negotiations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Economic Strategic Agreement (TPP) and the Pacific Alliance. Additionally, Chile favors that within the disciplines negotiated in AP and TPP, ones that go beyond those traditionally addressed in trade agreements, such as competitiveness, regulatory coherence, development issues, trade facilitation, customs cooperation and export window, SME, among others, are included.</p><h4>Chilean investors have made strong investments throughout the Peruvian economy in 2014, and continue to drive domestic growth. What is the future of Chilean foreign investment in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>The growth projections of the Peruvian economy are auspicious, allowing anticipate new opportunities for our investments in that country. Since 2000, direct Chilean investments in Peru have shown a significant increase. Thus, in December 2014, according to figures in process, it totalizes more than $15,800 million. Regarding the investment areas, the opportunities that the Peruvian market offers the services sector, in areas such as construction, architecture, engineering, mining, software and information technology can be highlighted.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you provide an overview of growth by segments over the past year?</h4><p>Telefonica performed incredibly well in 2014 with healthy growth in all areas, and in the mobile sector we grew by double digits. In the post-paid segment we had 8% growth, and 12% in revenues. In fixed operations, it was also a very good year. Our client base was steady, at around 3%, which is impressive for fixed lines, and our revenues grew by 4% in that business line. Our BDA was 10% higher than the previous year. Meanwhile, 2015 is starting out well. It is almost six months in, and we are still growing in pre-paid, post pay, and all the areas not just mobile.</p><h4>How much of the growth in the mobile business would you say stems from the $350 million you earned in 2013?</h4><p>Contributions from past earnings remain low, because they are mostly being reinvested in 4G. This coverage is growing, but it is still a small part of our business, relevant to other operators. What is important for us is that the data sector is growing the most. Our investment is responsible for 15-20% of our growth, but data is responsible for at least 40-45%.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to become the operator of choice in Colombia?</h4><p>Our recent merger was a success. Right now, we are the first fully integrated operator. This is important, but our ultimate goal is to become a digital telecommunications company, and the first to deliver this growing service to both the consumer and corporate segments. It is also important for us to have digital convergence, and to be part of the digital life of our customers.</p><h4>How important have your 4G investments been for Telefonica's innovation agenda in Colombia?</h4><p>4G is probably the most important part of our innovation, and we work in delivering special services. Telefonica works with a special team in security and health, and works vertically with the latter of the two in Colombia. The company wants to be the first digital telecoms provider, which means being central to the digital life of our customers. In this regard, we are working with specialists in those areas to provide services from end to end, especially in security and health. Perhaps three years ago, we started to invest in security on all levels, from connectivity to hacking. In any telecommunications company, you have the traditional services, which are 60-70% of the current revenue. But for us, around 30% of revenues are coming from the digital services like security, health and insurance, and other such areas.</p><h4>What are the greatest challenges and opportunities of the new digital environment?</h4><p>The main challenge in our market is the major players, but the good thing is that there are numerous operators. There are at least six to seven operators taking into account Virgin and other companies. Having numerous options is conducive to innovation, but with the major operator, it is a challenge for the regulator to ensure market fairness. Right now we have a less dominated field, and our interest lies in data services concentration because it approximates voice concentration. If there is only one device for voice and data, it is likely that customers will have the same operator for both. The concentration in voice is evolving quickly towards data, which is a major concern for the market, and the regulators.</p><h4>What are the main objectives and expectations for the group for the next year?</h4><p>We have to cover many areas. The first is to keep growing our post paid and pre-paid services; here we expect to grow both in revenues and in customer base. Of course in the broadband areas we have room to grow, especially in intermediate cities. We started 2015 on increased growth. We have to develop strategies that make data the main driver of our revenues, which is what we are doing today. Mobile data will be the key in terms of future growth over the next two to three years. We need to create the foundation today to grow soundly tomorrow. We want to take full advantage of the 4G network that we are deploying nationwide. We are going to be present in over 250 municipalities of Colombia. It will change everything because once you have delivered broadband to those towns you can provide a diversity of services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru is one of South America's top economic performers. How do you attract foreign investment?</h4><p><span></span>Foreign and domestic investment have been some of the main factors behind growth since the early 1990s. The Peruvian economy has been improving since the early 1990s, when economic reforms began to take effect. At that time we embarked on a process to attract foreign investment, outlining the main rules regarding the treatment of foreign investments. Foreign investors are treated in the same way as Peruvian investors, so this attraction of foreign investment began with the privatization process in Peru, when we opened several sectors such as mining, financing, power generation and distribution, and many other sectors that were previously only in the hands of nationals, or even in the hands of the state. This process was improved during the 2000s, when Peru decided to promote the participation of private investment in infrastructure and public services through PPPs. The Peruvian Investment Policy was consolidated by the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements (FTA). The first FTA that Peru concluded was with the US, and with this agreement we just consolidated the open policy for foreign investment and we turned to a stable and predictable policy for foreign investors. The investment chapter of the US-Peru FTA formed the basis of the subsequent 16 additional FTAs that we have negotiated and which are already being enforced. The main reason behind the expansion of foreign investment in Peru is the stability of economic policy and of our investment laws.</p><h4>Over the past two years alone, both Moody's and Dow Jones have upgraded Peru's credit rating. What new investments are on the horizon?</h4><p><span></span>In recent months we have experienced a slowdown in the economy. In the coming year there will be several important mining projects and some significant infrastructure projects that will also begin the construction phase. Regarding infrastructure, there is an irrigation project being undertaken in the North, a second line of the Lima metro, and a gas pipeline in the southern part of Peru. Regional airports around the country will also be renovated and expanded, probably in the third quarter of the coming year. Two thermal power plants in the south of the country will really expand the dynamics of the economy. We expect a GDP growth rate of about 5.5-6.3% over the coming years, partly due to these projects.</p><h4>Do you think that in the long-term prices need to return to their former levels in order for Peru to continue growing as before? Can infrastructure fill that gap?</h4><p><span></span>Infrastructure is the foundation of the nation's productive potential. In the future, Peru will not depend as much on the price levels of minerals. A major goal is to diversify the export base and one of the most important areas is agribusiness. The irrigation project of Chavimochic in the northern coastal region of the country will incorporate around 60,000ha of new land for agribusiness. Together with that, in the southern part of the country, there will be a further 35,000ha of land also incorporated through another irrigation project. The gas pipeline being constructed in the southern part of the country will bring gas to two power plant projects that have already been awarded and will provide energy for the development of important mining projects in that zone. In addition, natural gas may also allow for the development of petrochemicals.</p><h4>Over the coming years Peru is expected to regain its growth rate, at least to some degree. How will Proinversión continue to encourage investors to come to Peru and stay here for the long-term?</h4><p><span></span>We have a particularly stable economic policy that we will continue pursuing. Clear rules allow you for the planning of your business. Something that has helped us hugely is the way we have consolidated all the policies in our FTAs, and have a wide range of investment opportunities, not only in mining, but in food production, tourism, and now petrochemicals. We will probably also talk about forestry in the coming years to promote Peru an export platform, the country is working to be a regional hub to connect the South American region with the Asia Pacific economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[At a Crossroads]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[at-a-crossroads]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Latin America stands at an important crossroads. After a remarkable two decades of economic, political, and social renewal, the region today faces an extended slowdown in a global setting of mediocre growth. The immense potential of this diverse region has become tangible, but so too have the formidable challenges that lie before it, which is why the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in Lima later this year occur at an important moment.</p><p><span></span>The representatives of the IMF's 188 member nations traveling to Lima are well aware of the issues facing Latin America. Among the most pressing is the need to develop new growth drivers now that the boom in global commodity markets has receded. This challenge can and will be met. But selecting the right path to renewed growth and prosperity requires a harnessing of the collective will and creativity of the people, and of the policymakers who serve them.</p><p><span></span>At this critical juncture, it is therefore more important than ever to foster growth that is inclusive, balanced, and sustainable.</p><p><span></span>After decades of stagnation, Latin America's middle class has been growing in size and confidence, expanding by about 50% since 2003. Much of this can be attributed to a reduction in income inequality, through, among other means, rising minimum wages.</p><p><span></span>Unfortunately, despite this progress social indicators remain weaker and inequality higher than in comparable regions. And so with growth in the region slowing for a fifth consecutive year, there is a risk of losing some of the social gains achieved in recent years.</p><p><span></span>For example, the rising expectations of Latin America's middle class are bumping up against shortcomings in the provision of public services. While specific concerns may vary across countries, surveys show that many people share a general discontent over corruption and poor government accountability.</p><p><span></span>This is a loud and clear call for action, and many governments in the region are working hard to improve public services. They have launched initiatives to increase the quality and reach of public education, broaden the system of social protection, and expand equitably the public revenue base. All this and more is needed to create a more inclusive and stronger society.</p><p><span></span>Moreover, many countries need to significantly improve their infrastructure networks. High logistics and freight costs hinder Latin America's integration into global value chains. This underscores the need for more investment and greater regional collaboration in energy, transportation, and IT, in order to raise the economic prospects of the region.</p><p><span></span>And given the current challenges, Latin America certainly needs to increase economic and financial integration to lift the potential growth of the entire region.</p><p><span></span>This would boost regional trade, but there are a host of other issues that could also benefit from a greater willingness to reach across borders and to learn from each other. This is what we hope the October meetings will bring. Policymakers could cooperate more on topics such as labor, security, energy, the environment, and competition, to name a few.</p><p><span></span>The idea of cooperation and multilateralism is, of course, at the heart of the IMF's work. The fund was set up 70 years ago to help its members prevent economic and financial crises and to provide badly needed financing should they occur. The fund is also helping low-income and transitional countries gain a foothold in the global economy, and is working behind the scenes to build capacity and resilience through technical assistance. And we are always striving to provide timely and well-tailored policy advice and technical assistance to our members in this region.</p><p><span></span>The Lima Annual Meetings will provide a forum for global policymakers to speak with each other about such critical issues. They provide an opportunity of finding a strong and compelling voice to inspire the people of Latin America, and help unlock the potential of this immensely rich and diverse region. We at the IMF are looking forward to hosting and participating in this discussion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core factors behind the establishment of the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion?</h4><p><span></span>We focus on five main areas; child nutrition, early child development, integral child and teenager development, economic inclusion, and protection of senior citizens. Effectively, these pillars cover the entire cycle of life. One of the keys of our success resides on the synergies between ministries to make sure we efficiently impact on people's lives, making sure all parties contribute to achieving this nationwide goal. One clear example of this is school meals, which we changed toward a more approachable strategy based on providing improved food to all public schools based on what is currently in the market, rather than what had been determined as the staple for such meals. The program is Qali Warma and reaches more than three million children nationwide. We started from the rural parts of the country, expanding to the main cities. We expect to reach 3.6 million children in the near future, which would mean all public school pupils in Peru. At the same time, our government has managed to reduce extreme poverty; when we took office extreme poverty was at 6.3% of the population, but by 2014 had dropped to 4.3%. According to the World Bank, when a country reaches 3% of extreme poverty, it is considered to be eradicated. We have in place two programs to combat extreme poverty; “Together," based on conditioned monetary transfers, and “Pension 65," targeting retired people in extreme poverty. We transfer $61.95 and $76.82, respectively, every two months. In general terms, in 2011, when we assumed office, poverty rates were at 27.8%, while today it has declined to 22.7%. Furthermore, chronic malnutrition among children was at 19.5% in 2011, whereas it now stands at 14.6% and our goal is to further reduce this figure to 10%. We also consider it essential for all Peruvian households to have the basic amenities of water, drainage, electricity, energy, and telephony. We have improved indicators in these fields, too; the national average access to these services was at 60.5% of Peruvian households, whereas now we are at 66.3%. </p><h4>What does the Ministry do to make sure people moving out of extreme poverty have economic opportunities beyond social assistance?</h4><p><span></span>Another of the programs we have in place to fight poverty is Haku Wiñay, which is based in the generation of economic opportunities. For example, families in extreme poverty are given a piece of land to enable self-sufficiency. We also provide them with training on farming and irrigation techniques, how to use fertilizer, and more, so they can become efficient at producing agricultural goods, creating a production surplus for sale. This enables families to first have regular income and subsequently, a permanent one. This is a crucial element to ensure that families rise out of poverty sustainably.</p><h4>What role does the private sector play in the Ministry's efforts to close social gaps?</h4><p><span></span>All economic sectors play an important role in our efforts to reduce poverty and promote social integration. For example, the private sector plays a key role in the Qali Warma program. We buy food in the market and this program has an annual impact in the national economy equal to $430 million. We also have the Cuna Mas project, addressing children up to three years of age, which sources food from the private sector. These two programs have a huge impact on the national economy in terms of enabling greater production by local producers for an annual amount of around $123 million. We have also boosted the purchase of healthy food, opening an entire new market in the country. This is a great opportunity for the private sector, including foreign investment. The private sector and foreign investment also have an opportunity in terms of contributing to closing social gaps in society; sanitation, drinking water, electrical energy, and so on are all areas that can be invested in. We need to highlight this as Peru has a very varied geography and we need to reach rural areas. The private sector also plays a key role in the financial integration process.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would be Costa Rica's competitive advantage in its contribution to the Pacific Alliance and how would it benefit from becoming a member?</h4><p>Regional economic integration is an essential element for our countries to progress towards greater economic and social development and better quality of life. In this framework, the Pacific Alliance should be seen as an alternative to propel growth and development, based on increasing the competitiveness of the economies concerned, and a deep integration that transcends the purely commercial aspect. This initiative offers the opportunity to establish strategic partnerships that favor the development of investments, increase real and effective competition, improve productivity and the competitiveness of goods and services, and facilitate commerce between countries, fostering better integration with other regions. Costa Rica has closely followed the Pacific Alliance as it gradually approached the initiative. As with other member countries of the Pacific Alliance, our country offers a pro-business investment environment that we continue to work on in order to improve and strengthen. We coincide in our end goal of promoting a deeper regional integration in order to achieve greater growth and to promote greater closeness to other regions, particularly Asia Pacific.</p><h4><span></span>In 2013, the free trade agreement between Peru and Costa Rica came into effect. The treaty reduced and eliminated tariffs on specific products such as precious metals and chocolate. How has this agreement benefited both economies until now?</h4><p><span></span>The treaty with Peru came into effect not that long ago, and so it is early to make a concrete analysis of its results. However, recent commercial and investment figures confirm that there is a growing tendency toward consolidating in regards to commerce with Peru. The commercial exchange between Costa Rica and Peru has maintained a growing tendency for the past decade. It went from $20.4 million in 2003 to $60.1 million in 2013, registering an average annual growth of 18.9%. Prepared foods, medicines, paper or cardboard for recycling, caps and plugs, covers for metal containers, tires, rigid tubes of vinyl chloride polymers, homogenized preparations, joints or gaskets of vulcanized rubber, machinery for cleaning, classifying and grading seeds or other similar products are amongst the main export products from Costa Rica to Peru. The number of Costa Rican companies exporting to Peru rose from 42 in 2009 to 70 in 2014. With regard to direct foreign investment, the period between 2007 and 2013 reached a cumulative amount of $42.7 million. In 2013, the real estate sector concentrated the total investment coming from Peru, with a sum of $5.5 million.</p><h4>What could countries learn from Costa Rica's industrial reconversion program that would help encourage exports through free trade zones?</h4><p><span></span>Free zones are a great appeal for those who wish to invest in our country. This system offers a series of fiscal benefits and competitive advantages that characterize our country: the talent and value of our workers, political stability and a strategic location. The attraction of direct foreign investment is associated to the promotion and diversification of exports, the search for improving and refining products manufactured in the country. The government offers benefits and incentives to companies and investors that are interested in settling in the country as long as they comply with the requisites and obligations outlined in Law 7210.</p><h4>Costa Rica will celebrate its third summit of the CELAC at the end of January. How has the organization helped to foster links between countries in the region?</h4><p><span></span>During the year that Costa Rica had the temporary presidency, we managed to agree on 50 declarations during the last semester. We also had a very productive leadership. We established effective mechanisms for dialogue in the region and with the region's partners, for example our meeting with China. During the summit, the commitment to implement the food security plan was consolidated in order to eradicate famine by 2025 and a plan to end illiteracy in the country was generated. Working together in these processes will be the key to success. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC)'s voice has to be heard and valued in the international arena, contributing new experiences to influence fresh results. What is at stake concerns us all. It is about the development agenda that will guide humanity till 2030. CELAC's value is in its provision of a medium for dialog and the influence that we manage to have in our political integration and in the ability to conciliate positions in diverse and necessary matters such as the environment, human rights and nuclear weapons. In maintaining these scenarios and in working together lies our vision for our continent's future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you begin your term as Minister, what do you see as the key challenges confronting Peru in terms of foreign policy priorities?</h4><p>During the most recent Summit of the Americas, held last April in Panama, President Humala underlined the two key challenges the region faces. He highlighted the crucial importance of reducing social and economic inequalities. We must address those gaps to strengthen the social fabric of our nations. Our foreign policy must respond by contributing to spur economic growth focused on social inclusion and poverty-reduction. Achieving said goal requires modern partnerships abroad aimed at improving Peru's public services, human capital, job market, and productivity, by increasing trade, foreign investment, and international cooperation.</p><p><span></span>President Humala also stressed the need to adopt—by consensus—concrete steps to mitigate climate change, a major global challenge that already affects Peru and other Latin-American countries. Peru's firm commitment to this issue was clearly demonstrated while conducting negotiations at the COP20 meeting held in Lima last December, which led to adoption of the Lima Call for Climate Change, a major step forward heading to the 2015 agreement. We hope to sign a comprehensive and effective multilateral agreement this year when we conclude the COP21 meeting at Paris.</p><p><span></span>What are the next steps in deepening Peru's integration with Pacific Alliance countries, and what economic and political benefits will this bring to Peru?</p><p><span></span>The benefits brought by the Pacific Alliance are already being enjoyed by our citizens. Nearly 92% of our trade today has tariff-free status. We also have a joint stock-market agreement in place that allows free share trading among its members. And meanwhile, Mexico's recent inclusion to the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) will make the Pacific Alliance stock exchange market the largest one in Latin America. Likewise, several innovating cooperation projects have been launched, including a scientific web to tackle climate change and an exchange program for voluntary work by youth organizations. </p><p><span></span>The Alliance aims at deepening integration by increasingly including new actors and fields in the joint effort. We are convinced that integration has to be an ongoing inclusive process. For instance, this year we have held meetings to promote commercial exchange by SMEs, which today only account for 5% of our trade. We intend to continue promoting exports by including suggestions made by the business sector in our policies. The full entry of our trade agreement into force will boost intra-regional trade to integrate production lines and produce more intermediate and final goods by the Alliance as a unit.</p><p><span></span>Peru will chair the Alliance starting in July. Peru intends to give priority to strengthening our institutional framework, deepening the integration process, and expanding decisively our relations with the Asia-Pacific region. We expect to see the Alliance's framework agreement come into full force under our chairmanship. We will also review the progress of our integration process and establish new goals, and we will work closer with observer states—which amount to 32 today and will soon expand to 39—as well as with international institutions.</p><h4>At the COP20, President Humala and his Pacific Alliance counterparts presents a Declaration Against Climate Change. What steps can Peru take to ensure that the fight against climate change is integrated into its foreign policy priorities?</h4><p><span></span>Peru remains at the forefront of the multilateral process working closely with France to ensure success for COP21. We are focused now in defining the key elements to be included in the final draft of the text to be approved in Paris. At the regional level, Peru is seeking to find common positions on financing and adaptation measures within the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Pacific Alliance. Bilaterally, Peru is establishing joint programs aimed at conservation and management of its biodiversity, and also at enhancing national capacities to combat climate change.</p><p><span></span>Peru announced its contribution to the Green Climate Fund last December at the COP20. We are now preparing our national contribution. A national commission is preparing a proposal based on five areas identified as those with larger climate change mitigation potential: forests, agriculture, transport, industrial processes, and solid waste management. Well-funded and scaled-up financing, technology, and capacity building from developed countries and the world's largest economies are vital to enabling the developing world to move ahead in cutting-down greenhouse gas emissions, while building strong economies for the well-being of future generations</p><h4>What makes Peru a favorable destination for international investment?</h4><p><span></span>Foreign investment has been a cornerstone of Peru's strong economic performance for over two decades. A combination of stable rules, political stability, fiscal responsibility, and sound policies attracts major foreign investments in diverse fields of Peru's economy, including mining, energy, utilities, retail, and agriculture.</p><p><span></span>Our regulatory system rests on non-discriminatory treatment for foreign and national investors. Foreign firms can invest in all economic activities and have unrestricted access to national and international financial sources. Access to international dispute-settling institutions is also guaranteed. This ample set of favorable business conditions remains unchanged and provides a suitable environment to welcome international investment.</p><p><span></span>Currently, PPPs offer new opportunities for investing in infrastructure, transport, and communications. We believe that working together with transnational enterprises is an effective way to increase the use of scientific and technological knowledge in Peru's economy, and to strengthen our competitiveness.</p><h4>What are the key foreign policy priorities you plan to pursue during your tenure as Minister?</h4><p><span></span>Persistent efforts to maintain cooperation and integration flows with neighboring countries are of utmost importance to improve the livelihood of our citizens. Likewise, regional integration is an essential foreign policy guideline in playing a significant role in the world economy. Nurturing our strategic associations with the US, the EU, and China, as well as with other international powers, is also a major priority. We underscore the need to focus cooperation with said countries on increasing human capital and the use of science and technology in our production lines.</p><p><span></span>The Pacific Alliance reflects the high priority we grant both to deepening regional integration and to bolstering relations with the Asia-Pacific region. Peru hosts the 2016 APEC Summit to strengthen ties with the US and Asian-Pacific countries. At the same time, we will work to open new roads by increasing engagement with BRIC countries, as well as with growing economies in Asia and Africa</p><p><span></span>Finally, it is also a priority to address global challenges by implementing global responses agreed upon within multilateral institutions. Peru seeks to maintain an active role in multilateral efforts to promote sustainable development with social inclusion and to combat climate change. In this light, next October we will host the annual IMF and IDB meeting, and also the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Lima, while in 2018 Peru is due to host the Summit of the Americas.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the primary tasks undertaken by UNASUR?</h4><p><span></span>Ours is a young organization that brings together all political players of the region and streamlining the projects taking place. Among the most important projects we handle is the convergence of all regional projects taking place, including Mercosur, the Pacific Alliance, and ALBA countries, among others.</p><h4>What are the main differences between the construction processes of the EU and UNASUR?</h4><p><span></span>We start off from a different point of view; as a region, we have a common language and history, as well as a similar geography and conditions. We are the fourth largest economy in the world and we started building this on the common regional identity the countries in the region display. We have common regional projects within the infrastructure, connectivity, and institutionalization fields, among others.</p><h4>The Banco del Sur aims to become the main financial institution in the region. At what stage of development is the bank today?</h4><p><span></span>One of our main objectives is to financially strengthen the region through several tools such as the Andean Development Corporation, the Latin-American Reserve Fund, the Mercosur Infrastructure Fund, and the Southern Bank. This project has developed at a slow pace, but has already established its directory. I believe it will play a key role in leveraging the resources of the region. We also have several alliances with other international finance organizations. Our aim is to co-finance infrastructure projects in the region. UNASUR has a list of 32 priority infrastructure projects, of which we will co-finance seven. The main feature of these projects is that they involve at least three countries. For example, there is the highway from Caracas to Buenaventura through Bogotá and the railway connection from Southern Chile to the central railway corridor in Bolivia. Our other priority in the social field is inclusion, and in the political sphere it is social participation in political processes, while in the economic arena our priority is to create regional value chains . We are a region sharing the benefits of our land—oil, gas, agriculture, and so forth. To begin adding value to our resources we have several infrastructure and connectivity projects such as a common fiber optic network that will have a submarine connection with Europe. This project will be completed within five years. We also work on competitiveness through the use of cutting edge technologies.</p><h4>How would you assess the new defense policies that UNASUR is keen to implement in the region through this school?</h4><p><span></span>In April 2015 we established the South-American Defense School, which aims to achieve a higher level of regional security. We work towards common security and defense policies regarding several risks as climate change and in order to promote sustainability, and biodiversity, as while we are a wealthy region, we also stand to suffer considerably from such threats. The curriculum is also concerned with civil security. The school is the best example of the regional commitment to tackle such issues from a common perspective. With the creation of the South-American Defense School the region goes from the conflict hypothesis to the trust hypothesis.</p><h4>Peru has repeatedly expressed its interest in developing a dispute resolution body within UNASUR that could serve as an alternative to the CIADI. What is the status of this effort and how could it benefit UNASUR countries?</h4><p><span></span>The initiative has already achieved virtually 100% consensus. I would speculate that current dispute resolution mechanisms are obsolete and uniformly result in litigation. We have a completely different approach that instead prioritizes consensus. Naturally, too, we understand the need to balance national and personal interests where disputes arise.</p><h4>You recently met with Peru's President Humala. What was the outcome of that meeting and how did it contribute to regional integration?</h4><p><span></span>President Humala has two focuses within UNASUR: social inclusion and the ties between the private sector and UNASUR. Meanwhile, we are due to host the International Energy Forum in Quito in September 2015. The main players of the energy industry in the region will take part in this event to build bridges between the industry and UNASUR. President Humala believes in the strategic importance of such events.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>The Peruvian Corporal Jorge Arnaldo Hernandez Seminario is a hero from the Paratrooper Brigade of the Spanish Army, which is an elite unit that has participated in most of Spain's peacekeeping operations. He received the Military Merit Cross with a Red Distinctive and a NATO Medal for his participation in the International Force for Security Assistance (ISAF) in Afghanistan.</p><p><span></span>Jorge Arnaldo was born in Chapica de Campana, a small hamlet of Chulucanas, the so-called capital of mangoes, lemons, and ceramics, in the state of Piura, Peru. He was 26 when he died on July 8th, 2006 on duty in Bakua, Afghanistan. From the Paratrooper Brigade, he sent savings to the village where he was born. He financed meals for one hundred children, and his dream was to build a clinic in his village and rebuild the primary school. Jorge Arnaldo: we will not forget you.</p><p><span></span>Almost 200,000 Peruvians live in Spain, with 112,000 having been granted Spanish nationality since 2000. This gives proof of their exemplary integration, their commitment and spirit of solidarity: They defend both freedom and our shared values in the most dangerous international missions of our armed forces, and with their special warmth, they take care of our sick and elderly. They are discreet heroes.</p><p><span></span>As President, I want to recognize and acknowledge the contribution of Peruvians to our development and what is now Spain. On behalf of all Spaniards, I would like to thank you. We owe you a debt of gratitude. Like Jorge Arnaldo, you are an example of commitment and dedication.</p><p><span></span>Peru's greatest asset is its people, as is evident from its talent pool. In opera, Juan Diego Florez's voice led Pavarotti to consider him his successor. In cinema, we remember Claudia Llosa's Oscar nomination. In haute cuisine, both Gaston Acurio and Rafael Osterling are renowned. In the upper echelons of science, Peruvian scientist Barton Zwiebach, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is one of the world's referents regarding the ambitious String Theory, called the “Theory of Everything." This theory unifies the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to explain the Universe in a revolutionary way. Zwiebach and his colleagues contend that matter is composed of strands of energy, or “strings" that vibrate, each producing their own tune, as if the Universe were a great symphony.</p><p><span></span>The dedication of Peruvians to our common language deserves special recognition. The Nobel Prize Mario Vargas Llosa is the beacon of a literature that is regularly updated with new names, some of whom live in Spain, like Santiago Roncagliolo (Alfaguara Novel Prize), Fernando Iwasaki (Don Quixote Journalism Prize), Jorge Eduardo Benavides (Torrente Ballester Prize), José Luis Torres Vitolas (Alfonso the Magnanimous Prize), or Sergio Galarza (Cortes of Cadiz Prize for Stories). In Spain, Peru is read, heard, and felt permanently.</p><p><span></span>The history of Spain is rich in contributions from Peru. In the sixteenth century, the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega was the first writer from the Americas who lived in Spain, brilliantly assuming his two cultural heritages. We can also highlight Pablo de Olavide, who was the promoter of the first organized and legal emigration in history, when many Europeans (mainly Germans) emigrated to Andalusia in the eighteenth century.</p><p><span></span>This outstanding human capital explains the development of Peru in recent years and projects the country into the future with huge potential. Spaniards believe in Peru: in 2010, our cumulative investment in the country was almost ‚¬2 billion; in only four years, despite the financial crisis, it increased by 100%, now moving around the level of ‚¬4 billion. Peru emerges strongly as an economic platform, thanks to its extensive network of Free Trade Agreements with the four cardinal points, including China. Peru takes advantages of its Asian heritage: it belongs both to the Pacific Alliance and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC), and participates in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) free trade negotiations. Peru is a clear success of miscegenation, which in a global environment, easily merges with other cultures.</p><p><span></span>We could not discriminate against exemplary countries, which in the face of globalization have opted for openness rather than protectionism. When facing the adversities of drug trafficking and terrorism, their institutions have prevailed, proving to be sound, by overcoming such conflicts with the rule of law, through justice, negotiations and forgiveness. These processes of national reconciliation are an essential part of the new face of the region: peace and progress</p><p><span></span>Spain has shown with facts, not rhetoric, that it never forgets Latin America. Even during a period of crisis, Spain has demonstrated that it defends Latin Americans and makes justice prevail for them, eliminating any existing stigmas. This great diplomatic victory is not ours: it belongs to you, Peruvians, it is yours. Thank you for your efforts and sacrifices, and to your ongoing contribution to our development.</p><p><span></span>As a Spaniard and Ibero-American, I feel a great satisfaction when standing up for discreet heroes such as Corporal Jorge Arnaldo Hernandez Seminario, and for all of you, Peruvians. I am a Hispanic of Europe, and I believe in Latin Americans. I have proved this, and I will continue to do so.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your upcoming projects and goals for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>2015 is a landmark year for MBS as we mark our 50th anniversary. The University of Manchester has received a landmark donation for the future development of Manchester Business School from Lord Alliance of Manchester and his fellow Trustees of the Alliance Family Foundation. In recognition of this support and Lord Alliance's long-standing relationship with the University and the Business School, the School will be named "Alliance Manchester Business School" or "Alliance MBS."  The naming comes at a pivotal moment for the School as it continues to attract more world leading researchers and teachers, prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary and breaks ground on a new building.  In the Middle East, our main goals are to continue to recruit and support top quality students for our part-time MBA program, broadening our geographical coverage and creating greater access and deepening diversity with more female students. We also expect to see a rise in company-supported MBA students.  We will also be nurturing the regional alumni association to provide ongoing support to the growing MBS community.  We will extend our program portfolio with the launch of our Executive Education open program in Dubai — the first MBS program of its kind to be launched outside the UK. It is aimed at experienced managers who have been identified in succession plans to move into key positions and who need practical preparation for these roles.</p><h4>What are some of the most pressing needs that you have recognized in the Saudi Arabian education sector, and how does MBS Middle East help to fill these holes?</h4><p><span></span>In many ways, the business education needs of working professionals in Saudi Arabia are the same as in other countries in the region requiring flexible and convenient access to world class business programs, from top ranking business schools, leading to the award of globally recognized qualifications.  Saudi Arabia is the largest source market in the region (after the UAE) for students for our part-time Global MBA and its blend of self study and regular workshops with our world-class faculty and peers in Dubai gives them a valuable face-to-face experience conveniently on their doorstep. Ongoing executive education is important to help the country build and maintain a strong, experienced cadre of well-educated business people, who have the leadership and management edge to help the country achieve its ambitious goals. MBS programs complement and supplement the strong higher education sector in the Kingdom, providing practical exposure to global business and management practices, and the nurturing of successful organizational leaders, business managers, functional specialists, and entrepreneurs. Most of our students are self-funded and one of our objectives is to encourage more support for MBA students in Saudi Arabia, as well as building talent management partnerships directly with employers in the Kingdom.</p><h4>With by far the largest youth population in the GCC, how important is Saudi Arabia to the regional strategy of MBS Middle East?</h4><p><span></span>Saudi Arabia is an important country to MBS Middle East Centre; since we opened in Dubai Knowledge Village in 2006, we have supported hundreds of part-time MBA students from the Kingdom. We meet current students and alumni there, as well as prospective students, and we can see for ourselves the potential demand for a range of business programs delivered flexibly and accessible to all parts of the community. The MBS programs are post experience qualifications for early-mid career working professionals that help them to accelerate their careers, facilitate career switches and support entrepreneurs. We are certainly looking at how best to build our student base in the Kingdom and to support our students at every stage of their education.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the unique role that KFMC plays in the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>KFMC started as a tertiary care organization under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health. The idea behind its establishment was to cater services to tertiary care patients in Saudi Arabia. We cover the core medical care competencies including but not limited to cancer therapy and the treatment of neurological and cardiac diseases, and endocrine diseases. KFMC covers many other areas of as well. We have looked at Ministry of Health data and statistics on the incidence and providence of diseases and the limited tertiary care services in Saudi Arabia in order to determine our specializations. Specialties were chosen based on demands not covered by other tertiary care organization like King Faisal Specialist Hospital, military hospitals and the National Guard hospitals to avoid duplication of services. KFMC helps take care of the needs of those patients who are not otherwise covered by health care on a tertiary care level, it receives referrals from all over the country, which are filtered through a medical committee deciding what needs treatment at KFMC versus what can be treated at a local facility. Through this process the patient receives a continuum of care once they return to their local hospital. </p><h4>How is KFMC making investments to expand the capacity of the medical city?</h4><p><span></span>In 2004 this complex was inaugurated, and it started by serving a mixture of secondary and tertiary care. In 2005 and 2006 we completed a healthcare study and found we needed to expand by 40%. We are expanding from 1,200 beds to 2,000 beds—the construction you see today is part of that plan—and we will be able to deliver services as 2000 bed tertiary care facility by 2017. This expansion was built based on population demographics of Riyadh region and quaternary care needs of the kingdom. We are now making attempts to expand our scholarship programs in order to provide more health care training for our workforce. We are developing local training programs in every specialty within the medical city. On the administrative side we have begun Master's degree programs in healthcare administration in collaboration with international universities, such as Washington University in St. Louis and University of Minnesota. In the first program we had 17 candidates, followed by 25 in the second, and this year our goal is to graduate 35 candidates. We are also developing a Master's degree program in research with 25 seats and, in collaboration with a university in the UK, a degree program in Medical Education.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for the private sector in health care?</h4><p><span></span>Typically, countries spend roughly 10% of their GDP on healthcare, and we are beyond that. On estimates today we are spending 12% of our GDP on healthcare. This is a large amount spent on healthcare. Government organizations managing the hospitals are not able to provide comprehensive care without the help of the private sector. However, the private sector relies on private health insurance or out-of-pocket payments, and neither method is sustainable. Eventually, the GDP portion will continue to expand on healthcare, and this will be dangerous. The challenge for this system is to make sure that we use the budget on proper coverage. There is waste that needs to be contained, and one of the ways to do this is through a national health insurance system. The profit aspect of health insurance needs to be eliminated from the equation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru has seen a decade of strong economic growth and declining inequality. What economic ideology has guided your presidency with regard to balancing foreign investment and domestic policy concerns?</h4><p><span></span>A focus on economic growth with social inclusion rests at the core. In this sense, private investment has been essential to achieving meaningful development outcomes that raise people out of poverty. Private investment has led to a higher level of salaries, household income and consumption, which has allowed an expansion of the middle class and a good performance in poverty reduction. For this reason, investment is actively promoted by the Peruvian government, both domestic and foreign. During 1H2014, 56% of FDI flows came from the reinvestment of profits, reaching high rates in sectors such as services (34.5% of total reinvestment), mining and hydrocarbons (32.7%), and the financial sector (15.5%). On the other hand, Peru has been ranked 35th out of 189 countries in the 2015 Doing Business Report, and second in Latin America. An important factor to highlight is that Peru has comparative advantages that attract investment. For example, industrial electricity rates are below the Latin American average, since 60% of Peru's electricity is generated by hydropower and a further 35% by natural gas. Regarding social inclusion policies, our strategy is based on the Life Cycle approach where the focus is on early childhood, teenagers, and young people. In particular, we pay greater attention to job generation and scholarships for young Peruvians. To avoid the "middle income trap," policies focus on the underpinnings of long-run economic and productivity growth such as education, health, innovation, and productive development.</p><h4>The Pacific Alliance has emerged as a significant regional economic force. What are your long-term ambitions for Peru's place in the alliance?</h4><p><span></span>Nowadays the Pacific Alliance is in a very good moment. This alliance, as a whole, constitutes the eighth largest economy in the world, and represents the seventh largest exporting group worldwide. It attracts more than 40% of the FDI that flows into the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This, summed up to the results obtained to date, as well as to the tasks still in agenda, has attracted the interest of 32 observer countries from five continents, which makes us realize that we are doing things right. In the long term, I would like to see that the innovative initiatives that the Pacific Alliance is seeking to implement create positive results and serve as a reference to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region. In that sense, I have the expectation that in the future the Alliance will be a stronger economic block, and that it will urge other countries in the region towards the development model that the current four members share. For that reason, I would like to see Peru become a reference for other economies in Latin America and the Caribbean region, as a leading country in the Pacific Alliance sharing its positive experience implementing 21st century economic policies.</p><h4>In the late 2013 and 2014, mineral prices fell and Peru's rate of GDP growth decreased with them. What are the Peruvian economy's greatest non-mineral strengths, and how is your government encouraging continuing and diverse growth?</h4><p><span></span>The Peruvian economy's greatest non-mineral opportunities are located primarily in the retail sector. Peru has two shopping centers for every million people, while Chile has four shopping centers for the same number of people; secondly, comes the vehicles sales sector: Peru has six vehicles per 1,000 people, whereas Chile and Argentina have around 21 per 1,000 people; the banking sector is also an area of opportunity: credits are at just 30% of Peruvian GDP, while in Colombia thy represent around 40%, in Brazil 55% and in Chile over 80%; manufacturing exports are also ready: the 2013 per capita level was at around $700 while in Chile it was around $3,000. In all these areas, we have significant ground to catch up; developments that will drive growth in the coming decade. Concerning the sustainable development of our natural resource-rich country, the Peruvian government also promotes productive diversification beyond the extractive industries. Manufacturing is growing. Between 2000 and 2014, for example, the number of products in the non-traditional sector increased fourfold; and medicine exports, perfumery, and personal care products increased fivefold. We also recently launched the National Plan for Productive Diversification aimed at promoting new sources of income and growth. The pillars of this plan are: diversification promotion, which aims to diversify our exports' basket; adequacy of regulations, aimed at cutting red tape that prevents productive investment; and reduction of productivity heterogeneity, aimed at closing the productivity gap between the modern and the traditional sectors of the economy.</p><h4>Economic stability has been a feature of your administration. How will you ensure that consistent economic policy is part of your legacy?</h4><p><span></span>The government has worked hard to ensure Peru's macroeconomic stability against exogenous shocks, and at keeping a more fiscally conservative regime. Also, our macroeconomic buffers are ready to defend the local currency, thanks to the Central Reserve Bank, which has continuously increased its international reserves over the past decade. As a result, Peru has a much higher international reserves to GDP ratio (32%) than its Latin America counterparts (16%). On the other hand, we have an important fiscal stabilization fund with more than 4.4% of GDP, and—according to the IMF—the lowest funding needs in Latin America. Peru's net public debt is at 3.7% of GDP, below its regional peers such as Mexico (42.1%), Brazil (33.7%), and Colombia (23.9%). On the fiscal side, during the current administration, we have been working on a new macro fiscal framework that will help public spending disengage from the more volatile source of fiscal revenues, such as the natural resource sector's revenues in relation to commodity prices. With this new institutional framework, fiscal policy is in line with international best practices for commodity-exporting open economies.</p><h4>Latin America has a promising future, despite some uncertainties. What is the role of Peru in the upcoming years?</h4><p><span></span>Most Latin American countries have shown their financial and economic strength during this international crisis. Peru has stood out among them thanks to its fiscal and macroeconomic policies. They allowed us to have 16 years of continuous growth and to implement social policies that effectively fight against poverty. Peru will continue as a regional reference on successful economic and social policies. But also, as an attractive countryfor investors—with an enormous potential in different sectors—Peru will continue to receiving investment from global and regional capitals, and show them the opportunities in our internal markets and as a center for regional activities. Latin America is widely known for the production of commodities, but now the region has to give a step forward and position itself as a region in a process of productive diversification. Peru has already been working on a National Plan of Productive Diversification to generate alternatives that boost economic growth and sophistication. In addition, Peru foresees that the Pacific Alliance is an opportunity to make regional economies more competitive and take advantage of complementary markets.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main ways that KFUPM is contributing toward the sustainable diversification of Saudi Arabia's economy?</h4><p>The establishment of Dhahran Techno-Valley (DTV) at KFUPM in 2006 compounded with the government's aims—as reported in the Saudi development plans (eight &amp; ninth)—to move into a more diversified economy. During last nine years, DTV Science Park has gradually turned into a nucleus for an integrated innovation ecosystem. The DTV Science Park (Phase I) became the presence and focus for large number of R&amp;D centers for MNEs and national organizations, as well as a success story in attracting R&amp;D-related FDI to the Kingdom. The advancement of the DTV Science Park with progressive velocity is timely and comes at a point where the Saudi government has climaxed its efforts and push for economy diversification. The supply and value chains for the energy and water technologies captured through the DTV ecosystem are expected to be innovation drivers for Saudi technology-based businesses either on the developmental side, for example in water and energy consumption, power generation and environment protection, or the economic side, such as chemical and petrochemical industries. </p><h4>What investments does the university have to expand and grow in new strategic areas?</h4><p>Currently, we are focusing our efforts on three major strategic areas: 1) enhancing the value chain of DTV Science Park through Phase II to capture broader fields of the petroleum downstream, the renewable and the water technologies, 2) strengthening the effectiveness of DTV ecosystem so that it can encompass in the future a complete R&amp;D-based techno-economic cycle, and 3)  enhancing the efforts to develop the readiness of the KSA technical/engineering workforce for facing the increasing challenges of oil and gas production global demands.</p><h4>How KFUPM is working to increase its support of entrepreneurs or further integrate entrepreneurial skills into its curriculum?</h4><p>The growth and prosperity of modern economies are increasingly becoming highly dependent on entrepreneurial activities. The entrepreneurs provide in the diversified economies source of income and employment for themselves, and others and drive more economic value chain activities. It takes cultures and educational systems that engage the students in thinking about their future opportunities, testing their ideas, and setting up businesses as part of the curriculum. Students who receive entrepreneurship education are not only more likely to be employed, but also more likely to start their own companies. With that in mind, KFUPM has started many initiatives that will spread the entrepreneurship culture at its campus which hopefully prepare KFUPM graduates to be entrepreneurs. One of the major initiatives is the establishment of its Entrepreneurship Institute (EI) that supports the development of its innovation-entrepreneurship ecosystem and to actively contribute in the transition to a knowledge-based economy in the Kingdom. The EI continuously provides many training programs in the form of courses, workshops and competitions for KFUPM students and additionally it works on launching a minor degree in entrepreneurship. </p><h4>KFUPM is one of six members of the recently established Saudi Arabia Advanced Research Alliance (SARRA). How is KFUPM working to not only drive innovation within the Kingdom, but also commercialize innovation to contribute toward the Kingdom's economy? </h4><p>Saudi Arabia has many of the necessary elements for a potential innovation ecosystem. This includes stakeholders from academia, research and industry, which perform R&amp;D activities and target that such activities will result in products that help in expanding the technology sector of the Saudi Economy. These research performing organizations face similar challenges when it comes to advancing individual technologies to the demonstration and deployment points. From another angle, the DTV can be considered as an ideal platform for commercializing innovation at the Kingdom level. This platform includes the major elements necessary for innovation commercialization: 1) the innovation push reflected by the large number of KFUPM research-based patents and the collaborative R&amp;D activities of the DTV Science Park, 2) the market pull and the global innovation trends represented by the presence of R&amp;D centers of global innovation corporations at DTV Science Park, 3) an infrastructure for supporting the planning and incubation for technology-based businesses through the technology incubator and the facility for 3D printing and prototyping, which are available now in the Innovation Cluster in DTV, and 4) the financial venture investments of Dhahran Techno-Valley Company (DTVC). </p><h4>How would you rate the current progress of Saudi Arabia's transition toward a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>The Saudi economy remains largely oil-based. It retains about 16% of the world's proven petroleum reserves and ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum. The petroleum sector accounts for almost 80% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings. However, the government strongly supports the growth of the private sector in order to diversify the economy and to employ more Saudi nationals. The government invested enormously between 2010 and 2015 on social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi Arabia's economic development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BASHIRCO was founded 35 years ago. What gaps in the local dental industry were you hoping to fill at that time?</h4><p><span></span>At the time of our establishment, the dental supply business was considered a small part of the medical business. This is why all other players in the field were part of diversified conglomerates. We were the first to start a fully dedicated dental business, attending to the needs of dentists and dental technicians in the Kingdom. The other companies were so large that this niche market, for them, was not considered important. This is how we were able to get to where we are 35 years later, with a 27% share of the Saudi dental market. After two years, we started a pharmaceutical company to service OTC needs. We started by dealing with the needs of the pharmacies and, little by little, we understood there was a niche in all that is considered “herbal" or “natural." Therefore, we went into that market. Slowly, we learned this business, and now we are thinking it is time to produce these products here. We merged the two businesses, the dental and the pharmaceutical business, which is why it is called Medical &amp; Pharmaceutical Services.</p><h4>What are your views on the opportunities for the private healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The customers are becoming more and more demanding. They have more information. They can go anywhere in the world and see what is happening, and so they are putting a lot of pressure on us. They want us to deliver the best products that we can. Those who can do it will have an excellent market, and be able to turn a real profit. This is bringing a lot of goodwill from outside, and many large companies are thinking about entering the  local healthcare market. I see a lot of interest in education and health. People have the money, the experience, and the organization, and are looking to find new opportunities. They are starting by buying groups and clinics, and commencing production. All these rules and difficulties we are speaking about will force international companies to produce locally. Some countries have laws demanding that you produce locally. Saudi Arabia doesn't have this stipulation yet.</p><h4>How have the changes in the Ministry of Health affected Bashirco? </h4><p>In 2014, we were having difficulties in the private market because the Ministry of Health was in a state of flux. We had five ministers of health in one year. They were implementing new rules and scrapping previous ones. However, they are trying to implement advanced processes. For example, the Ministry of Health is trying to put everything related to health in Saudi Arabia on one IT platform. This is fantastic for everyone; however, it needs a lot of work and support. This represents the ideas and visions for the future.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the rest of 2015?</h4><p>This year we have a number of major tasks that are taking up a lot of our time, mainly in logistics. With the growth we have experienced, we cannot meet existing demand with our current capacity. In turn, we are building new warehouses, and implementing software that can help us carry out our business in a more sophisticated way. This will be what helps us cope with the demand of the market. Hopefully, this will be up and running next year. We have an ERP in the company; however, things are changing so fast that now we want to have an ERP that can work with the customer-relationship management, while also being linked with the warehouse. We also have a large training center that can train up to 120 people, be they dentists or pharmacists.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the significance of the Saudi Arabian market in relation to GSK's regional and global strategy?</h4><p><span></span>The Saudi Arabian market is very important and is considered to be the largest in the Middle East/Africa for pharmaceuticals. The country places high priority towards health sector development. The Saudi Arabian government is supporting the development of the healthcare sector, by placing the right infrastructure and developing the right policies for the health of the population. GSK is aligned with this vision, as we are the first global company to set up a joint venture to locally manufacture pharmaceuticals. Glaxo Saudi Arabia Ltd. manufactures most of the pharmaceuticals that we market in Saudi Arabia. We are not only bringing new technology to the country but are also training and developing local talent on the manufacturing front.</p><h4>What are some of the unique challenges in this market?</h4><p><span></span>One of our key contributions to people's health is to develop and deliver innovative new medicines and vaccines, which improve the prevention and treatment of disease and medical conditions. Registration timelines have been a challenge in Saudi Arabia as it may take up to two years before registration is granted to new chemical entities, which normally delays the access to innovative medicines to Saudi patients. However, we understand that SFDA is actively reviewing their registration processes to shorten the registration timelines especially for those products that have already been reviewed by authorities in the US and Europe. This will help in early access of innovative medicines to Saudi patients. Another challenge, which is crucial to our business, is the scarcity of Saudi national pharmacists and the difficulties in attracting those talents to work with pharmaceutical companies. However, GSK is at the forefront of attracting local pharmacists toward career opportunities offered by the industry.</p><h4>What kind of products are you  focusing on in the short term?</h4><p><span></span>GSK has a huge portfolio, which varies from country to country. Most of the products we market come from our R&amp;D pipeline. GSK is considered to be the number one supplier of respiratory medicines worldwide; we provide treatment options for most common respiratory illnesses such as asthma and COPD. GSK is also one of the largest companies for vaccines involved in research and development and manufacture.  We supply most vaccines required for the vaccination program in Saudi Arabia. GSK also manufacture primary care medicines, such as antibiotics, anti-allergy, and anti-ulcerants, and so on. We also have a specialized portfolio to treat AIDS (HIV), hepatitis, depression, and epilepsy.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for next couple of years?</h4><p><span></span>In the next couple of years we will be bringing innovative medicines in the field of asthma, COPD, HIVurology, and diabetes to the patients in Saudi Arabia. We want to ensure that our local manufacturing (Glaxo Saudi Arabia Ltd.) site is reinforced to manufacture most of our products locally, rather than depend solely on imports. We have also entered into a strategic alliance with a local company in Saudi Arabia to manufacture vaccines. These initiatives will help to transfer the latest manufacturing technology to Saudi Arabia, develop local talent and smooth supply of medicines and vaccines to the people and the government of the Kingdom.</p><h4>What do you see as the long-term outlook for Saudi Arabia's pharmaceutical sector and what are the major trends that you are noticing in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The pharmaceutical industry in Saudi Arabia will continue to grow at a reasonable rate. Nonetheless, due to GCC price unification and reference pricing there may be reduction of prices of some products. The high population growth rate of the country and government commitment to the healthcare sector will result in high demand for better healthcare facilities and innovative medicines.  Moreover, as the population ages there will be more demand for medicines for treating chronic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and COPD.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the centers of excellence that you focus on?</h4><p><span></span>Number one is trauma. KSMC aims to become a top level trauma center over the next 2-3 years. A lot of effort is being put into this project through a number of initiatives. One of them is building tower number three, which focuses on trauma and surgery. We have a large fund to build a state-of-the-art surgery and trauma center that is going to be built on a new plot of land we have recently acquired west of KSMC. We are heavily investing in training young Saudis in the best centers around the world and we are collaborating with a number of international partners in the US, the UK, Australia, and Canada to help us in training and transferring skills and knowledge. The second center of excellence is orthopedics. We probably have the biggest orthopedics service in the region. We have about 120 orthopedics beds. It is quite busy. Again, we are trying to develop orthopedics by bringing in new skills, upgrading services, and reaching out to the community in better ways. Number three is burns. We have one of the few burn centers in the Riyadh region. It is the biggest one and we are investing more and more into burn care. Our fourth center of excellence is the dental center. We provide comprehensive dental care and maxillofacial surgery free of charge for Saudis. The fifth center of excellence is critical care. We have a total of 150 critical care beds, the most in the Kingdom with a dedicated 40 beds for trauma ICU.</p><h4>Can you talk about your expansion plans? </h4><p><span></span>This is very exciting. We are going to expand from 1,200 beds to 2,000 beds in seven year's time. Tower number two should be operating in six months. It will be a women and children's hospital. That will be really wonderful news for the community we serve because our current facility is very old. Tower Number three will be for surgery and trauma and will have a large burn unit. Other new projects that will commence in the next 12-24 months are a 200-clinic dental center, a 300-clinic ambulatory center, and a parking building.</p><h4>What are some of the main challenges for hospitals in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>A shortage of skilled professionals is the number one challenge everywhere in the Kingdom. Number two is the lack of integration in our healthcare system. Our patients suffer because of a lack of integration. No hospital could provide excellent care in all specialties. Today, there are 275 hospitals operated by the Ministry and there will be another 100-150 hospitals commissioned in the next five to six years. How are we going to operate all these new hospitals when most current hospitals are suffering from the lack of a skilled workforce? I strongly believe that the answer is in integration and sharing resources. Skilled professionals that are difficult to find should have privileges in more than one hospital. In other words, we should create multiple integrated health systems. We have started integrating with King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) and we have agreed that there will be services that will expand at KFMC and others that will expand at KSMC, but they will complement each other. For example, if we diagnose a case of cancer, it will be referred smoothly to KFMC while trauma or burn cases will be transferred to us.</p><h4>How do you see the role of public hospitals over the long term?</h4><p><span></span>There is still a severe shortage in the number of hospital beds per capita compared to international benchmarks. And so, I think the partnership between the public and private healthcare systems is in the best interest of the community. Public hospitals have definitely not been able to attend to everyone, so having the private sector assume a larger role is good. We still have a huge problem with regards to access to care and waiting lists. Our ERs are usually full. Having fewer patients will allow us to improve quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2014 for the Chamber, and what are your priorities for 2015?</h4><p>We are still building infrastructure for Makkah in 2014, in particular the Holy Mosque. We are still in the expansion and extension phase. The benefits will be clear in probably three years, as that is when the infrastructure for the Holy Mosque will be complete and the positive impact of the increased number of pilgrims will be felt. We are expecting Hajj numbers to reach 7 million pilgrims over the next two or three years. In terms of transportation, we are starting to see the new developments in a new airport, which is due to be launched in the next two years, and will coincide with the completion of the rail system. All these projects are expected to have a major impact on the economy of Makkah and Medina.</p><h4><span></span>What is your medium-term outlook on the Hajj, and how it will affect your member companies?</h4><p><span></span>In 2014, it will decrease, the same as in 2013, because we have decreased the number of pilgrims coming from outside, as well as from within the country. This is because of the development in the Haram area. We hope that this is the last year that we will be forced to keep pilgrim numbers low, and maybe from 2015 we will be able to increase their numbers again, and we expect a rapid rise in income from Hajj and year-round tourism. </p><h4><span></span>In what ways is the Chamber collaborating with both other Saudi and international Chambers?</h4><p><span></span>In Saudi Arabia, we have the umbrella Chamber, known as the Council of Saudi Chambers, which makes the arrangements and organizations between all the Chambers. We have a special relationship with the Medina Chamber, as our neighbor in the region, and we also share an economy based on the Hajj, Haram, and Medina. For other countries, we try to cooperate with all international chambers of commerce, but we do focus on the Islamic Chamber of Commerce, because it is easy to visit our Chamber. In addition, we try to build strong economic relations between Islamic countries; however, we are open to the whole world.</p><h4><span></span>How is the Chamber tackling the issue of unemployed youth, and what role can the private sector play in the solution? </h4><p><span></span>We are trying to build a database of people seeking employment that businessmen can access to bring employers and potential employees together. We hope this system will make it easier for both parties to find the right role in the right industry, and for businesses to find the right employees to increase Saudization. We try to help companies, but some sectors have difficulties, for example construction. This is because most locals are not willing to undertake a lot of the jobs that are offered in that sector. </p><h4><span></span>What are your long-term plans for MCCI?</h4><p><span></span>We know that the economy of Makkah is based on the Hajj, and we try to benefit from that. Since all Muslims are expected to visit Makkah at least once in their lifetime, we can make services available for them and develop the hospitality sector, in particular. We will also expecting to focus on the conference and exhibition sector.</p><h4>What role can Makkah play in the development of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>Makkah is a unique city; it cannot be duplicated. All Muslims must ultimately visit, and so we must meet demand, as we expect it to grow. Once we have finished our infrastructure projects here, the economy will boom. We have seen increased interest outside of Makkah for real estate, hotels, and all associated services; therefore, Makkah is one of the most attractive cities in the world, particularly for Muslims. For the Saudi Arabian economy, it is second only to petroleum and oil in terms of revenue created. If we continue to develop it and the service sector, we expect that it will contribute even more, while providing employment for local people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on where the Jabal Omar project currently stands?</h4><p><span></span>Jabal Omar is in the holy city of Mecca and it is one of the largest developments in the Middle East. It has an area of 230,000sqm with a built up area of about 2 million sqm; we have 38 towers inside our project within which there are 24 international hotel brands with nine international operators. What makes JODC unique is that it gathers 24 brand hotels in one area, which makes it one of the largest concentrations of 5 star hotels in the world.</p><h4>What other innovations are you bringing to Mecca?</h4><p><span></span>Most of the areas in Mecca are congested. Therefore, the government has started urban planning to ease congestion. One of the areas that has urban planning is Jabal Omar. The other companies and developers are following the same concept. It also has state-of-the-art technology, especially in infrastructure. It has district cooling and grey water treatment, which is in line with green building regulations. Jabal Omar will have huge technical galleries running under the project.  It is actually a mini-city. Through one of the projects, we have technical tunnels that accommodate the chilled water piping, electrical systems and the garbage collection. The garbage will be collected, pumped (under negative pressure) and collected in a station within the Jabal Omar development. We also have the grey water treatment because many people come here for Wudu and there is a huge wastage of water. The water is collected, treated, and pumped back to be used again.</p><h4>How do you balance between creating ultra-modern developments and maintaining the traditions of the city at the same time?</h4><p><span></span>The government of Saudi Arabia wants to increase the worshippers at the Haram Al Sharif, especially during Umrah and Hajj. Between 1.5 and 2 million people come for the Hajj, and about 5 million come for Umrah every year. The government wants to increase these numbers to 15 million. This number was announced during the presentation for Mecca development. In order to realize these numbers and this huge demand, we have to develop infrastructure such as railways, buses, airports, electricity, water supplies, and hotels. We are one of the hotel developers that will meet these demands moving forward. </p><h4>In terms of investment opportunities for Mecca, how would you describe the current investment climate?</h4><p><span></span>When we talk about Jabal Omar, we are talking about 15,000-20,000 employees that are needed for staffing purposes alone. Jabal Omar has three categories, namely hotels, apartments/villas, and commercial segments. The commercial segment is one of the largest in Mecca. We will also have a convention center that can accommodate up to 2,000 guests. We have already started an auction, and in 2014, we sold 20 villas. In 2015 so far, we have sold another 22 villas. This confirms a high level of interest.</p><h4>What are the major challenges you face in this project?</h4><p><span></span>Logistics is the number one challenge, and because of the proximity to the Haram we experience complications with the trucks entering the site. In addition, we have an issue with labor, because only Muslims are allowed to enter Mecca. In addition, workers tend to pray at Haram because it is a unique opportunity for them, which means that there is a considerable amount of non-productive time.</p><h4>What are some of the concrete goals and targets you hope to achieve during 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We are looking to complete three hotels in time for Ramadan and the Hajj. The target of our company is to complete all hotels and the commercial section, which is still under development. We also have the remaining apartments and villas to be completed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Tatweer play in the Kingdom's ambitious education plans?</h4><p><span></span>Tatweer Education Holding Company (THC) is fully owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Its main role is to be the private sector's arm for the ministry of education and any other government department involved directly with serving education or the youth of Saudi Arabia. THC's major strategic role with the Ministry of Education (MoE) is to support it in its strategic organizational plan to free the ministry from any none core services or any other services that the ministry wishes to delegate to THC. Such services include student transportation, schools building, and books printing, for example. The MoE is keen on focusing on the development and improvement of student outcomes to produce the 21st century Saudi generation capable of leading the country in being one of the leading and influencial countries in the world. This focus requires time, effort, and delegation of many of its support functions. THC and its subsidiaries are positioned to take off the burden of the secondary functions to free the MoE to perform what only it could perform. </p><h4>How does the merger between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education affect Tatweer?</h4><p><span></span>The merger to me looks great. My market is becoming larger and a step further has been taken toward integration. A merger, as a concept, is well known for faster growth and client reach. The MoE and Ministry of Higher Education serve the same main single client, the “Saudi" or “student" with a single objective, which is to prepare them to serve this country and maintain not only its existence, but also to put it on the map as a super power. Therefore, merging the two will make it better focused on the student and their educational outcomes. The product of the K-12 eventually goes to university, then the graduates of universities go back to teach K-12. So the problem of the chicken or egg situation will be solved right there. MoE now will be responsible for the development of the Saudi man/women from KG until they finish their higher education. The one-stop shop.</p><h4>What would you say are the main challenges or obstacles holding back the development of Saudi Arabia's education sector?</h4><p><span></span>I believe there are two main considerations: the students' willingness to learn, and the teachers' willingness to teach. The curriculums are more or less the same worldwide, meaning the material is not the issue. One of the dreams of Prince Khalid, the former Minister of Education, is to somehow change the mindset of the student here to the point where they wake up wanting to go to school; it is Dr. Azzam's plan, too. Achievements start with the desire to achieve. But it's not just for the students; the same thing can be said for the teachers. They also need to desire to teach and make a difference. Today, we have many administrative issues; our teachers may not have the desire, experience, or the necessary tools. I would raise the requirements for teaching K-12. It is the most critical stage; it is the foundation. Our students from K-12 are the ones who eventually go on to our universities and then end up teaching the next generation of K-12, so you can see how it is all related. PhD holders and Master's degrees are an urgent necessity in K-12.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2015 marks the 10th anniversary of KFSH. What achievements thus far are you most proud of?</h4><p><span></span>Going back 10 years ago, when this hospital was commissioned by the Late King Abdullah Bin AbdulAziz as a general hospital that will cater for the healthcare needs of the population of the eastern province, a lot has been achieved that we can be proud of. Firstly, our emphasis on our human capital has paid dividends, as we have invested a lot on training Saudi staff to assume various roles in medical, clinical, nursing and various administrative positions. We managed to collaborate with centers of excellence internationally to establish this outcome. Additionally, we have recruited a highly skilled expatriate workforce, that helped us build our centers and train our staff, and to whom we will always be grateful. Secondly, we are proud of the many alterations we had to do to upgrade this facility to the tertiary and quaternary care levels that we needed. Projects such as Cyclotron facility, state-of-the-art imaging center where a large nuclear medicine unit, multiple digital operating suites with a hybrid neuro-interventional OR suite, large CAP accredited laboratory facility, Intensive Care Units and Bone Marrow transplant unit are all just some examples of that. Thirdly, is the reputation and high levels of patient satisfaction that we achieved during the past few years, as a center of excellence in specialized healthcare with special core competencies in Oncology, Neurosciences and Multi-Organ transplantation, and providing compassionate, quality care to our patients. </p><h4>What will King Khalid Medical City bring to the health sector in the Eastern Province?</h4><p><span></span>The King Khalid Medical City will provide the eastern province with its largest (1,500 bed) hospital, which utilized evidence-based design and  is principled on being a smart, green, patient-focused building. It will provide a Research Center and academic facilities to help it achieve its goals of clinical excellence. This facility will undoubtedly not only be an addition an terms of capacity, but also the scope of services, training and research opportunities will be the largest of its kind in the whole region including the GCC. </p><h4>How would you assess the level of highly trained local human capital in the health sector?</h4><p><span></span>This is a huge challenge, regionally and internationally. We realized this early on, and have invested heavily in achieving high rates of Saudization and in training. We now have 20+ Saudi Council accredited training programs in different specialties, including medicine, surgery, transplant, and emergency medicine, among others. We continue to invest our human resources in nursing, allied health and administrative specialties as well.</p><h4>What are your concrete goals or expectations for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We are moving in parallel with the government's and the Ministry of Health's visions. It is time for us to think how we can integrate health care. I believe there is a greater focus on integrating healthcare and improving the patient journey and focusing on patients moving from primary to secondary, and tertiary services in the smoothest way possible, and with the best experience the patient can have. Parallel to this vision, King Fahad Specialist Hospital will start to work together with the Ministry as the Eastern province Directorate of Health to ensure we improve access to care. We will increase our outreach capacity to reach remote areas to provide tertiary care. From the other perspective, our mission in the short term is to prepare the foundation and to consolidate our services to be ready to accommodate privately insured patients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the PSCC project evolved from an exhibition center to a massive multi-use real estate development?</h4><p><span></span>It was initiated by HRH Prince Khaled Al-Faisal in order to have a dedicated Jeddah exhibition and convention center. The idea started from that, but this was during the late Prince Sultan's life. I wanted to do something that carried on his name because he was well known for his charity and support. Projects such as this are normally executed by a city municipality, or the Chamber of Commerce, because they do not usually make money as a development. Such projects only bring money in for the city once you have an exhibition, and they form a part of your tourism sector. At that time, we thought we had to have another business opportunity that could support this project and sustain itself. From that, we knew we had to create more business-oriented projects. We thought about what Jeddah needs and what it is known for. In the early days Jeddah was also known for its healthcare tourism. There were more private hospitals located there than in any other city in the area. We decided we should revive this business again, and hence we looked at establishing a medical park. We worked to bring in top medical operators from the US, such as the Methodist Hospital from Texas. They are leaders in certain areas, such as cancer and heart disease. To achieve this high standard of healthcare, we also needed to bring in doctors. There are outstanding doctors here. Then, we needed to have proper housing for them, and from that, proper schools for their children, and then universities, and then shopping centers. In this way, the project came together as a lifestyle and wellness concept.</p><h4>What economic effects will the PSCC have on the city of Jeddah?</h4><p><span></span>Beyond a social impact, it will also have an economic impact. We are not doing the whole thing ourselves; we are developing the city, but we are also giving the opportunity to businesspeople to come and invest. They are the ones that are going to develop the hotels, schools, and sub-developments. In this way, we have created a chain of economic impact for the businesspeople of Jeddah. We have created the opportunities for companies and businesspeople to come and invest. This project will also have an impact on unemployment. With this and the medical park, we have created 5-6,000 jobs. We have created opportunities for people to work in the hotels, restaurants, medical facilities, exhibition spaces, and much more. Again, it is our aim not only to produce profit for the investors, but also for other reasons—we are creating jobs and a lifestyle for our children.</p><h4>How much investor interest is there this far into the project?</h4><p><span></span>Around 70-80% of the project is already committed. This is from local and international investors. We aim to have international associations. For example, for the medical development, any party that wants to come in and invest in a hospital has to have an international partner. With this, we have attracted foreign investment from Europe—Austria, Germany, and France. Even the hotels, schools, and exhibition areas have international operators as our partners. They are bringing in their own equity.</p><h4>Where do you see the project by the end of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We are hoping to have people living and going to school here by the summer of 2017. By the beginning of 2018 the hospital will be open to the public. We are hoping that it will be three to five years maximum for the project to open. The project is being developed on a lease basis, therefore now participants are paying rent. The components depend on each other. For example, the school needs the housing, and the housing needs the restaurants. They are all connected, hence they have to finish at the same time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Comparing 4Q2014 to 4Q2013, Al-Khodari Sons increased profits five-fold. What were the main drivers behind this recent success?</h4><p><span></span>In regard to profitability, while we have had better years the margins have been dampened by the Saudization initiatives that took place. In a company with 23,000-28,000 employees and an 8% Saudization requirement, it means we have to do our best to recruit the number required to meet that quota. In the construction field, it is tough. To explain our success in the past quarters, we have to also say that we are involved in auctions that sometimes skew quarterly results. Thus, we try to look at yearly results for a more accurate picture of our success. We are happy with the performance of 2014 because we are on the upswing of improving our margins as compared to the year before, and it is a positive improvement from the 2013 results. We are back on the uptrend despite what we have encountered with Saudization. Slowly, we are getting out of our backlog of revenue stream, and now we have more business that has been priced with these costs in them. </p><h4>How is Al-Khodari Sons planning to expand its presence outside of the Kingdom?</h4><p><span></span>Our growth strategy includes the Middle East and Africa, but, of course, that is a lot of countries. We will be making assessments country to country, which will dictate where we choose to look into. Egypt is a country with a great potential right now, and countries similar to Egypt would certainly be taken into consideration. In Africa, other countries where significant spending on infrastructure is going to be put out also have potential. In the Middle East, we have to be extremely selective; however, when opportunities arise we look at them. Right now, we are looking at the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait. Our concentration is still on Saudi Arabia because that is where the major spending is going to be. </p><h4>What effects have the oil prices had on projects now and megaprojects down the road, and how has Al-Khodari been impacted?</h4><p><span></span>Today is different than when the oil prices dipped in the mid-1980s when we had very little, if any, reserves, and the deficit was high. This is the only time when we have had strong reserves that are not required to fund the whole budget but can be used for any deficits that may appear. There should be plenty to sustain the dips, even if they are prolonged. The government has been clear that the budget will be prioritized toward infrastructure and it will ensure that the Saudi citizen is well cared for. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the construction sector over the long term?</h4><p><span></span>You have to split the sector in two with essential being infrastructure and social, and then non-essential, which by and large are the ones that are going to be slowed down. Part of infrastructure is impacted directly by the drop in oil prices, and in 2015 and 2016 will be impacted especially. The construction sector is still buoyant in some areas; however, some contractors are witnessing a slowdown right now if they are involved in non-essential construction.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the remainder of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We have already announced the revenue for the first quarter, which came to SAR1 billion, and that alone is a comforting indication that we are still moving along on our growth strategy. We are currently doing many projects, and our model is to have a much larger amount of projects of medium size rather than just three or four large ones. We do that for risk mitigation, and that way it does not have a material impact on our growth strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do the opportunities in Saudi Arabia represent for TAV?</h4><p><span></span>First of all, the Saudi Arabian economy is one of the leaders for the whole world, and it is the largest oil producer, which is why it has become so important for the airport business as well. It is a large country with many airports that is highly populated in respect to other countries in the Arab region. In 2014, Jeddah had a 28 million passengers and Medina had 6 million. There is a large demand for terminals as well as airport facilities and cargo. There are catering, cargo, and ground handling buildings required, as well as airport hotels. There are many opportunities in this huge market. It is important for TAV to be in Saudi Arabia, since it has a stable economy and political environment; everything is quite attractive here</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you have faced or experienced in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>Any time you enter a market you face new challenges, such as new culture, visas, and banking systems. It is not so different from the other countries where there are megaprojects. However, the positive thing about Saudi Arabia is that there are many brands, manufacturers, and subcontractors available in the country. Since it is economically an active country, there are many companies already here. It is not difficult to attract companies, and it is not like other countries that are facing economic difficulties. This is a real advantage for Saudi Arabia. There is a proper banking system from a financial point of view, and when we start a project we have thousands involved. We feel it is one of the most stable and secure places to start a project in the world. There are great opportunities here. </p><h4>How will TAV's projects bring the airports you are working on up to international standards?</h4><p><span></span>Medina hosts many passengers every year, and the airport conditions were not great, which is why the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) stepped in and launched a PPP type airport development program. We won the tender, and over three years we invested $1.2 billion in the project. Now, there is a brand new high-tech airport with facilities in Medina; therefore, we have already begun adding value in the Medina area through this airport. It is a growing airport, and will be more attractive and an important facility for travelers. There have been steps taken to rehabilitate and refurbish the Riyadh airport in the same way, and we have won the tender for T5 there as well. This will be another important and key terminal when the airport is refurbished. It will become an integral part of the system. When we go back to Jeddah, parallel to the airport the airlines are also growing. When one of them grows the other one needs to grow in accompaniment. Initiatives have already been taken to start maintenance and repair hangers. We are currently building hangers in the northeast corner of the Jeddah International Airport, which will be our contribution and value-added to Jeddah airport. Airports are active cities and organisms. Since the completion of the Medina Airport, we were asked to build an airport hotel and a catering facility in Medina Airport. Since we are growing with the market, we are available to work on major airports and become a key player. We wish to continue like this, and hopefully we will be able to continue to build new facilities in the Kingdom's airports.</p><h4>Now that TAV has entered the market in the last few years, what is your vision for TAV in Saudi Arabia over the long term?</h4><p><span></span>Over the long term, we are targeting many future decades of business here. We will surely be busy in the airport, transportation, and other large scale PPP investments and projects. Anything related to airports are of interest to us. This is the beginning of a long relationship, and we anticipate being here for many projects and years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RATP Dev operates in 14 countries around the world, but Saudi Arabia is the first in the GCC. What does this market and your SAR7.8 billion bus project mean for your regional and global strategy?</h4><p><span></span>We started to look at Saudi Arabia and the Middle East about six years ago; recognizing that this was a high growth region where companies such as RATP Dev could find the growth it was looking for. Beyond that, we saw a tremendous appetite for public transport here. It is an area that is seeing growing urbanization, meaning there is a large need for public transport, especially considering the traffic problem and the environmental issues these countries face. When you consider that Saudi Arabia will become a net oil consumer within the next 30 years, you see just how much more important public transport will become. We decided that it was important for us to enter this part of the world, entering an agreement with SAPTCO more than five years ago. We were awarded our massive and unparalleled project to create a 1,000 bus networks for Riyadh, a city of 6.5 million people. This kind of project has never been done. It was the King's vision, and we are delivering this with SAPTCO. </p><h4>What have been the challenges to creating and implementing a project of this scale in a city where there has never been any such public transportation network? </h4><p><span></span>To create a full service from scratch is something we have never seen before. To deliver the project itself is the first challenge, in other words, to build the depots, buy the buses, hire 4,200 people to drive the buses and staff the network, and to get everything in motion ensuring that you run the service on time, which is two years from now. In spring 2017, the service starts, beginning in the south, then the center, and then the north in three stages. The whole thing will be up and operational by 2018.</p><h4>In the longer term, how do you see yourself leveraging any success from this project into future opportunities in Saudi Arabia or in the GCC?</h4><p><span></span>First, this project has to be a success. Hence, we are concentrated for now on delivering what we have promised. At the same time, there is a Riyadh metro tender project, which is also just starting and one we are competing on by again combining the local strengths of SAPTCO with our RATP's capacity and expertise in operating and running automatic metro lines. We already operate some of the densest and highest capacity lines in the world. For example in Paris, the automatic Metro Line 14 carries 600,000 people a day, while Line 1, the historical line in Paris, also completely automated with the same driverless technology like the one we will implement here in Riyadh, carries 800,000 people a day in Paris. That line started off as a driver line and was converted to a driverless line without any stop or pause in service. Therefore, a Parisian could board the train the next day and not know that they were in a driverless train. We are bringing this capacity and expertise to Saudi Arabia and to the Riyadh metro tender with SAPTCO. We are also looking at other GCC projects; however, we are conscious of how much potential there is, and how much resources there are available to deliver on our promises. After all, these things aren't infinite, and you have to manage and plan them well. Our RATP mother company has a team of 4,000 experts working in Paris alone, not to mention our teams working in Algiers, the UK, and Asia, for example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After some years, Virgin Mobile officially began operations in the Saudi market in 2014. What does the Saudi Arabian market mean for Virgin Mobile Middle East and Africa (VMMEA)?</h4><p><span></span>The Saudi market is the largest market in the region. It is strategic for VMMEA, and, of course, we believe that if we can succeed in Saudi, we can succeed in other operations. The Saudi market consists of 30 million customers, with 20 million local and 10 million expatriates. Virgin Mobile decided to launch two brands, one for locals and one for expatriates, in order to serve both segments and customers. If we succeed in Saudi, then we are not playing the same game or playing the same price strategy; it is more about the customer experience and how we can innovate and be more groundbreaking in this direction. Of course, if we can succeed, we can take it to other regions in the GCC and to the Middle East and Africa in general. We had a great experience in Europe, Canada, and the US, and, of course, we are trying to take this experience to Saudi Arabia so that we can serve our customers there with the right experience. We are looking at 10 countries in the coming five years. Virgin Mobile already operates in South Africa, and we are operating in Oman, Malaysia, and Jordan, albeit with a different brand. We are looking for an additional five locations over the next five years.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia is notable for having a large expatriate community, as well as a young population. What are your strategies to cater to these demographics?</h4><p><span></span>When you start looking at the needs of customers, you start to realize immediately that expatriates have different needs to locals, because they want to be able to stay in contact with their home country; therefore, they make more international calls compared to young Saudis, who are looking more at the quality, data services, and the voice and other services on offer. This is why we decided to introduce two brands, one where the expatriates feel that we are really matching their needs and what they want to have, and, of course, another brand for Saudis. Both brands are trying to provide the best experience, albeit with a completely different approach. The brand for Saudi youth, for example, is about trying to communicate through social media. And, for our expat brand FRiENDi, we go more offline and try to be close to our customers.</p><h4>How do you see the long-term effects of having three additional operators, particularly MVNOs, affecting the market?</h4><p><span></span>The positive thing in our business model is that we can focus more on experience and marketing, rather than spending time on the network and trying to have large coverage on the technology side. I believe that is a major advantage for our business model. This is also how we can play a different game and in different areas. Another aspect is that when you are an NMO, you tend to be more of a niche market. We are not going for the mass market; we want to be experts in a certain segment, which is not 100% of the market. This is the business model we chose, compared to other NMOs who are looking at the mass market and technology. We are really going in the opposite direction by looking at a small segments and being experts. We launched in 2014, and it was a very successful commercial launch. The feedback that we received from our customers is excellent; they are happy with the innovative products that we introduced. For example, we introduced a unique three SIM start-up pack, which had great feedback. This is the innovation that we want to keep and offer to the market. The feedback was really positive, and it is first time that I can see in social media that people took pictures of our start-up pack. It is not a handset, it is just a SIM card; however, people were really happy to see this new product.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DHL recently opened a $20 million logistics center in Riyadh, as well as completing other significant facilities investments in Saudi Arabia since last year. How will these investments impact your capacity and operations in the Kingdom?</h4><p><span></span>The newly opened Riyadh customs clearance facility is part of our $60 million infrastructure investment plan in the Kingdom. We will build three state-of-the-art, market-leading clearance facilities across the Kingdom in airports, with one in Riyadh, one in Dammam, and one in Jeddah. All three facilities will increase our shipment and clearance capability tenfold. These facilities will all have in-house customs clearance and other government departments. These services will provide us with the fastest and most compliant clearance in the industry. It will provide our people the best working environment and our customers and partners the best service available, thus supporting their growth. We have already completed this, and we are operational in Riyadh and Dammam airports and Jeddah airport facility will be on line in 2016. These facilities will support our customers and partners business growth in Saudi Arabia with market leading logistically solutions.</p><h4>What future investments does DHL Express have in the pipeline for Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>As a market leader, we are always looking to invest where we can improve services, working conditions, and be closer to our customers. We aim to be as close to the customer as possible and make it easy to use DHL through our retail outlets where customers can both send and collect shipments at their ease. This will always be ongoing as we listen to the voice of both our customers and our employees. This will undoubtedly lead to more investment and DHL facilities across the Kingdom. In five years' time, I see DHL still being the market leader and logistics provider for KSA. This will be through our people being certified international specialists, our facilities being all state of the art, and by providing fastest to market transit time for all our customers both large and small</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of the Saudi Arabian market for DHL and DHL's strategies for the MENA region?</h4><p><span></span>DHL will, and has always, invested heavily in the Middle East, as we have been present in this area since 1976. By being here first and always looking at leading the way in logistical solutions in many difficult markets, our partners and customers trust us with their business and we work with them to make them successful. DHL are customer centric, and every customer and shipment is our priority. With this, every country is important in every region around the world in the DHL network; however, some countries in the business world are more dynamic and more demanding, and as such have a greater importance to customers and the DHL network. KSA is one of those countries and is important in our Middle East and Global network as we deliver a DHL promise everyday from somewhere in the world with every shipment we deliver to our customers. KSA has many ongoing investments not only in logistic parks, cargo areas, airport developments, road and rail investment, and solutions, but also in doing business with the world and opening up Saudi Arabia to foreign investors meaning greater opportunities for all industries and especially the people in the Kingdom with great career opportunities for both locals and foreign workers. Therefore, KSA is key in the MENA region and globally.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the Kingdom's logistics sector and its competitiveness as a logistics hub over some of its neighbors? </h4><p><span></span>Saudi Arabia is moving in the right direction with DMM cargo village, King Abdullah Economic City and port, rail infrastructure, and airport development across the Kingdom. For many years, the main trade line into the GCC, and especially KSA, has been Jebel Ali port in the UAE and then either air, ocean, or road into the Kingdom. I strongly believe with the infrastructural investments and new mindset of Saudi Arabia that it will become much more self-sufficient and not so reliant on other GCC countries as a first point of entry, which has been the case for many years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about NASJET's new rebranding strategy?</h4><p><span></span>NASJET started in 1999, and has grown every year since. Today the company is the largest and fastest-growing aviation firm in the Middle East, with approximately 70 aircraft in its fleet. We have connections across the world. We have flown to almost 10,000 airports globally. We are now reaching the third phase of NASJET, and we would like to see ourselves in top line growth mode, acquiring more aircraft in our fleet. Based on that, we thought the new logo and new brand should reflect our ambition for the future. We want to build a brand that will represent our expectations. The new branding was launched in December 2014 at MEBA show. In addition, NASJET has accomplished major milestones in 2014, to complete our portfolio of service to our clients that is the signing of the cooperation with The Jet Business London-based organization that is prestigious and well known for its sales and acquisitions of more aircraft. The second milestone is that we signed alliance agreement with Luxaviation, a Luxembourg-based private aviation company. We now have activities together and are trying to share our network and assets globally.</p><h4>How does NASJET work within these alliances?</h4><p><span></span>NASJET is looking to expand and cover more geographical areas. We have evaluated different operators, and found that Luxaviation share our long-term objectives. Luxaviation has grown over the past five years to become one of the top three aviation companies in Europe. It has acquired private aviation companies in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Portugal, and the UK. Both of our companies are ambitious, and share the same strategies for growth. Our clients fly all over the world, and they also need local travel in Europe and the Far East. Luxaviation has more than 100 aircraft in its fleet; therefore, our clients will enjoy the flexibility and availability of the fleet of Luxaviation. Likewise, we are the largest private aviation company in the MENA region; hence, our network is also available to Luxaviation. Now, we cover the MENA region, Europe, and the Far East. Putting the two companies together, we are the second largest private aviation company in the world. That gives us an advantage over other competitors.</p><h4>How will these partnerships further expand your services?</h4><p><span></span>Our aircraft fleet flies into most of the airports in Saudi Arabia, and we feel that our clients need more convenient and higher quality services on the ground as well. We also evaluated potential partners to work with, and found that ExecuJet provides high quality services. We came to an agreement for establishing a joint venture here in Riyadh. We are expanding in Jeddah and other airports in Saudi Arabia to ensure we provide our clients with a high quality service on the ground. </p><h4>How can the private aviation sector combat the grey market?</h4><p><span></span>There are two ways to counter the grey market. One is in NASJET's control, and the other is regulation. For NASJET, it means high quality services. With regard to regulations, we expect the regulatory bodies to implement the regulations on the ground and make sure safety is a priority. We operate at the highest safety standards we also educate our clients about the risks of flying on the grey market because some of those aircraft are not well maintained, the pilots are not well-trained, or the services are not up to standard.</p><h4>What major trends are you noticing in private aviation in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>As we are the leading private aviation company in the MENA region, we would like to be a reference to business and advance the industry more. We want to contribute to the satisfaction of the needs of the VIPs in the region. We noticed that private aviation is becoming an important tool for many people to accomplish more in their lives.</p><h4>Is there room for growth in this sector?</h4><p><span></span>Statistics show that growth in the private industry is around 8% yearly. It is because the private aviation industry in our region did not start until recently, and people realized its real value later. We are positioned to take advantage of growth in the area. We plan to expand our fleet and our geographical coverage, while also expand services that come along with private aviation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Flynas recently won its first World Travel Award for best low-cost airline in the Middle East. What does this milestone mean for you and the company?</h4><p><span></span>It is a wonderful endorsement of what we are trying to do, and it is important on a number of different levels. First of all, previous winners were all airlines that we are constantly benchmarked against; therefore, we have now achieved a certain level of proficiency. We have got some fantastic crews out there doing wonderful work every day of the week, and I am receiving many compliments on the work that our people are doing in the air and on the ground. We pride ourselves on looking after people. It is great that people recognize our efforts. The Flynas brand is becoming well recognized, certainly in KSA. We are starting to get a really good foothold and reach here. People now know who we are, and that is something we want to keep doing in the region, to keep our brand up there.</p><h4>Within the four-hour sector, where will Flynas focus its expansion efforts?</h4><p><span></span>At the moment, we do 70% of flying within the Kingdom itself. We only touch on a fraction of the airports around the country. Where we see profit and volume, we are happy to expand on that. We are currently reviewing whether we are flying to the right places, how many times we are flying, and whether we need to expand as an airline. Any expansion will be done organically. We are not going to go with a large aircraft order and then hope that we can fill it to fly somewhere. What we are trying to do is to see if we can get more scientific about what we do, get smarter about what we do. For example, everywhere we fly to we tend to fly from Jeddah and from Riyadh. That is not necessarily a smart move. Jeddah has its own demand. It has the pilgrimage traffic, where a huge amount of people that want to visit the Holy Mosques. As a national carrier, it is almost incumbent upon us to provide that space just for that reason alone. The routes between Jeddah and Riyadh are just phenomenal, the amount of people that will fly between those two cities. Internationally, people in the GCC countries do not need a visa, meaning we have a team looking at where we should be flying in the GCC. If anything, during my tenure, the flight schedule will not change dramatically; however, we will see several changes where we take some unprofitable flying and just change direction on it, and we will have a different schedule in Riyadh than we have in Jeddah. We will not automatically go to both. </p><h4>Where do you see the greatest opportunities for foreign companies in the market as Saudi Arabia's aviation sector continues its privatization progress?</h4><p>There has always been an interest. If you look at the volume of traffic of other airlines into the Kingdom, there is constant demand for Jeddah and the pilgrimage traffic, which is not going to stop anytime soon. Once the construction is completed around Mecca, it is going to be phenomenal. There is room for everyone. We do have interest from other countries in domestic flights. It is the largest single domestic market in the region. With 27 million people in the country, a lot of people have to travel long distances. We always focus on that kind of expansion in the market for our sales. However, if other people do, it is up to them to compete with us. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Relying on Quality]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[relying-on-quality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of your company performance over the past five years?</h4><p>Basically, we have grown by around 96% in terms of net premiums, from about ZMW70 million in 2010 to ZMW137 million in 2014. In terms of our position in the market, we still remain the largest insurance firm with a market share of 23%.</p><h4>How would you describe the competitive landscape in Zambia?</h4><p>In the first place, I would like to stress that competition is welcome. The only challenge we have on that front is the fact that the minimum capital requirement of entering the sector remains quite low, at ZMW1 million, which is roughly $150,000, or less at the current exchange rate. In terms of competition, we have relied on quality service delivery and product innovation to ensure our long-term survival. We have also put in place a clearly defined financial strategy. That has been our focus, and has allowed us to distinguish ourselves from our competition; the point being that prompt claims settlement is our main priority. Let me add that we are the only insurance company in the market to have introduced the “on the spot claims settlement“ campaign for five claims categories, provided documentation is available. These are usually claims for things like car windscreens, car batteries, car radios, tires, the home, household goods, laptops, or other electronic devices. We believe that such possessions do not merit a lengthy process, and that in all these cases people require an urgent solution.</p><h4>What innovations are you responsible for?</h4><p>We have developed, for the first time, a product in the micro insurance segment for launch in 2H15. In terms of our growth prospects, we need to cater, too, for the low-income segment of our country. In the micro insurance arena, the products that we are launching will cost less than $1 per month, and clients will have a number of  options to choose from. In terms of product reach, we have partnered with certain companies involved in selling mass products that are available nationwide. In particular, we have a payment platform called Kazang, which is available both in urban and rural areas in all 10 provinces of Zambia. This is an excellent vehicle for penetrating the vast number of citizens currently excluded from the financial markets. We will also work with mobile service providers to deliver this product as the mobile phone has become a vital platform for nationwide insurance penetration.</p><h4>How do you plan to inculcate an insurance awareness culture in Zambia?</h4><p>We have had the product translated into the seven official languages, and information on this will also be aired on local community radio stations through out the country. We will also stage road shows in select areas as we seek to reach members of the public normally excluded by conventional insurance offerings.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the new insurance act?</h4><p>In terms of the new act, I would mention three progressive components that contrast with the current landscape. The first is the fact that, for the first time, micro insurance will be subject to specific regulation. Even as we are developing new products in the micro insurance segment, we are doing so with the assistance and guidance of the Pensions and Insurance Authority. Secondly, the new act will help in terms strengthening corporate governance in insurance companies. As an example, the new act has stipulated a minimum of seven board members per entity. The third aspect relates to shareholding structure. Thus far, we have had no guidelines in terms of, for example, the stake that a foreign entity can own when establishing an insurance company in Zambia. Once the new act is in place, foreign entities will only be able to hold a maximum 70% stake, while the remaining 30% is to be held by Zambian nationals. I consider this to be progressive in the sense that  Zambians will continue to participate actively in the development of the insurance sector as we have the capacity to do so.</p><h4>What can the government do to further develop the insurance sector in Zambia?</h4><p>In my view, one of the major steps the government could take is assisting us in terms of reducing the cost of insurance. At the moment, I feel that the cost remains prohibitively high due to the 16% VAT added to each policy. I believe that if VAT were removed, as was the case before,  it would go a long way in terms of incentivizing people to buy insurance. Other than that, I feel the government could also help in terms of more strictly regulating the issue of premium finance. At the moment, we do not have a good mechanism to ensure that those who buy insurance actually end up paying for it; currently, considerable sums are being written off as bad debt. I have seen this happen in other countries where the government addresses the matter through the introduction of the cash and carry policy with regard to insurance premiums.</p><h4>What role does insurance play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>The benefits of insurance are immense. When you start a business, the shareholders invest considerably to get the ball rolling. The last thing we want to see is a flood, fire, or other calamity laying this effort to waste. In that sense, the insurance industry plays a key role in ensuring business continuity and peace of mind. Secondly, insurance helps the broader economy by inculcating a culture of savings. As insurance companies, we invest much of the revenues generated from premiums into a number of financial  instruments, such as fixed deposits, treasury bills, and so on. This money goes a long way in terms of  helping with the development process, both directly and indirectly.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2014, our profitability grew by around 31%. My expectation for 2015 is for profit after tax to grow by no less than 30%. Other than that, I have also devised measures aimed at increasing our liquid reserves by no less than 40% so that we are able to continue responding more positively to the needs of our customers. Right now, we have the largest investment portfolio in terms of liquid investments in the general insurance sector in Zambia. As of December 2014, we had about ZMW27 million in liquid assets by way of held-to-maturity investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A major vision for NEXUS is to become a global operations service provider. How are you putting this into practice?</h4><p><span></span>The emerging market is our target, and we have set criteria to determine the best partners. Although India is one of the fastest-growing economies, and there is booming business in the VIP flight market, it is also a complicated and challenging country in which to run a business. We were fortunate to find a local partner company that knew the market and allowed us to stay as who we are. We set up our operations center in Bombay at the end of 2012, importing our own infrastructure and training, and the center has been successful. After India, we opened in Rwanda, where we manage all the airlines within Africa. We just signed a partnership with China, and by the third quarter of 2015 we will be open in Shanghai, with a holding company in Hong Kong. We are also looking at opportunities in Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines, Australia, and the Asia-Pacific in general. Statistics are impressive throughout the region, but China is promising because there is little to no competition as yet. Beyond China, our aim is to penetrate markets in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico. We are focused on emerging markets because this is where we excel. The US and Europe are not on our radar as much, though we have been successful there as well. We look for unique opportunities and quality clients. One of our customers, FlyTrans, a family-owned business, invited us to operate in Europe in early 2012. We chose to go to Monaco because their taxation policies were appealing as well as the quality of the established companies. We were one of only 12 companies approved that year. Recently we opened an office in Vienna, a very important hub to support the entire network within the European area. </p><h4>NEXUS is celebrating its five-year anniversary. As a pioneering company that started amidst many doubters, what does this anniversary mean for the company?</h4><p><span></span>Five years is an important milestone. We are thankful to have found a supportive partner who created many opportunities for us. The company is successful and profitable and depends on itself. We are in the process of acquiring another two companies that will be self-funded. There is stability and a growth. We have made it a priority to think globally and act locally; this is the key to our success. When we enter a new place, we work to adapt to the community as opposed to acting simply like a “Middle-Eastern company." Education levels and languages vary, as well as market needs; the team understands that adaption is the way to do business.</p><h4>What are the company's goals over the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>NEXUS aims to be the benchmark global aviation company. We have achieved this in the Middle East, because we have made contact and built a large customer base. Our team is proficient, and we are proud to have been selected for many projects with the government and corporations. We hope to take the company public in the next five years. </p><h4>What is your outlook for Saudi Arabia's aviation sector?</h4><p><span></span>Our government has and is still investing in the infrastructure of the country, by building new roads and expanding airports. This has had a tremendous effect on the aviation industry. We have almost more than 30 airports. All these airports are first domestic and gradually many of them will become international. There is high demand, a growing population, and new cities. The sector has seen many changes in management and leadership, changes that have presented more opportunities. Many airline carriers want to come in to Saudi Arabia; we are a G20 courtier with one of the fastest-growing and most stable economies. We will continue to face obstacles, but will be able to overcome them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major developments or milestones have you witnessed over 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Overall, 2014 was our best year yet. We hit record numbers volume wise, revenue wise, and profit wise. In addition, we hit record numbers in terms of utilization and efficiency. Over the past year, we have undergone significant changes and restructuring which has been embedded in the company. For example, our new revenue management department is now fully functional and has generated good value, our new CRM team is expanding the boundaries of customer relationships, and our charter department continues to provide customers with tailored solutions that meet specific needs. These are all examples of the many initiatives the team has taken on and as a result, we are seeing greater business efficiencies and stronger customer ties. Our aim is that 2015 will be focused on continuing the journey. We have other areas that we are going to be taking onboard, including an update of our operations. We will also be looking at restructuring our cargo ground handling business with the intent of upgrading our service levels and customer experience to a whole new level over the coming years. We have also taken on board a few new aircraft and will continue to grow our fleet capabilities in the coming years. We will also kick start our new facility construction in Jeddah this year. This will be a mega project to be completed over five phases, which will more than double our existing capacity while improving the quality and standards of our operations. We also have similar plans for an expansion in Riyadh, which we are progressing in parallel. At the heart of all of this lies our focus on people development and human capital, as none of this can be achieved without having the right people on the ground. Were currently investing heavily in people development and in grooming the leaders of the future, this will remain an area of focus over the coming year</p><h4>Why has the Middle East seen almost double the growth rate in air cargo compared to the rest of the world?</h4><p><span></span>The global growth in air cargo last year averaged 4%. Saudia Cargo achieved a growth of 11%, which is more than double the global average. It is important to highlight that all global air cargo companies are subject more or less to the same global economic conditions and various market dynamics. Any shift in global trade patterns impacts us equally. There are few aspects however that separates us from one another, one of them is access to global air traffic rights, another is having an advantageous geographic location, which allows for greater network span. Saudia Cargo's hubs are in the heart of the Middle East. This geographic location enables us to connect east with west, and north with south. Much of the cargo from the Far East transits through here to Africa, for example, or to Europe, and it is the same with cargo coming from Africa and transiting to Europe; it all comes via our hubs in Saudi Arabia. Being based in the Middle East allows us an advantageous location in the center of some key trade routes. Another key difference is that Saudi Arabia as a country is a genuine consumer of imported products and materials; it is not just a trading hub. Most of the cargo flown into Saudi is for domestic usage and consumption. We provide some of the best routes with direct access into Saudi. Still, we are all subject to the same international treaties, taxations, and economic conditions. If anything, we find that growth here comes with its many challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently met with HRH Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz, President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTNH). How are the aviation and tourism sectors working together to reach their mutual goals?</h4><p><span></span>The tourism and aviation sectors have a symbiotic relationship wherein the two sectors complement each other in terms of growth and development. The two sectors play a significant role in the government's economic diversification efforts and have to work more closely in an integrated manner to achieve common objectives. My meeting with HRH Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz, President of SCTNH, can be described as strategic and goal oriented. We discussed ways of working together to further achieve our goals and also help achieve the Kingdom's economic vision. In addition to policy, some of the areas of cooperation will include knowledge sharing, training, and joint programs.  </p><h4>The gradual privatization of the aviation sector has had positive early results. As this privatization process continues, what opportunities are there for local and international investors?</h4><p><span></span>The liberalization and privatization of the Kingdom's civil aviation sector is a strategic process that will help provide world-class services within our country's airports. Currently, GACA operates 27 airports across the Kingdom and has several key strategic developments. Many investments are underway including a brand new expanded terminal at King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, a brand new airport in Jeddah (King Abdulaziz International Airport) in addition to other upgrades. Another example of the transformation that Saudi Arabia's civil aviation sector is experiencing is the recent launch of the Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport in Madinah. This is the first airport in Saudi Arabia to be constructed and operated entirely by the private sector following a Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO) Agreement signed by GACA in 2012 with Taiba Airports Operations Company Limited, a consortium consisting of TAV Airports Holding, Al-Rajhi Holding and Saudi Oger. Phase I of the new airport, which spans a total area of 4 million sqm, will allow for a passenger handling capacity of 8 million per year, which will increase to 18 million and over 40 million passengers per annum in Phase II and III, respectively. The airport was built at a cost of $1.2 billion through capital raised by the Taiba Consortium from National Commercial Bank, Saudi British Bank, and Arab National Bank under the supervision of the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group. Another project is the new Terminal 5 at King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, which will be operated by an international company and GACA has invited companies to bid for the project. In addition to that, we have plans to establish a new company, Riyadh Airports Company, exemplifying the privatization process. The Saudi government has committed to a $10.65 billion program to upgrade or build more than 20 airports to help accommodate its fast growing but underserved aviation industry. </p><h4>In April 2015, the new Cargo Village in King Fahd International Airport was launched. What role will this new Cargo Village have in stimulating the local economy, as well as positioning the Eastern Province as a hub for trade?</h4><p><span></span>The King Fahd Cargo Village is a first-of-its-kind multimodal cargo clearance facility spread over half a million square meters in Saudi Arabia. A staggering 70% of goods bound for the region are destined for Saudi Arabia, and the opening of the Cargo Village has enabled direct access to the Eastern Province and the Kingdom in general, circumventing the need for shipments to transship through neighboring GCC countries. Cargo Village has been custom-designed to maximize operational and cost efficiencies for airlines and freight companies operating from KFIA, while providing greater connectivity and guaranteeing express cargo delivery with reduced shipping times and increased cargo capacity. In addition, the ease of shipping and cargo services that Cargo Village offers and its strategic location along with the availability of low-cost fuel in the Kingdom, are key factors that will significantly enhance KFIA's positioning as a leading cargo hub in the region. Leading international and regional freight companies, such as DHL Express, NAQEL, SMSA Express, TNT, and UPS, have already established express cargo clearance facilities and offices there, thereby creating new economic and employment opportunities in the Eastern Province. With several evidences of the ever-increasing popularity and sustained success of multimodal transport hubs across the world due to considerable savings in transit time and freight cost they offer, and the anticipated growth in cargo activity and the demand for cargo space in the Kingdom, additional capacity at Cargo Village is expected to come online soon further proliferating the local economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebara is active all over Europe, but this is its first venture into the Middle East. What were the main attractions of the Saudi Arabian market for Lebara?</h4><p><span></span>Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states have significant communities of expatriates—in Saudi Arabia approximately one-third of the local population are expatriates coming from all regions of the world. As the universal brand for the global migrant community, Lebara focuses on providing high-quality, low-cost, international calling and mobile internet to connect people with friends and family back home. This has been Lebara's approach across Europe and it similarly applies here in Saudi Arabia. Our primary target is the Saudi expatriate community, who make up about 10 million of the population. Our offering also appeals to lower-income Saudis, and I believe that this strategy provides us with a major opportunity, because this group is currently under-served by the existing MNOs, which tend to focus on high-income earners. I believe there is great potential in Saudi Arabia and it is the best place in the region for Lebara to start. </p><h4>Lebara officially launched at the end of 2014. How would you rate the success of this launch so far?</h4><p><span></span>We have made an excellent start and exceeded all expectations. Although we experienced some delays before launching—due to various regulatory reasons—things have gone really well since the launch. We are currently unable to offer some services, but we should be fully operational in the next six months, and able to compete with other operators in terms of voice, data, international roaming, and so forth.</p><h4>What are some of the lessons that Lebara can learn in the Kingdom to prepare for expansion to the rest of the GCC?</h4><p><span></span>I am confident that Lebara will succeed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, just as it has in Europe and elsewhere. I believe the two main challenges for the region, however, are that there's a new experience among our regulators regarding MVNOs, the MVNO's relationship with the MNOs, and how everyone deals with each other. As a global MVNO brand and one of only two MVNOs in KSA, it's Lebara's duty to help educate the regulator on the MVNO's business model, sometimes regulations can create a major obstacle and it is our role to demonstrate the value we add to the market and feedback on regulation that works well to develop the MVNO model and allows us to innovate in the market. Secondly, the agreement with the MNO here is different—it's not like any agreement in Europe—so you need to have detailed negotiations with the MNO beforehand to ensure you end up with the right contract terms. Again, this is where Lebara brings its expertise and has a vital role to play in negotiating with the MNO and making them understand the benefits of helping their MVNO partner grow.</p><h4>What major trends are you noticing in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>Like elsewhere in the world, we see tremendous growth in data. This is something that we have to prepare for and our MNO needs to be ready for, because expansion in data requires major investment on the part of MNOs. We have to ensure this investment takes place so that we are all prepared and can meet the needs of our consumers who want to consume more content on their devices. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Our priority is to build brand awareness so that Lebara enjoys the same trusted brand status it does elsewhere—people may not be familiar with Lebara yet, particularly those who do not travel to Europe, which is almost 99% of our segment. We need people to really feel that Lebara has a different approach and a deep understanding of their needs. With growing awareness, we can expand our subscriber numbers, improve our wholesale agreement terms with our MNO, and add more services to create an even stronger consumer offering.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Saudi market and the relationship with Saudi Arabia for Northrop Grumman?</h4><p>Northrop Grumman is an advanced security company. We have been in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for almost four decades. The business started with five aircraft for the Royal Saudi Air Force, and since then the relationship has been excellent. The advanced systems of KSA are unparalleled and date back decades. During that time, two major joint ventures have been established, one with Vinnell Arabia and one with Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Saudi Arabia. These are our partners and our way of saying that we are committed to the Kingdom.</p><h4>How has this relationship continued to evolve, and what plans do you have to be more committed to the country?</h4><p>Before, we had a presence through individual business sectors within Northrop Grumman, but the decision was made in late 2012 to mid-2013 to have a corporate-wide presence in the Kingdom. As a company, we started with four priority countries, the UK and Europe, Australia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Now, we represent Northrop Grumman 100% here, and we want to grow the business. To do so, we have set a strategy looking at what is important for Saudi Arabia. Saudization is important for the country through training and educating the country's youth, as well as technology transfer, know-how transfer, a diversification of the economy, and so forth. All of these are part of the government's strategic plan. We needed to ask ourselves what we can do as a company to support the government, because we look at it as a partnership, and not as just regular business. We are here for the long term, and so we looked at those initiatives. Hence, we have a commitment to offer as many jobs as possible to Saudi citizens. Already, in total, with our joint venture, we have about 1,700 employees, some 60% of whom are nationals. We would love to bring this figure to 80%, but we are dealing with the most advanced technology, and so it takes time to train people to the required level. Still, we are establishing special programs where, for example, some 90,000 students study in the US through the King Abdullah Scholarship Program.</p><h4>How do you see the defense sector in Saudi Arabia developing over the long-term?</h4><p>We are absolutely committed at Northrop Grumman to developing the aerospace defense or the defense and security industry in the Kingdom. Our strategy is that when we win major contracts, we are not going to fly a Northrop Grumman employee from elsewhere to do the job. What we do is work through the local supply chain, which means that we would look at the capabilities of the various Saudi companies involved in the defense and security industry, and start a partnership. We are looking to manufacture products under licenses from Northrop Grumman. In the long term, it is not only about manufacturing and supporting our services here in the Kingdom, but for the whole region. Saudi Arabia can be the hub to support our products globally. </p><h4>How much of Northrop Grumman's R&amp;D is being done in Saudi Arabia, and what are the long-term plans to expand this?</h4><p>Soon we will announce a deal that we are already engaged in with the Prince Sultan Advanced Technology and Research Center to explore all opportunities possible. However, we are committed to looking more at R&amp;D, and it would make more sense for us to work with R&amp;D organizations that have a link with our product portfolio, which is exactly what we are doing with PSATRI. We have already started getting the ball rolling, and there are some opportunities that we are working on. We are also working with King Saud University in relation to C4I and cyber security. We believe that it is extremely important for the younger generation to start to understand and learn more and benefit from this technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Saudi Chemical Company diversified its investments since emerging as a player in the energy exploration sector?</h4><p><span></span>The Saudi Chemical Company is a publicly listed company, and a holding with five subsidiaries. The Saudi Chemical Limited Company, which was established in 1972, specialized in the manufacturing and distribution of civil and military explosives. The second is Sitco Pharma, which distributes pharmaceutical products. The third company is Aja Pharma, which is a pharmaceutical manufacturing company. The fourth is SINCO, which is a joint stock company in Egypt, and manufactures ammonium nitrate around Suez and Egypt. And the fifth is CCCI, a distribution and logistics company for FMCGs and medical equipment. Our strategy is to expand geographically, and we are acquiring similar companies in different countries, in addition to acquiring more principles. The Saudi Chemical Company is a public company. It is easy to talk to us regarding government compliance because we have a very clear system, which gives us a priority over companies looking at Saudi Arabia. From a logistical and manufacturing perspective, we have specialized factories and products, and we are talking to several international companies to look at a joint venture for specialized manufacturing facilities. At present, we are most focused on neighboring countries that we can integrate with our resources in the area, as well as Africa, which is an area of interest.</p><h4>How is the Saudi Chemical Company becoming more engaged in the Kingdom's defense sector?</h4><p><span></span>Technology is changing, and we are keeping up with manufacturing and the manufacturing of plastic explosive technologies. We are also building a new factory in the North of Saudi Arabia. We have four factories to date in the country, and we are entering into the defense business. We are entering into a joint venture with a multinational manufacturer to start this. We are looking into it, especially after the changes in the Ministry of Defense and Military Industrial Complex (MIC), and we are in negotiations now to start a number of joint projects. We are also in discussion with a number of American and British companies to localize their technology as well as transfer it. Each country has different demands and different requirements, and by establishing a manufacturing base and investing in R&amp;D, each country has different threats; therefore, we can tailor that to suit those needs, which is definitely our hallmark. </p><h4>How do you see the role of the private sector within the defense sector?</h4><p><span></span>The government cannot do everything, and has to involve the private sector. In addition, this industry is a cluster industry, and instead of manufacturing what you need, this industry can be an economic power for the country as well as another source of income. I believe that Mohammed Al Mady, the new head of the MIC, will make this business profitable. Saudi Chemical has the license to manufacture military explosives, and this license enables us to manufacture many types of products. We have the experience, the alliances, and solid relationships with multinationals.</p><h4>Many of your major clients are linked to state megaprojects. How have the lowered oil prices affected your company, and what effects do you expect? </h4><p><span></span>It will have an effect with the decline in the number of projects. It will have an impact on our sales, but we also have other areas such as the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We will open our new factory, which should be finished by the end of May 2015. Then, we will go into operation around June. We have a new factory that will also be inaugurated, which makes three in Saudi Arabia. In other businesses, we are expecting a significant growth for the holding. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rajhi Steel is the largest private steel company in the country. What is the role you play in the heavy industry's domestic private sector development? </h4><p><span></span>Mohammad Abdulaziz Al Rajhi founded Rajhi Steel in 1984. The company started off as a small production plant in Riyadh.  Today, it produces over 3.5 million tons of steel bound to meet the demand of the construction sector. Rajhi Steel produces up to 0.9 million tons of steel per annum from its Kharj industrial complex and about 2.6 million tons from its industrial complex at Jeddah. Our largest clients are government contractors, and 80% of our output is used to supply government projects. We are committed to the socio-economic development of the country and our long-term strategy is to ensure the competitiveness of Saudi steel across the MENA region. An example of our commitment to Saudi development is our investment in local talent. Currently, the sector relies heavily on the expertise of highly-skilled immigrants to operate the plants. Nonetheless, we are dedicated to the education and training of Saudi citizens and we are proud of our Saudi workforce. In partnership with the Saudi Standards Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO), we at Rajhi Steel are improving the sector in many ways, on par with those of the US and UK. To ensure that Saudi Arabia continues to remain attractive to foreign investors, we need to have a qualified workforce, high quality standards, and efficient legislation.</p><h4>The budget for the government's construction megaprojects correlates with the state's oil revenue. What impact does the price of oil have on supply-chain management?</h4><p><span></span>We believe that the drop in oil prices will not have a significant impact on the Saudi Arabian economy. Despite the oil price decrease, steel demand has not declined. The portfolio of Saudi construction projects for 2015 is worth at least $13.59 billion. Rajhi Steel has shown strong and steady growth since its inception, with a CAGR of 22% over the past three years. We expect that to continue, and are confident that, in accordance with the country's plans to continue investing in infrastructure, demand for steel will continue to grow. </p><h4>How is Rajhi Steel expanding its manufacturing capacity?</h4><p><span></span>Rajhi Steel had successfully expanded its rebar production capacity by 1 million tons by 2012. Our two new downstream specialty plants produce over 100,000 tons of cut and bend or custom-shaped steel, and we plan to inject more capital into these plants in the future. We currently produce high-quality steel to meet the short-term demand for the Kingdom. The steel bars we produce range from 5.5-40mm in diameter, and up to 12m in length. Each bundle weights 2 tons. Coil diameter ranges between 5.5-16mm, and coil weight is either 1.8 or 2.4 tons depending on the type of alloys used. In the long run, we hope to diversify our production. We are in the market for new production technologies that will enable us to be cost effective.</p><h4>If the government lifted the export ban on steel, what countries would become feasible markets for Rajhi Steel? </h4><p><span></span>During the global downturn in 2008, there was a shortage of heavy material in the local market. At the time, the government launched a law banning exports. Now that there is no longer a shortage, the export ban is being lifted. We are working with other steel manufacturers to try to get the ban lifted by the end of the year. In the long-run, we are interested in expanding into regional and African markets.</p><h4>What's your long-term vision for Rajhi Steel?</h4><p><span></span>Rajhi Steel is looking to invest in both back-integrated and forward-integrated plants to increase its competitiveness. With regard to the country's steel sector, according to our projections, demand levels will continue at the same rate for the next five to six years at least, without foreseeable problems. We are looking for new opportunities in the region, such as trade liberalization, as well as potential threats like the development of international steel producers in Turkey or Ukraine. We hope the government will consider applying appropriate legislations. The steel industry plays an important role in the diversification of the country's economy away from the oil and gas sector, and should be encouraged using a fair import and export tax regime. We believe that demand for steel in Saudi Arabia is going to be steady for the rest of the year, and we also expect stability in the costs of raw materials.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Tale of Three Cities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-tale-of-three-cities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current investment climate for Jubail and Yanbu Industrial Cities, and how will the Royal Commission work to attract more local and international investors?</h4><p>The Kingdom is keen to diversify its sources of income through the promotion of industry and provision of the right climate for domestic and foreign investment in the industrial fields. This is based on security and political stability and economic durability, as well as the existence of well-established laws and regulations and a judicial system that is characterized by a high degree of transparency and independence. In addition to this, a favorable investment climate should be enjoyed by the cities of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu. They enjoy many investment opportunities, whether in the petrochemical and mining sectors, or in the field of infrastructure and services. Cities of the commission are characterized by distinct strategic positions that enable investors access to global markets, and where available the necessary raw materials for petrochemical and mining industries at competitive prices. The cities are characterized by quality management. All these features qualify the Kingdom in general, and the cities of the Royal Commission in particular, to be a favorite destination for many investors. The cities of the commission have managed to contribute to the achievement of the ambitious aspirations of the Kingdom's leadership by succeeding to attract many investments over past decades. The cities Jubail, Yanbu, and Ras Al-Khair continue to achieve more accomplishments through well thought out plans to provide investment opportunities and present them to the potential investors to take advantage of the competitive edge enjoyed by the Kingdom. Recently, the Commission worked on the development of special locations in the industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu, known as PlasChem. These locations will provide an appropriate environment for the establishment of industries producing specialized chemicals and transformation industries for plastic products.</p><h4>How do you see the large developments in Ras Al-Khair city adding to the national economy and the surrounding region?</h4><p>The strategic view of Ras Al-Khair Industrial city is to transfer the Kingdom into a strategic axis in the mining industry at the national and global level. Ras Al-Khair is linked to the mines in the north and center of the Kingdom and Waad Alshamal city through railway lines to transport mineral ores, including concentrate phosphate and bauxite for the projects of Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to complete their manufacture and development of the relative manufacturing industries. It is then exported via Ras Al-Khair's modern port on the Arabian Gulf, which contains seven piers with work for seven more underway. This represents a new economic sector in its size that is identical to the industrial strategy and the strategic option of the Kingdom to diversify the base of the national economy and create job opportunities in the industrial mining sector. Ras Al-Khair Industrial City is also home to the largest production plant of water and electricity under Saline Water Conversion Corporation, producing 1.03 million cubic meters of water and 2,400MW of electricity.</p><h4>What international opportunities are there for SABIC to diversify its assets abroad?</h4><p>SABIC has a clear vision to become the leading and preferred global company in the field of chemicals. The company has a clearly defined integrated strategy until the year 2025. The world around us is changing quickly and competition has become stronger, especially with the increasing world population and limited natural resources. SABIC applies its vision and strategy to support its capacities to face said challenges, which requires fundamental changes in the way we work. Our strategy must be able to convert those challenges into successful and fruitful business opportunities for the company. We are fully aware of the extent of our continuing need to gain access to raw materials at competitive prices in order to maintain the steady growth of SABIC. The shale gas revolution in North America has provided competitive opportunities in the raw materials for the petrochemical industry, but a need remains to diversify our sources of raw material from several geographic areas around the world. Clearly, we have to diversify our package of sources of raw materials.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-solution]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are SWCC's strategies involving privatization, and what role will the private sector play in further developing Saudi Arabia's desalinization efforts?</h4><p><span></span>The privatization strategy consists of transforming the SWCC into a state-owned holding company with subsidiary production companies, and potential private sector participation in both the holding company and its subsidiaries. The holding company will be structured around a corporate core as well as smaller business units. The business units consist of old production areas, transmission business units, research institutes, and training centers. Private sector participation will be gradually introduced to increase value by creating production assets following the Independent Water and Power Project (IWPP) model. Privatized assets will consist of a bundle of existing production assets with new ones that should be developed. SWCC will retain a 40% stake in the new companies. Private sector participation will not be introduced in water transmission assets, the research institute, the training center, and some old production plants. The last phase of the privatization and restructuring program will focus on the introduction of private sector participation in the holding company, either through management contracts or through an IPO.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for foreign investors within the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The desalination industry in Saudi Arabia provides many investment opportunities. For example, construction opportunities exist for new desalination plants, such as the Rabigh 3, Jeddah 4, Jubail 3, and Haql 3 projects, among many others. Additionally, there are rehabilitation projects for existing SWCC plants. Opportunities also exist for the procurement of desalination equipment and chemicals. Capacity building for the training of Saudi engineers and joint research programs with the Saline Water Desalination Research Institute also provide additional opportunities for foreign partners. Finally, foreign investors have the opportunity with regard to coupling renewable energy—such as solar, wind, and nuclear energy—with desalination technologies such as membrane and thermal. </p><h4>How do Saudi Arabia's desalination efforts work together with its renewable energy initiatives?</h4><p><span></span>Water is an essential and important commodity for human survival.  Today it has become the most precious commodity on earth. The majority of the population of the world  doesn't have sufficient access to it and 70% of it is even without fresh water. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which falls in an arid region, also faces several challenges in water sectors such as the rapid increase in population, increase in water demand, high per-capita consumption, limited natural water sources, and industrialization. Desalination technology is an energy intensive process. SWCC plants use either gas or oil as source of energy and energy costs contribute almost 50% towards the cost of water. SWCC consumes around 3% of the daily kingdoms oil production. Hence, a great deal of attention is also being paid to tap alternative resources, such as renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear. Among the many options for renewable, solar energy is most suited for the Kingdom as everyone knows that intensity and brightness of sunshine in most parts of Kingdom is high and can be tapped for its energy, which is about 2,000 KW/sqm per year. Thus, to execute the SWCC's strategy for energy efficiency and diversification, numerous initiatives have been launched, such as joint collaboration agreements with national and international organizations, companies and universities, such as Hitachi Zosen, King Saud University, King Abdullah-City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, and the King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST). SWCC supports the efforts being made to find alternative renewable energy sources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities are there in the Saudi market for Schneider Electric?</h4><p>Schneider Electric has been in Saudi Arabia for the last 30 years through a joint venture with a local Saudi business. For us, Saudi Arabia represents a major opportunity for many reasons. We are in electrical distribution and power, building management, and industrial automation, in addition to our IT business. We have a portfolio of products that is relevant to what is happening in Saudi Arabia today. There are many areas that have attracted FDI and benefited the Kingdom. All of these areas require infrastructure projects, which Schneider Electric can be a part of. We also have a strategic relationship with the electrical company here, namely Saudi Electric. There are many infrastructure developments happening currently, which means more opportunities for distribution. This has created significant prospects for Schneider Electric, as well as opened up the market for us. Today, we operate with a vision to bring the best of Schneider Electric to the Kingdom and bring the best of the Kingdom to Schneider Electric. If you look at the historic vision of the leaders in the Kingdom regarding the country's place in the world, many opportunities emerge that have accelerated openings for Schneider Electric.</p><h4>How do you see the Kingdom balancing its rapidly rising energy demand with sustainable solutions?</h4><p>The leaders of the Kingdom have recognized the tremendous need for energy efficiency. We need this partnership and collaboration between the private and public sector. If you look at the power generation profile today, oil is the main source. The consumption of oil-generated power is actually on the increase. Utility companies have opened this sector up to private companies, and we are seeing new capacity being installed. The growth that has been projected for the economy suggests that the energy sector's consumption of oil will increase rapidly if it continues to use oil as an energy source. Now is the right time for sustainable energy consumption, which should be encouraged. We know that the price of electricity today is lower than that in other GCC countries; however, we should focus efforts on raising awareness among those who do not make conscious efforts to conserve energy. The creation of the Saudi Arabian Energy Commission is a step in the right direction, as is the introduction of a standard on imported energy goods with an efficiency rating of five stars. We are an active member of this committee and bring products in that are in compliance with this push. That is a great step in the right direction, but more can be done. Schneider Electric helps in so many areas, and we are actually one of the leading solutions providers for energy consumption. Part of our strategy is to label ourselves as a global energy management solutions provider. Most of the new products we have are targeted toward more efficient energy consumption. We not only promote this type of energy-efficient solution outside of our company, but inside as well. Globally, there has to be collaboration between governments, the private sector, and the people to promote the energy efficiency campaign and get its message out there. Through this, we have seen improvement in waste water management, too, which has been a major issue for the Kingdom since it relies so heavily on desalination.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the short term?</h4><p>We have been here for 34 years, and have continued to make plans for future contribution to the Kingdom's economic growth. We are working toward gaining government support as Saudi Arabia becomes a regional hub for our activities. This is all part of our strategy and business plan. For Schneider Electric, one thing is clear: we want to do more. That is something that we will never lose sight of or lose passion for. Not only do we want to grow the business, but we also want to be the best operation for Schneider Electric globally in terms of customer retention and satisfaction. We aim to position Schneider Electric as one of the best in our industry across the world and raise the bar high on solutions and effectiveness. We also want to be the employer of choice and set the standard for engagement in the energy market. This will take a lot of passion and hard work and Schneider Electric is determined.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the opportunities within the environment sector that Huta Environment will expand into?</h4><p><span></span>Opportunities within the environmental sector are diverse, ranging from various renewable energy sources to the regeneration of fragile ecosystems. Huta Environment has now designed and patented a system called “Eden Reef Blocks." This is an artificial reef establishment method that will regenerate reef areas that have been degraded due to marine development and various point and non-point sources of pollution. The results of this application to date have been amazing considering the short period of time from its implementation. The latest assessments conducted show a complete restoration of the marine ecosystem. In addition, we are venturing into renewable energy and are currently sourcing areas within the Kingdom with our European partner, Community Wind Power, with the intention of developing wind farms on a commercial scale.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you have here that are specific to Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The prime challenge within Saudi Arabia from an environmental perspective is the unique Red Sea aquatic ecosystem. The conservation of marine protected areas, especially the endemic species and their habitats will ensure the diversity and abundance of the Red Sea coastal and marine ecosystems.</p><h4>What role should be private sector play to address the environmental needs and concerns of the country? </h4><p>The private sector has a major role to play in order to address the environmental needs and concerns, by implementing training and awareness programs. There have been major improvements, under the guidance of the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME), with emission levels and various other sources of pollution greatly reduced. With continued input from the private sector by way of in-house training and awareness programs, further improvements can be achieved.</p><h4>How would you characterize the current level of awareness in the private sector for foreign investors regarding investment opportunities related to environmental protection?</h4><p>The Presidency of Meteorology and Environment has an extensive awareness program that provides all-encompassing opportunities to the private sector. There are currently numerous ongoing environmental protection programs in Saudi Arabia. The majority of those are implemented by PERSGA, King Abdul Aziz University, The Saudi Environmental Society, and Marine Science College King Fahd University of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. The Gulf Environmental Forum, held annually in Saudi Arabia, provides the ideal platform.</p><h4>Do you see the local market as being large enough to sustain growth for Huta Environment, or are you thinking of expanding outside of the Kingdom as well?</h4><p>The continual local market growth within the Kingdom provides Huta Environment with continuous growth opportunities. We have recently established offices in the Eastern Province in order to ensure that we maintain our professional standards to clients in the region. Expansion outside of Saudi Arabia started in 2014 with offices in Egypt, Bahrain, and Qatar, and we are currently reviewing opportunities in South Africa and Morocco.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the types of projects that you are involved in the country right now or that you would like to be involved with?</h4><p>Our innovative approach and tailored service and advice on site-specific issues has established our presence as pioneers in the field of environmental impact assessment studies. Our in-house knowledge and our diverse pool of skills are well known within the local and international markets. The types of projects to which we provide custom-made solutions are sourced from both the public and private sector. Huta Environment, a pioneer in environmental rehabilitation and restoration of coastal resources, recognizes the importance of mangroves in the ecosystem of the Kingdom.</p><h4>What is your vision over the next 10 years for Huta Environment?</h4><p>Considering the current dramatic impacts of global warming and climate change, Huta Environment is structured to provide sustainable development strategies to our clients. With our current involvement in renewable energy, wind and solar, it is our intention to develop this capability within the Kingdom and provide an eco-friendly environment.</p><h4>For the remainder of 2015, what expectations and targets do you have that you hope to accomplish?</h4><p>We are currently constructing a medical waste treatment facility in Riyadh, which will provide the latest technology in the treatment of medical waste, using the ecosteryl microwave system. This will be fully operational in November 2015. Ecosteryl feasibility studies are currently ongoing in Jeddah and Dammam with the intention of expanding our capability by year-end.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major investments do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>Shell is seen as a responsible corporation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the social activities we deploy in the country are well regarded and valued. We first try to understand a society's needs, and then we make sure our social investment programs address those needs. At the moment, we run four programs—a highly-acclaimed entrepreneurship training program and a road safety program, to name a few. When it comes to commercial activities, we are happy to have been in the Kingdom for 75 years and are looking forward to another 75 years or more. We have a keen interest in growing our presence in the country, both on the upstream side in exploration and production of gas, and on the downstream side, where we are involved in refining and chemicals. We have a joint venture with SABIC in petrochemicals, and there are discussions of future investments that we could contemplate together both in Saudi and abroad. What may not be widely known is that our partnerships with Saudi Arabia extend beyond the borders of the Kingdom. The largest “Saudi" Joint Venture is in fact in the US, a partnership with Saudi ARAMCO in Motiva that includes three refineries, including the largest US refinery at Port Arthur. This shows that the respect we have earned through our activities in the Kingdom has allowed us to successfully partner outside the country. With SABIC too, we are currently in discussion on projects we could be undertake outside the Kingdom.</p><h4>What plans does Shell have to be more involved in the Kingdom's gas exploration?</h4><p>In mid-2014, we decided to end further investment in our joint venture with Saudi Aramco, which started in 2003. In that decade, we invested a considerable amount of money to explore for gas in the Empty Quarter. You will appreciate that this being an extremely remote area, and the fact  that the gas resources in that area are particularly difficult to produce, and requires many wells, are factors that have contributed to this decision. However, it is good to see we were able to  go our separate ways with mutual respect. If in the future fresh opportunities arise in the Kingdom, we want to be at the front of the line for those opportunities with ARAMCO. It is up to the Saudi Government to decide on the development of its resources as they did a decade ago, in an initiative whereby certain areas in the Empty Quarter, and only those areas, were offered to international investors. It led to the creation of four joint ventures, of which Shell partnered with ARAMCO. If the Kingdom sees value in continued investment by international companies in gas exploration, the government would have to take actions similar to the one they took a decade ago. Saudi Arabia realizes that more gas is required for the existing and growing petrochemicals industry, not just in the eastern, but also the western part of the country. There is still a lot of power generated by diesel and crude oil. The Kingdom has an intention to do away with that and to use gas for power generation, which is much more economical and environmentally friendly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-new-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is the current market large enough to sustain the 35 insurance companies, and what is your outlook regarding mergers and acquisitions?</h4><p><span></span>Some of the 35 companies have already suffered losses, because the major business available in the market is either medical or motor fleets where usually profit margins are thin. The major business of the country is oil and gas, and this should be the main target for insurance companies, for decades we have been dependent upon international firms to handle this business, and it will take time for the Saudi market to be able to set up firms that are sizable enough with expertise and knowledge to be able to take on such large accounts with sizable retentions. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, companies will have to do this if they want to survive and continue onward. Perhaps a merger between those that are suffering should be enforced, because now the stake is limited and everybody is chasing the same piece of cake and due to size differences, economies of scale are not in favor of the smaller insurance players. Medical for example, has gone through phases, and is constantly improving. The government will eventually move from fully subsidizing the health sector to asking insurance companies for medical coverage, this will also open up more business for insurance companies. Despite the size of motor premiums in the market, there remain  growth opportunities within motor  insurance where coverage is still below potential. As for other lines of business, several compulsory lines are currently being reviewed by SAMA, the regulator, and they are not wasting any efforts in enhancing the sector. </p><h4>Chedid Re has made significant progress in the market since its entry five years ago. Where do you hope to see the company over the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>The sky is the limit for us we have the expertise, talent , commitment, and devotion, to do the extra mile for our clients. We are committed to a full fledged operation in the Kingdom. With time we are hoping to attract more qualified Saudis into the insurance business and/or continuing our internal trainings. Do not forget that this sector is fairly new to the country, and so we hope that with time there will be more universities in the Kingdom that offer insurance studies and specialize in this area, which will grow over time the number of Saudis in the sector. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the remainder of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We cannot hide the fact that the drop in oil prices is going to slightly impact, and maybe slowdown growth. However, as our King declared recently, the government will continue to support major infrastructure projects from the huge reserves that the government has, and we hope that oil goes back to the levels that are beneficial to both sides. Gradually, Saudi Arabia is trying to move away from being totally dependent upon oil revenue, which is why the government is encouraging foreign investment in different industries. We have seen that there is a focus on setting up high-quality industrial zones and industrial cities across the country; however, this will take time. Eventually, the country will be really diversifying revenues outside of the oil sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea of establishing the Beirut Art Fair arise?</h4><p>Our motivation is to open roads between cultures, between the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, as our passion is to promote a global dialogue predominantly motivated by art. Beyond stereotypes and fashionable productions, beyond ideologies, religions, and political views, our desire is to organize events that promote a dialogue between cultures as well as one that broadens horizons, and the Beirut Art Fair is a perfect example.</p><h4>What will be the main highlights of Beirut Art Fair 2015 taking place in September?</h4><p>For its new edition, Beirut Art Fair brings together around 50 galleries. They will present both established and emerging artists. Among them, around 20 new international galleries are joining us. Beirut Art Fair offers for the first time a journey through digital art with Bankmed as the main partner. In addition, for the first time in Beirut, a selection of videos of the international renowned artist Martina Abramovic will be presented. Roundtables have been organized on topics focusing on the changes affecting the art market. These topics and themes are put within the Middle East, North Africa, South and South East Asia (ME.NA.SA) context. We have also invited renowned personalities on the international artistic scene: collectors, curators, directors of cultural institutions, and organizers of international fairs. A major moment at the fair will be presenting new talents to discover in photography through the Byblos Bank Award, and new young designers with the BLC Design Platform, with the selection of gallery owner Loic Le Gaillard, one of the founders of Carpenter Workshop Gallery. A VIP Program is being developed thanks to the support of HSBC Private Bank, which includes private visits of art collections specially organized for foreign art collectors coming to Beirut for the first time to visit Beirut Art Fair. New charity associations, among them Dar Onboz and Brave Heart Fund, will be also featured this year. The third edition of Beirut Art Week with a new itinerary “outside the walls,“ presenting monumental artworks and installations, will be showcased in the streets and in the shops of Beirut Central District.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the global art market?</h4><p>The world of art has been transformed in recent decades—in large part due to changing financial undercurrents. As noted by a veteran art dealer, Jeffrey Deitch, “the art world used to be a community, but now it's an industry.“ Moving from a sales environment previously dominated by the urban art worlds of museums and galleries in Paris, Berlin, London, and New York, today's artists and art galleries must now confront a shifting paradigm for marketing works of art. With the increased costs of art production and marketing, many artists face an even greater financial challenge in the attempt to make a living selling art can be either easy or hard depending on circumstances.</p><h4>What is your assessment of knowledge and perception of the Lebanese population towards culture?</h4><p>The Lebanese are eager to learn, discover, follow the trends, and be up to date in terms of what is happening around the world. They are multilingual, which adds to their ability to have greater exposure. Our constant challenge to bring the best galleries and the best cultural program at each edition of Beirut Art Fair is also to always be up to the expectations of the Lebanese who have a high level of cultural knowledge.</p><h4>What can be done to boost tourism in Lebanon?</h4><p>Since the fair's inception, Beirut has experienced, simultaneously, a significant artistic development. To boost tourism in Lebanon, it would be ideal to promote the country as an “art destination“ and offer different highlights on the cultural scene. With the opening of new institutions such as the Sursock Museum, the Aishti Foundation and the organization of numerous artistic and cultural events, Lebanon has all the requisite criteria to be considered an Art Destination. This would go hand in hand with international festivals occurring in Lebanon throughout the year gathering international artists and performers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[its-in-the-water]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the role of the private sector developing as a solution for the Kingdom's growing water demand?</h4><p><span></span>In 2006-07, the Kingdom had a large strategic plan concerning the water sector. From then, the water and waste water privatization started with the inception of the National Water Company (NWC) which was established in 2008. This strategic plan was presented to acquire the major cities within the Kingdom—Riyadh, Jeddah, Makkah, and Ta'if—in its first phase. This represented the initial listing for the entire privatization of the sector with more cities to come in the future. It indeed played a major role in reshaping the water sector in the country with more focus on customer care and enhancement in supply demand management. The objective of this strategic transformation is to encourage private national and international players in the sector to enhance the water infrastructure and operation in the Kingdom. This will allow private sector investment to participate in this high potential market in all green and non-green field projects.</p><h4>What types of projects are you focusing on now for Nesma Water &amp; Energy?<br></h4><p>Nesma is involved in many types of projects. One of our focused areas is operations and maintenance. Currently, Nesma is operating many plants for the National Water Company and for the Ministry of Water and Electricity as well as other private and semi-government sectors.  </p><p>The second sector is the plants construction, in which Nesma has participated in the national strategic rush project for the Riyadh Water Enhancement Program (RWEP), where Nesma along with other contractors have managed to construct 43 different water plants in 27 locations within Riyadh City in only six months, for the NWC. The third sector is the infrastructure projects, which includes the water and power utilities infrastructure; for example, the RWEP with the different sites was a strategic project for the nation. It was a rush project to deliver around 250,000 cubic meters per day. Nesma participated heavily in this project despite the many challenges faced during the construction phase due to the nature and complexity of the project, which included digging wells down to 2,500m. Nesma and the whole nation are very proud of this project as it was awarded the best global water project during the national water summit in Paris in early 2014. Part of our infrastructure works is two large projects in the north of Jeddah, in which Nesma is responsible for all the infrastructure, including water pipelines, water connection, irrigation, potable water, waste water networks, storm drainage, electrical cables, and substations, as well as complete road construction and traffic signs. Both projects are significant for the development of the industrial and residential areas of north Jeddah.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Nesma Water &amp; Energy?</h4><p>Nesma is expanding rapidly, especially with a fast changing market such as the Saudi construction sector. The minute we get a project, we will expand, not for the project but for the entire company. The number of people and assets we have has grown dramatically over the past two years. The more we have, the more we are ready for the next expansion. Our next goal is to get into public-private partnerships (PPP), BOO, and BOOT concept projects with the government and/or the private sector. We feel that we have the desire and the financial capability to do this. I hope the chance will come soon so that we can materialize our strategic objectives over the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Regulations regarding the mandatory use of health insurance for specific segments of Saudi Arabian society have evolved over the years. What have been the most important recent regulatory changes, and what are the most important for the upcoming year?</h4><p>We are expecting to rollout new regulations regarding the addition of mandatory insurance for visitors. In the near future, we are working on the addition of the Saudi domestic workers segment. Furthermore, we are currently working on the CCHI mandate itself in an effort to ensure it is more adaptive to the current changes and future predicted trends in the industry.</p><h4>What can be done, from a government or regulatory standpoint as well as from the private sector, to further increase the level of penetration within the Kingdom?</h4><p>As the market follows a steady curve and the industry evolves, the awareness, legislature, and governance will evolve with it. With additional integration between the two sectors, government and private, through the adoption of innovative electronic solutions and systems, integration between the two sectors will make the service more accessible, and, therefore, enable better penetration. At this point in time, it is difficult to determine when we shall see a universal healthcare system in Saudi Arabia. Of course, adopting a universal system is one of the many potential methods to go about this issue; however, at this point it is still early to adopt such a prediction.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook on the future of the health insurance sector, in regards to sector growth and competitiveness? Can the sector sustain such a number of companies, or will we see mergers and acquisitions over the long term? </h4><p>There are 28 licensed health insurance companies and TPAs. Our outlook of the health insurance industry is that it is expanding. We believe that the demand on health services and health insurance services in Saudi Arabia will expand 100% in 2019, which is a huge shift that requires a lot of effort and change to both CCHI and the industry players, as well as the overall quality of health insurance companies and providers. We have to implement many changes, and assist the market in adapting these changes in order to maintain and improve quality of the services we offer now; therefore, we believe that the health insurance market can sustain additional companies when it is needed, as this is related to the industry's maturity stage.</p><h4>What are the CCHI's main goals and targets for the upcoming year?</h4><p>We are transferring the CCHI concept to an e-environment. All of our transactions and documentations will be web-enabled. We are adapting a model of change in our strategy, policy, and structure to cope and expand within the online market. One of the major tools adopted in developing this organization is moving ahead to an e-environment setting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current regulatory framework?</h4><p><span></span>Looking at the time spent by the regulators up until today, the state of insurance in Saudi Arabia is a success story. The achievements are broad, in terms of the time spent and we are seeing continuous improvements in the regulatory framework within the country. However, in any new industry, we face many challenges, and it will take some time for the regulations to take effect. There are lots of compliance issues from most insurance companies, because it is a new thing for everybody. Compliance was a major issue for most companies, but moving forward we see a brighter picture, because being a leader, you also want to be the leader in terms of compliance, and sometimes you have to develop yourself before anyone else and prepare for any future requirements that come to the company.</p><h4>How are you challenging the poor awareness or perception of insurance over time? </h4><p><span></span>Awareness is growing at a rapid rate, and we have started to see people increase their insurance policies, whether they are compulsory or non-compulsory. People have become more aware about the benefits of insurance, because in the beginning most people thought of insurance as being a burden, not a benefit; they saw it as being just part of the regulation and that they have to pay it to finish paperwork, and so forth. However, that is changing and the evidence of the success is seen on the medical-insurance side, when people retired or lost their jobs. Even though the government is providing healthcare, people become used to using private healthcare. </p><h4>How would you characterize the current level of local human capital in this sector and what are you doing as a company to raise this level?</h4><p><span></span>We invest a lot in our people, because we are strong believer in human capital being the backbone of the company. Tawuniya is busy providing the best quality training and on-the-job training for our staff. One of our national obligation is to employ more locals in the industry, and we currently have more than 77% of our current positions filled by locals. The difficult part, which is challenging for all companies, is that we do not have experts in Saudi insurance, and so the only way to overcome that is to bring in expatriates to train the Saudis and to get people to take on additional training as they go, in order to reach that level. It is not easy, it will take a couple of years to reach that level; however, we are proud to say that most of our current management team are Saudis, which is a pioneering vision in our sector, being a national company, and we also have lots of projects in terms of career paths and succession plans, and training programs for staff in order to reach the required high level of expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of the Saudi market in relation to Deutsche Bank Group's overall MENA strategy?</h4><p>Emerging markets in the overall context of Deutsche Bank's global business strategy are extremely important. Emerging markets obviously encompass many countries and regions, including Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Within MENA, the GCC is a critical part. Saudi Arabia, being the largest economy in the GCC and one of the largest among emerging economies, has a special place within the overall strategy of the bank. With a GDP of nearly $950 billion, a youthful population of 28 million, a solid fiscal position with significant buffers (notwithstanding the recent slide in crude oil prices), a stable and well-managed monetary and banking system, and a vibrant private sector, Saudi Arabia is one of the most attractive markets among its emerging market peers as far as the bank is concerned. This has been our view since establishing our presence in the Kingdom in 2006. And this is why we continue to invest in our Saudi platform. In addition to our well-established investment banking and corporate finance operation we invested heavily in a well-rounded corporate banking and transaction banking presence as well as in corporate treasury services. We are also growing our wealth management, custody, and brokerage business onshore.</p><h4>How does DSSA leverage Deutsche Bank's global reach to better serve its clients in Saudi Arabia? </h4><p>DSSA, though operating as a segregated legal entity in compliance with Capital Market Authority (CMA) regulations, is owned 100% by Deutsche Bank. Through robust service level agreements and other arrangements with all relevant entities of Deutsche Bank Group around the globe, we are seamlessly integrated into its fabric. Therefore, our clients launching an IPO or a bond issue, for example, get the benefit of the best that Deutsche Bank has to offer globally from our product, structuring, industry and risk distribution, and management teams and systems. This is the bedrock of our business approach to Saudi clients; delivering the best advice, service, and products that the Bank can deliver anywhere in the world with no compromises. The Saudi-based team manages client interfaces and helps clients with local products and services; however, in the end, we rely on the infrastructure and the various divisions of the Bank's centers of excellence all over the world to deliver value to our Saudi-based clients.</p><h4>How will the Saudi Stock Exchange's (Tadawul) further opening up to foreign investors affect DSSA?</h4><p>It is an important initiative for the Kingdom's securities market and for the CMA and Tadawul. DSSA has been a key player in this market since its inception in 2008 and we continue to have a prominent position. In terms of business, the opening of the market will generate a much larger amount of flows for our brokerage business and will grow the local custody business significantly. The amount of interest among our global clients is high. There are some concerns, however, and some questions and clarifications that I hope will be resolved and addressed in a proper way in time for that launch.</p><h4>How is DSSA developing local human capital in the finance sector?</h4><p>It is a well-established global policy for the Bank to do two things in every country we go into. The first is to develop the markets and help the regulators, exchanges, and key market players to actually make it broader, deeper, more efficient, and liquid. The second, which is just as important, if not more so, is to ensure that we hire, train, and develop local talent and human capital. That is critical for Deutsche Bank, and it is one of the reasons why we were successful, not just in the Kingdom but also in many other countries. If you look at our platform, we are about 60% Saudis, and our senior management are all Saudi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is MEFIC Capital expanding and diversifying its product range?</h4><p>MEFIC Capital has historically been opportunistic in terms of product development. We had our past successes due to launching products which gathered substantial interest from our esteemed clientele. We are currently known for our ability to generate income in the real estate market. We believe that this segment has plenty of room for growth. The future growth in the income-generating real estate space can be attributed mainly due to the evolving regulatory landscape in the region for this asset class. Also, in the past we have had tremendous success in terms of return generation within public assets. In specific, we are currently the market leaders in the money market segment in Saudi Arabia. Moving forward we see ourselves continuing to focus on creating product structures, which are unique and can fit the varied risk and return requirements of our clients. Working toward this, we see an increase in investments from our private equity funds. We are currently working on deals in the food and the retail sectors in Saudi Arabia. Our aim is to keep the growth momentum in our Assets Under Management (AUM) and we expect to more than double our AUMs to $1.6 billion by the end of 2015.</p><h4>How do you see the entry of Qualified Foreign Investors to the Tadawul affecting the market?</h4><p><span></span>In the short run, it is not expected to impact the market in a large way. The QFI group are  a different set of investors and are not traders. I think their affect in the long-term will be to change the share of individual traders. In Saudi Arabia, currently more than 90% of traders are retail and individual. Therefore the institutional rates are low, and I believe this will change. The QFIs are expected to focus more on the Blue Chip companies, which will push companies to strive to reach this level of corporate governance and disclosure practices. I believe that in the short term there will be no effect; however, in the long-term I think that is what we need. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the overall finance sector here in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span>The finance sector is trying to add more products to the market, and we are working together with the Capital Markets Authority at this time on many committees to at least assess what we have, while suggesting new products. My dream for MEFIC is to see the MEFIC REIT fund in the market. First of all, the Saudi investor has two types of investment, real estate or capital market, which is why we allow people to invest in products similar to REITs currently and give them a fixed income on an annual basis. We have to educate the people about investment banks. Until now, most people know very little about them; hence, it is a major challenge to educate them on the difference between a bank and an investment bank, and that has not taken place until now. </p><h4>What is your outlook or expectations for MEFIC Capital for the remainder of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>We are targeting $1.6 billion AUM by the end of 2015, and if we achieve that, which is our expectation and hope, then we are on the right track to achieve that target. We think we can do that; we have an excellent team. We think 2015 will be better than last year. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>With exception to Saudi Arabia's natural exposure to the international oil and currency markets, our society, culture, and national economy have been, to a large degree, insulated from the economic instability felt in many parts of the world. You can call it protectionist, conservative, or lucky, but in considering these adjectives, you may also consider calling it wise.</p><p>The global crisis, which began in 2007, was a regrettable financial tsunami that consumed livelihoods, homes, and uprooted financial institutions seen as symbols of economic strength and stability. Whether directly or indirectly, the impact of the crisis continues to haunt Europe, and the picture remains daunting. Indeed, due to the Kingdom's gradual but progressive steps toward global convergence, we have fortunately avoided experiencing this ill fate.</p><p>Our national economy has grown at 5.4% CAGR since 2010, fuelled by significant expenditure on education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which together comprised close to 50% of total government spending (on average) since 2010. Private sector contribution in the national economy has also continued to grow at a faster rate of 6.5% CAGR over the same period, rising from 37.7% in 2010 to 39.5% of real GDP by the end of 2014.<br>Whilst recent conditions in the international oil markets are expected to weigh heavily on the Kingdom's revenues, an important financial dynamic continues to counteract the impact of this decline; namely, the strong appreciation of the US dollar. Indeed, every dollar of oil-export revenues earned by the Kingdom is 18% more valuable now from a global purchasing power perspective, than when the 44% decline in oil prices began in September 2014.</p><p>Though the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) erased 23% of its gains by the end of 2014 in response to the sharp fall in oil prices, the index has had close to zero correlation with oil prices over the last five years, and has maintained a weak positive correlation with the US dollar and US and EU markets over the same period. This relationship has not materially changed over the 12 months of 2014.</p><p>Though on the face of it the picture looks less than ideal, the expected $39 billion budget deficit in 2015 may actually represent an opportune strategic pivot point for further economic policy development. Indeed, notwithstanding the Kingdom's fiscal reserves of nearly $737 billion, a budget deficit in 2015 could actually induce the issuance of government bonds to fund the anticipated shortfall. Currently, Saudi government debt stands at an insignificant 2.7% of GDP, one of the lowest ratios in the world (versus 9.4% in Russia, 96% in the US, and 103% in the UK). The issuance of new government bonds would serve to establish a sovereign yield curve to act as a pricing benchmark for local issuers; this would then serve to stimulate the growth of private sector debt issuances, a significant topic on the national agenda, whilst also reducing the public and corporate cost of capital over the coming years.</p><p>Another topic of growing focus on the national agenda is the non-oil economy and its role in contributing to employment and sustainability. SMEs are at the very heart of this debate, asserted as engines of Saudi economic diversity. The topic of SMEs continues to gain momentum as policymakers speak of a total approach to tackling the cross-jurisdictional challenges these enterprises typically face, especially in terms of access to funding, licensing, intellectual property rights, and human resourcing. Advancement in these areas of policy focus will impact the Saudi economy, generally, and the capital market specifically.</p><p>A more imminent development set to have a profound impact on the capital market is the introduction of qualified foreign institutional investors; a new investor class, with permissible access to around $50 billion of Saudi stock market capitalization; expected to bring further diversity to our stakeholders, a more sophisticated investment outlook, and a longer -term investment horizon.</p><p>We are excited to be at the very center of this evolution knowing that it will redefine the boundaries of our scope and significantly expand our reach to global capital market stakeholders. In fact, we are currently finalizing a structured plan for reaching out to these new stakeholders via an international roadshow, which we hope will feature the critical pillars of our capital market community, including our regulator, issuers, members, and other important private and public sector stakeholders.</p><p>This, and other capital market developments, occur at a time when the Exchange is in the midst of activating its role as a self-regulating organization, whilst also being in the final leg of upgrading our trading engine to the latest in high performance trading technologies. The weight of these activities has prompted us to focus significant internal efforts in 2014 on detailed strategic planning, as well as on structural and cultural transformation, with the aim of strengthening our foundations and positioning ourselves for the future.</p><p>In 2014, we earned the honor of being voted Euromoney's Best Managed Financial Exchange in the Middle East for the third consecutive year. We ascribe this honor to the unwavering efforts of our staff who continue to respond to the evolving needs of our stakeholders whilst maintaining an exceptional level of market integrity and an outstanding operational track record. Indeed nearly 37 million trades were conducted over our platform in 2014, registering a seven year high of more than $572 billion worth of value traded; equating to trading velocity of 118%, the third highest amongst our emerging market peers. In addition, 2014 was also notable for the initial public offering of the National Commercial Bank, which stood as the world's second largest IPO and one of six listed on our platform during the course of the year. Looking ahead, we expect a minimum of eight IPOs in 2015 as a number of company filings approach the end of their regulatory review cycle.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the Exchange is expecting to make significant investments over the next five years in building internal capabilities, and honoring our national responsibilities. We firmly believe that the value we derive from our investments is measured by the contribution these investments make to our core values of trust, innovation, and excellence. Indeed, we believe that value for the Exchange, as emphasized by our strategic position in the national economy, is defined by the trust we earn from upholding the integrity and reliability of our market; the innovation we aspire to in developing market infrastructure, management processes, and in the design and delivery of our products and services; and the excellence we strive for across all customer value streams.</p><p>I am confident that these investments, combined with the prevailing policy dynamics and planned development initiatives, will see the Kingdom continue to emerge over the next five years to take its place as the natural regional hub of capital formation and the destination of choice for foreign capital flows.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Al Rajhi continue to invest in diversification?</h4><p>The Mohammad Al Rajhi holding company used to be a holding, managing all companies and with everyone reporting to them with 100% control. Now, all the companies have separated with independent board members. It gradually became a private equity investment house. Down the road, we will reduce our stakes. Today, we have sold 30%. To replace this 30%, we will diversify and invest somewhere else. Steel is an important business for us. We are one of the leading steel manufacturers and produce over 2 million tons of rebar. We are a 100% Saudi company. It was the core business of Al Rajhi when it went industrial. It started with home appliances and then steel. Today, we have two steel manufacturing plants, one in Riyadh and the second in Jeddah. Our base in the latter employs the latest technology. We have built our company on the latest technology and are one of the leaders in the market, like that of Danieli. We expect to grow further into the industry. We have a plan, through M&amp;A to grow and acquire a greater market share and spread all over the country and the GCC, as well as other emerging markets. We are studying existing strategies, with the first choice to go with an IPO of 30-40%. It is whatever the board and the stakeholders decide. The business of the steel industry in Saudi Arabia is growing, and there are many projects beginning. Many things need to be looked at, yet I believe steel will be our main choice to keep growing, establish a long track record, and maintain a market share. The board of Al Rajhi Industrial has decided to look for new opportunities. It said that it is an investment hub for industries, and wanted to invest in any opportunities related to the industry. In 2014, we invested in fiberglass. This was one of the opportunities that we opened recently. After that, we have three more areas of interest, one of which is food manufacturing. For our exit strategy in our companies, we will shift this money to consider new investment opportunities. We prefer to invest and work either in brown or mature investments rather than to be in the greenfield, which is not in our scope.</p><h4>In the short term, what are your expectations or priorities to have finished by the end of this year?</h4><p>We want to spin off some of the companies that we work and manage 100%, and we are looking to invest in two or three different companies. By the end of 2015, three companies will be separated and might have possibly gone public. We will need to make a decision regarding investing in other sectors. These are my ultimate goals for 2015. You can say that this is the beginning of a new phase at Al Rajhi. We are seriously looking to build up a strong private equity company whereby we can acquire more companies in manufacturing and industry. The record of the Mohammed Abdulaziz Al Rajhi Company for the last 20 years has been that of a success story. We are one of the great companies in the market and have built up a strong know-how over the last 50 years and built a track record that we have capitalized on. Today, we need to capitalize on companies with a proven track record that have done well and are well-established. They need to be leaders in the industrial area. We need to take this privilege and capitalize on any company that we acquire. We will introduce corporate governance, a vision, a mission, as well as management. We have done it previously and went through many learning curves. However, at the end of the day, we did well by having these companies well positioned. We took the principle of them and applied it to others. I would even like to give this experience to other family companies in which the founder is getting old, and in which the second generation is not in a position to manage its wealth. It would be good for them to come and knock on our door and tell us that they need to partner with us. We will introduce our value-added concepts into the company and make it larger, give it more corporate governance, and a clear direction based on our track record.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Maceen Capital getting more involved in solving the housing deficit from a financial perspective?</h4><p>Accessing the Saudi market is not easy. You have to be on the ground to understand the dynamics of the real estate market. It has to really be translated well in terms of rewards and risks associated. We have witnessed a drop in real estate market by 14% over the past eight months. We believe this was mainly driven to the announcement of a 30% down-payment in order to receive a mortgage loan. In addition, the main challenge is the availability of land and the quality of developers. It is a supply side issue. The latest legislative decisions on raising white land fees will provide a major boost for land to be readily available for assistance, therefore putting pressure on prices and shrinking the bubble.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the opening up of Tadawul to QFIs?</h4><p>The most important effect is confidence. There will definitely not be a huge inflow of cash in the short term as investors will be cautious until the vision of registration process and inclusion in MSCI is clear. However, the entry into the market will boost the confidence of local investors and encourage them to invest more. It is substantial. The main objective will be volatility reduction through increasing institutionalized effect on the market movements and improvement of corporate governance through leveraging on worldwide investment perspective. It will improve, but not substantially. What will really help is having effective regulations in place. Of course, improvements are always required. Maybe the advent of foreign investors will help speed up the process, as will the international angle in all decision-making processes. It is a fantastic opportunity for international investors to diversify their books as well. It is a shortcut for FDI. This is about going through the backdoor to the capital market.</p><h4>For Maceen Capital, how do you plan on taking advantage of this opening?</h4><p>This definitely will help boost the company's portfolio. Maceen circle of competence is portfolio management. We believe QFI will target investment houses that have the knowhow and understanding of TASI to run their investment book from abroad. This is how Maceen can leverage such opportunity.</p><h4>This opening has been long-awaited by foreign investors. How would you characterize the level of interest you have seen from foreign investors in the Saudi stock market?</h4><p>We are considered the largest stock market in GCC and QFIs will have the opportunity to directly invest in exceptional companies that have solid fundamentals, especially tapping into the banking and petrochemical sectors in Saudi Arabia. There is a lot of enthusiasm about this. The appetite of foreign investors toward TASI has been witnessed by the swap transactions that took place before the announcement, around SAR7.5 billion. We will see excellent transactions in the banking sector, in particular from foreign investors as well as in petrochemicals once oil prices rally.</p><h4>There has been much debate about the correlation between price of oil in Saudi Arabia and the performance of the stock market. What are your views now on how these lower prices are affecting the outlook of the stock market?</h4><p>We believe the relationship between the stock market and oil prices was never linear. However, there is only psychological correlation between oil prices and the stock market. We have sectors that are defensive, but it is mainly investor sentiments that drives movements in the market from oil price fluctuations. We have witnessed a recovery in the oil prices and the market started correcting since beginning of this year. Oil prices have recovered substantially, and I believe they will continue to recover as shale gas producers are drowning with huge debt and they are pressured to reduce their production. I do not believe the oil price freefall will put any pressure on government expenditure given our strong foreign reserves and capacity to issue sovereign debt as current debt level represents only 1.6% of GPD, while in the US, for example, it is 100%. This should give comfort to investors over the short term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[What’s Corporate Governance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[whats-corporate-governance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your emphasis on corporate governance—from family-owned to a holding company—translated into success for SEDCO Holding Group?</h4><p>Our corporate governance journey is a long one. I hear about many companies that want to go into corporate governance and separate ownership from management, however, it is not done in a day. For us, it has taken over 15 years, starting with a decisive directive from the owners of the company. We see many companies that are family businesses where the owner wants to separate ownership from management, but for one reason or another, they do not. They might have a non-family CEO, but these CEOs have no real power. It has taken us some time, but by looking for the best personnel in the market, we have made that transition. For example, if you look at the board of the holding company, it has eight members, three of which are from the family, but five are not, with some even from outside Saudi Arabia. This is a powerful message that states they all have equal voting power. The outside directors can out-vote the family members, because egalitarianism is critical. I am the fourth non-family CEO. Like I said, this journey has been ongoing for some time, and it underscores how much we have transitioned from a family business to a conglomerate with strong corporate governance, a board, subsidiaries, and companies that report to the board, among other organizational structures. In my previous job, I worked at a bank and I used to deal with  many family businesses in Saudi. I was surprised when I moved to SEDCO and found a strong corporate governance model put in place by the owners and not the regulators. We do not have outside directors imposed upon us; we make such decisions internally with every decision maker's consent.</p><h4>What are some sectors that you are looking to grow into in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We are looking to diversify and expand in two ways through horizontal and vertical integration. From the vertical point of view, we have a number of existing companies that are trying to grow and expand their business. For example, in our F&amp;B business Tarfeeh, we are opening more restaurants, and growing the number of brands in our portfolio. Another example from our hospitality business is Elaf Group, where we are building new hotels and expanding the portfolio of 3, 4 and 5 star hotels. In terms of horizontal growth, we have several businesses in different sectors, so we are looking at how we can utilize the synergies between these companies to grow and service the group and then expand externally. </p><h4>How do you see the Saudi economy developing over the next five years?</h4><p>If you look at the population of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, we are the largest and we have a young population. In other words, we have strong consumption power and our GDP growth is healthy. The economy has strong foreign currency reserves, and even if the oil prices are low, we can still tap into the reserves. Besides, there are many important projects currently underway in the Kingdom. For instance, the religious tourism &amp; hospitality sectors, which are inter-linked, are revenue generating and job creating on their own. Also, Saudi has opened its stock market to foreign investors as of June 2015. All matters considered, the economic outlook of Saudi Arabia is inspiring.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have lower oil prices affected the Eastern Province's economy, and how do you see the region responding over the remainder of the year and into 2016? </h4><p>Saudi Arabia's economy, as a whole, is less likely to be affected by falling oil prices. The Eastern Province is the heart of Kingdom's industrial activities and home to many ongoing megaprojects. It is able to withstand the effects of fluctuations in oil prices. The first and foremost assurances for keeping the country's economy afloat came from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, when he said, “Though oil prices are in the downward trend and affecting the economy, we are working to limit the effects on the country's overall development march." There are reasons why the Saudi economy will not feel the crunch of lower oil prices. It is because the government is committed to maintaining spending to prevent the negative implications of the crisis. Moreover, the Saudi economy has the ability to weather the current storm of declining oil prices by tapping into its huge reserves of $683 billion. The Saudi government has previous experiences in dealing with such situations of falling oil prices in the past and it had overcome those crises successfully. Generally, the Saudi economy has strong fundamentals supported by years of strong economic growth, which averaged 5.5% annually. Most importantly, the key contribution to economic growth comes from the non-oil sector, which on average grows by 6.8% per year, compared to oil sector growth of 1.6%. In addition, the national budget for 2015 has already envisaged a record projected expenditure of $229.3 billion, which will support government spending.</p><h4>Within the Eastern Province, what are the major opportunities for private sector and foreign investments over the coming years? </h4><p>The Eastern Province is called the economic engine of Saudi Arabia, offering enormous trade and business opportunities for local and foreign investors. It is the most important industrial region of Saudi Arabia, contributing 60% of GDP to the national economy. This province represents nearly half of the Kingdom's industrial investments and around 90% of the country's both oil and non-oil exports contributing significantly to the Kingdom's drive to diversify its income away from oil. Although the Eastern Province is the center of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas industries, many manufacturing industries, such as petrochemicals, chemicals, steel, aluminum, plastics, and foodstuffs, have developed in the region. It has an internationally recognized petrochemical industry located in the Jubail Industrial Cities (I and II) and currently represent more than 7% of the total global supplies of petrochemical products. The Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) is behind the growth and development of the Kingdom's petrochemical industries. Most of its 17 manufacturing facilities including 14 joint ventures established in cooperation with the world's major giants are located in Jubail.</p><h4>How is the Asharqia Chamber working to promote and develop employment opportunities for young Saudis in the Eastern Province? </h4><p>The development of the SME sector is key to creating more jobs for Saudis. Since its inception in 1952, Asharqia Chamber has been supporting the growth of SMEs, which represent nearly 90% of the total business establishments in the country. The Chamber has set up a SME Development Center through which scores of studies have been carried out to help local people start their own small and medium size enterprises. The SME Development Center has organized many seminars, symposia, conferences, and workshops to educate and keep the owners of SMEs abreast of the latest in technology and sources of financing. The Chamber has launched the best SME Award to encourage private companies to play a larger role in the economy. With the Nitaqat labor law in place that, until the middle of 2014 had created over 600,000 jobs for Saudis, there have been some impacts of the system on the SME and Asharqia Chamber has been working with the Labor Ministry to reduce the Saudiization pressure on small enterprises.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From a regulatory standpoint, what advantages are there in Saudi Arabia for prospective foreign investors? </h4><p>It is important to see the country in a historical light. In the past 10 years, KPMG has basically transformed investment completely. The Foreign Investment Act, Capital Market Authority, and more than 25-30 legal platforms have been established to ensure business prosperity is granted. Today, we have a complete platform of legal framework. The judiciary platform has improved considerably over the last 10 years with King Abdullah's project to develop the legal system here. We have come a long way in terms of the improvement in business and civil courts; however, we are still in the process of improvement. We must develop the platform to meet demand from local and international investors. The company is in a strong position in terms of adapting these practices and creating a platform for investors. </p><h4>How do you leverage KPMG's global reach to better suite your clients locally in the market?</h4><p>KPMG International is a global network of independent member firms with more than 162,000 people around the world in 154 countries. What the network can provide to an investor globally is that before they move any money we can provide a full due diligence of the investment environments, the investment platform, the opportunities within the country, and if they decide to invest we provide the logistics and supports starting with obtaining the license to operate within the country through the foreign investment act or we will establish a corporate structure and go through the whole operation cycle. We can take out the hassle for the investor by using our network. We are independent trusted advisors. We work to provide a clear picture of what is happening in the country and what might happen in the future. We serve our clients based on what is good for them. </p><h4>What sectors within the economy has the most interest from perspective foreign investors?</h4><p>All sectors are lucrative for investors. Approximately 60% of our population is below 25. GDP per capita increased from $13,000 in 2006 to $18,000 in 2015. All the sector services, tourism in religious areas, healthcare, education, and technology, will grow. Carbon and petrochemicals are already transforming to downstream and value-added industries. Any company that can provide services that help the country meet its demands in terms of providing quality services for the population of Saudi Arabia where the business community will be successful. Our economy is growing and has been growing. The companies are looking for areas where they can grow. This is the right time to be investing in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are KPMG's targets or expectations in Saudi Arabia for the remainder of this year?</h4><p>Our strategy for 2015 it to be the “Clear Choice" for our clients and our people. We will continue to be client focused and aligned to client and national priorities. Second, we want to ensure our people understand and are ready for regulation changes. We want them to maintain and improve the quality side our business to be able to add incremental value to our clients. Therefore, we have plans to conduct a lot of training to safeguard our plans and make sure that our people are on the right page. A key focus for our firm is to develop and retain Saudi talent. Third, we have a 40% target for reaching Saudization by the end of the year, which we are on target to achieve. We have short-term objectives for the year and the good thing is that economy's numbers are helping us to reach our main targets and objectives. The key message for anyone interested in investing in Saudi Arabia is to understand and appreciate the ground realities in the Kingdom; at times you get to hear negative press in the International media about the opportunities in the Kingdom. In reality, we have a strong economy and strong government, and we are in a leadership position both in the Arab and wider Muslim worlds. Saudi Arabia is a member of the G20 and its name is known everywhere, not only because of its political power but also because of its economic power.</p>]]></richbody0content>

More than 150 gas turbine parts are being serviced in Saudi Arabia by qualified and trained Saudi suppliers for the center. We are supporting SME growth and ensuring that they are enabled to become not only local suppliers but global suppliers for GE and the industry. There are many ways you can support the economy. One way is to support Saudi SMEs. We have worked with Aramco and others to run an annual Saudi Suppliers Conference in Dammam, where we meet with SMEs and discuss areas of development, opportunities for growth, and how we can support them and enable them to grow. The outcome from that kind of relationship has established more than 290 Saudi suppliers and 140 SMEs for GE in the Kingdom. Several Saudi suppliers are also involved in manufacturing parts for GE's global gas turbine network as well as producing mechanical, fluid, and electrical systems for power plants. Globally, GE can get parts and services from Saudi SME companies in Saudi Arabia. This also supports the economy.</p><h4>Can you talk about the future role of GE's Manufacturing Technology Center (GEMTEC)?</h4><p>GEMTEC is a key strategic center. The center is a significant investment in the Kingdom and in the manufacturing industry. We have marked the fourth year of operations of the GE Manufacturing Technology Center, which is today a regional service and manufacturing hub and center of excellence for advanced gas turbines. We have expanded the center significantly since its launch in 2011, and are now gearing up to manufacture the first high-efficiency, heavy duty gas turbine in the Kingdom by 2016. The best technology that can fit Saudi Arabia's needs can be manufactured at the center. This center is also key because it hires and educates many Saudi engineers. Right now, the center has achieved about 70% nationalization, with many additional job opportunities being created for Saudis. Since its launch, the center has created more than 700 jobs. At the same time, we have utilized this shop to support more than 70 customers in around 30 countries worldwide. It is not in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Arabia; it is in Saudi Arabia for the whole world. In fact, nearly 80% of all parts assembled at the center are for external markets including Europe and the US as well as GE's manufacturing facilities globally. We are hiring the right people, and we are very proud to have female Saudi engineers working in the shop as well. The center will further expand its capabilities to include a first-of-its-kind repair research and development center to support the gas turbines. Our customers, such as Aramco, are monitoring this closely, visiting us and giving us the right encouragement and support. We are currently servicing more than 500 gas turbines here, so you can imagine how important this is. This further supports Saudi Arabia's focus on strengthening exports and manufacturing to boost economic growth and competitiveness.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals and priorities in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We will continue to partner in the transformational growth of the economy and to support the Kingdom's goals in promoting the manufacturing sector and economic diversification. This is evidenced by our goal to manufacture the first gas turbine here in the Kingdom at GEMTEC in Dammam in 2016. We will also continue to advance the $1 billion investment commitment to the Kingdom. We are investing in people, knowledge transfer, and many aspects of the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After visiting the Kingdom twice since September 2014, how would you characterize the importance of developing Italian-Saudi economic ties in relation to the Ministry's regional and even global mission? </h4><p>Italy is the second-largest manufacturing economy in Europe and has a strong export performance. Italian exports have been growing consistently in past years and have a rising impact on GDP. The country's industrial basis, which mainly relies on SMEs, is large and diversified with a high innovation rate. When I visited Saudi Arabia in September 2014 and January 2015, I had the chance to appreciate how successfully the country has embarked on an ambitious path to diversify its economy and foster local entrepreneurship through SMEs and investments in human capital. I believe Italy and the Kingdom make ideal partners within a framework of long-term commitment and cooperation based on best practices sharing, technology transfer, training, and joint investments.</p><h4>In 2014, there were over 60 Italian companies operating in Saudi Arabia, with investments totaling roughly $3 billion. How do you see Italian participation in the Saudi economy developing over the next five years?</h4><p>Italian FDI in Saudi Arabia fall mainly under two sectors: infrastructure and energy. We boast a successful and decade-long partnership with Saudi Arabia in these domains. Within the EU, Italy is the largest importer of Saudi goods and the second-largest exporter to the Kingdom. Nevertheless, long-standing relationships always need new initiatives to keep pace with a changing reality. One of the main avenues for our bilateral cooperation in the future are joint investments in Italy, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere across a wide range of sectors, including tourism, healthcare, and renewable energy. This will be the most promising way to give new impetus to our relationship with mutually beneficial results.</p><h4>What major projects or initiatives are currently underway or planned to strengthen the economic relations between Italy and Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Exchange of high-level visits focused on our political and economic agenda, business delegations, scientific research programs, and joint pilot projects in high-value industries are the main leverages for boosting the economic relations between Italy and Saudi Arabia. These visits enrich the partnership, introducing new areas of cooperation and keeping it on pace with global trends. Nowadays, Italy is offering its foreign partners a more and more attractive business environment, not only from a legal point of view, but because of its strong economic fundamentals. Our business people firmly believe in internationalization, innovation, and global partnerships. I believe there is a huge potential for Saudi investments in Italy, especially in technology-intensive industries that are the backbone of the Kingdom's diversification plans. Unfolding this potential is part of our main focus and it will be the new frontier of our cooperation. </p><h4>As Saudi Arabia strives to become a more knowledge-based economy, in which ways can Italian collaboration and technology help to achieve this goal? </h4><p>Italy boasts a wide and advanced industrial basis with a major role for SMEs. Italian SMEs combine their unique district-based production model with innovative, global, and forward-looking production strategies. Most of them enjoy an outstanding export performance and represent points of reference for niche markets worldwide. Their products are found in the upper part of the global value-chain. They also have a major impact on job creation. I see great potential for our SMEs-based model as a way to promote entrepreneurial awareness in the Kingdom, foster the shift toward a knowledge-based economy, boost human capital, and combat unemployment among young Saudi people. Closer partnerships between Italian and Saudi SMEs can help the latter develop leading global technology.</p><h4>What are the major short-term goals for the Ministry regarding Italian-Saudi economic relations, as well as your long term vision and strategy for this relationship?</h4><p>In the short term, we are mainly working on bridging the “information gap“ that is still preventing the Italian-Saudi economic cooperation from fully meeting its potential. This means fostering closer contacts between our business people, identifying pioneering projects and, in general, making investment opportunities in both countries better known. All countries suffer from misperceptions and stereotypes, and Italy and Saudi Arabia are not exceptions. When it comes to our relations, this means we need to move beyond oil and gas and open up new areas for joint initiatives. Once we make this step, I expect the Italian-Saudi cooperation to be an even more successful one as we can perfectly match Italy's longstanding expertise with Saudi Arabia's ambitious vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Saudi Arabia and the rest of the GCC improve their collaboration in regards to security and defense?</h4><p>For some time now, the GCC has realized, because of the complexity and multitude of threats it faces, that its security depends totally on working together and coordinating the activities of its military, police, and all other services and agencies involved in security. Work began some years ago to enhance the alliance's joint capabilities in key areas on land, sea, and in the air to ensure that interoperability of doctrine, weapon systems, training, and communications, for example, were harmonized. In addition, the GCC Supreme Council, particularly during the 2013 and 2014 meetings, made certain decisions that will have a long-term impact on bringing our nations even closer in a security sense. The major decisions made were to establish: a GCC Unified Command Headquarters to enhance military interoperability and information sharing; a GCCPOL (similar to Europol) to improve policing in the fight against serious trans-border organized crime and extremism; a GCC Emergency Management Centre to identify and prepare the GCC against all major and potentially destabilizing risks; and, finally, and importantly, an agreement was reached to create a GCC Academy for Strategic and Defence Studies to consider resilience against all threats. These institutions will not only act as focal points for improving coordination, cooperation, communication, and trust between members, but will also enhance external links by connecting into other regional and global establishments. In all these areas, Saudi Arabia has played a full and leading role. It is also worth mentioning that the Kingdom has established a permanent International Centre for Dialogue in Vienna, with the aim of fostering understanding between different religions and cultures. In addition, it has offered funding and asked that consideration be given to establishing a Global Centre to coordinate activities to counter terrorism and extremism in all its forms. In summary, the nations of the GCC are doing a great deal to improve security collaboration.</p><h4>Greater integration within the GCC or the formation of a GCC union has been discussed. How do you see such actions affecting Saudi Arabia and the GCC overall?</h4><p>Any alliance relies on unity of vision, unity of purpose, unity of thought, and unity of effort. We in the GCC recognize the importance of working together, and I am glad to say that we have these psychological attributes of unity in plenty. As a result, we are integrating and getting closer to each other in many ways. Some examples of areas where members are collaborating more include: encouraging free markets and internal investment; providing for easier cross-flow of labor; ensuring that our intra GCC customs regulations are eased; and considering a common currency, amongst others. </p><h4>What are the GCC's short-term priorities and goals for 2015-16, and what role must Saudi Arabia play to achieve them?</h4><p>It is not for me to detail the Kingdom's activities, but it may help to consider the GCC's short-term goals within the context of security, social, and economic requirements. In terms of security, we all agreed that our principal goal is to assist and participate fully in the international efforts to defeat ISIS. Following on from this, we wish to do our best to end the spread of extremism, especially that which emanates from within our own boundaries. In doing this, we will do much to enhance our own security. Also, we will continue to pursue harmony and understanding with our regional neighbors, and, in particular, through diplomatic efforts do all we can to firstly stabilize and then improve the situation in Yemen within the terms of the UN Security Council Resolution 2216. Finally, we are determined to proceed speedily with the joint and institutional initiatives outlined, because by doing so we know that our overall interoperability and, therefore, resilience will be greatly enhanced. In regard to our social requirements, the single most important aim of all our member states is to overcome the challenges of radicalization, education, employment, and other challenges facing the youth of our nations. Success here will not only do much to secure our present stability and social fulfillment, but most importantly we will also ensure durable and resilient foundations are in place to meet the extraordinarily demanding future ahead of us. With this in mind, youth is at the top of the GCC Supreme Council's agenda and special funding and numerous initiatives are in place. Economically, all our members have their own plans, but as a bloc the priority is given to pursuing joint projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within Jeddah, what are the major opportunities for the private sector and foreign investors in the coming years?</h4><p>Jeddah is known as the gateway to Mecca. Every year we receive around 10 million visitors to the Holy Site in Mecca. This is an excellent opportunity. In addition, Jeddah is the major port on the Red Sea. The Jeddah Islamic Port is strategically located in the middle of an east-west international shipping route, and with 58 berths it is able to host and service the newest generation of large container vessels. Jeddah is also the center of business of the northwest of Saudi Arabia, with a major airport and a robust building sector. Around 80% of international agencies are located in Jeddah. Therefore, Jeddah is the business city of Saudi Arabia. All this is painting a very bright future. There are over SAR50 billion in government projects going on currently, which are creating further opportunities for the private sector and foreign investments.</p><h4>How is the JCCI working to promote and develop employment opportunities for Saudi women?</h4><p>Jeddah took the initiative of accepting women at the head of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce through the Sayidah Khadija Center. The Center is named for the Prophet's wife, who was a businesswoman. It has worked to develop many new rules and initiatives, which have helped women get empowered by the government. Jeddah has the highest hiring rate for women in Saudi Arabia, and we now see them in every sector, in companies and stores all over. The Jeddah Chamber of Commerce was behind a law that obligates all business people to start to hiring women. In addition to that, the Chamber has a department in which it is responsible for finding jobs and opportunities for unemployed women. Women apply to this department and they will help them find jobs anywhere. The Jeddah Chamber of Commerce has consistently been a main player in initiatives to empower women in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you assess the health of Jeddah's export base?</h4><p>Due to the fact that Jeddah is a gateway to Mecca and that we have a population of 3 million people, there is a large business community here. When people come to Jeddah, they come and buy clothes. They buy different products and take them back to their own countries. For example, Sudan, Egypt, Djibouti, and previously Yemen used to just import around SAR20 million of garments from Jeddah. These were mainly small business, but behind that number, some became larger and got involved in a variety of projects in the Saudi market. Therefore, in Jeddah we have around 1,000 factories and around 30% of their products are being exported to the regional countries.</p><h4>How does the organization of festivals support economic growth in Jeddah?</h4><p>Jeddah is the business city of Saudi Arabia. Jeddah has 80% of the dealers and agents of the international companies. In Jeddah, we organize about three or four festivals, one in summer, one in Ramadan, and one in Eid. These attract many Saudis. Over 1 million Saudis come to Jeddah to be part of these festivals. A large project, of course, generates business for companies because they have jobs to do. They create new jobs, new opportunities, and new investments. It creates a wealth of business opportunities both inside and outside of Jeddah.</p><h4>Which sectors in Jeddah represent the most potential for prospective investors?</h4><p>The real estate sector is highly dynamic. This is true of both commercial and residential real estate; however, the majority of the opportunities are in residential. Approximately 60% of the Saudis living in Jeddah live in apartments. The prices of plots and land in Jeddah have increased to extremely high level. In the future, we will have more projects in this sector, especially now with the Saudi government getting Yeminis to work in Saudi Arabia. Yeminis are being admitted now to be residents, and they will help that sector grow. Real estate also has a knock-on effect, creating opportunities in construction, retail, infrastructure development, and other areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What international investment opportunities within Saudi Arabia, and how is the CSC strengthening international business relations with the Kingdom and specific countries and sectors with high growth opportunities?</h4><p>One of the CSC's main goals is to attract investments to the Kingdom, and thus increase job creation and transfer technology. As a link between Saudi business owners and their foreign counterparts, CSC works to achieve this goal via regional and international conferences, seminars, workshops, and business exchanges between the Saudi private sector and its foreign counterpart worldwide. Business opportunities coinciding with Saudi Arabia's advances in development over the past years allow for more local and foreign investments, given the availability of financial, technological, technical, and organizational elements. Creating partnerships between local investors depends on several factors, including opening up the horizon for potential sectors in the Kingdom and benefiting from the comparative advantages of the private sector, such as the petrochemical and food industries, without disregarding the slowest growth industries, especially ones that are tied to national security. The private sector additionally aims at forming relations with moderate countries that share good ties with Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How is the CSC promoting cooperation between the different Saudi chambers?</h4><p>Our motto at the CSC is, “Cooperation and Integration are Keys to Success." Therefore, we work toward promoting bilateral and multilateral cooperation among the chambers of commerce across the Kingdom under the umbrella of CSC to ensure benefits for all. Our mission extends to include cooperation between general secretariats and national committees, which cover multiple economic activities and sectors. To promote the desired cooperation, CSC relies on holding regular meetings for general secretariats of chambers of commerce, as well as board meetings, which consist of chairpersons of various chambers of commerce.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the medium-term effect of oil prices on the Saudi economy and the diversification of the Saudi economy?</h4><p>All the three sectors—government, business, and society—of the Kingdom are aware that oil is not a renewable resource and that, as a global commodity, oil prices fluctuate subject to the forces of supply and demand. Therefore, Saudi Arabia's strategic vision adopted over the years, as well as its national development plans, which are both jointly implemented by the public and private sectors, emphasize the diversification of the production base and revenue sources in order to minimize the risks of increased reliance on a resource that is subject to price changes. The Kingdom takes into account such risks, which were preceded by drastic fluctuations in previous decades. As per the assurance of King Salman bin Abdulaziz in his speech on March 10th, 2015, comprehensive development plans and policies shall remain unchanged despite recent declines in oil prices in global markets. By maintaining the diversification strategy, the medium-term impact of dropping oil prices will not be drastic, given the continued effort on production base diversification. In general, Saudi Arabia's economy will be affected, but the impact relies on the level of diversification in the Kingdom's economic base.</p><h4>How does the CSC and empower women in the workplace?</h4><p>Enhancing the skills of the female workforce is key to integrating women into Saudi Arabia's economic development process, both as business owners and employees, which is a natural outcome of these developments. Supply and demand in the Saudi labor market determine the requirements and nature of jobs. Therefore, the CSC has been working on bridging the gap between the two sides of the labor market, and is helping to upgrade the skills of Saudi women to meet the market criteria. This is conducted via various instruments, including a CSC-specialized committee, the National Committee for Women Affairs (NCWA), which was created by a royal decree in 2005. The committee consists of members of expertise whose role is to coordinate with bodies relevant to encouraging private sector institutions to recruit and support Saudi women and get them involved in the national economic development process, and providing the necessary financial support to achieve that. Additionally, NCWA examines existing regulations related to female employment and makes suggestions that have to do with obstacles that may hinder their employment process. To further facilitate this process, the NCWA encourages businesswomen to expand their investments, especially in the SMEs sector, and coordinates with public agencies to create female offices at their establishments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the University of Sharjah's position in the international education sector in terms of its programs, number of students, and extracurricular activities?</h4><p>The University of Sharjah, which was founded in 1997 by His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council, Ruler of Sharjah, and President of the University of Sharjah, is considered a preeminent center of higher education and research at the national, regional, and international levels. Its broad expanse of land includes its main campus in Sharjah and branch locations in Khorfakkan, Kalba, Dibba, and Maleiha, in addition to a new branch that will soon be opened in Dhaid. Catering to a student population of 14,000 young men and women, the university offers over 85 academic programs in a diverse range of specializations at the diploma, Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels, as well as extracurricular activities through various cultural clubs, student societies, and athletic programs. The university takes pride in having graduated over 19,000 students, many of whom have assumed important positions throughout the UAE and across the globe.</p><h4>How is the University of Sharjah working toward improving scientific research in the region? </h4><p>Each campus contains state-of-the art facilities to enhance university studies and develop the research capabilities of faculty and students in accordance with the strategic vision of the local administration, which calls for raising the profile of the university to an international level in the field of research. New strategic directions were formulated in cooperation with leading international experts and specialized institutions with the aim of fulfilling the university's mission to serve the local and regional communities and contribute to the welfare of humanity. The university has begun to realize this global vision through the merging and development of its centers, laboratories, and research institutes under several newly-established specialized research institutes, which include the Sharjah Institute for Medical and Health Sciences Research, the Institute for Sciences and Engineering Research, the Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, and the Institute for Teaching and Faculty Development, in addition to nine centers of excellence in research. To ensure the success of these institutes, the university has introduced professorship chairs, valued at AED50 million ($13.61 million), and is actively collaborating with renowned international universities, institutions, and research centers with which it has established partnerships pursuant to numerous agreements personally signed into effect by the Ruler of Sharjah and President of the University. His Highness further generously granted the endowment of 13 luxury apartments to support research at the University of Sharjah.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of the university's overall growth strategy on the economy of Sharjah?</h4><p>Prior to introducing any new academic programs at the University of Sharjah, the university conducts studies and surveys to determine the most urgent needs of the local and regional job market. UOS students are rigorously prepared to meet these demands in terms of skills, theory, and practical experience related to their fields of specialization. Academic programs and research at the university are geared to propel the Emirate of Sharjah economy forward in an upward thrust in order to contribute to the growth, development, and services of the local and regional communities. The massive expansion of UOS over the course of 18 years is representative of the success of the health and training services provided by University Hospital Sharjah (UHS), the University Dental Hospital Sharjah (UHDS), and the Sharjah Surgical Institution (SSI). Pivotal to future directions in space exploration and research is the newly established Sharjah Center for Space Science and Astronomy (SCASS), slated to open in April 2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of the acquisition of Medpharma by IPS and Valeant, and how will this enable the company to broaden its footprint in the region?</h4><p>There are two broad impacts, the first being the impact on Medpharma and the second the impact on Valeant and IPS. The impact on Medpharma is significant because we are challenging each and every thing in the factory here. We began with raising standards of quality to match international levels, which were already approved by GCC authorities as well as the Saudi FDA. In line with this, we have introduced standard operating procedures. We are also in the process of increasing our employee numbers, since we are increasing our output volumes, and we have put in significant efforts to train people in line with international standards. The impact on Valeant is significant as well, because it is not as established in the Middle East, in spite of it being a large company globally. Valiant decided to enter the Middle East partly through acquiring Medpharma, and using it as a stepping-stone to enter the market. A good turn-around for Medpharma will mean that the entire Middle Eastern market will open up for Valeant.</p><h4>How would you describe the growth plans for Medpharma for the next five years?</h4><p>We are forecasting triple digit growth in the first three years, followed by high double-digit growth. There are a lot of opportunities in Sharjah, and we are using Sharjah as a base from which to export to the whole GCC region. Additionally, we are also expanding our presence in North Africa.</p><h4>How would you describe Sharjah as a base of operations for Medpharma? </h4><p>Sharjah will be the core of our operations, and we will be exporting everything from here. The base will always be in Sharjah, even if we enter into joint ventures with companies in other countries, because our facilities in Sharjah are economically feasible from a labor and resources standpoint. Also, we are getting a lot of support from the government and things run smoothly from a legislative point of view. The opportunities are coming from the openness of the government. There is complete transparency and there is no discrimination, and this is why they are attracting people. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the current investments in the UAE's pharmaceutical sector, and how does it impact on Medpharma?</h4><p>All the big international pharmaceutical companies are coming to the UAE, and in 10 years the UAE will be the center of the pharmaceutical industry. For Medpharma it will be the same, but we were here before others, so we are one step ahead. We will maintain this advantage because we came earlier and we will capitalize on our organic growth and will possibly undertake more acquisitions in the GCC.</p><h4>The UAE's pharmaceutical market was estimated to have been worth $2.4 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2020. What is your outlook for the sector, and how would you describe Medpharma's role in this growing market?</h4><p>The market will grow to at least more than $4 billion by 2020 if the sector keeps up the current pace.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The pharmaceutical market will continue to grow and we will double, or possibly more than double, the size of Medpharma's operations. We will thus continue our growth as well. In 2016 we will open more countries, especially in East Africa and the English- and French-speaking countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Arabia is Bahrain's top trade partner, and the two countries are tightly connected through longstanding business relationships and networks. How do you see this relationship evolving in the next five years?</h4><p><span></span>According to our Economic Vision 2030, Bahrain's economy can grow and prosper if we respond effectively to the challenges and opportunities presented by the world around us. We aspire to shift from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy, shaped by the government and driven by a pioneering private sector. Beside its bright history and skilled productive population, Bahrain is privileged by its unique geo-business location. Being the only island state in the MENA region and in the middle of the GCC, with a causeway connection and near future railway bridge to Saudi Arabia gives it a great advantage to be the financial, trading, and investment hub for the GCC region. Alongside traditional political, business, human, and cultural relationships, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands out as Bahrain's first trading partner and closest investment and services transactions counterpart. Recent trading transactions between the two countries are witnessing notable growth by making 250% progress between 2009 and 2014.</p><p><span></span>A more revealing reality about the mounting role of Bahrain as a regional trading and logistics hub for Saudi Arabia and the region at large is the fact that the rate of re-exports within Bahrain's exports to Saudi Arabia has more than doubled between 2009 and 2014 and rose from 23% to 61%. Given the emphasis laid by Bahrain upon its logistics, transportation, telecommunication operations, and infrastructure, and the vast potential of the planned King Hamad Bridge, such a role is bound to gain greater importance and rewards for both countries. Moreover, the investment landscape and business transactions between the two countries are also impressive. There are more than 1,000 registered and operating companies in Bahrain with Saudi ownership. There are also over 110 Saudi companies operating in Bahrain through branches or commercial agencies covering investment, finance, construction, transportation, telecommunications, tourism, aviation and other business and industrial sectors. </p><h4><span></span>Economic diversification away from oil and gas and strong industrial growth is a strategy shared by Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, as well as the rest of the GCC. How are Bahrain and Saudi Arabia working together to achieve these goals?</h4><p><span></span>Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030 development strategy, launched in 2008, aims to reduce the country's high dependence on oil and gas. The strategy has helped diversification efforts. The manufacturing sector continued to grow and constitutes the third largest contributor to Bahrain's economy after hydrocarbons and financial services. Bahrain's services sector has continued to grow, which represented around 58% of GDP. Furthermore, the telecommunications market was liberalized back in 2003. Bahrain's transportation sector has been streamlined toward the development and modernization of Bahrain's logistic infrastructure including air, port and maritime, and land transportation. The tourism sector not only draws on Bahrain's cultural and historical heritage, but also on its sports and business tourism potential. Such a performance has been in line with the ambitious diversification strides made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the rest of the GCC. Supported by Bahrain's traditional liberal economy, diligent regulatory system and friendly business environment, the Bahraini modern investment infrastructure has attracted the highest share of Intra-GCC investment flows. The GCC Center for Strategic Studies reporting that intra-GCC investment flows showed that Bahrain has attracted the highest percentage of these intra- GCC investments since its establishment in 1981. According to the study, Bahrain's share of such investments until 2010 amounted to $53 billion, representing about 36% of the total ($147billion). A vivid indicator of the advanced level of industrial diversification in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is the components of trade exchanged between the two countries in 2014. The export list of Saudi products to Bahrain comprised the following manufactures: Sulfate resistant cement, refined sugar crystals, dairy products, soda lye or liquid soda, beverages, Portland cement, cans for aerating beverages, conductors, polyethylene, soap in the form of powder, and diapers for children. Meanwhile, the Bahraini exports to the Saudi market comprised the following manufactured items: aluminum alloys bars and rods, agglomerated iron ores and concentrates, dairy products, soft drinks, air conditioning, other aluminum wire and cable, handkerchiefs, tissues and towels, aluminum electric wire with steel core, and hollow profiles of aluminum alloys. Moreover, all GCC countries, including Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, are prioritizing economic diversification in general and to manufacturing and SMEs in particular. There is also a common GCC concern about industrial development related issues, such as the development of standards, intellectual property rights, enhanced market access to WTO MFN, and duty free for goods and services through free trade agreements (FTAs) and R&amp;D, all of which impact on the competitiveness of GCC goods and services on the global platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Grace and gratitude be to Allah for having bestowed upon us His bountiful graces and accepted for us the religion of Islam, and prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Mohammad, the seal of all apostles, and upon his family and all his companions. King Abdulaziz, blessed be his soul, and the sons of this land have laid the pillars of this state, and implemented its unity in accordance with the righteous Sharia and the tradition of the Prophet, PBUH. Throughout the decades that followed the foundation of the State all the way through the reign of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, BBHS, your country—all thanks to Allah—has steadily been traveling the path of growth and development, holding fast to the principles of its pure faith, and adhering to the original nature and tenants of this society.</p><p>Allah Almighty graces this land with the honor of serving the Two Holy Mosques, and the Kingdom, since its foundation, has always been carrying out its duties and responsibilities, particularly those that serve Islam and meet the anticipations of Muslims so that they may always comfortably and peacefully perform their Hajj and Umrah.</p><p>I have committed myself to continuing the work on the immutable foundations on which this blessed country has stood since its unification: adherence to Islamic law sharia, preservation of the unity, security, and stability of this country, and continuance of construction and the completion of the foundations that were laid out by the late kings of this country. We shall work continually towards the integrated, balanced, and comprehensive development in all regions of the Kingdom, justice for all citizens, and provision of opportunities for all to achieve their legitimate aspirations and wishes in accordance with the state's regulations and procedures.<br>Every citizen in our country and every part of our dear land has all my attention and care. There is no difference between a citizen and another, nor is there a difference between a region and another. And I look forward to the contributions of all to serving the homeland. I have instructed the Minister of Interior to emphasize to the governors of the regions the importance of receiving and listening to citizens, and submitting the ideas and suggestions they voice to serve the country and its citizens, while providing them with the means of comfort.<br>We affirm our commitment to addressing the causes of differences and to eliminate all matters that would stratify the society in a way that harms national unity. All citizens are equal in rights and duties.</p><p>Media plays a major role, in accordance with the teachings of Islam, in supporting these efforts, providing an opportunity to express opinion and air the facts, instead of provoking difference or disagreement among the components of society. The media has to be contributors to harmony and construction, and a cause of strengthening the bonds of unity and national cohesion.</p><p>Over the past few years, high oil prices have positively influenced the Saudi economy and contributed to the completion of projects. We are working toward building a solid economy based on strong grounds that will lead to multiple sources of income. This will lead to better savings and better job opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We are going to encourage and support SMEs to grow, so that these become a strong economic areas for a large segment of society. The coming years will witness rich and great achievements that enhance industrial and services roles in the national economy.</p><p>Though oil prices are dropping and affecting the Saudi economy, we are working to limit the effects on the development march. And operations for the exploration of oil and gas will continue, with the grace of Allah.<br>In the field of services, we are working on developing governmental services by improving healthcare services for all citizens throughout the Kingdom, so that healthcare centers, referral, and specialized hospitals will be available to all citizens wherever they are.</p><p>For our sons and daughters, I say that your country has put all potentials and smoothed all the means so that you enjoy the best education at the most prestigious universities locally and abroad. Saudi Arabia is looking forward to your contributions. You have invested your time well because you are your country's future investment. We are keen on finding you jobs and professions that promise you a respected life. Both governmental and private sectors have mutual responsibility to do so.</p><p>For the businessmen in our dear country, I say: you are partners in development. The State works to support the private sector so that it contributes to improving the national economy. You are part of the fabric of this country which has granted you many privileges, and it awaits much from you. You have a commitment to your country by taking initiatives in fields of employment and the social and economic services.</p><p>Those are attached by working in order to achieve security and stability in the world, establish the principles of justice and peace along with the commitment to dialogue, resolve differences through peaceful means, and reject the use of force and violence or any actions that threaten international peace and security. With the emergence of the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism as a global scourge that has no religion, the Kingdom has focused on the fight against extremism and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, whatever its sources, and on cooperation with brotherly and friendly countries and the international organizations in the fight against this detestable menace, and in seeking eradicating its roots and causes.<br>We are part of this world and face its problems and challenges. We all share this responsibility and will actively contribute to putting solutions for many urgent international issues, including the issues of environment and promotion of sustainable development. We will continue to work with international organizations and institutions as well as international partners.</p><p>Realizing the heavy responsibility I am entrusted with, I ask Allah Almighty to help me perform this trust as best as it will be graced by Allah's acceptance; and I pray that He preserve for our country its security and stability and help us support our religion and achieve our aspirations.<br>Wasslamou Aleykum Wa Rahmatou Allah Wa Barakatouhou.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How would you describe the pivotal role that cultural heritage and arts play in Sharjah and the development of its citizens, and through which strategies does the Department aim to reinforce this role?
</h4><p>
	Sharjah has been known as the cultural Emirate for many years now, and it has won a plethora of accolades since the 1980s. In 2014, Sharjah was the Capital of Islamic Culture, and most recently it has been named the Capital of Arab Tourism for 2015. His Highness believes that culture is integral to bettering people, and he has been a huge advocate of education. Museums are vital in this regard, as they offer culture, as well as an environment for educating people. We have a special focus on educating children, since they are the next generation, and it is vital that they understand the importance of arts and that they will be engaged in culture for the rest of their lives. The Sharjah Museums Department manages 16 museums covering a wide range of disciplines from Islamic arts to archaeology to science and maritime heritage. It is important to offer a wide variety of disciplines, and it also important to cooperate with other departments to engage people in intangible heritage.
</p><h4>How does the Department work toward enhancing Sharjah's cultural identity internationally and attract visitors to the Emirate's museums?</h4><p>
	We promote Sharjah mainly through exhibitions and partnerships with international organizations. We work with stakeholders in Asia, America, and Europe to host different exhibitions in Sharjah, and hopefully we will be hosting exhibitions abroad as well. These exhibitions show what we have to offer and allow us to learn from other cultures. We also have MoUs with organizations from other countries. Sharjah is doing tremendous work for museums and heritage on a global scale, and we are putting a lot of effort into restoring or reconstructing antiquities that have been lost in the Arab world. We believe that we are custodians no matter where we are or where these antiquities are, and to lose them would be a loss for everyone.
</p><h4>How are museums changing as a result of technological advances in today's globalized world, and how is the Department adapting to this?</h4><p>
	We are always looking at ways to update our projects with technology, but it is important that our museums retain their human approach to visitors. Technology, if used well, can benefit a project. We are working to integrate technology into our current museums, as we did recently in Al Hisn Fort Museum, which has interactive screens to allow visitors to have better access to historical documents, enabling them to browse thousands of items in depth and with ease. We are looking for our future museums to many more of these kinds of innovations.
</p><h4>Which of these new museum projects will have the most impact going forward?</h4><p>
	Currently we have a number of museum projects under way, as some venues need to be completely renovated and restored. We have totally redesigned and renovated the Bait Al Naboodah museum for example. We will reinterpret the entire museum, redisplay it, and add technological features to it. Also, the Science and Technology gallery of the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization will be redone to include more technology and interactive displays as per the directives of His Highness. Moreover, we will be renovating the Aviation Museum in the near future. The biggest project, however, is the Science Museum, which will morph into a science park with state-of-the-art facilities for science geared toward helping children discover science and learn more about it. It will hopefully become an important educational venue that will cover all the different disciplines of science, particularly from an Islamic point of view, but of course always within the context of universal science. Meanwhile, the American University of Sharjah (AUS) is currently constructing a state-of-the-art Technology and Science park, which is also planned to include a museum of technology. Within the context of this project, we are looking at possible opportunities for cooperation between our science museum and the new AUS technology museum.

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The SCTDA is tasked with showcasing Sharjah's value proposition as a destination for tourism and business. What makes Sharjah such an excellent destination for both, and how do you work towards showcasing that?</h4><p>The SCTDA invests considerable effort in promoting Sharjah as a destination. We work closely with our stakeholders to take this destination to the next level, and we participate in a multitude of exhibitions worldwide. We are also collaborating with the United Nations World Tourism Organization towards this end. The diversity of offerings is what makes Sharjah a really special destination for visitors. We have always focused on culture and the authentic Arabian experience which is the vision of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi. Next to our wide variety of cultural and educational events, we have leisure and entertainment events, which always have an educational or cultural side to them. For example, the world-renowned Sharjah Water Festival, which in essence is an entertainment event for families, raises awareness of water conservation and safety. The Sharjah Light Festival is another festival that receives significant global attention and highlights the architectural splendour of Sharjah through light effects. The Sharjah International Book Fair, which is the biggest book fair in the Middle East and the fourth biggest in the world, is an annual highlight of the Sharjah events calendar. It has been organized in Sharjah for 33 years and generated one million visitors in 2014. Another factor that makes Sharjah a great destination for business in particular is Sharjah's University City, which was established by His Highness in 1997, and is the largest campus in the Middle East. Sharjah's government has also tried to adhere to our cultural traditions with architectural design, so that it is more Arab than other destinations in the region. Another advantage of Sharjah is its beautiful East and West coasts, with desert and sand dunes in the middle that offer a rich mix of landscapes. Sharjah was named the Islamic Culture Capital of 2014 and has recently been awarded with the distinction of 2015 Arab Tourism Capital by the Arab Tourism Organisation. As a result of all of these factors, we have seen double-digit growth in terms of guests for our 106 hotels. Occupancy rates are between 70% and 80% on average, and at peak times reach 100%.</p><h4>How integral are cultural institutions such as museums to Sharjah's tourism sector?</h4><p>More than 50% of the UAE's museums are in Sharjah. Sharjah has 20 award winning museums, each of which is unique in its own way. The first airport in the UAE, which was built in Sharjah in 1932, has been transformed into Al Mahatta Museum and houses original aircraft alongside the history of aviation. The Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization is perhaps the most well known museum due to its beautiful iconic building which used to be a souq. Sharjah also has a very interesting art scene, which is host to the Sharjah Biennial. It is organized by the Sharjah Art Foundation, which is headed by His Highness's daughter Sheikha Hoor Al Qasimi. </p><h4>One of the advantages of Sharjah is that it has ports on the Sea of Oman, which are easier to reach for cruise ships. How are you capitalizing on that?</h4><p>We have put a lot of effort into bringing in cruise liners. Last week was the first visit for the Queen Mary II, which called at port Khor Fakkan on the East Coast. Khor Fakkan transitions into a destination for cruises, because cruises come for the entire region and Sharjah is an excellent point of entry. We are very active in providing an enabling environment for this business to grow, as it will add value to Sharjah as a destination, and stimulate economic development for the communities in Khor Fakkan.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the potential of Sharjah to become a MICE hub? </h4><p>MICE visitors account for almost 10% to 15% of our annual visitors. We have many new facilities, such as the Expo Center in Sharjah, which was expanded two years ago with an additional 10,000sqm of floor space. A new four-star hotel with 200 rooms will be linked to the Expo Centre Sharjah. There is also the Al Jawaher Reception and Convention Centre, strategically placed opposite Sharjah International Airport. On the east coast, we have another expo center that we use for conferences and so on.</p><h4><br>What opportunities exist for foreign investors in the tourism industry in Sharjah?</h4><p>Considering our current figures, the potential, the occupancy rates, and revenue for available rooms, I think the hotel sector will offer investors a solid return on their investment. We work in tandem with Shurooq, which is Sharjah's Investment and Development Authority, to promote to investors different areas that have been designated for major projects by Shurooq. These are projects in different sectors of the economy, which make Sharjah appealing and attractive for investors.</p><h4>Where do you see the Sharjah tourism sector five years from now?</h4><p>We are expecting growth, and I anticipate the planned improvements to Sharjah's infrastructure to be one of the main factors and measures of success. More five star hotels are planned for Sharjah as the demand for this category grows. I see a lot of new developments by His Highness, particularly in the new major ecotourism projects across the country. I am confident that Sharjah's image will become stronger and more prominent. Sharjah has been fortunate to benefit from steady sustainable growth. It is a destination providing many valuable offerings and we are seeing efforts and promotional plans really starting to pay off. Sharjah will always be a cultural city, and we will always hold onto our traditions. If you decide to go 100% commercial you can, but you often do this at a cost. Achieving this balance is the focus of His Highness and it is what we believe in too.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Bee'ah's strategy for transforming Sharjah into a sustainable Emirate, and what progress has been made in this regard?</h4><p>Bee'ah was established in 2007 by a decree from the Ruler of Sharjah, and the objective was to tackle all environmental challenges. We started to focus initially on the problem of waste, which was a major problem here in the region. The waste output per capita in this region is one of the highest in the world, because of the development and growth that is happening here, and we started infrastructure-building operations in 2009 to tackle this issue. The infrastructure we have built since that time includes several facilities to handle, treat, and recycle waste, such as the Middle East's largest material recovery facility, a tire recycling facility, and a construction and demolition waste recycling facility. We also have oil treatment facilities, a car shredder, and a medical waste plant. On top of that, we also manage the engineered landfill and we set up a sister company, called Tandeef, as our waste collection arm. Today, we have contracts with the government to collect household and commercial waste, which we take to our landfill to treat and process. As of the end of 2014, 67% of all waste that we collected in Sharjah was either treated or recycled, which is the highest rate in the Middle East. Once our gasification waste-to-energy facility comes on line next year, which will be the largest gasification facility in the world with a capacity of 400,000 tons, we will be able to achieve our target of zero waste to landfill.</p><h4>What is your strategy to maintain the tremendous growth Bee'ah has achieved over recent years?</h4><p>In 2009 we had 14 employees, and as of 2015 we employ 4,000. We have been recognized locally and internationally and won many awards for Best Waste Management Company in the Middle East for the past four years running, from various authorities. This adds to our credibility and shows we are on the right track, and now, the way forward is to expand outside of Sharjah. We already have offices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and recently opened an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We are already prospecting new opportunities in Oman, Bahrain, and Qatar. We are also expanding our services, and have become an environmental management company, while we started as a waste management company. This year we are installing air quality monitoring towers across the Emirate, to assess the state of the air and decide what action is required. With regard to renewable energy, we have a waste to energy project coming up that will generate 85 megawatts of clean energy, and we have a solar project coming up, which we expect to generate between 15 to 20 megawatts of power mainly for our own facilities. In order to grow in the areas of air quality, water quality, and renewable energy, we have been gaining expertise from foreign entities. </p><h4>Bee'ah is a Public-Private Partnership with the Sharjah City Municipality. What are the benefits of this model?</h4><p>We operate like a private company, and we have managed to become profitable in a short period of time. But the partnership with the government has enabled us and Sharjah to move much quicker and become the leader in environment management here. In most other cities, waste management has been fully privatized, but in Sharjah the partnership has helped considerably with legislation and support, and we would have faced many challenges without this. We believe that this model works well in this region. Before Bee'ah, waste management was handled by the government, specifically by the municipality, which was adequate but not quite enough to meet the pace of the vision of Sharjah's authorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Sharjah Healthcare City (SHCC) project, which aimed to transform Sharjah into a world-class healthcare hub, was initiated some years ago. What progress has been made?</h4><p>SHCC was decreed in 2012 by HH Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah with a vision to establish Sharjah as one of the most preferred destinations for quality healthcare. Since then a lot of preparation has been made with regard to the feasibility study, legal structure of SHCC, its business model, master planning and designing, branding works, market sounding exercises, and so forth. We believe that a project of this size requires a great deal of preparation prior its launch. Our objective has always been to position SHCC as one of the most preferred healthcare investment destinations. </p><h4>In recent years, Sharjah has firmly positioned itself as a destination for medical tourism. In what way does the Sharjah Healthcare City, under the auspices of the SHA, provide a stimulus for this?</h4><p>Sharjah is known as the Islamic Culture Capital of the Arab World. One can find true Arab culture here. Apart from that it is also an educational hub of the region with the sprawling University City. At SHA, we are trying to add value to the Emirate of Sharjah and to the UAE by building the SHCC, which not only would provide a culture of care to citizens and residents of the UAE but also become a destination of medical tourism.</p><h4>SHCC offers ample opportunities for foreign investors who are keen to invest in Sharjah's rapidly growing healthcare sector. What can you tell us about these opportunities and the SHA's modus operandi for attracting investment?</h4><p>Sharjah already has a growing healthcare infrastructure with about 16 hospitals and many private clinics catering to various sectors. The latest addition to the hospitals is the 325-bed (210 inpatient beds) Sharjah University Hospital. With the growing population of Sharjah and the adjoining Emirates, which is expected to reach 2.7 million by 2025, there is an acute need for more healthcare facilities. It is also estimated that Sharjah alone needs about 630 additional beds by 2016 and the overall healthcare industry is expected to grow in the region considerably. Supply of specialized surgery centers, cancer centers, advanced diagnostics, rehab centers, cardiac care centers, and neurology centers are currently limited or lacking and represent an excellent opportunity for investors. The scope of healthcare-related investments in the region is enormous and SHCC will be the finest platform for its investor friendly atmosphere.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on the benefits of SHCC's single window service system, and its status as a free zone?</h4><p>SHCC operates as a free zone and thus the investors can enjoy a 100% ownership of their entity, zero tax and duties, 100% repatriation of capital and profits, single-window service, hassle free licensing, and world class infrastructure. In fact, the investors would not be required to meet with any other external agencies as all approvals including the free zone company registration and licensing, leasing of facilities, facility licensing, and professional licensing would be done by SHA or SHCC.</p><h4>How does the SHA cooperate with other countries and foreign entities to strengthen Sharjah's healthcare, and what are you doing to increase that cooperation?</h4><p>SHA promotes investments opportunities in SHCC heavily across the globe among the targeted healthcare community. SHA has already entered into a MoU with Ministry of Health in Seoul, South Korea. Bilateral cooperation is under discussion with other countries as well. Recently SHA conducted an investment seminar in London with the leading healthcare operators in the UK. SHA was also among the invited delegates to the US, Europe, and the Far East in recent years. Going forward we are looking at more international associations and collaborations.</p><h4>What is the growth trajectory of Sharjah's healthcare sector for the next five years?</h4><p>The healthcare sector in Sharjah is growing rapidly and it is promising. The next five years are crucial with the opening of SHCC and many landmark healthcare institutions entering the market. By 2020, the GCC may require more than 25,000 additional beds with the current level of care. With projects like SHCC, Sharjah will contribute substantially to this increase in healthcare demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, Sharjah ports handled an increase in container volume. What strategic advantages are behind the ongoing growth of container volumes at Sharjah's ports?</h4><p>It was the foresight and vision of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi that paved the way to establishing the first container terminal in the Middle East in Sharjah Port Khalid as early as the early 1980s to cater to the growing needs of a young nation, while containerization itself was in its infancy. While the main thrust of Sharjah's container volume shifted to Port Khorfakkan, Sharjah Container Terminal continued to play its part as an important container gateway and has increased its throughput consistently over the years. It is now a well-established fact that Sharjah is the industrial hub of the UAE. Add to this our customer-centric approach in facilitating documentation and the smooth clearance of goods through customs, combined with the proximity of the port of Sharjah and Inland Container Depot to their facilities, and it becomes clear that the Emirate is strategically advantageous for both our clients and the port. This fuels the growth of our cargo throughput at our ports.</p><h4>Sharjah's well-diversified economy has recorded strong GDP growth from 2001 to 2014. How would you describe the role of the Department of Seaports and Customs as a driver of the economic development of Sharjah?</h4><p>It has been the vision of HH the Ruler of Sharjah to diversify the economy of Sharjah across several sectors so as not to be skewed into a few areas. His Highness was at the forefront of developing the port infrastructure and has been keen to invest in facilities at our ports ahead of demand. Our ports serve as a gateway for businesses to access international markets for suppliers and buyers alike. The connectivity offered by our ports allows for a wider market for producers. Our facilities offer increased choice and quality for businesses, making us a facilitator of trade. There are a great deal of services and industries related to ports that benefit from our port facilities, such as road haulage, ship repair, ship handling, ship agencies, freight forwarders, and logistics service providers to name a few, and this offers a multiplier effect on the economy. My department is a primary facilitator of trade and plays a pivotal role as a driver of economic development in Sharjah in particular and the UAE in general, thus spurring the state's GDP to greater heights.</p><h4>Shurooq has estimated that Sharjah's transport and logistics sector will have a market potential of AED3.43 billion in 2020. How would you describe the importance of Sharjah's seaports and free zones in achieving this potential?</h4><p>Sharjah is home to three deep-water ports. Each of our ports is unique in offering a distinct advantage. Port Khalid is located in the heart of the city and close to the industrial heartland of the UAE, providing the vital service of being the gateway to international markets. Hamriyah Port is located within the fast-growing Hamriyah Free Zone, which houses large and medium size industries. The port benefits and serves the need of not just companies within the Free Zone, but also of industries located in the other Northern Emirates, generating cargo traffic for our ports through its ideal location and deep-water facility. The inner harbor in Hamriyah Free Zone is a bustling hub of offshore support activities, and several related industries prosper from the activities of the offshore oil and gas sector. Khorfakkan Port, which is strategically located on the east coast of the UAE, makes Sharjah the only Emirate to have ports on both the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. We have room to increase facilities within our three ports and, based on a market study that is currently being undertaken, appropriate steps will be taken to meet future growth in cargo volumes. With the increased activity in Sharjah's seaports and also our airport, the transport and logistics sector will receive the necessary leg up to achieve the targeted GDP growth.</p><h4>How do you assess the opportunities for foreign investors to invest in Sharjah's port infrastructure and logistics network in order to sustain and increase the current volumes of marine freight?</h4><p>We are an open and free economy and FDI is encouraged across all sectors in order to improve the competitiveness of the Emirate and its economy, and port infrastructure is no exception. When port infrastructure projects come up for development—and this is based on projected demands—it is done through a process where international firms that have the expertise are open to participate. With regard to setting up a logistics network, we are among the freest markets and anyone can open a logistics company under the framework of UAE laws. There are no barriers to investing in the logistics and transport sector apart from maintaining standards with regard to safety and confirming with UAE laws.</p><h4>What are your department's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The port industry is based on derived demand, so we are fully dependent on the macro-economic situation in the country. There are several factors that make us believe that the coming year will be one of steady growth for us. We are aware of the need to be efficient and priced right while offering top-notch service to our customers, who have ample choice within the UAE, and we are doing what is necessary to make our facilities cutting edge and competitive. The Free Zones of Hamriyah and Sharjah Airport are constantly growing, and with our ports as a natural choice for their cargo movement we expect enhanced demand for the usage of our facilities. All of this bodes well for the growth of our port. We continue to strive to make our ports the preferred choice of our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of the environment sector within the overall strategies of Sharjah's government?</h4><p>The EPAA was established in 1998 to support the environmental strategy of the Emirate of Sharjah and a new methodology of developing the institutional structures of environmental management. Inspired by the principles of development and strategies set by HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, and guided by the resolutions of the Executive Council of the Government of Sharjah, the EPAA successfully achieved goals in various aspects of the environmental works. Moreover, the EPAA established several protected areas and natural reserves in Sharjah, drew up specific plans to raise environmental awareness and educate people, and adopted an approach to unify the practices and rules in the environmental sector through the formation of Sharjah Awareness and Environment Education Committee.</p><h4>How does the Authority work towards managing and protecting the indigenous flora, fauna, and landscape of Sharjah?</h4><p>The Authority aims to protect the environment, the wildlife, and its biodiversity. This happens through scientific research, setting appropriate policies to raise awareness, supporting the principle of sustainable development to preserve natural environmental resources, and by a guaranteed exploitation of natural resources to the benefit of the present generation and future generations. Under the Authority, there is The Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), which opened in 1998. It is closed to the public, and was built for breeding threatened wildlife, and has become a base for the conservation and research of all of Arabia's indigenous fauna and flora. The BCEAW has been instrumental in setting up and running conservation breeding programs for some of the regions most threatened species, including the Arabian leopard and Arabian cobra, and also participates in several international breeding programs for the cheetah, sand cat, striped hyena, and Nubian ibex, among others. Over the years BCEAW has built up strong ties with facilities, institutes, government departments, and field researchers—both regionally and internationally. This cooperation has made it possible for environmental planning and management to be discussed cooperatively, rather than each area of responsibility being dealt with on an individual basis.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Kalba ecotourism project on Sharjah's tourism and environment industry?</h4><p>This is an ecotourism project by Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) in collaboration with the EPAA, which will showcase Kalba's rich biodiversity and diverse ecosystem. Geographically different from most parts of Sharjah, it offers a unique biome of fauna and flora. The project will revive tourism on the East Coast and attract visitors from all over the Emirates. In terms of environment, it has been determined that Al Qurm area is a 100% tourist area for which an environment impact assessment (EIA) is requested from Shurooq before any new facilities will be built. Moreover, the buildings are constructed sustainably, and are environmentally friendly. The only completed project at the moment is the learning center, the Kalba Bird of Prey Center.</p><h4>Which new EPAA projects and initiatives will have the most impact going forward?</h4><p>The Kalba Ecotourism project and Sir Bu Nair Island Ecotourism project will be the most significant projects, as well as restoration programs for the protected areas and reserves in Sharjah, and the building of new learning centers.</p><h4>What are the Authority's specific goals and expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The Authority has a plan that covers a period of five years, which stipulates a series of goals. It will also manage and control the Emirate's environmental and natural resources and take the necessary procedures to protect and maintain administrative, legal, and technical measurements. Furthermore, the Authority will produce the necessary proposals in the field of environmental protection, and contribute to the development of deterrent laws against those who may cause harm to our wild environment. Also, we will spread environmental awareness through activities about the importance of preserving the environment and to help define the purpose of the Authority and its objectives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Passenger numbers to Sharjah's airport have increased from 860,000 in 2001 to 9.5 million in 2014. What factors are behind this significant growth?</h4><p>The main driver of the growth in passenger numbers has been the establishment of Air Arabia in 2003 by His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah through a royal decree. As the base carrier of Sharjah International Airport and flag carrier of the UAE, Air Arabia has been fully independent from government funding, except for a $13.6 million initial investment. Having a base carrier at our airport attracts other airlines, which want to benefit from the connections and the available flow of passengers. That was the main reason for our annual double-digit passenger growth. Our passenger numbers have also benefited from the fact that we are not competing with Dubai. Sharjah airport is different from Dubai Airport in the sense that it does not heavily focus on luxury or aesthetics, but rather on providing a time-efficient journey, which attracts a lot of regular flyers who just want to get from A to B as soon as possible. Dubai also does not focus on traffic between the Emirates, but rather on long-distance international travel. Another factor behind our growth is our focus on signing open skies agreements with countries around the world. Presently, we have entered into full and limited open skies agreements with 146 countries. Today, some European and American carriers are lobbying against us to try and limit our entitlements to fly into those countries. For us, this is confirmation of our success and shows us that we are on the right track. However, the growth of passenger numbers that were achieved by Air Arabia were much higher than what we anticipated during our initial planning phase, so the growth that we have experienced has created a burden on airport infrastructure. This is why, today, we have done several modifications of the existing facilities and directed a lot of investment into the airport to accommodate that growing number.</p><h4>How has the Department of Civil Aviation managed to continuously enforce a high level of safety and security in spite of the steep rise in passenger numbers?</h4><p>The rapid growth has brought many challenges. First, there was a rapid influx of inexperienced and untrained employees who are prone to error. To mitigate this risk, we have focused on increasing the safety culture in the airport for not only the airport personnel, but also for the employees of other companies that work in the airport. We train extensively and have created a culture of self-reporting, instead of investigation. We have also worked a lot on developing our safety and compliance division within the department. We have people monitoring the operations 24 hours a day, and we have been very strict with regards to the enforcement of safety standards. Our operations do not only take place on the ground, but also in the UAE's airspace, which is becoming increasingly crowded as a result of the growing number of flights. Therefore, we have made many improvements to the airspace design in order to minimize delays resulting from congestion. After all, Dubai and Sharjah are two very busy airports that are located within 15km of one another, so focusing on separating the air traffic in a safe and secure way is paramount. Another factor that is of importance regarding the airspace design is our aim to reduce the time and fuel needed for aircraft to land at Sharjah airport in order to support low-cost carriers such as Air Arabia.</p><h4>What benefits will the recently constructed, $136 million runway bring to Sharjah International Airport?</h4><p>This airport was established in 1974, so the current runway was in need of a major renovation. This renovation meant that we would have had to close the runway for seven hours a day and move certain wide-body aircrafts, resulting in a loss of profit for the airport. After calculating how many flights we would lose, it turned out to be more feasible to keep the airport fully operational and construct a completely new runway, instead of renovating the existing one. The project took three years from planning to completion, and the new runway has many features that the airport will benefit from. First of all, the power-saving and environmental impact of this new runway is enormous, as it is far more energy efficient than the old runway.</p><h4>How do you assess the future of the aviation sector of the UAE, and what will be the priorities of the Civil Aviation Department in this growing sector?</h4><p>The future of the aviation sector in the UAE is bright and challenging at the same time. Thanks to their business models, our airlines are aggressive in exploring new markets. But for this, they are dependent on our full or partial open-skies agreements with the countries, some of which have not been willing in order to protect their own carriers. The efforts of European and American carriers lobbying against us to reduce our access into those markets will be a challenge for us in the future, and we are designing a strategy to handle these objections. Another challenge is devising a regulatory framework for drones. The technology is developing very quickly and there is no legislation for this particular area of aviation. We have worked with the airports and aviation agencies, and there will be a federal law regulating the use of those aircraft. We are very keen on having safe drone activity in the Emirates. The future and development of new aircraft and new ways to fly is what will keep us busy in the near future. Meanwhile, a lot of things are going on to improve the entire UAE air industry based on projections of future growth of the airports, passengers, and carriers. We are working today to modify our airspace to accommodate that growth. Also, cargo handling and passenger handling facilities in the airports need to be expanded and diversified in order to cope with the future plans and expansions of our carriers. There needs to be a focus on infrastructure development. In Sharjah, we have planned for a $1.9 billion investment to go into infrastructure developments taking us from 2017 up until 2025. We want to expand the airport terminals, the baggage handling facilities, and the security checkpoints and equipment. We have already invested $6.8 million into security equipment at our cargo shipping facilities in Sharjah in order to strengthen our cargo handling capability. By 2019, we are looking at raising the airport capacity to 20 million passengers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will Al Zahia—Majid Al Futtaim's joint venture project with Sharjah's government—have on residential living in Sharjah?</h4><p>Al Zahia is one of the projects of Sharjah Holding, and is equally owned by Majid Al Futtaim properties and the government of Sharjah. As a strategic partnership between the government of Sharjah and Majid Al Futtaim Properties, the current focus of Sharjah Holding is on the development and management of retail and mixed-use projects in the Emirate of Sharjah. Al Zahia also gives momentum to the government's vison and drive to diversify Sharjah's real estate sector—improving the Emirate's standing as a preferred investment destination, as well as an ideal place for community living. All facilities will be within walking distance of the residential areas, and we are providing greenery, by which we hope to motivate people to leave their cars at home and enjoy the outdoors. Our focus on making this a sustainable living environment means that we are providing a living experience, rather than just selling bricks and mortar. Upon final completion, Al Zahia's estimated contribution to the overall Sharjah economy is valued to reach around AED5 billion ($1.36 billion).</p><h4>How would you characterize your cooperation with Sharjah's government on this project?</h4><p>The successful delivery of a project with the strategic goals and magnitude such as Al Zahia requires solid support from a strong partner. We believe that this formidable partnership will give immense momentum to the government's vision to enhance the social, cultural, and economic development of Sharjah, as well as the diversification of Sharjah's real estate sector. Working hand-in-hand with the government also generates additional credibility within the market. Of course, our ambition is to go from this into bigger projects.</p><h4>What growth plans do you have in place to turn this ambition into reality?</h4><p>Taking into consideration the outlook for the real estate sector in Sharjah and the UAE, we believe there is a strong demand for gated communities that offer a high level of quality in Sharjah. We are playing into this by providing convenience in our living communities, which really is a trend these days. Convenience is one of the major factors influencing people's decisions when it comes to living in a certain place. Providing that convenience within a gated community for the family is key, and it is the convenience factor that we are trying to cultivate and build into our projects, because the demand is there in Sharjah. We acknowledge that people have less time and want accessible quality facilities and amenities to support their busy days, and this will be translated to the project.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's initiative to open up the real estate sector to non-GCC UAE residents?</h4><p>It is a great initiative, which will add to the already successful market that we have. Sharjah has been a great attraction for people from all over the GCC and the Arab world in terms of owning property, but opening it up to the rest of the world on a leasehold basis is a good decision. The UAE in general has a positive real estate outlook. There is a lot of anticipation for Expo 2020 in the market, which benefits the entire UAE. The real estate market is not growing as steep as it did in late 2014, but growth will continue and probably increase toward 2018/19. I am optimistic about the overall real estate market in the UAE because I believe that the leadership of this country has proved time and again that the UAE is progressive and forward thinking.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies has the Sharjah Airport Authority implemented to foster the exponential growth in passenger numbers and cargo tonnage that has taken place over the past decade, and how would you describe future growth plans?</h4><p>The growth is the result of several factors that are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. First, the attractiveness of Sharjah as a business and tourist destination, coupled with the economic growth of the UAE, is a key element that has contributed to the airport's growth. The Emirate is strategically located and is one of the safest destinations for business and leisure travellers alike. Secondly, efficient procedures and excellent services have boosted its attractiveness. Thirdly, new routes and increased frequencies by existing carriers have been instrumental in driving growth. Air Arabia, in particular, has provided a key stimulus to the sector by offering low-cost travel, which has increased demand. As a result, Air Arabia expanded its operations and the number of flights it runs. We are expecting the growth of passenger numbers and cargo volumes to continue for the coming years. Sharjah Airport Authority has also selected the engineering, construction, and projects management company Bechtel to design a new master plan for the airport. The company will conduct short-term and long-term analyses of the airport's future needs. Further studies for large-scale expansion projects are currently underway and are expected to be announced soon to maximize the use of land at the airport, and come up with new facilities for both passengers and cargo services. Running parallel with the exponential growth of Sharjah Airport we are meeting the demand of airport users by increasing existing capacity in various areas, including check-in counters, additional boarding gates and growing the numbers of human resources, utilising the latest innovative technologies and equipment to enhance the passenger experience. Furthermore, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhamad Al Qassimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, launched the new, $136 million runway in Sharjah International Airport in October 2014, which has increased our capacity significantly.</p><h4>How would you describe the strategic advantages of Sharjah International Airport versus other airports in the region?</h4><p>There are many competitive advantages at Sharjah International Airport. Some are related to its strategic geographic location, while others are the result of operational strategies such as direct approach for flights and shorter taxiing distances, both reflected in reduced fuel burn on ground and less 'holding' to land. Other advantages are more commercial, resulting from our competitive rates in various airport services. Sharjah Airport International Free Zone's proximity to the airport, Sharjah's two seaports, ongoing projects to develop the airport infrastructure, the free trade atmosphere with the Open Sky policy, and transparent cargo procedures also contribute positively towards Sharjah Airport's competitiveness. I am an advocateof cooperation between the UAE's airports, rather than competition. We should be complementing other airports, as each airport has advantages that make it a more viable choice for a particular passenger. Our airport is more convenient for short-haul passengers because of our emphasis on faster processes. We are capitalizing on this, and try to not exceed the 20-minute gap between the check-in counter and aircraft boarding. The increasing number of passengers, however, requires Sharjah Airport to be more efficient, so working 'smarter, not harder,' ensuring faster boarding and alighting times for passengers is maintained</p><h4>How do you assess the future of the aviation sector in the UAE, and what does this mean for your organization?</h4><p>Within five years, the UAE will undergo a huge development to cope with UAE vision 2021, and will host major events like Expo 2020, which need a lot of investments and planning. The aviation sector is one of these sectors that will expand to meet the high demand; all national and foreign carriers have plans to expand. As one of the most important sectors of GDP, we should be prepared for the increase of passengers and cargo. We expect the growth to continue, as the demand is high. After this development, we should be looking into attracting long-haul airlines to the airport, which is an area in which we see growing demand. I assume that one day we will start operating long-haul flights, but only when we are either ready to handle more flights in peak hours, or when long-haul airlines are willing to operate in off-peak hours.</p><h4>What are your organization's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>We expect to continue with our annual growth as forecast. This will entail an increase compared to 2014, when our passenger numbers were boosted by 700,000 passengers that we temporarily took over from Dubai International Airport due to continued construction over there. We may not retain all of those passengers this year, whilst some have recognized the attractiveness and convenience of a more non-congested airport, fully fledged with facilities and modern amenities, and our own growth should see us reach the target of 9.5 million.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah's real estate market has experienced strong growth and an increasing demand for residential and commercial properties. How did you manage to bring the company to its current position in this growing market? </h4><p>Potential Real Estate has grown in parallel with Sharjah, where demand for real estate has always existed, even in times of economic crisis, because the government has been very keen in providing the necessary infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, the electrical grid, education services, and healthcare, which creates demand for residential and commercial properties. We must also mention the regulatory infrastructure, which guarantees the rights of investors, and regulates the relationship between tenants and landlords.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the recent government policies aimed at relaxing the rules on foreign ownership in terms of improving the real estate market in Sharjah?</h4><p>Many expatriates have always wanted to own property in Sharjah. Many of them were born and educated here, but their passport prevented them from doing so. The opening of Sharjah's real estate market to them finally gives them the opportunity to buy their own places and be secure for an extended amount of time without feeling the effect of price fluctuations in rent, which are high as a result of increased demand. Moreover, it allows them to invest their money in real estate, which is more profitable and safer than putting it in a bank. Opening the market has increased demand for our services. Many people actually prefer to rent out their new investment while staying in their own residence.</p><h4>Which of Potential's initiatives or projects do you expect will have the most impact going forward?</h4><p>In Sharjah we have big plots in Industrial Area 1, and we are going to have a huge impact on this area because the project will cover, and area of 150,000sqf will cost AED400 million ($108.9 million). For the next four years, this will be a huge project for us. In Abu Dhabi we will begin construction in October on a 21-story residential building with 130 apartments right next to the Exhibition Center, which will be aimed at families in the higher segment of society. Another big project is the Sultan Bin Rashed mosque that we are building in Al Ain. With a capacity for 2,100 worshippers, it will be monumental for Al Ain. We will provide facilities for ladies and for men, and we also have Koran recital classes and educate newcomers about Islam, which is very important as a majority of newcomers to the UAE want to learn more about the local culture and religion. To this end, we are building a multipurpose room that will serve as a lecture hall, and also a place for neighborhood gatherings, where people can be educated by the General Authority of Islamic affairs on a variety of societal topics.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the real estate and construction sector in the UAE for the medium term?</h4><p>It will continue to grow. What is unique about the UAE is that we do not depend on our own growth numbers. Over the past four years, the average population growth was 8.5%, and projected population growth in the next five years is 9.5%, which means we need to provide for about 800,000 people per year. I do not see the real estate market dropping anytime soon. There will be steady growth, backed in particular by the Expo 2020, which will guarantee us a lot of business.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Our company manages over 2,500 units and we just added another 500 units to our capacity. People started to realize that we are giving a good, honest service. We are breaking into to the market right now, and I hope to expand our units under management to 5,000 over the coming three years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[top-of-the-line]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Gulf Petrochem grown into a global conglomerate and how has being located in Sharjah contributed to the growth of the company?</h4><p>Gulf Petrochem was started in 1998 in the Hamriyah Free Zone, whereby we had a refining unit that processed waste oil into meaningful products, which we subsequently sold locally or exported to Africa. The authorities have supported Gulf Petrochem from its inception, receiving us with open arms and offering an environment that was characterized by low costs of land and the exemption of taxes. I am extremely thankful for the support that the Hamriyah Free Zone Authority and Sharjah Leadership has given us. These things have really supported the business to achieve the growth and success we enjoy to date.</p><h4>How does the price of crude oil affect your operations, and how would you describe your medium-term outlook for oil prices?</h4><p>History has shown us that whenever oil prices go down, the demand for oil in the retail market goes up, which benefits us in a way because it generates more trade volumes for us. The return on capital employed (ROCE) is also better on lower prices. Also, the costs of cargo financing goes down, which really helps us to increase our margins. Lastly, because of the low prices, the futures price of oil are higher than the expected spot price. This situation, which is called contango, is what we have witnessed of late, and it has driven people to store oil, which in turn helps us make money. It's difficult to talk about a long-term price, but in the mid term I see strong support and resistance operating within a trading range of $61 and $68, respectively, for the rest of the year. Producers want to produce more and there is no indication of cutting down.</p><h4>Are you looking to engage in partnerships or joint ventures to strengthen these growth plans? </h4><p>In East Africa, we are looking at entering into partnerships with local oil companies to see how we can fund their expansions and be party to what they are doing. It's a standard approach to enter new markets with people we can trust locally. These are not markets like the UK, EU, or the US that have processes and systems and legal frameworks in place. These are the emerging markets with some level of risk involved, but coupled with huge opportunities. The opportunity we foresee is as a result of a lot of large oil companies moving out of Africa. The conventional players like BP or Shell are exiting the market because they are finding more money to be made in the upstream sector of our industry. The local players sometimes don't have sufficient funds or the expertise to make the margins required to survive. For them, margins of 12-15% are too low, but for a company like ours, we can happily work with these sorts of numbers. We have the capital they are looking for, so that gives us the opportunity to go and explore.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The UAE will not be affected by oil price fluctuations that a lot of people are worried about. The UAE will remain stable both politically and economically, so we are not worried about that. Banks are flushed with liquidity, and whenever something potentially damaging occurs in the region, the UAE is flushed with funds, which is actually putting pressure on interest rates because everybody wants to lend and there are limited good borrowers. We have been fortunate to cut down on our interest rates and that's helping the business to grow. Demand is good and looks to remain that way, so the outlook for the company looks strong and healthy for the year ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has market evolution in recent years impacted your business?</h4><p>Two decades ago, the time I started managing this business in UAE, there were less companies in the market specialized in our field, and few of them had the expertise and the knowledge to produce required standards. The healthy growth the Emirates experienced in the past decade attracted many new companies including international ones. This by itself created challenges for us which helped us to improve and upgrades our performance. We are proud that we are able to achieve these higher levels of standards by acquiring the necessary certifications, the qualified personnel and the up-to-date technologies. Our business nature has also matured to a level that we have become one of the main players in the architectural metal work market. Nowadays we deal with wide spectrum of customers, from residential villas to airports, the metro, hotels, malls, hospitals, towers, oil and gas, palaces, mixed-use, and clubs and restaurants. Some of our prestigious projects include Dubai Metro, Central Market—Abu Dhabi, Masdar City, Mumbai Airport, Sheraton Hotel Doha, Conrad Hotel as well as the Hyatt in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, we are currently involved in the Louvre Abu Dhabi, Presidential Palace, and the Four Seasons Hotel. Geographically speaking, we are always on the lookout for opportunities and challenges in any market.</p><h4>How would you assess the strategic advantages of Sharjah?</h4><p>We experience more advantages of being located in Sharjah Emirate. Logistically, we are able to reach all other Emirates with great convenience given the esteemed network of roads and infrastructure the government has built during the last decade. At the same time, the cost of living including the housing market is considered quite reasonable in comparison with other emirates. Utilities are also slightly more competitive to others.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your growth strategies and expansion plans? </h4><p>Generally speaking, our strategy is in line with growth strategy of the market. We are in fact privileged to be living in the UAE since it's a key element to the economy of the Gulf and the Middle East. The market indicators in the UAE are quite realistic and accurate. We have an advantage here that we sense the economic activities in the entire region through the economic vibes we experience from our customers and observing the projects boom.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for 2015? </h4><p>Having said about the above growth in the market, this year we look forward for at least 20% increase in our activities compared to the year 2014. We are confident of achieving these figures and working towards them accordingly. I believe our turnover should increase by a minimum of 20% as compared to 2014. I am confident about the current economic developments in the region, and as a result we are prospecting ways to expand our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the strategic reasons behind the establishment of the Emirates Industrial City?</h4><p><span></span>The Emirate of Sharjah has 19 industrial zones and two free zones. The Emirates Industrial City was created in 2005 as part of the Sharjah government's strategic plan to provide alternative locations to the existing zones in order to accommodate new industries and existing industries that are expanding. I believe that we have the necessary infrastructure and facilities to attract and accommodate as many industries as possible. The Emirates Industrial City is 100% privately owned by investors, whereas industrial zones in most other places are government or semi-government owned through a freehold long-term lease. Additionally, there are no hidden charges and running costs, nor are there any taxes on a company's exports to the GCC, as is the case in most other free zones.</p><h4>How does the Emirates Industrial City help retain industries in Sharjah, and what more can be done by the Sharjah government to support this?</h4><p><span></span>We are proud and happy with our collaboration with the government officials in Sharjah, specifically HE Marwan Al Sarkal of Shurooq and HE Sultan Abdulla bin Hadda Al Suwaidi of the Economic Development Department. The existing industrial areas are individual plots owned by individual people, and they are scattered around Sharjah, most of them located near residential areas. Thus, there is no room to expand, and as industries cannot grow their operations, there is the risk of them leaving Sharjah. The Emirates Industrial City is the solution to this problem, and we are making sure that we attract as many foreign and local investors to our zone by giving them better facilities and more room to expand. I believe that when it comes to the involvement of Sharjah's government, it is necessary to develop the rules and regulations in a way to better accommodate the changing nature of the industrial sector.</p><h4>What goals have you set for the Emirates Company for Industrial Cities for five years from now?</h4><p><span></span>We are trying to add value to the remaining two square kilometers of land in the Emirates Industrial City through building facilities and attracting investors. So instead of earning revenues through land sale, we will earn from land lease, which gives us a higher return than selling the land. We believe there is room for expanding the Emirates Industrial City, and we have been approached by developers. We hope that we will find other similar locations in Sharjah and the GCC so that we can develop more Industrial Cities, because the Emirates Industrial City is just our first project as Emirates Company for Industrial Cities. For this expansion, we would welcome strategic partnerships. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the Emirates Company for Industrial Cities and for the Emirates Industrial City for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>After the first quarter of 2015, we are optimistic. When the World Expo was announced, there was a huge jump in costs and demand in real estate, and prices started to go crazy throughout 2014. In the last quarter of 2014, the prices started to level out again, and that is the way we like it. It is not good to have these sorts of fluctuations, because they are very sharp. We believe that it will be good, not because of land sales, but land leasing. Perhaps the prices might come down in a few years, like they did in 2008. I think 2015 it will be about adding value to what we already have and leasing, and I believe that the people are starting to take things more slowly and are prepared to lease for a few years and see where the economy is heading.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does SIB play into the growing demand for sharia-compliant products?</h4><p>In 2002, SIB was the first bank in the world to transform from conventional banking to Islamic banking. There is growing demand for Islamic banking in the Middle East and Europe, because of the ethics and transparency that Islamic banking brings with it. These values, which are embedded in our products and services, are what make Islamic banking so attractive. Our vast experience as a conventional bank has enabled us to capitalize on this growing demand for sharia-compliant products, because we know the needs of customers and we focus on turn-around time and the quality of  our products and services. We created many products to cater to the different financial needs of our clients.  Many of these products were not hitherto present in Islamic banking, so we introduced them to the market, and now other banks use them as well. </p><h4>SIB issued an unsecured AED1.8 billion ($500 million)five-year sukuk in March. How would you describe the significance and impact of this sukuk on the bank?</h4><p>We were the first institution to issue a sukuk in Sharjah, in 2006. We issued our fourth sukuk in March, which was a successful transaction, receiving an A-rating from Moody's. With a book size of $3.6 billion, the sukuk was more than seven times oversubscribed and our trading was exceptional compared to the previous tradings of other issuers. It was also very well diversified between investors from the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. The spread and the pricing were attractive, as we managed to put the price on 110 basis points over five-year midswaps. All in all, we consider it as a successful issuance. The reason for that success primarily lies in our closeness to the international market, and the awareness we have raised there for the bank. Another factor for success has been the growth of our overall financial ratios. </p><h4>Which untapped sectors have you identified within global Islamic banking and how should these be utilized?</h4><p>Most of customers' financial requirements are already covered by Islamic banks, which are able to cover all the long- and short-term finances for international customers. Certain financial products, like derivatives and swaps, are not tapped because there are sharia issues with it. Another product that we do not provide are personal loans for cash, but we do provide other solutions for the customer in order to raise cash based on their own assets. There is always room to grow for Islamic banking products, and there is uncovered ground because it is much easier to structure a product under conventional rules. Islamic banks have certainly developed and matured since 1975, as they have taken great steps towards catering to all the financial needs and banking needs of their clients. As for the future of Islamic banking, what we've seen is that conventional banks are starting to offer certain Islamic products and services because of the demand in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. By issuing Islamic bonds, they will be able to capture both Muslims and non-Muslims, as opposed to a non-Islamic bond to which Muslims may not subscribe to. On the other hand, Islamic banks for their part are moving away from creating products that are only for Muslims.</p><h4>How would you rate the importance of SIB for the economic development of Sharjah?</h4><p>SIB plays an important role in Sharjah's development, and has done so for years. We have participated in most of the major projects in different sectors of Sharjah's economy, either by financing the project or financing clients. SIB is one of the leading banks in Sharjah in terms of corporate and social responsibility, to which end we have a lot of projects. As an Islamic bank we are obliged to put aside zakat, which is a form of charity, to invest in the community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over its 40 years of operation Sharlu has become a market leader in the oil lubricants market. What are the reasons for your continued success? </h4><p>Established in 1975 by a group of investors from the UAE, Sharlu was the first privately-owned blending company in the region, delivering high-quality products. In our four decades of existence, we have had many partnerships with virtually all oil multinationals to produce lubricants. Our commitment to quality and services has driven us to be the first company to offer customers the convenience of direct onsite delivery, and the first to offer bulk product to workshops in the UAE and the wider GCC region. To cope with our growth, we relocated our facilities in 2007 from the center of Sharjah to a plot outside the city, which will enable us to maintain our growth rate.</p><h4>How would you describe the role of government in supporting industries in Sharjah and their current efforts to open up the Emirate to greater foreign investment?</h4><p>We greatly appreciate our relationship with the government, which has been excellent since our first day of operation in Sharjah. Throughout those years, we have received all the necessary support, as the government is aware of our needs and concerns, and is highly committed to addressing these. The open-door policy that exists in Sharjah and the UAE is unique, and runs through every government department. The support we have received has, for example, enabled us to move from city to the Plant where we are now and to establish a tank farm to store base oil, the capacity of which have grown from 14,000 tons to 50,000 tons within five years. Of course, the fact that we follow their rules and regulations is a boon. And as we are a business entity like any other, I believe that the government extends a helping hand to other companies as well.</p><h4>Can you talk about Sharlu's medium to long-term growth plans?</h4><p>We have been blending for  the most prominent Japanese car and engine makers for over 30 years as their most important supplier by volume, and are looking to expand this partnership. We have also been appointed by one of the major base oil suppliers as one of their exclusive four worldwide distributors of base oil for small quantities in the region. All in all, we are always looking to expand, and we are growing our market share for our two main brands Sharlu and Falcon by addressing the local industry and in our exports to Africa, Asia, and the MENA region and beyond. Additionally, we are focusing on diversifying our business.</p><h4>Can you comment on how the price of crude oil has impacted your business? </h4><p>The price of crude oil does not have a direct impact on Sharlu since the base oil that we use is a byproduct of the refineries, and there is a lag between crude oil price and base oil price. Our problem, however, is that our clients refrain from importing or buying, especially the major distributors, because they note that price of crude is too low. This is the only way it affects our business. It is definitely a period we must watch closely and be tight in our supply of raw material. We do not speculate on the product, as we sell, buy, and produce to order.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The government is acutely aware of the potential, economic risks, and is keen to mitigate unsavory developments in the sector. I do not foresee an imminent major impact. I believe the UAE will continue to grow more substantially and sustainably. This goes for Sharlu as well. We are looking to expand, and will be breaking into new markets. We have been operating at the new plant for eight years, but it needs more fine-tuning and streamlining to enable us to increase our export to other markets. From a financial perspective, Sharlu is healthy and sufficiently stable to weather any competition, which is fierce in this business, and we will be enjoying continued YoY growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Crescent Petroleum developed into a regional leader in the upstream sector?</h4><p>Crescent is proud to have been operating regionally and internationally for over forty years. Our roots, headquarters, and heart are here in Sharjah. We initiated our operations here with the offshore Mubarek field. We grew from that and pioneered various activities in the region including cross border trade natural gas. We have offices in the UK, as well as throughout the region. We have big operations in Iraq and in Egypt through our affiliate. Crescent was also instrumental in the creation of Dana Gas.</p><h4>How important is socio-economic development for the region, and how is Crescent Petroleum trying to achieve that? </h4><p>We are blessed in the UAE with stability and a positive trajectory. Clearly, the source of stability is in socio-economic development, and above all creating sustainable jobs for the future. There is a lot of unmet need here domestically and regionally for energy solutions, and we feel ready to address those needs as a regional player with an understanding of the local dynamics and relationships.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the current volatility of oil prices in terms of the opportunities and challenges that it creates for the oil and gas sector? </h4><p>What was unusual and impacted us the most over the past year was the speed of the fall in oil prices, a 60% drop within months. That means that higher costs of oil elsewhere in the world may come off the market, and it means that all companies and governments that are exposed to that price risk need to be more conscious of costs. The key for the Middle East is to take advantage of this opportunity to be more cost conscious and instigate fundamental energy reforms, particularly pertaining to energy subsidies. Half of the world's energy subsidies last year—$220 billion—were consumed in the MENA region. That is a real destruction of value and that money could be invested in more productive ventures. Subsidy reform is not an easy thing, but it is easier when oil prices are lower because the difference is less. Also, there is room for long term planning on the energy mix and ensuring that the right incentives are provided for the private sector to maximize investment upstream and develop more of the huge resources that this region has. This region has half of the world's oil and gas, yet actual production is a fraction of that. There is a lot of scope for growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the global oil and gas sector?</h4><p>One of the key trends is the rise of the independent oil and gas companies. The sector used to be dominated by the national companies and the large multinationals. Smaller companies are driving the shale revolution in the US for example, and independent local companies are starting to become bigger players in their regions. A second important trend is the rise of gas. If coal was the fuel of the 19th century and oil was the fuel of the 20th century, then gas surely is the fuel of the 21st century. Though adding renewables to the mix and long-term sustainability beyond the fossil fuel world is important, natural gas is the cleanest and cheapest sustainable fuel for industry. This is why the demand for gas is growing phenomenally across the world and in the region. In the US they have switched more to natural gas, and as a result their emissions rates are the lowest in 20 years. Europe has actually failed to meet their targets, and they are actually importing coal from America to burn for power. The third key trend is going to be the role of the sector in contributing to the challenge of climate change and sustainable growth.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Despite the challenges and sometimes negative headlines, I am an optimist about the future of the region, and a firm believer that our absolute priority must be to deliver better economic opportunities for future generations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah's government has recently boosted budget spending to $4.82 billion in a bid to stimulate economic growth. Can you tell us more about the way in which the budget increase will achieve this?</h4><p>The budget for the Emirate of Sharjah, which is set under the guidance of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah is mainly geared towards education, culture, infrastructure, health, and free housing for local families. Though our budget has rapidly grown in recent years, it is still a relatively small budget. The reason for this is that His Highness wants Sharjah to grow organically and sustainably, instead of exponentially, which could have a negative impact in the future. This strategy was part of the reason Sharjah was not affected as much by the 2008 crisis, which only had a minimal effect. As a result, the government currently has a low debt burden, and enjoys a stable fiscal position. We leave commercial ventures to the public and investors, as our focus is on building the country and its infrastructure through investments that we are undertaking gradually. </p><h4>Sharjah has received an “A3“ long-term credit rating from Moody's, and an A rating from Standard and Poor's. What is your assessment of the Emirate's fiscal position, and how pivotal are these ratings in positioning Sharjah as a preferred destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>Sharjah received those ratings for the first time in 2014, after two years of hard work from our department and other stakeholders. The ratings were vital for our position on the capital markets. Since our aim as the government of Sharjah was to issue Islamic bonds, we needed to be in the possession of a sovereign credit rating. As our economy is small compared to other economies, it has been very helpful for a lot of things. Investment inflow has significantly grown, as investor confidence has increased and they know Sharjah is a safe place to invest. Our local banks are benefiting from the rating, because it reflects positively on them for the sake of their own credit ratings. Also, our rating contributes to the overall economic rating of the UAE. The rating has also strengthened us on the borrowing market, where interest has gone down for us. As I mentioned before, we wanted this rating to be able to issue Islamic bonds, sukuk, which we did in September 2014, when we issued a 10-year, $750 million sukuk, which was the Emirate's debut debt issue on capital markets, and has been a huge success. The sukuk will make Sharjah more stable, and will allow us to concentrate on other issues. We have already received inquiries for a new one. This, however, will not happen anytime soon, as we abide by our principles of sustainability.</p><h4>Sharjah's well-diversified economy has recorded strong GDP growth from 2001 to 2014, with no sector representing more than 20% of GDP. How do you view the future growth path of Sharjah's economy?</h4><p>Sharjah was affected by the crisis, but because of the structure of the economy, the only sector that was really hit was real estate. The impact there was mitigated, however, because the number of construction projects was not that high. Looking to the future, Sharjah is still moving forward and growing steadily. His Highness is focusing on educating the local people that will in the future make up the workforce of Sharjah. His emphasis on education is what will put Sharjah firmly in place to continue to enjoy growth in the future. </p><h4>What are your department's expectations for the coming year? </h4><p>We are positive, and we have always been positive. HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi always tells us to look on the bright side. We are managing our budgets under his guidance, we can see his vision, and we are managing our income and expenditure in Sharjah and I am confident in the team at the Finance Department, which is doing a great job. The future is bright, not only in Sharjah, but across the Emirates. A lot of people are anxious about future economic stability, but we have been safe here and growing, and we have a lot of expatriates, who come and live here, and they love living here and we are happy to have them, as we have a very welcoming country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-brains-of-the-operation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shurooq has targeted four sectors that need investment: tourism, environment, transport and logistics, and healthcare. Can you tell us more about the opportunities that exist in these sectors?</h4><p>The first area of growth is the transportation and logistics sector, which comprises almost 6% of GDP, and we need to increase that. Looking at the expected growth rate and what the expected market size increase is, there is a huge gap in what is available and what can be done. For tourism, our aim is to increase the current contribution of 10% to GDP. Sharjah requires almost 3,000 additional beds to cope with increasing tourist numbers, so we need more hotels and more resorts. We also want to attract more passenger carriers to come to Sharjah, and we want more restaurants. Shurooq supports investors by providing them land with support for their facilities, and even getting them to the right operators to fill those hotels in the future. We are actively trying to diversify the tourism sector to cater to all kinds of tourists, be it cultural tourists, beach tourists, or ecotourists. We are developing ecotourism in Kalba, beach tourism in Khorfakkan, and cultural tourism in the city of Sharjah. Healthcare is also a big topic in terms of investment and development in the entire Arab world. The services are not as advanced as in Europe or Asia, so governments are trying to attract investors that are willing to establish their own hospitals and institutes. Most governments in the GCC have created zones, and Sharjah also created the Sharjah Healthcare City, a freezone offering ample opportunities to investors. One area that we are targeting in particular is healthcare services for the elderly, where there is a huge gap between supply and demand for services. The fourth sector we focus on is the environment. We are trying to promote companies that can provide us with energy efficient products that would reduce our carbon footprint and emissions. It is a huge market that accounts for nearly $41million, and it experiences a 15% YoY growth. Sharjah was the first city in the region to go into recycling. Bee'ah has played a major role in this sector, and we are trying to attract investors to work closely with them.</p><h4>How specifically does Shurooq facilitate investment in Sharjah? </h4><p>We create market intelligence, conduct studies, and provide investors with market data rather than just telling them to come and invest in Sharjah. We promote Sharjah through international roadshows, and deal directly with Chambers of Commerce in different countries around the world. Furthermore, we have seminars with foreign business councils in the Emirate. However, Shurooq's role is more than just providing market intelligence. We actually work hand in hand with investors in providing land for projects and easing the process within the government departments. We don't give financial support to our investors because we believe those investors are coming ready to invest. However, we do enter into joint ventures with investors and work with local entities to facilitate the process for investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the low price of crude oil impact on the bank's operations?</h4><p>We used to be very active in the oil trade but we exited at the right time, our activity in is now limited to cash rich companies, and consequently the direct impact of the lower price is limited. However, since the UAE is a major exporter of oil, the revenue of the country has been negatively affected, which has resulted in some projects being frozen and not going through as planned. The lower price will be a temporary issue, and we are now in the $60-70 price bracket, which is high enough to generate sufficient revenue for countries like the UAE. If it continues, though, it might have an effect on expenditure and thus on major projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. But the country is rich, even a prolonged reduction will not have a large impact since there is a huge buffer. If anything, the UAE will be  affected by the decrease in Russian and Chinese tourists visiting the country, but that effect will most probably be mitigated as well, as the UAE is experienced in weathering the storms of economic crises, as was evident in the 2008 aftermath. </p><h4>How have you managed to shield the bank from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis? </h4><p>Most of the banks were affected, but first of all, the government stepped in to help those banks that had liquidity issues, and most of the banks gave back the money after the crisis or converted it into equity. Since we are highly capitalized, we did not need such an option and we returned the money. The crisis affected some of our customers, especially real estate developers, and some customers active in regional trade. All in all, it has been manageable. We know our customers well, and we did not have any that simply ran away or left exposures. Since 1977, we have seen many crises and even wars. Our structure is such that we have always been extremely liquid, and we have from inception used the rule that 30% of our total deposits has to be invested in liquid assets, which is roughly what Basel III states, because we never wanted to be a problem for the government of Sharjah or the Central Bank. </p><h4>As the bank has gradually expanded throughout the UAE, how would you describe future expansion plans?</h4><p>There are basically two ways of expansion that are open to us. Either we go for cross border acquisitions and we consider a merger with another financial institution in the UAE. Unfortunately, we cannot undertake cross-Emirates mergers. As of today, we are still preoccupied with consolidating our presence in certain Emirates, which makes a lot of sense. If we really want to grow as a bank, we should look for a merger with a bank that is into retail banking, because it should be complementary to our corporate banking services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which areas of your diversified business portfolio are most important in your overall growth plans? </h4><p>We aspire to being an international group. For us, being international means being defined in a number of different ways. Having regional operations is fundamental. Five years ago, we started focusing on Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. We have started selecting other countries to expand—such as Malaysia. Currently, we are exporting to over 40 countries around the world. Our vision for the future definitely focuses on growing this international capacity, as well as continuously improving the professionalism of our business and people. Our healthcare group is a specific area where I see a lot of potential for growth, as the entire sector is growing very rapidly in the UAE and GCC. Specifically, we want to provide home healthcare services to the aging population, which is still a very much underdeveloped segment. In healthcare, we enjoy a large market share in the UAE. In order to support our international partners/agencies to better market and distribute their products, we will concentrate on growing our distribution services. We are also considering getting involved in PPPs in the various Emirates in the context of diagnostic services, but this is not something that has come up yet. Other areas for growth largely revolve around our consumer goods group, where I see good opportunities for expansion. Tourism is witnessing a lot of growth at the moment across the UAE, and with it the retail food sector.</p><h4>How have training programs enabled the Group to create a competitive advantage along its range of diversified businesses?</h4><p>We hold regular formal training sessions for our employees, and separately conduct leadership training. We also host an annual Albatha Learning Festival, where we gather all of our employees for voluntary learning sessions across a wide range of subjects. The first day is reserved for blue-collar workers, and the next two days of the three-day festival are for all of the other staff. Human development is highly valued within our Group, and we want to be a learning organization. We aim to grow and instill professionalism throughout our group by seeking and retaining talent, and through professionalizing processes in our system. Improving the professionalism and training the workforce is complemented by our aim to create the right kind of environment for our employees. We try our utmost to have a positive environment throughout the Group that inspire people and motivate them to work hard and stay with us for a long-term career, because they believe in the values of the group. Majority of our management leadership has been in place for more than 15 years, and we are living and practicing the values that we are teaching to our employees. It is important for us to instill work ethics that harbor creativity as well</p><h4>How would you assess the initiatives of Sharjah's government to open up the Emirate's economy to foreign investment?</h4><p>The government has been supportive in terms of facilitating foreign investment. Sharjah has a large, small and medium scale industry that dates back to early days, and this SME sector really is Sharjah's niche. Sharjah is welcoming to foreign investors, and that is why people have invested into the industries here, which have turned out to be highly successful. Our manufacturing facilities are in Sharjah, where a lot of ancillary products and services are readily available. Sharjah has done well to attract investment, especially via the two free zones. The Emirate has also announced plans for Sharjah Healthcare City, we see a lot of new initiatives on the cultural and tourism side, as well as improving infrastructure. As a result, the economy here continues to flourish. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are both the Hamriyah Free Zone and SAIF contributing to economic growth in Sharjah? </h4><p>Both free zones are a very crucial component of the economy of Sharjah, and serve as its backbone. Today, over 13,000 companies have been established in both free zones, and over 1,000 industries ranging from small to medium to heavy industries have been set up. We have investors of 157 different nationalities, who are active in different economic sectors in our zones. The free zones were developed to encourage more FDI investment within Sharjah, since Sharjah was a leading industrial city with 33% of all the industry of the UAE. The free zones compliment that growth, and we are targeting unique sectors for growth within Sharjah specifically and within the UAE. When it comes to industries, we are very specialized, we look at integration and clustering and we look at how we can develop our services further to let our investors have a well-balanced, one-stop service business environment that enables their growth. </p><h4>Which economic sectors are most important in the Hamriyah Free Zone?</h4><p>The biggest sectors are oil and gas and maritime. Furthermore, the Hamriyah Free Zone is the largest steel zone in the UAE. We are also the second largest oil storage zone in the UAE, and we are expanding and looking at new customers to set up their businesses in that sector. We have many other sectors like building materials and food production, which we are looking to expand as we have recently created a new food and plastic packaging zone. This is a new project in Hamriyah that will cater to a specific clientele within the free zone; we are encouraging customers from around the world to participate. We are continuously looking at growing our number of clients in Hamriyah in different sectors and segmentations.</p><h4>Are you experiencing an influx in investors as a result of that? </h4><p>We are gaining ground in sectors such as the food and petrochemical sectors. We are also expanding the steel sector in the free zone, and we have the largest private shipbuilding facility, which is Damen Shipyard with around 350,000 sqm of land. We look at different sectors, and we also look at how we can compliment these industries together. Sometimes certain industries are not aware of other industries that are in the free zone, so we match them together, which creates synergy and builds more business between them.  Today the free zone has an area of 22 million sqm and to cope with the rising  future demand, a further expansion of 10 million sqm area has been planned.</p><h4>Which sectors have you prioritized for foreign investment in the coming year?</h4><p>Sharjah has always had a balanced economy; we have a certain margin of growth that we focus on. What we are trying to do now is look at how we can upgrade our services in the different fields in both free zones. We are looking at more software-enabled services—more third party enabled services to improve the efficiency for our clients when it comes to cargo and transportation and other facility management services. The free zone has very good growth and we are very optimistic about the next five years. We are looking at new sectors and new countries, such as the US, Canada, Portugal, and Brazil. We are also looking at Europe in a big way, because it is a big market for us. We have recently gone to Japan, which was very encouraging. We already have some Japanese firms, but our aim is to get more clients from Japan. We are looking at expanding into manufacturing because the Japanese are very good in this field and we want to encourage more industries to come here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Sharjah's particular strengths as a destination for foreign investment?</h4><p>Sharjah is the industrial center, cultural capital, and education hotspot of the UAE. Its diversified economy and carefully considered approach to investment and development have guided the Emirate through challenging economic times and laid the foundations for future growth. Sharjah's economic resilience is further fueled by more than 45,000 strong SMEs that benefit from the competitiveness of the Emirate's supply chain. Entrepreneurs and family businesses in manufacturing, real estate, business services, and trading play an integral role in the flow of commerce, both domestically and regionally. Sharjah's three deep-water ports also provide vital access to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. Port Khalid, Hamriyah Port, and Khorfakkan Port have a combined capacity of 2.4 million containers and are fully equipped to handle a wide range of vessels, from break-bulk to containers. </p><p>The creation of free zones such as the Hamriyah Free Zone and Sharjah Airport Free zone have further encouraged full ownership of the companies. With a GDP of $30.76 billion generated in 2014, Sharjah is one of the leading industrial powers in the UAE, providing a solid base with flexible ports that are ideally positioned within the Emirates. The rules and regulations around investment are transparent and clear, protecting both sides equally, and giving confidence to investors. Another important factor is the reputation and resilience of banks in Sharjah. Despite the severity of the global financial crisis in recent years, Sharjah prospered where so many other cities around the world struggled. This is due to the fiscal policies that have been put in place, the stability of lending, and the strength of balance sheets. The international credit rating agency Moody's, for example, recently reaffirmed Sharjah's A3 long-term credit rating with a stable outlook due to the Emirate's strong fiscal and government debt position, diversified economic structure with a competitive manufacturing sector, and the government's focus on education.</p><h4>How is Shurooq driving the socio-economic development and growth of Sharjah, while at the same time retaining the Emirate's heritage?</h4><p>Under the patronage of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, Sharjah's cultural scene has flourished since its designation as UNESCO's “Cultural Capital of the Arab World" in 1998. Later named the Capital of Arab Tourism 2015, Sharjah is home to nearly a quarter of all the UAE's museums, and to seminal international and regional events such as the Sharjah Biennial and the Sharjah International Book Fair. Sharjah is proud of its roots and heritage, and at the same time embraces all races and beliefs, with expatriates from more than 190 nationalities working and living here. We have also made many contributions in countries such as Egypt and Morocco, which is part of our socio-economic growth and development.</p><h4>Which projects and initiatives are expected to have the most significance for Sharjah's development in the near future?</h4><p>Shurooq's mandate includes drawing up investment-related legislation, investing in new projects, and signing and concluding partnership agreements and MoUs that help bolster investment rates and economic activities within the Emirate. Shurooq also focuses on building Sharjah's economic structure within the framework of sustainable development and environmental friendliness, in line with international standards. By setting up a comprehensive information center that highlights investment opportunities, Shurooq has facilitated development targets with other bodies and organizations, and set up special investment zones and suggested investment-related laws to further facilitate these endeavors. This includes enhancing integration with government and private organizations to ensure achievement of short-, medium-, and long-term goals, as well as encouraging free circulation of information and data between legal, tourism, and economic bodies. Capitalizing on Sharjah's burgeoning tourism sector, Shurooq has developed, and is continuing to develop, a range of world-class tourism and leisure projects. Shurooq's portfolio combines retail, cultural attractions, and F&amp;B, offering 26 premium investment opportunities in exceptional master-planned destinations. One such recent notable development is the $21.78 million tourism project on Al Noor Island in Sharjah's Khalid Lagoon. The island, which extends over an area of 45,470sqm, is the Arab world's first island to combine nature, art, and entertainment. Last year, Sharjah welcomed more than 1.9 million tourists, a number that is expected to be exceeded significantly this year in light of the large scale celebrations, which include over a thousand international cultural, tourism, and entertainment events, planned to mark Sharjah's year as Capital of Islamic Culture for 2014. Shurooq has numerous projects in the pipeline, all of which will have great significance in terms of Sharjah's future development.</p><p>Shurooq has also helped others to collaborate with various Sharjah enterprises, aiding the Emirate in becoming a one-stop location for all foreign investors. In recognition of its overall accomplishments, Shurooq was named The Banking Awards FDI Agency of the Year in 2013 and 2014 in the MENA region at the European's Global Banking and Finance Awards. Additionally, the Authority was named the Top Investment Promotion Agency at the 2015 Best to Invest Award by Site Selection magazine.</p><h4>As one of the architects of the Emirate's future, what is your long-term vision for Sharjah not only in terms of economic growth, but also social and cultural development?</h4><p>We are constantly looking forward and we always set the bar high and encourage others to raise their standards. There is much evidence that our economy continues to develop, and that we are reaching far beyond the UAE. Cultural events like the Sharjah International Book Fair and Sharjah Heritage Days contribute to the long-term social and cultural development of the state. Additionally, Sharjah has over 1,000 mosques, which earned it the title “City of 1,000 Minarets." This shows that as we continue to build and use the latest technology, we don't forget our culture and heritage. Keeping true to our roots and traditions is vital for Sharjah. Importantly, Sharjah has always paid special attention to the arts and with culture, and is host to a regular schedule of diverse creative events designed to appeal to the broad spectrum of the community, organized by the many art institutes and centers in Sharjah. Maraya Art Park, one notable example, acts as a platform for regional and international artists, boasting two locations directly on the fascinating Al Majaz Waterfront; the Sculpture Park and Children's Art center. Furthermore, there is also the Sharjah Biennial, established in 1993, which has grown rapidly from a traditional and regionally focused exhibition into the internationally recognized event. The Emirate takes pride in its unique architecture, an ode to the Emirate's authenticity, composed of five major components; heritage, traditions, arts, culture, and education. And to promote its tradition, Sharjah continues to maintain the buildings that are such an integral part of its history. Projects range from several heritage villages—in Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Al Dhaid, which showcase the spirit of Emirati culture and traditional ceremonial practices—to the Heart of Sharjah, which aims, once it is completed in 2025, to be a central hub for all cultural activities in the Emirate. Seeking to reflect what Sharjah was like over half a century ago, the Heart of Sharjah will restore and revamp the city's traditional areas to create a tourist and trade destination with contemporary artistic touches, yet one that still retains the feel of the 1950s.</p><p>As a center for business and investment, Sharjah is in the midst of a truly dramatic transformation. The Emirate has the most diversified economy in the GCC, with no single sector making up more than 20% of GDP, while also contributing to a large proportion—around one-third—of the UAE's manufacturing sector, as well as having 18 industrial zones spanning an area of 15sqkm.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current state of Sharjah's economy, and what strategies have been implemented by the Department to boost economic development?</h4><p>The economy is going through one of the best periods of economic growth, as reflected by a record GDP growth rate of over 8% in 2014, and a growth in gross fixed capital formation of 6.4% in 2013. On top of that, Sharjah has enjoyed a limited inflation rate of about 4%. Also, it has witnessed high and direct operational spending on labor, which hit a growth rate of 6.5% and consequently achieved significant growth rates in a number of sectors, such as construction, wholesale, and retail, where workers compensation rates rose up to 9.4% and 6.4% respectively. The Department's annual business indicators reflect Sharjah's fortuitous economic status; where the new licenses that SEDD issued in 2014 increased by 6.3%, and license renewals grew by 6.4% compared to 2013. Furthermore, the number of new enterprises that were established increased by 5% due to the fact that more industries have started to conduct business in Sharjah throughout 2014. Additionally, commercial enterprises grew by 7.9%. SEDD looks at local indicators as well as the growth of licenses through an integrated perspective that enables sustainable development in economic, social, and environmental terms. Also, it works on developing the economic performance by improving its services, encouraging investment, and applying initiatives to save investors' time and reduce their costs in accordance with the World Bank determinants for conducting business. Also, SEDD is concerned with social issues through raising the number of local businesses where it releases “Eitimad" license that enable locals to conduct their business from home, in addition to supporting national and youth enterprises. Furthermore, SEDD is committed to applying requirements for environmental compatibility of Sharjah's enterprises, and achieving a green economy in the context of attaining sustainable development in the Emirate.</p><h4>SEDD has joined forces with Shurooq and the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) in promoting Sharjah's economy. How would you assess this increasingly holistic institutional approach to growing Sharjah's economy?</h4><p>Sharjah's economic performance and vision to attain economic development require placing efforts in a number of sectors in order to attain a standardized methodology that affects the main sectors positively. As a result, SEDD realizes the importance of collaborating with all economic development partners in the Emirate, not just with SCCI and Shurooq, but also with the consumer, producer, financial institutions, and government agencies, which play crucial roles in the economic development of Sharjah at the local and federal levels. Lately, SEDD turned its focus to create a partnership with Shurooq and SCCI by attending several joint meetings and promoting investment in Sharjah. It has linked its working environment with the investment view of Shurooq and the tools that SCCI holds to communicate with businesses. As such, SEDD completes the economic management triangle at the governmental level where it promotes Shurooq's vision of investment and supports SCCI's process in linking products and services with the requirements of the market. </p><h4>What factors make Sharjah an attractive destination for investment and in which particular sectors of the economy do you see the most significant investment opportunities? </h4><p>Sharjah enjoys competitive features not only at the local level, but at the regional level as well. The most important aspect of Sharjah is that it has been a family business incubator since the 1970s, which helped in making it an ideal environment for establishing business and enterprises. Sharjah also has a comprehensive educational structure that compliments the economic structure, where it used to have the largest port in the Gulf in Khor Fakkan Port, and the first airport in the region. Sharjah has witnessed significant developments resulting from economic initiatives and projects launched due to the directives of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah. The most promising sectors of Sharjah's economy are utilities, hospitality, transport and logistics, real estate and construction, business services, financial enterprises, government services, as these have reached major growth in 2013. Growth in some sectors is a direct result of increased government spending, such as the utilities sector where rates increased from 1% in 2012 to 12.5% in 2013, the hospitality sector that recorded 3% in 2012 and 9.4% in 2013, as well as government services sector that attained a growth rate of 2% in 2012 and 11.2% in 2013. Such quantum leaps in these sectors drive the need for additional unconventional local and international investment, such as through PPPs between Sharjah's government and the private sectors. </p><h4>It is estimated that Sharjah will continue to post strong GDP growth in the years to come. What is your medium- to long-term outlook for the economy of Sharjah, and what are your particular expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>Sharjah has achieved a compound GDP growth rate of 11% in the past ten years, proving that Sharjah's economy is sustainable and hasn't been exposed to structural imbalances, even in  the wake of the crisis of 2008. On the contrary, Sharjah reached a GDP growth rate of 4.2% in 2009, and went on to post 8.5% GDP growth in 2014. Based on these growth rates, we expect that the GDP will reach around AED90 billion ($24.5 billion) in 2015. The Emirate's economy is moving at a steady pace not only in terms of high GDP growth, but also through growth in particular economic sectors. Based on our economic and political analyses, we believe that Sharjah will continue to achieve high growth in the years to come. </p><h4>What goals have you set for the Department for the next five years?</h4><p>In the past two years, SEDD paid great attention to organizing infrastructure, developing organizational performance, building capacity, improving the dealing with investors, facilitating its services in Sharjah and surrounding regions, rehabilitating national cadres, and achieving transparency. The Department has implemented an organizational strategy to enable it to guide the economic development in Sharjah. To strengthen this strategy, HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah called for establishing a Commercial Department and an Industrial Affairs Department at SEDD to focus on the qualitative growth in the main sectors of the Emirate. Also, SEDD has concentrated on implementing a sectorial economic vision that focuses on horizontal geographical development, supporting local businesses, employing local employees from educational institutions, boosting local trading and industrial sectors—especially the wholesale and retail sectors, increasing customer satisfaction by increasing efficiency and saving costs, and developing laws and working conditions in the Emirate. Our aim is to improve the ways of doing business in Sharjah, as well as to monitor and control our markets, to ultimately encourage investment and spending in order to obtain economic growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Netherlands strengthening its trade relationship with the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>One could say that we want to strengthen our relationship with the more traditionally important sectors of the economy, but that we are also very interested in the strategy of the Emirates to diversify its economy and to look for innovation. What I find quite interesting is that the authorities look for innovation within the traditional oil and gas sector, but they are also looking to invest in renewable energy. Investing in renewables is about investing in the hardware and technology, but also in investing in changing the mindset of the people. When you are as resource rich as the Emirates, the first challenge is to acknowledge, which they did, that they need diversification in order to keep up a strong economy for the longer term.</p><h4>What role can Dutch companies play in assisting the development of the renewable energy sector?</h4><p><span></span>I would say that I am impressed by the ambitions of the Emirates in this respect. We have a lot to offer within the gas sector. There are a lot of opportunities where we not only have companies, but we also have consortia of knowledge institutions working together. In the field of renewables, of course, there is wind; moreover, here in the Emirates there is tremendous opportunity for the development of solar energy. It is within both of these segments that we see Dutch companies playing an important role as a partner for development of the UAE.</p><h4>How would you describe the opportunity for further collaboration between the Netherlands and the UAE in the agriculture sector?</h4><p><span></span>We are the second largest exporter of agricultural goods on a global scale. Of course, we have strong ties to the Emirates in that sector, but there are still a lot of opportunities in the areas of fresh fruits, for example, and other places where we have not really explored the market enough to take all the opportunities. Here is a very well developed market with a strong demand for quality products and also the logistics are very well organized, which makes an excellent market for our fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><h4>What role does the UAE play in offsetting the effects of the EU sanctions on Russia concerning agricultural products?</h4><p><span></span>Regardless of the sanctions, we are always looking for new markets and opportunities for deepening our relationships with international markets. Our agricultural market has felt some impact, albeit minimal, from the sanctions. The agricultural sector has managed to look for new markets, so all in all the numbers game is still very good. Obviously, the UAE represents a good opportunity for us for future collaboration. In October 2015 there will be a trade mission with agricultural companies coming here and I think that would be a good moment for Dutch companies to look into more specific opportunities here as well as to team up with businesses already present here.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for collaboration with the UAE in the distribution and development of international humanitarian aid?</h4><p><span></span>I think it's right to say that the UAE is one of the key players on the humanitarian development front. Actually, in 2014, it ranked first in the world. That's a wonderful achievement and I am glad that they are very interested to work with us to continue their success along the lines of trilateral cooperation. I think the days of the concept of a donor-recipient paradigm are more or less over. We want to look at how we can work together using a new model. For the Emirates and us to work in a third country would be very interesting; for example, we could work together in Africa, Asia, or even the Pacific. Equally important to trilateral cooperation is knowledge exchange.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We attach great importance to this nation and region, and this is not only for economic reasons. The United Arab Emirates form a rather small country, but one that leaves a strong mark on world events, just like Belgium. The UAE is very important to us as a basis of stability, prosperity, development, and progress in the Arab World, a world that is currently facing many challenges.  </p><p><span></span>Our cities, countries, and regions enjoy very close trade relations. The UAE is a major hub in international trade and thanks to its visionary leaders, the nation is known in the entire world as a success story of innovation, entrepreneurship, and development, symbolized by its impressive structures. Furthermore, there are multiple global events planned, like the World Expo in 2020, which will only strengthen this reputation. I am speaking from experience as the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels meant a huge boost for the image of our country. I am confident that it will mean the same for the United Arab Emirates.  </p><p>The relations between the UAE and Belgium have always been excellent. The Belgian community in the UAE is the largest in the Gulf Region, with about 3,000 Belgians living and working here. Within the European Union, Belgium is the fifth major exporter of goods to the UAE and the largest importer of goods from the UAE. At a global level, the United Arab Emirates are our nineteenth largest customer and our 21st-largest supplier, ranking just after Canada and preceding Brazil. This makes the United Arab Emirates by far our most important trading partner in the Arab World. The main commercial trade domain is that of diamonds, both in terms of imports and exports. Another important area is gas and oil trade, where Belgian companies play an important role in the development of new infrastructure. Regarding water supply, our country has great knowledge and experience with desalination. In the construction and building sector, we have a very long history of cooperation, as it was the Belgian company BESIX (Six Construct) that realized the Corniche of Abu Dhabi in 1965. Electrabel GFD Suez is involved in building the power plant in Taweelah, Dredging International and Jan de Nul have helped to realize the changes to the shoreline, Belgian luxury products can be found in the country's malls, and Belgian expertise is used in the medical sector, as well as in dozens of other sectors. In Belgium, we have the presence of the chemical group Borealis-Borouge, Abu Dhabi Investment authority, JFB-RAK, ATS Logistics, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlines, and so on. </p><p>This region is full of energy and life, with a strong sense of entrepreneurship, which also strongly characterizes Belgium. Our companies have an extensive experience in this region; they possess high-tech knowledge in the logistics, construction, and petroleum sectors. They bring innovation into the local economy, as demonstrated by so many success stories. It is clear that this country offers many possibilities to Belgian companies, just as Belgium offers many interesting opportunities to businesses from the UAE. I am convinced that the constructive cooperation will only continue to grow in the 21st century and I am looking forward to the results of the UAE's strategy to become one of the world's most innovative nations within seven years. Belgian companies can make a significant contribution in achieving those objectives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the opportunities that exist in Finland for investment stemming from the UAE, and the strategies that the Finnish government has in place to facilitate such investment?</h4><p><span></span>Finland is an advanced industrial economy with a thriving private sector. We have a developed infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and competitive operating costs. Red tape is minimal and Finland is one of the least corrupt countries in the world according to Transparency International. As one of the most competitive and open economies in the world, Finland has a great deal to offer foreign investors. Foreign-owned companies are eligible for a wide range of government and EU incentives on an equal footing with Finnish-owned companies. Foreign-owned companies can benefit from government investment incentives and access research from the extensive cooperation between Finnish universities and the private sector. Finland can offer attractive business and investment partnerships to the UAE, which currently is executing vast and ambitious development programs and plans across the board. </p><h4>Could you reflect on the activities of Finnish companies in the UAE and the sectors of the UAE's economy that offer the most viable opportunities for enhanced cooperation and investment?</h4><p><span></span>For Finland, the UAE represents a stable and predictable business environment with long-term potential and prospects. The UAE has been one of the main trading partners for Finland in the Middle East and Gulf region, and the number of our companies operating in the UAE is constantly growing. The focus of trade has been on paper industry, machinery and engineering, and more recently on information and communication technology. Today, the strengths of the Finnish economy lie both in its high technology industry and in the efficient management of the industry, the economy and society in general. As a result, we are able to provide world class products and services for example in business management, construction, energy, healthcare, and education sectors. </p><h4>What is the significance of the UAE in Finland's foreign trade policy, and how do you see bilateral relations between the countries evolve in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>Finnish exports value to the UAE is roughly ‚¬200 million  annually. It used to be considerably larger in the early years of 2000 when our exports exceeded ‚¬1 billion with Nokia phones in the lead. Exports have declined since, partly because Nokia phone production has been shifted to other countries. Finnish export is, however, picking up again and prospects in various fields seem promising. </p><h4>How are Finland and the United Arab Emirates working towards promoting the foundations of regional peace and stability?</h4><p><span></span>Finland and the UAE are both part of the international coalition to counter ISIL. It is important for both of us to stress that defeating ISIL requires a long-term and comprehensive approach. Finland's efforts range from development aid to supporting the resilience and capabilities of the countries in the region. In March 2015, Finland also made the decision to participate in the security sector training in Iraq, as part of an international effort to strengthen the capability of the Iraqi army and peshmerga forces to counter ISIL. We will participate in the training operation in Erbil with about 50 soldiers for at least one year under the German leadership. Our full capacity in the operation will be reached in the beginning of August. Finland also supports the region with development aid. Our aid to alleviate the effects of the Syrian conflict will be at least ‚¬5 million in 2015. The focus is on building the resilience of the neighboring countries receiving refugees (Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq). In addition, Finland provides humanitarian assistance to the region based on needs. For example, since 2011 we have already provided ‚¬49 million of humanitarian aid to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and ‚¬15.7 million to Yemen. I commend the UAE for its valuable role in international humanitarian efforts. Dubai, in particular, has become a vital humanitarian hub in the region with the efforts made by the International Humanitarian City.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Sharjah's culture and education contributed to the formation of the Emirate's national identity, and how has Sharjah managed to carve out a role for itself in the field of culture and education in the greater region?</h4><p>Thanks to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, Sharjah has always been known for its preservation, patronage, promotion, and celebration of heritage, culture, arts, and knowledge. The Emirate takes pride in its rich Arab and Islamic heritage, civilizational legacy, and believes in peaceful coexistence with all people of the world.<br>In his book Taking the Reins—The Critical Years 1971-1977, His Highness stated in his speech during an announcement on the commencement of oil exportation in 1974: “[…]we are witnessing positive changes in this great country, which aspires to a future filled with opportunities for decent living, wellbeing and peace of mind[…]" He continues: “The plan has the citizens as its main focus point in order that we might create a well-balanced and robust society[…]."</p><p>Sharjah boasts a busy and diverse calendar of spectacular festivals, events, and activities held throughout the year celebrating the Emirati and Arab-Islamic values, its history, and culture. The Emirate is home to more than 20 museums, one of the richest being the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization. Cultural centers, art galleries, and heritage sites build essential parts of our portfolio and embrace the rich history and fruits of development our region has made.  </p><p>Multicultural events with global reach, such as Sharjah International Book Fair, International Government Communication Forum, Sharjah Heritage Days, Sharjah Biennial, Sharjah Light Festival, and Sharjah Water Festival to name few, make the Emirate a year-long, must-visit destination for visitors from around the world.  <br>At the same time, Sharjah is also known for its constant pursuit and patronage of a culture of knowledge and excellence, in the spirit of our civilizational legacy. The Emirate is home to some of the best and world-class universities such as the American University of Sharjah, the University of Sharjah, and colleges and research centers with renowned professors, attracting thousands of students from across the region and around the world. </p><p>In 1998, UNESCO declared Sharjah the Cultural Capital of the Arab world; and in 2014 the Emirate was crowned the Islamic Culture Capital by the Islamic Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (ISESCO).  <br>This year, Sharjah is being celebrated as the Arab Tourism Capital by the Arab Tourism Organisation of the Arab League. Culture and education arguably form the backbone and pillars of Sharjah's national identity that are in line with the UAE's vision. The Emirate has successfully integrated those two fundamental pillars of human rights and bedrocks of sustainable development into the vision as inherent components to carve a unique identity and niche for itself in the region and to position the Emirate on the world map. </p><h4>As the industrial hub of the UAE, how has Sharjah created a viable environment for industrial companies, and what efforts is the government currently undertaking to consolidate Sharjah's position as a preferred destination for industries?</h4><p>Besides being the citadel of culture and heritage in the UAE and the region, Sharjah also happens to host nearly half of the country's manufacturing and industrial sector. Sharjah is an important base in the region for hundreds of multinational companies and is a major destination for foreign investors, thanks to its central position in the UAE and location along the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. <br>Sharjah's traditionally business- and investor-friendly policies and economic environment allowed to establish some of the biggest and well-equipped, world-class industrial areas and free zones. Strategically located at the confluence of major sea trade routes and Africa, Asia, and Europe, the Emirate is also home to three well-equipped, major seaports—the Port Khalid, Khorfakkan Port, and Hamriyah Port. </p><h4>Which sectors of Sharjah's vibrant economy are most poised for growth and offer the best investment opportunities for the private sector?</h4><p>Sharjah is one of the region's fastest growing and most diverse economies and offers tremendous growth potential and investment opportunities in all areas—especially in infrastructure development, industry, education, and tourism and hospitality sectors. </p><h4>What initiatives and projects to be implemented by the government of Sharjah in the next few years will be most instrumental in driving Sharjah's socio-economic development forward?</h4><p>The government of Sharjah has been constantly working and exploring measures to enhance its citizens' standard of life in the Emirate, develop its infrastructure, and offer enriching leisure experiences for its people. For decades, Sharjah—led by His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah—has been investing heavily in the Emirate's infrastructure, economy, education, and social welfare sectors. We are encouraging private sector stakeholders to do the same to generate more economic avenues, employment, and residential opportunities for our people. </p><p>Pursuing the same vision of the leadership, the Sharjah Executive Council has in the past few years initiated a number of innovative policies and projects that have fuelled the pace of growth in the Emirate and will have a long-term impact on Sharjah in terms of economic prospects. </p><p>In the past few years, Sharjah has initiated a number of ambitious, groundbreaking projects including the Heart of Sharjah, the billion dirham Kalba ecotourism initiative, and the AED500 million Sir Bu Nair Island project. The Sharjah Investment Development Authority (Shurooq) is planning to unveil many more such projects in the next few years that are set to catapult the Emirate further on the path of economic progress and will immensely benefit its people. </p><h4>Sharjah has recorded strong year-on-year GDP growth in the last decade, and this is forecast to continue. What is your medium-term outlook for the economy?</h4><p>Sharjah has registered remarkable, consistent growth, year by year, in accordance with the economic vision and strategy of the Emirate's leadership. Two important achievements have been recorded by our Finance Department.  </p><p>Firstly, two leading international credit rating agencies, namely Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) rated Sharjah as a sovereign government entity with a long-term credit rating (Moody's: A3, S&amp;P: A). These credit ratings firmly established Sharjah within the top tier of sovereigns globally, affirming its position as a leading investment destination</p><p>Secondly, the government has announced the issuance of its debut transaction in the Debt Capital Markets, a $750 million 10-year Sukuk Al Ijara priced at 3.764%. This is not only the government of Sharjah's first issuance, but also the first time a sovereign has executed a 10-year Sukuk in its debut issuance. </p><p>We expect and are confident that the Emirate's economy will follow the same trajectory of growth as far as both medium and the long-term economic outlook is concerned.</p><p>The Emirate follows an open-door policy for local, regional, and international investors and spares no effort in making Sharjah an ideal, attractive, and friendly destination for trade, investments, and tourism in the region and around the world. </p><p>Our medium-term outlook for the economy holds many estate projects that will allow non-Arab nationals to invest into the Emirate and open opportunities to increase the economic output.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the reasons for the establishment of the Sharjah Media Centre, and how would you rate its success to this day?</h4><p>The reason for the establishment of the Sharjah Media Centre was, ultimately, to promote Sharjah. We found that Sharjah's governmental entities were not communicating to the press as effectively as they should have, and regarded the center as a tool to ease communications between the government, media, and the public. Thus, the center was created in 2011 under the patronage of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, who charged us to educate the employees of every government entity on government communication and equip them with all tools that would ease their work. I think the center has been very successful, since we have increased awareness for Sharjah and the importance of communication between the government and the public by more than 50%. Training the departments has also paid off, and they now work well together with media organizations. Our strategy is to be a role model for the departments in the sense that we implement every initiative in our own organization before exporting them to others. We opened our doors to all journalists who hold a healthy curiosity about Sharjah and want to obtain more information about its history. They can come here and get all the material they need at any given moment within the week. </p><h4>How will the center's four-pronged strategic plan, which you unveiled in January of this year, strengthen the center going forward?</h4><p>Our overarching aim is to ensure that Sharjah is put on the global map with the center as a focal point of contact for not only the global media, but all organizations and individuals interested in our Emirate. We want everything that comes out about Sharjah to go everywhere, and we will be utilizing the four-pronged strategic plan to achieve this. Firstly, we aim to focus on continuously developing ourselves and support other departments approaching us. By training government officials and educating them, we are increasing their understanding of government communications, which is resulting in significantly more interaction between government and media. The second aspect of our plan is to empower young nationals, especially women, by offering them a position at the center to show their creativity and prove their capabilities. Most of the people who work with us are fresh graduates with zero, or very little experience outside of the university. They have started their career with us, and are thus very loyal. We want to show that the best people are not necessarily the most experienced ones, though we do of course have experienced employees as pillars. Thirdly, we do a lot of research in government communication and get in touch with different entities locally and internationally to obtain international best practices for developing government communications locally and internationally. The fourth leg of the plan is focused on documentation. One of our initiatives is a virtual government communication library, which features and archives all  presentations, speeches and educational material on government communications, and is open to the  world wide community.  </p><h4>How significant is the annual International Government Communication Forum the center hosts for Sharjah's regional position as a nexus for culture and media?</h4><p>The main reason for the forum was to develop our own team and our own Emirate into finding new ways of government communication and new best practices. However, it turned out that it is also a good opportunity to market ourselves. The forum has grown in scope, as well as in number of attendees, since we first hosted it. It has allowed us to become acquainted with numerous government communication experts, and we have been host to a number of high-profile speakers, such as Turkey's President Erdoğan and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, to name a few. Apart from high-profile speakers, we focus on names that will help improve the forum and the Government Communication Library itself, such as academics. We prefer to focus on the content of the forum rather than just the show of it. Thus, we have workshops that serve to develop our communication tools. At the outset of each forum, we formulate recommendations and sometimes initiatives that will be discussed during that particular International Government Communication Forum, after which we implement the initiative in Sharjah. For example, our second Forum produced the Government Communication Award, which we have hosted since. This Award, which aims to incentivize departments to pursue the best government communication practices, has 11 categories and an independent committee selects the winners.</p><h4>How are you overcoming the challenges that exist in the region facing efficient and effective government communication?</h4><p>We face different challenges every year. When we started, our biggest challenge was to change popular perception of Sharjah and how the media was trying to, unsuccessfully, publicize Sharjah. We have overcome this through aforementioned initiatives and policies that we have undertaken since inception. The other challenge that we have to face is technology. It develops and changes  so rapidly that it is hard to stay up to date. Government departments are lost if they are not up-to-date with the latest technology and latest advances in government communications. Most departments have adapted well to technological advances, and the majority of them are competing with one another to win our prestigious Government Communication Award</p><h4>What are your organization's expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>The media sector is growing very fast. It is progressing; just as technology is developing every year, this sector is developing fast as well, which requires us to stay up-to-date. A lot of tools will come out that will help us to be accessible for everyone. We need to communicate not just to a certain percentage of the population but to  each individual. This year we launched Sharjah24.ae, which is an electronic newspaper that we think a large percentage of the youth will use. Sharjah24.ae is operated under the purview of Sharjah Media Centre, the media and communications arm of the Government of Sharjah and serves the public as a reliable reference for daily news consumption about events taking place in the United Arab Emirates and the Emirate of Sharjah in particular. We communicate through newspapers, TV programs, social media, and numerous other applications. We are also developing training programs for different departments in order to upgrade their way of communicating. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can Belgium learn from Malaysia and, in turn, how can Malaysia benefit from Belgium's strengths in the fields of science and technology?</h4><p>Malaysia's excellent geographic location allows the country to position itself as an Asian hub for the halal industry and Islamic finance. The World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, which ranks Malaysia 25th out of 160—and first among the Upper Middle Income Countries—proves Malaysia's attractiveness as a logistics hub. Moreover, Malaysia's Islamic economy boasts a strong international reputation. Benefitting from Malaysia's expertise would not only allow Belgian companies to better cater to the Malaysian market, but could also be a key to open doors in other regions where the Islamic economy is present. The Etiqa joint venture between Belgium's Ageas Insurance and Maybank is a perfect example of how our respective companies could benefit from each other's strengths. With a total value of the Islamic Economy estimated at $6.3 trillion, the stakes are high. In this perspective, we must not forget that the sector also has a potential in Europe as well, with Belgium and its neighboring countries alone counting for approximately 12 million Muslims. Malaysian companies could benefit from this market by investing in our region. From our side, Belgium is ready to become Malaysia's gateway to Europe. Other Asian countries have already made extensive use of our infrastructure and our manpower. I'm thinking in particularly of our seaports and our airports, which serve as a hub for Europe, both for passenger and freight traffic. Belgium is located in the heart of Europe, has an incredibly skilled and multi-lingual labour force, and offers an advantageous tax regime for foreign companies keen to invest in our country. Belgium has a lot to offer to Malaysia: ranking 15th in the world in terms of GDP per capita and 19th in the value of its exports, Belgium and its companies give proof of a high degree of economic efficiency, combined with an outward look on the world. In the world of S&amp;T, many Belgian scientists are currently working at leading foreign universities. At home, the high scientific standard of Belgian universities attracts many foreign students and researchers to our scientific institutions. Traditionally, science in Belgium was linked to education and the public sector. But for the past few decades, Belgian scientific research has been strongly industry driven, with a special focus on space travel, biochemistry, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and IT.</p><h4>There is a growing Belgian business community in Malaysia. What attracts these companies to set up regional offices here, and what opportunities does the Malaysian market present?</h4><p>There are currently approximately 385 Belgians registered in Malaysia and we hope to reach the cap of 400 this year. The overall majority of the Belgian community resides in Malaysia for business reasons. Different assets of the country attract them. Firstly, Malaysia has a unique geographical location: centrally positioned in South East Asia, the country is an ideal hub for the ASEAN region as well as the Far East. The Strait of Malacca is a vital artery for the world's international trade. Malaysia boasts an open economy, which attracts many foreign investors, including Belgians. Moreover, the country is also an important producer of commodities, notably palm oil and crude oil and gas. These two commodities have given rise to a strong petrochemical and oleochemical sector in Malaysia, in which our Belgian companies actively participate. Last but not least, Malaysia is a country where all these business strengths are combined with a good quality of life. Malaysia prides itself in being a moderate country with good living standards, two key factors for attracting foreign talent and businesses. If the country upholds the essential values of tolerance and moderation, future foreign investments will be secured.</p><h4>Negotiations are underway to establish an FTA between Malaysia and the European Union. How soon do you think such an FTA could be finalized?</h4><p>The importance of the European Union for Malaysia can hardly be underestimated. Today, the EU is Malaysia's fourth largest trading partner, the second largest trading partner for ASEAN and by far the largest source of FDI into the ASEAN region. With 500 million consumers, it is the largest single market in the world economy, where imported goods can circulate freely. Malaysia could boost its trade with the EU and Belgium even more once the FTA is concluded. The European Commission and the EU Delegation to Malaysia are currently working together with Malaysia to restart the negotiations. It is difficult to predict when these negotiations will be finalized, but this timeline is not the primary concern. What is most important is that the FTA becomes an ambitious, all-encompassing agreement that tackles all existing trade barriers, so that it benefits both our populations. Belgium strongly supports the increasingly leading role the EU is taking up in Malaysia, because its identity is very much linked to that of Europe: we are one of the founding fathers of the EU and Brussels, which is home to more than 160 nationalities, is considered the de facto capital of the Union. In that sense, we could draw a parallel with Malaysia's famous slogan and say: “Belgium Truly Europe.“</p><h4>How will increased integration between ASEAN nations further boost the importance of Malaysia as a gateway to the rest of Southeast Asia?</h4><p>With a market of 600 million consumers and average annual GDP growth of 6% over the past 15 years, ASEAN has become a global economic player to reckon with. Today, ASEAN represents a $2.5 trillion economy. Once the ASEAN Economic Community is completed by the end of 2015, the region will be the third largest single market in the world. And with these increasing powers come increasing responsibilities: as the ASEAN Chair in 2015, Malaysia will guide ASEAN during an important year in the history of the Association. Belgium supports ASEAN's efforts in establishing a full-fledged ASEAN Community, which will enhance political, economic, and socio-cultural integration amongst its members. By continuing to promote its business friendly environment at the center of South East Asia, Malaysia will continue to serve as a gateway to ASEAN for European and Belgian companies.</p><h4>How do you see bilateral relations between the two countries evolving in the coming years and in which particular areas will cooperation efforts be focused?</h4><p>Our bilateral relations go back to the founding of the Federation of Malaya in 1957 and even before. They have been excellent during all these decades. During the Economic Mission in November last year, Belgium has sent a clear message that it “meant business“ with Malaysia and that we're ready to take our bilateral relations to the next level. Our trade has been increasing year-by-year and stood at EUR1.3 billion in 2014. Our healthy trade relations remain our primary focus, but also provide solid bedrock for further expansion of our relations. We feel that there is scope to advance even further, because there are still areas of untapped potential. I'm hereby thinking of possible synergies in the fields of S&amp;T/R&amp;D and higher education. We look forward to further explore the possibilities in these domains in our continued commitment to strengthen our ties with Malaysia. Malaysia is now member in the UN Security Council for the period 2015-17. Belgium is also the candidate for a seat in the UNSC for the 2019-20 period. Let us seize this opportunity to develop closer ties at international and diplomatic level. Malaysia and Belgium have both a long tradition of supporting UN peace operations. In that framework, both countries could work together and develop joint initiatives to the benefit of people and countries affected by war and other plagues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Eko was privatized along with the rest of the distribution sector in 2013. Can you talk about what has changed since the company was privatized? </h4><p><span></span>When we took over in 2013, the network was dilapidated due to inadequate investment. Up to that point, the sector was under government control, and had not seen the investment it required for over 30 years. When we took over, we had to evaluate the network and assets that we purchased as prior to privatization, investors had lacked this opportunity. Our evaluation was in essence like a black box, revealing the poor condition of existing infrastructure. We quickly raised $250 million to ramp up the existing network to such that we could distribute electricity to our customers. When we looked at the total customer outlay, it turned out that 50% lacked meters, and among the other 50%, meters were obsolete, or not in working order. We are now investing in meters with a clear focus on the customer, who does not favor estimated billing. This year, Eko is spending over NGN20 billion on meters alone to replace the entire system for its 400,000 customers. We also have high-consuming industrial and commercial customers, numbering around 6,000-7,000. Those entities consume over 40% of our energy and, paying more, are the current focus of our metering efforts. We want to make sure that no one is cheating the other, and that everyone has a functional meter that they are comfortable with. This way, whatever bill we give our customers, they will be satisfied with.</p><h4>How has gas supply affected your distribution efforts?</h4><p>We are not getting enough power from the grid because of an inadequate gas supply to the generators, brought about because of vandalism to the gas pipeline, which has reduced the level of generation throughout the country. Also, the cost of gas for power generation is low compared with gas sold to the rest of the market. Gas suppliers naturally favor higher price bracket customers. The government has moved on this, having increased the cost of gas per unit. It is ready to supply gas if the pipelines are renovated. And as far as the grid is concerned, there is a sharing formula where everybody gets a percentage of what is generated. For instance, at Eko, we have 11% of whatever is generated on to the grid. What we require today is a minimum of 700MW. But we only receive on average 300MW, or even below 200MW. For a number of months we have received a daily allocation in the morning of not above 300MW. Our supply tends to dwindle in the afternoon, as there is insufficient gas for the generators. We allocate based on what is available to us, but Eko cannot continue to operate like this, and is seeking a complimentary source of power for its network. Now, we are encouraging private companies to set up generation plants the output of which would be sold to us for addition to what is available on the existing grid. Such embedded power is not subject to grid intervention. We have been working on this for almost nine months now. A total of 43 companies have indicated a willingness to set up plants of various capacities and in assorted locations. These companies should provide an additional 400MW, though it will be gradual process as equipment needs to be received and installed. Currently, Eko has almost completed a bilateral power agreement with existing power plants that are not tied to direct agreements. We have almost concluded an agreement for an additional 100MW, which will probably materialize before June. Secondly, a further three companies have 40MW ready for supply once all MoUs are signed. In total this year we are looking at an extra 170MW.</p><h4>Will those embedded generators impact the final costs to your customers?</h4><p>There will be a premium, but we will be able to guarantee power. This will benefit the customer, because all demand will be met.</p><h4>How many hours of power are to be provided per day once the 170MW comes online?</h4><p>Right now we are providing power for between 12-15 hours a day. We should be able to increase that to 18-20 hours a day. And as more companies get set up and sell us energy, we can increase the number. In the future, generation for the grid will be more stable. Bear in mind that there are 10 IPP power stations currently being commissioned. By the time those come on stream (their total output is 4,500MW) there will be thousands more megawatts added. And then there are privatized power stations that are also increasing capacity. So the future is bright for the power industry in Nigeria and customers merely have to exercise some patience. Very soon we intend to light up Lagos.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015-16?</h4><p>In addition to the 250 million invested in the network there are some other funds. For example we recently received a Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) intervention. This money is being ploughed into addressing network problems. And beyond the network itself, we are looking to enhance the workforce. We want to retrain our workers and recruit more technicians, as well as invest in an electricity management system that enables the automation of our activities. This will make jobs easier and allow us to respond faster to customers. Currently, we are in a period where owners are investing, rather than looking at profits. The massive investment this involves means that five years from now, we will have proven to the public the capacity of the private power sector to work effectively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Skye Bank grew 81% in pretax profit in the first quarter of this year. Could you unpack those results?</h4><p><span></span>Skye Bank had always taken the route of organic growth strategy till 2013 when we decided to acquire one of the nationalized banks offered for sale by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). Consequently, in line with regulatory requirements, the Bank submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the acquisition of Enterprise Bank Limited, for which Heritage Bank Limited was announced the preferred bidder on September 11, 2014. Skye Bank later emerged the preferred bidder for Mainstreet Bank Limited (MBL) on October 3, 2014 after a rigorous bidding process. The Bank effectively took over the management of MBL on December 18, 2014. The acquisition of MBL has repositioned and transformed Skye Bank to a more commercially inclined institution. Following the takeover of MBL, both institutions were fully integrated in June 2015 and are now running on one of best and most efficient banking applications in Nigeria; Flexcube 12.0. The speedy and smooth integration was a result of past investments in best-of-class IT infrastructure made by the Bank in the last two years. With the acquisition, the Bank's branch network grew from 259 to 469 branches in Nigeria, and about 70 branches have been slated for closure as part of the Bank's ongoing branch rationalization exercise. This network made Skye Bank to become the 4th largest bank by branch network. The Bank is already reaping the benefits of this acquisition. For instance, owing to the boost in business activities, we recorded 81% growth in pretax profit in Q1 2015. In absolute terms, we posted a pre-tax profit of NGN6.2 billion and NGN10.7 billion for the period Q1 and Q2 2015, respectively. We achieved this result despite the tough economic and business environment informed by change of leadership in the country and various regulatory headwinds. </p><h4>What were some of the benefits of the Mainstreet Bank takeover, and how did this provide you with opportunities like agricultural lending?</h4><p>In terms of service quality and turnaround time, MBL had not been a great brand prior to our acquisition. However, MBL has a pool of loyal, institutional and corporate customers who remained with the bank despite its status as an AMCON owned bank. This loyalty is also reflected in its customer base, which did not reduce significantly prior to AMCON take-over. MBL also has competitive advantage in agriculture lending which accounted for 12.6% and 16.9% of its total loans in 2012 and 2013 respectively. NPL ratio on agriculture loans was very negligible, at 0.01%. We expect to leverage MBL's success story and footprint in agriculture business. We intend to leverage MBL's branch network in the South-East, South-South and Northern regions of Nigeria. This will complement our spread in South-West and North-Central and ensure our complete coverage and presence in all the 36 states of Nigeria.</p><h4>Do you have plans to reach beyond Gambia and Sierra Leone? And will future growth come from bricks and mortar expansion, or other means?</h4><p>Our immediate strategy is to focus on the Nigerian market. Hence, we will seek to optimize our existing branch network rather than build new branches. As one of the market leaders in e-business in Nigeria, we provide top-notch and tailored e-solutions for our corporate and public sector clients. For instance, the Bank's internet banking platform has robust functionalities that meet the needs of our corporate and growing middle-income class customer. Similarly, in our quest to provide secured e-channel platforms for our esteemed customers locally and internationally, we recently received three International Certifications from the UK Trade and Investment. The three-fold awards include ISO 20000 IT Service Management, ISO 27001 Information Security Management and ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management. We have invested in the creation of ATM galleries and e-centers as opposed to brick and mortar branches. We also have a business office in Dublin that acts as an investment company. We plan to use it as an access point for clients looking for projects in Nigeria. </p><h4>How has Skye Bank responded to the Forex restrictions that were recently put in place?</h4><p>Skye Bank ensures strict compliance with regulatory directives. However, we expect certain developments to occur as a consequence of the foreign exchange restriction. There are major issues for correspondent banks but the full impact on the banking industry is still not clear. In Skye Bank for instance, some of our transactions will be affected as we need to clear the backlog in a bid to maintain the Bank's credibility and reputation. On the other hand, institutions with huge investments in certain lines of trade like rice importation may have issues with meeting their banking obligations. This may lead to higher credit impairment and lower earnings from such transactions. Although the policy has its own advantages, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the policy on our overall business. This puts us in a position to consider alternative forms of generating income.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>By 2016, the present administration should have highlighted their programs and policies for the growth and development of the Nigerian economy. We are getting ready to debate budgets for 2016, and the period between now and the end of the year will involve planning for 2016. We are beginning to see positive effects from the government transition, such as electricity generation and distribution and the optimization of our refineries and accretion of foreign reserves. In addition, the security situation is improving, creating more opportunities for foreign direct investment inflow. This will strengthen the economy and the banking industry will certainly benefit from these improvements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Panama for Nestlé?</h4><p>Nestlé has been present in Panama for over 75 years, and the country is also the nexus to our Central American operations, where we have the multinational headquarter organization. The team in Panama provides strategy, services, and back office support for all six countries in Central America, and also for Malher, the company we acquired four years ago in Guatemala. From here we provide the strategy, innovation, legal, regulatory, and financial support so that our countries can focus more on local execution, which mainly involves sales and distribution, team management, and relationships with clients and the authorities. Across all of our operations, we have more than 1,100 employees in Panama. We have a new distribution center, inaugurated last year in a new area that is secure and well organized, and where our sales and distribution teams are based. They cover all our commercial activities in Panama. Nestlé has two factories: one is a dairy factory where we manufacture evaporated milk, sweet condensed milk, powdered milk, cheese, and other dairy products. This facility collects ingredients from thousands of small farmers. We have worked with them for years to create shared value. This has given our company an important footprint in Panama. The other factory in Los Santos produces tomato products: ketchup, tomato sauces, and canned soups. Nestlé has developed a long-term relationship with tomato producers; our operations have a major impact on this type of agriculture in the country.</p><h4>What specific products are driving your growth in the country?</h4><p>Our most important and iconic products are evaporated milk and sweet condensed milk and have been produced since the company was established. They still enjoy high penetration and are present in households throughout the country. One of the sectors that is growing the most is Nestlé Professional, which is our out-of-home consumption vehicle. More people are eating out these days. We have machines that dispense espressos and cappuccinos in malls, hotels, and airports, and this business is growing rapidly. Within the Coffee Business, the most recent innovation is Nescafé Dolce Gusto. Nestlé launched it in Panama a couple of years ago, and it is being snapped up by consumers, who are buying more machines and portion coffee every day. Our pet food business is also growing quickly with the Purina brand.</p><h4>How will it benefit your operations in the region?</h4><p>Panama offers great logistics. The local government is continuously investing in developing and maximizing the logistic potential of the country. Their efforts open up new opportunities by creating synergies in the region and building a stronger supply chain. However, for an international company to really benefit from the manufacturing and supply chain in a broader sense, there are still some opportunities to be addressed. For example, the free trade agreements between Central America in regards to economies and borders. There have been encouraging developments between Honduras and Guatemala, where we also have operations. They are integrating their economies through shared borders, taxes, and perhaps even a common currency. These agreements are just as important as integrated supply chains. Products must be imported and exported to every country. These agreements, which we believe will be approved by the authorities, have the potential to dramatically simplify operations and reduce costs. Panama has 3.5 million people, which makes it difficult to justify an investment specific to that country alone. Central America has 43 million people, similar to Colombia or Argentina. You can really attract more investments when you treat the area as a whole.</p><h4>How is Nestlé contributing to social development?</h4><p>Creating shared value is one of our priorities. We do not have a department for this, as it is merely our way of doing business. We have been engaged in creating shared value for over 75 years. In the dairy segment we have more than 1,300 small and medium farmers from whom we buy and collect milk on a daily basis. We support them with financing and best practices. We also work together with them and the Ministry of Agriculture to improve their productivity and the quality of their milk. And in the case of tomato farmers, we have developed optimum quality seeds together with the Ministry of Agriculture. Ours is a technology intensive business, for example, in determining the most suitable variety of cattle for a hot climate, we work with the farmers and authorities. At the end of the day, we need the milk to make our products, we provide financing, knowledge, and best practices. We help the tomato farmers purchase the supplies they need in order to produce larger crop yields at better prices. We work together for our mutual benefit. </p><h4>Could you share with us your targets and priorities for this year?</h4><p>Our objectives and priorities are to add value to society as well as to our operations by creating shared value. Nutrition is a huge priority and is embedded in everything we do: products, packaging, and communication. It is also a priority to be recognized as the leader in nutrition, health, and wellness. We also want to develop the youth program. Entering the workforce in this country is hard, and we want to facilitate that. We work with universities and technical schools. We need mechanics and people for our factories, as well as for other jobs. We need people with specific skills. There are many young people that are aiming for these positions. For us it is important to determine: how can we work together with universities to provide practices in Nestlé at our factories? How can we facilitate their understanding? How can we help them prepare their CVs? These are important questions that must be addressed. We will lead a big youth program in Panama and Central America to generate opportunities for participants in Nestlé and other companies. We are planning to involve more than 4,000 young people in our operations and also prepare them so they can work at other companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the year that you have served as GM here, what new ideas have you introduced to the hotel and what have been your priorities in this period?</h4><p>I believe innovation is something you cultivate within your team, and my job is to motivate them to come up with new ways to impress our guests, and continue to improve our level of service each day. From day one, it has been about supporting the staff in order to create a personalized experience for our guests, which in turn creates more demand for our hotel and allows us to take our rates to new levels not previously seen in Mexico City.  As far as what's new is concerned, the enhancements we are making to the hotel vary: we are opening a new restaurant and renovating another, we have the arrival of a new pastry shop specialized in Mexican deserts, and we are unveiling a new men's salon called Gentlemen's Tonic in October 2015. These new developments will allow us to present our loyal guests with something new and exciting, while attracting a new generation of future Four Seasons patrons.</p><h4>How important are international events and conferences for your business?</h4><p>International Events are extremely important for our city.  They change the dynamics of demand and continue to promote Mexico City as a cultural destination. Formula One is returning to Mexico City this year, and has been a blessing for the country and for our hospitality industry.  In October, we will once again take to the global stage due to the popularity of this global sport.</p><h4>What would you say is the significance of the Four Seasons Mexico City within the company's Latin American portfolio?</h4><p>The Four Seasons in Mexico City was the first to open in Latin America and remains the headquarters of the business in the region.  Since its opening in 1994, we have opened three additional Four Seasons: Punta Mita, Costa Rica and Buenos Aires. In short, the success in Mexico City has spurred robust development throughout Latin America today.</p><h4>Mexico is a country known for excellent customer service. In your view, what factors enable this, and what does Four Seasons Mexico City add to the field?</h4><p>The Mexican people take pride in their jobs, and the genuine manner in which they approach service cannot be duplicated. Four Seasons is known for its service training and delivery around the world, but the Mexican people take it to a new level.  The staff at the Four Seasons Mexico City continues to prove this theory correct, as does the team at the Four Seasons Punta Mita.  They create a bond with their guests that fosters long-term loyalty.  They do not strive only to provide excellent service, they ensure everything possible is done to make the customer's experience memorable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the shareholding restructure impact your operations? </h4><p><span></span>The Government of Zambia, in accordance with the stock exchange, has been asked to reduce its shareholding in ZCCM-IH. GRZ shareholding in ZCCM_iH is roughly 87% owned by the government with the shares being held by the Ministry of Finance. The other 13% of the company is held by minority shareholders comprised of foreign and private Zambian shareholders. The Minister of Finance has indicated that it wanted GRZ to reduce its stake to 60%, and sell 27% to private individuals and Zambian corporations. We would like to have some of our shares moved to London. We have received an offer for 10%, of about $100 million, from a Zambian institution. Our market capitalization is at around $1 billion, making ZCCM-IH the largest group on the Lusaka stock exchange. </p><h4>Since you joined the company last October, what priorities have you identified for the next few years? </h4><p>My mandate when I joined the company was to industrialize ZCCM and increase its value. ZCCM has historically been highly involved in the mining industry, and we are now in the process of industrialization. We are investing in energy on a 300MW power plant, and moving toward micro hydro stations. We are also interested in value adding to copper, and are in the process of conceptualizing a factory to manufacture copper wires and cables. This project will commence within 18 months at a cost of around $65 million. We will also commence work on manganese mining. We are targeting processes such as manganese oxide production, which will double the value of the raw manganese. In addition, we are funding a Zambian exploration company exploring for manganese in Luapula province. Our other venture is investment in property. When privatization occurred assets were issued to residents and companies as a form of payment. Certain assets were forgotten, and upon discovering that we have a number of properties, we decided to capitalize on them by upgrading and renting them out. </p><h4>In addition to mining and real estate, what other sectors are you involved in?</h4><p>We are getting involved in cement manufacturing at our Ndola Lime plant. Cement is a very expensive commodity in Zambia, which makes major projects, including road building, expensive. Our intention is to see a reduction in prices as a result of the opening of new plants. Within 18 months we plan to open one with a daily capacity of 5,000 tons. There is much that needs to be done to industrialize the country, which cannot be done without the basic component of cement.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind your positive performance at the stock exchange?</h4><p>The market has confidence in ZCCM; we have seen a 163% increase in market share. We are also the best performing company on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. The trick in any investment company is to manage your diversification because singular commodities can be paralyzing. Our strategy is to industrialize Zambia. We are monitoring our investments closely, considering new businesses and analyzing their potential risks and returns; we make decisions once due diligence is completed. We have initiated a new division that undertakes restoration work to upgrade our old properties. For example, we have restored a bowling club and two farms. We are bringing in partners to use these facilities whereby we have the facility to continue investing in properties. And meanwhile, we are generating revenue from our investments, which we reinvest in bonds and other areas.</p><h4>Given the drop in copper prices and increase in mining royalties, how confident is ZCCM of positive sector evolution?</h4><p>We are positive, not least as the president has a clear vision for growth of the Zambian economy and is keen on trickle-down economics. There will be more people employed and generating income; jobs are being generated from the top down. ZCCM-IH will employ hundreds of people in our copper plants and concrete plants. Though the price of copper has been decreasing, we are now seeing an upswing in the market. Higher taxes will affect us because we receive dividends from the mines, although I should stress that it is necessary to pay equitable taxes. Mining companies need to be transparent in their dealings. Taxes may appear unpalatable, but are ultimately directed to raise funds to the betterment of society. In October 2014 we declared a dividend of $40 million to our shareholders. </p><h4>How would you describe the business environment for investments in Zambia?</h4><p>Doing business in Zambia is transparent and smooth compared to many other markets. Leaders here are broadly accessible, and the government is pro-business. Investment laws are there for the benefit of the investors, which instills a sense of security.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The sky is the limit for ZCCM because we have government support to grow the company. The major shareholders in the government want us to move forward, and I have an excellent team to support me. Our projects are adding value to the company and making money for the shareholders. Although the next few years will be challenging for our team, in the long run we will reap the rewards. Within two years we should add close to $500 million to our assets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>If a foreign company wants to invest in Mexico what particularities will they find in terms of taxes and doing business here?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the more open economies in the world. About 30 years ago, our country was much less open. Two vital steps for Mexico were GAT and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 when the economy started to be really open. After that very important event there were other free trade agreements that were signed with different parts of the world. So now Mexico is very open and we had a very important segment, which is the energy industry that according to our 'Top Management Perspectives in Mexico 2015' survey the most acclaimed reform was the Energy Reform, widely accepted by 64% of respondents for being in-depth and in-breath and for opening up the possibility or real industry benefits through new investments and accelerated development. The energy reform calls for investment of approx. $70 billion USD in the next five years in investment at E&amp;P oil and gas round fields, pipelines, electricity transmission and distribution lines, etc. Other reforms that will also increase FDI are in the telecommunications in which the increase in competition of the sector already has proved transactions in M&amp;A in excess of $4 billion USD and contemplates increased investment in areas such as the universal broadband and others. It can be argued that the Structural Reforms and further measures to improve the country's competitiveness have yet to yield results and one or two years are still required so they may look more consistent. Favorable responses of business community in our survey perceive the approval of Structural Reforms as positive (63%), but the remaining sample expressed its disappointment owing to the fall in internal consumption and insecurity, followed by delays in bureaucracy in support programs. We think the reforms that were approved a year and a half ago are also what makes Mexico very attractive for investors.  The structural reforms have raised the expectations of growth for Mexico. The OECD has rated Mexico as the most reformist country in the world, stating that about 60% of their recommendations have been passed through structural reforms, while OECD countries are at 30%.  </p><h4>When investors come to you what are their main concerns in terms of investing in Mexico? </h4><p>One is the rule of law, the judicial system and the tax regimes. The lack of security in some areas of Mexico remains and the power of the drugs cartels is a challenge. It has been claimed time and time again that insecurity and crimes do not necessarily bring foreign investment to a halt and this is confirmed by our 'Top Management Perspectives in Mexico 2015' survey. Under current conditions, 43% of executives have upheld their investment decisions, vs. 38% in 2014. It is interesting to imagine how the market would behave if enterprises were not affected by theft, threats and extortion. In that respect, in some ways Mexico is privileged to neighbor the US, the largest market in the world. On the other hand, I am highly optimistic about our country and the many advantages that we have. Demographic growth is expected in the next few years, and young people will drive our economy. However, industry needs to create employment for youth. Besides, our labor is highly appreciated among the global markets, for its quality and its balance between productivity levels and costs. All these aspects have derived in having the highest level of international trade among the Latin American countries and one of the highest in the globe with almost US$800 billion (between imports and exports, almost equally divided). Finally, for 2014, Mexico received US$22.5 billion, 57% of this corresponds to manufacturing industry, including the automotive industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the actual impact of the reforms on the investment environment? </h4><p>The reforms have already proven to be a success. They have definitely brought in more foreign investment. After the constitutional and primary laws reforms were made and secondary laws enacted, Mexico has started the process of inviting foreign investment in key sectors, such as oil, gas, and electricity that in the past were prohibited or limited to foreign capital. For example, the first, of several, important public bids will take place shortly. As called by the Mexican government Round 1, this first bidding process allows foreign investors to participate in the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in shallow waters via public-private partnership (PPP) agreements, through either profit sharing, production sharing, licenses, or the combination of the three. The estimated investment for Round 1 is $12.6 billion for 2015 and of $50.5 billion for the period comprised between 2015 and 2018. Although we cannot assert that the expected investment will come exclusively from abroad, I am not shy to say that at least 75% is expected to come from foreign players. In addition to the hydrocarbons industries, foreign companies from other sectors are seriously investing in our country. For starters, we have the automobile segment that although not directly linked to the opening of previously restricted areas, Mexico's ambiance of politic and economic stability, and the strategic location and tax benefits has convinced major players to invest in the country. Hard data states that from 2012 to 2015 Mexico has received more than $20 billion of direct investment from this sector. Companies from Europe, Asia, and the US have directly invested an average of $1 billion each in the opening of new manufacturing facilities at a wide range of Mexican states. It is expected that in this industry, Mexico will produce approximately 5 million units annually by 2020. In addition, we have to consider the secondary industries that each of such manufacturing facilities bring to each region. It is estimated investments rounding $1 billion annually in industries that support the manufacturing of automobiles. In the energy sector, specifically in electricity, the Federal Electricity Commission recently announced the opening of public bids in an amount close to $10 billion in key sectors ranging from gas ducts to electricity producing facilities. This sector is certain of receiving a large amount of FDI. </p><h4>The labor reform was passed in late 2012 and the fiscal was approved last year. To what degree will these new regulatory changes make Mexico a more attractive country for investment? </h4><p>Referring to the labor law reforms, the main topic aimed toward foreign investment is the removal of several provisions that were too protective of the employee. However, we need to clarify that although these reforms had as goal to remove the protectionist nature of labor law in Mexico, employees remain well protected and with benefits complying with international law and treaties. The reforms were brought about as a consequence of a more corporate friendly law with an easier process to hire employees. From the fiscal standpoint, the reforms ensured investors have a certainty in Mexico's economic stability. With a reform aimed toward more tax collection, but also less divestitures from the government, public finances are responsible and stable. Although there were some limitations regarding deductibles and the income tax rate remained at 30%, some taxes were removed such as the corporate flat tax and the cash deposit tax. Notwithstanding there are certain issues that were incorporated in the reform that need to be changed, as the same directly impact on the private sector ability to deduct certain labor obligations as a legitimate business expenditure. Failure to do this will reduce the benefits of the fiscal reform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the idea of creating an aquarium in Mexico City born?</h4><p>About five years ago I came up with the concept of creating an aquarium in the capital, and we finally opened it in 2014. Personally, I have always been interested in the concept of “edutainment," which merges education and entertainment. I wanted to build a business around that idea, and started thinking of establishing an aquarium because it was the perfect system for reaching several audiences. At Acuario Inbursa, we have kids that come with their schools and parents, as well as young people and senior citizens who all come to learn and enjoy themselves here. It is for everyone and for all ages. Once I decided to create a business plan to build an aquarium in Mexico, I began traveling around the globe and visited nearly 80 aquariums. I studied how they were built, what characteristics they had, and I picked out the things I liked the best from each. Next, I hired a team of biologists who studied the biological characteristics that the project should have. Finally I came up with a full business plan and presented it to several investors and, eventually, the Slim family liked the idea and decided to support the project to establish it in Plaza Carso.</p><h4>Acuario Inbursa has been operating for a full year. How has this transformed the leisure offering in Plaza Carso?</h4><p>It has been a great year. We have had approximately 1.3 million visitors since we opened our doors in June 2014. Acuario Inbursa has truly empowered the area, and Plaza Carso offers business offices, restaurants, movie theaters, bars, stores, and its celebrated Museo Soumaya. The aquarium is just what the area was missing, providing a plethora of leisure activities at the plaza. For instance, people might come to the aquarium for a couple of hours, but they will then go shopping or to a restaurant.</p><h4>What expansion plans does Blau Life have for Mexico and abroad?</h4><p>We currently have several projects. Firstly, however, we would like to expand our current project beyond the current building by using temporary exhibitions in the Plaza Carso. In addition to this we plan to open new aquariums at Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, and León, Guanajuato. It will not be the current building, but we could set certain temporary exhibitions in Plaza Carso. Besides, we are going to open two new aquariums in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, and in León, Guanajuato. That is part of our ongoing plans to open up to 12 aquariums across the republic. We recently signed an agreement to open an aquarium in New York that will be located in Times Square. There are no aquariums in New York, so I have been searching for investors and properties over the past couple of years and now I am proud to announce that Blau Life will build an aquarium there. We have just bought a property between Broadway and the 44th street, and we are excited because it is in a premium location in Manhattan where good properties are scarce. The aquarium will be close to all the musicals in Broadway and we think it is going to be a success. It is going to be about 30% larger than the one in Mexico City, and we expect to have the same amount of visitors in the first year. The investment will be about $30 million. This aquarium is going to be very similar to the one in Mexico City but will be more spectacular.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your thoughts about the new regulations on biotech medicines in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has made remarkable progress from a regulatory standpoint in a very short time.  COFEPRIS, led by Commissioner Mikel Arriola, was recently recognized as a regulatory agency of reference in Latin America. Today, many Latin American countries recognize Mexican regulatory approvals and supporting documentation, thus reducing time-to-entry into these markets.  COFEPRIS was able to obtain PAHO certification for pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals as well as the WHO certification for vaccines, thus positioning it as a strong regulatory agency worldwide. The latest biotechnology/biosimilars regulation (NOM 257) is of note. It is already a benchmark in Latin America and I would dare to say it is close to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulation.  Companies that manage to comply with these new regulatory requirements will have met high standards for their products. With the new NOM 257, innovative biopharmaceuticals and biosimilars will coexist in the Mexican healthcare system while ensuring product efficacy and patients' safety.  Prior to this new regulatory framework for biosimilars, around sixty-five products were registered as generic drugs and the quality and safety requirements were not as strict. The new norm requires characterization and biocomparability studies, as well as safety and efficacy trials that altogether will have to demonstrate their similarity to the reference products. </p><h4>How do you expect the national pharmaceutical industry to perform in the coming years?</h4><p>I expect that it will grow in a number of different ways. Initially because of demographics; the population is aging and chronic degenerative diseases are now more common than infectious diseases, which means that people have more comorbidities and are treated for longer periods of time, with more expensive, and complicated drugs such as biotechnology drugs, which have significant budget and cost implications. The second trend is that patients are opting for public hospitals over private hospitals because of the cost of their treatments. Many chronic diseases are treated with biotechnology products, which are more expensive. The third trend is that there will be many more biotechnology products because of the types of diseases we are looking at now. The biotechnology industry will keep on growing at double digit paces. Today this segment grows at approximately a 25% annual rate. In early 2000, 10% of NDAs submitted to the FDA were biotech drugs. Today 70% are. This rate will only increase.</p><h4>To what degree is innovation a key factor in PROBIOMED's continued growth?</h4><p>PROBIOMED is the only company that has the entire high-technology manufacturing process of biotechnology (biosimilars) medicines in Mexico. In contrast to traditional generics, the manufacturing of biosimilars requires significant innovative processes, such as the genetic engineering of living organisms, growing them in bioreactors for the production of proteins and antibodies, and obtaining the final product. It is essential to promote local manufacturing so that Mexico does not only rely on imported biotechnology products. At PROBIOMED, we believe that quality should be based on science, and this is the reason that since our founding, we have invested 20% of our sales in research and development, equivalent to the investment made by the major innovation labs. We have a R&amp;D unit, formed by an interdisciplinary team of highly specialized professionals for the design and development of biotechnological processes.  We always use technology that allows us to offer high quality products to satisfy global health needs. We are the only biopharmaceutical in Mexico that develops products from gene to drug—including hormones, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins and vaccines for the treatment of chronic degenerative diseases, malignancies, hematological disorders, metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases.  Currently we have 16 biotech products in the market and five more in development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the tourism industry for Mexico? </h4><p>The strategic vision of President Enrique Peña Nieto has recognized tourism as an important tool for development, prosperity, and welfare for Mexico. It represents 8.7% of our GDP, consistently registers a surplus in the balance of payments, employs directly more than three million people, is the biggest employer of young people, the second largest employer of women, and is the fourth source of revenue in foreign exchange. Additionally, tourism helps promote our country for what it really is: modern, vibrant, and in constant transformation.</p><h4>What steps has the government taken to boost tourism since 2012? </h4><p>Tourism in Mexico is reinvigorating itself. Since the beginning of this administration, we have undertaken a restructuring of a sector that was experiencing contraction. The National Tourism Policy established four guidelines that set its course towards planning and sectorial transformation, innovation and competitiveness, development and promotion, as well as sustainability and social benefit. Tourism also began to work from a cross-sectional perspective, resulting in the establishment of the Tourist Cabinet, an unprecedented tool that provides an important coordination forum for tourism development in Mexico. In addition, for the first time in history, tourism has been included as one of the strategic sectors of the National Infrastructure Plan. The results for 2014 reflect various actions carried out by Mexico's government through the Ministry of Tourism. With regard to travel facilitation schemes, we have extended the franchise allowed for passengers entering by land. Likewise, we have improved our visa policy by suppressing the requirement for Latin American countries such as Peru, Colombia, Chile and Brazil. This has directly resulted in an increased inflow of tourists. Visitors from Peru have increased by 25% and those from Chile by 15.8%. We also launched the second phase of the Live it to Believe it campaign in the US, Spain, and the UK as well as the #MiMéxico campaign, designed especially for the Hispanic audience resident in the US. Thanks to this, more than 7.1 million American tourists visited Mexico last year, marking an increase of 10.6%, and consolidating Mexico as the most visited destination for tourists from the US. </p><h4>What strategies are you putting into place to foster domestic tourism?</h4><p>An important part of tourism comes from the domestic segment. With that in mind, President Peña Nieto has instructed us to create a public policy of national outreach that will allow all Mexicans to travel and discover their own nation. The strategy aims to provide facilities for children, the elderly, the disabled, low-income families, youngsters, and amateur athletes to travel in and get to know Mexico. This is the commitment of the Mexican government; to strengthen tourism by promoting quality, diversification of service. and infrastructural development to foster economic growth that will lead to social benefits, prosperity, and welfare. At the Ministry of Tourism, we will work to help the vision of President Enrique Peña Nieto of a prosperous, inclusive Mexico with greater opportunities that enable greater progress.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Proteak perform in 2014?</h4><p>Last year was a terrific period for Proteak. We are developing the largest-ever project in the forestry industrial sector in Mexico. With an investment of $200 million, it involves building the largest plant for manufacturing MDF boards in the Tabasco region, which is set to commence operations later this year. We have been developing it on time, and on budget, which can be quite a challenge given prevailing conditions in Mexico. Half of our business in that area is related to teak, and we have been able to position Proteak's output in the Asian markets at a premium, despite fierce competition. Last year saw a record area planted for Proteak. We are by far the largest planter in Mexico, and we planted 2,500 hectares of high-productivity teak and eucalyptus in 2014. Finally, I believe that the capital markets are at last reacting to our solid fundamentals as a result of which our stock has appreciated by around 40%.</p><h4>Proteak's investment in Tabasco is one of the largest in Mexico's forestry sector in recent years. How important has this investment been locally for your industry?</h4><p>We are a highly entrepreneurial company, ever pursuing new projects. Tabasco is a particularly interesting project in the context of Mexico's terrific natural conditions for the development of the forestry sector. It has considerable precipitation, excellent soil, and plentiful sunlight. Yet despite such enviable conditions, we have been unable to fully develop our forestry sector. Indeed, forestry products account for one of the largest deficits we carry in our trade balance. This spans logs, paper, cartons, boards, and so on. Currently, we import around 90% of all the MDF boards and other products that Mexico consumes. This is because we haven't invested in our forests, as Mexico is a net deforester. Most probably for the next five to 10 years, the forestry sector will remain deficient. It was in this context that Proteak was launched, initially with several teak plantations some 14 years ago. We have been planting teak, which is a high value timber, on the Pacific coast for years. In doing so, we have developed a unique knowledge and platform to develop forests in Mexico. Few companies in Mexico are following suit, which positions Proteak uniquely to tackle the opportunities available in this sector. It is through this platform that we decided to enter the MDF business. This is an integrated project resting on three pillars. On one hand, it is the only project in Mexico that produces its own wood. Most input that Mexico consumes comes from natural forests. One of our competitive advantages is that Proteak produces its own resources. Allowing us to do so are our 9,000 hectares in the Tabasco region, and we are planning to have at least 2,000 more. Secondly, we will also be self-sufficient in energy, another key component in the production of MDF boards in terms of heat and electricity. Through cogeneration and some biomass from our own production process, we will be able to supply all the heat that the process requires and even surplus energy that we will sell off to other parts of Mexico. And thirdly, we are introducing leading German technology for board production in what is a state of the art process resulting in high quality boards unique to us in the Mexican market. These factors combined render Proteak well positioned to pursue opportunities in the Mexican market. Additionally, this is an unprecedented investment for the region, since Tabasco's economy is highly dependent on the oil industry. We know of no other investment in the region of such scale and with such positive environmental, social and economic impact.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quite-the-story]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OHL began operating in Mexico in 2002. What have you accomplished in the local construction industry since then?</h4><p>OHL is a story of success, compromise, and investment in Mexico. We have had a clear vision of developing infrastructure in the country and participating in and contributing to national infrastructure, which was clearly required. We have worked in Mexico for three governments from three political parties, and have always been able to deliver our projects on time. That is something of a novelty when compared with other infrastructure projects around the country, and we are focused on making things happen through courage and sometimes, through economic compromise.</p><h4>What would you say most characterizes your operations in Mexico?</h4><p>We pride ourselves in our capacity to deliver projects on time. In fact, the Ministry of Communications at one point found itself overseeing a difficult project that featured a tunnel, whereupon we were invited to rescue and realize the scheme. Times of crisis inevitably give rise to opportunities. We are also characterized by our capacity to provide the right suggestions. We do not always wait for a government project to bid for. Rather, we approach the government ourselves with, say, a mobility solution and propose they test it out. We do this on the back of the latest PPP law instituted. This approach does not always work out quite as planned, and some adjustments are required. However, over the past 10 years or so, the company has been able to engage in projects totaling $5 billion. No other Mexican company has been able to scale the index as quickly as we have, and OHL is also 44% floated in the market. We have become one of the most scoped out companies on the stock market. Within a short period of time we have been able to build one of the largest and most significant infrastructure companies in Mexico. The OHL Group in Spain has other areas of expertise that it has successfully consolidated. OHL Mexico has been broken up into the following areas: OHL Concessions, OHL Construction, and OHL Industrial. OHL Group has little by little been consolidating in Mexico, whereby we have become a weightier market player.</p><h4>To what degree does Mexico still need infrastructure to make the most out of its economy?</h4><p>Clearly there are plenty of opportunities to further develop local infrastructure. I also believe, because of budgetary constraints due to the price of oil, that there are opportunities for private companies and concessioners to develop those projects. Infrastructure no doubt brings development, and if Mexico wants to be competitive, it needs to develop its own further.</p><h4>How is OHL participating in the Mayakoba project in Cancun?</h4><p>Mayakoba continues to grow, and two additional hotels are being added in addition to a development of mid-level housing across the street. There are also ongoing discussions on building a high-end development with a golf course at another end of the project. We are planning to expand in all of the areas where we have expertise. OHL is here to stay, and we know the market, enjoy our presence in it, and want to take advantage of the opportunities this project presents.</p><h4>The CMIC forecasts that the construction industry could grow by 3.5% this year. What are your views on this?</h4><p>I consider that forecast challenging due to the government's budgetary constraints. Concessioners will continue to invest, which will help. The budget was drafted last year, but will have to be cut even further, whereby we expect growth of somewhere closer to 3%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us the details about the Eko Pearl Towers and how they came to be?</h4><p>I have been in Nigeria since 1970. Following a period working for another company, I decided to strike out on my own. My initial business forays were into a restaurant, a poultry farm, and then a logistics company, after which I started a printing and packaging company. In 1999, I ventured into the exportation of cocoa, and in a year when the national export figure was 150,000 tons in total, I managed to export 55,000 tons single-handedly. This progression of trade put me in an increasingly strong position in the market. My operations were growing, and I delved into road and civil construction backed by my quarries. Further down the line, I became the main supplier of the many rocks that form the first reinforcement wall of Eko Atlantic City, a city created by Mr. Ronald Chagoury to protect Victoria Island from future erosion that has degraded the coastline around Lagos over the last decades. Being the first residential property developer in Eko Atlantic City can be considered taking an uneasy step but I am a risk-taker by nature and find that these strategies pay off. This project costs $600 million dollars, and initially many had their doubts, but I had my share of supporters who saw its validity. The Towers project will comprise exclusively of deluxe apartments and will be developed at land level on 22,700 sqm at the harbor front of Lagos' innovative Eko Atlantic City. The five Towers are a collection of two-bedroom, three-bedroom, and Penthouse-type apartments with sea and marina views for residential and investment purposes only. The Towers are named after the most precious Pearls in the sea; Black, Champagne, Aqua, Indigo, and White. My investments have secured a valuable reputation regarding Eko Atlantic, and an increasing number of investors are aligning themselves with my projects. Construction and real estate are my main lines of businesses, and Eko Atlantic has done extremely well thus far, although it has not even scratched the surface of its potential. Regarding the first Tower, Black, it is completely sold, while sales for the second Tower, Champagne, are already at 30%. At seven years, I am a relative newcomer to Lagos, but I have lived in Nigeria for over 46 years. I am developing elsewhere in the world as well. For example, I recently developed a multiphase apartment project in Bangladesh where I am building around 4,000 apartments. I am considered one of the most reputable independent developers in Beirut, Lebanon under the umbrella of my company, (Elias Saad Leading Association (ESLA) and have completed 27 construction projects consisting of towers, villas, and office buildings.</p><h4>When you saw the plans for Eko Atlantic, what prompted you to take that risk from the very beginning?</h4><p>Nigeria is a land of opportunity begging to be believed in. All of the funds we have invested here, we invested with confidence. We believe in Eko Atlantic not only because of the people behind it; the Chagoury Group; His Excellency Mr. Gilbert, and Sheikh Ronald Chagoury, but also because it will become the future of Africa. As markets in Africa develop, this development will emerge as one of the central economic centers in the region and continent.</p><h4>How have you used your expertise in other areas to develop this project?</h4><p>Right now I run companies in the fields of piling, logistics, civil and road construction, real estate development, electro-mechanical engineering, industrial baking, ceramic manufacturing, and telecommunications. I never work alone; I use my personal expertise coupled with my very professional team. They provide me with briefings on a daily basis. In less than four years, another company that I own that manufactures tableware and ceramics will be the largest global producer of these products. Our ceramic products are already well established in markets such as the US, France, the UK, and most of the Arab countries. This year we are hoping to build yet another ceramic factory as we see a growing market.</p><h4>Following the most recent electoral successes, there seems to be a renewed interest in Nigeria. What have you noticed since the election?</h4><p>As a Nigerian, an expatriate, and an investor in the country, my perspective is multifaceted. I believe that the new government will open up the country, improve infrastructure, attract more foreign investment with confidence, and will better standard of living of Nigerians. President Muhammadu Buhari is the man who will see that this happens.</p><h4>You have already sold the first Tower and partially the second Tower. Is most of the interest from Nigerian investors?</h4><p>More and more, Nigerians are looking to invest in their homeland. I am delighted to be able to offer this opportunity and to give Nigerians a legitimate reason to seize this opportunity. I myself am investing in Nigeria with finance from abroad for what will be a bright future. Where our projects are concerned, 99.9% of interest stems from Nigerian investors. I am working here for the Nigerian people, and there are 180 million of them.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Having spent most of my life in this beautiful country, I am fortunate to realize that Nigerians are the most resilient and optimistic people you may come across. In the coming year, I am convinced we will move forward to a better Nigeria and higher to a more positive level. I myself am moving forward with optimism and will be introducing to the market several new projects including a 37-floor corporate tower to rise from the sands of Eko Atlantic City. It will provide office space with restaurants and high-end retail shops.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your early years in the US influence your work here?</h4><p>I not only saw the cities and urban development there, but was also given the title of honorary citizen in Miami, Washington, New Orleans, and Houston, where they gave me the keys to the city. I then established one of the first architectural firms in Mexico. Those years that I spent in the US were, therefore, crucial in my life development (also my brothers &amp; my family) as an architect &amp; developer.</p><h4>What have you and Grupo GVI meant for the Mexican architecture sector? </h4><p>We have been one of the leaders of the industry, classified 62 in the world and within the top five in hospitality, as well as the No. 1 in Latin America. We also evolved, creating Gomez-Vazquez International GVI to meet the globalization needs of the architecture field. This venture has proven highly successful and we continue to operate it.</p><h4>What are the key architectural attributes of your projects?</h4><p>Creativity, innovation, and personal attention to the client &amp; detail are at the heart of what we do. One needs to grasp the mentality of the region or location of the project, because architecture is, in my view, “harmony of constructive elements producing beauty, delimiting spaces where the spirit reigns." There are constructions that while undoubtedly beautiful, fail to satisfy client needs. This is why we need to satisfy the spirit of the user. Today, we have offices in Guadalajara, Mexico DF, San Antonio Texas, and Panama. We also work in Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, San Antonio, and Clearwater Florida in the US.</p><h4>Among all the projects that you are involved today, which do you feel the most excited by?</h4><p>We are undertaking the “El Santuario de los Martires" in Guadalajara; a project designed for 16,000 people and 40,000 in the Atrium, and one that will be unique for the continent. We also have a project called “The Palace of Arts and Communications," which is also in Guadalajara. This project innovated sample has been made possible thanks to Jose Perez Ramirez, and another great project is “The Global City" next to the Panama Airport in 2800 Ac.</p><h4>To what degree has Mexico City become a showcase for international architects in recent years?</h4><p>Mexico City is as important as other major global cities. And in step with globalization, many important architect firms have come to Mexico. Our firms are specialists in hospitality, touristic developments, malls with mixed-use projects, and also in urban and regional planning. Mexico is lacking still sometimes in urban &amp; regional planning, but it also provides some innovative examples. </p><h4>What opportunities do you identify for international investors in the construction sector?</h4><p>There are many opportunities thanks to improvements in communications. In the tourism sector, Mexico boasts an astonishing range of natural attractions. We have completed a regional master plan for the coast of Jalisco, and the airport is about to be finished.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the past seven years, no licenses had been issued in Mexico for new airline carriers. What has allowed TAR to end this spell?</h4><p>TAR's concept is to develop an aviation niche that at present is not reached by the legacy carriers in the country, and what we are trying to do is open new routes to the consumer, making it possible for the various regions of the country to connect without the need to go through the nation's main aviation hubs. People living on the Gulf Coast, for example, can travel with TAR from one destination to another without transiting through Mexico City. When we presented the concept to the Ministry of Communications, we received massive support from the central government, and of course, from local governments. We have chosen to fly 50-seater jets produced for low-density routes that make them viable for the creation of a route structure and an operational structure in which we can develop business and hence opportunities that have been dormant for years. We now also have the conditions as certain major companies in Mexico are substituting such aircraft with high-density alternatives. We are currently the only company with the capability to really operate in this segment.</p><h4>TAR's head office is in Queretaro. Why did you select this city?</h4><p>Queretaro is well placed geographically at the center of the country, has a strong aeronautical industry, and its airport itself has considerable international operational capabilities. Queretaro is a regional capital, and is well connected by land, and ideally located for setting up operations. We also believe that when the new high-speed train is built more companies will be established around the city.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your plans for expansion in the Caribbean?</h4><p>We are trying to establish a circuit whereby we can bring people, not only from the Mexican region of Riviera Maya, but also from Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Jamaica, to the Mexican coastal region, and that is also of major potential. The Yucatán Peninsula accounts for the majority of tourist arrivals to Mexico, but its connectivity with other Caribbean countries has still to be improved.</p><h4>TAR has been operating in Mexico for a short time period but has experienced rapid growth. What is the secret behind TAR's success? </h4><p>In Mexico we have a rare situation in which supply creates demand. Demand is there, but we are missing the products and so when we open new routes, demand rapidly follows. The key concept is that we should keep developing aviation products for existing demand, and fortunately for us, we have huge potential. Right now we have reached 13 destinations that make up over 40 routes, and the idea is that we should receive three additional aircraft by March, and thereby double the number of destinations. We are talking to the various airport groups in the country and each has a different marketing scenario, and also the ambition to connect the various airports. In addition, we are receiving support from local governments and in exchange can provide a good product to the consumer, with reasonable fares. We charge approximately $100 for an average one-way trip. In the past, our passengers would pay at least double that before flying with TAR, and so we bring an important element to the community by lowering their transportation costs.  </p><h4>Why did Grupo Mafra invest in TAR?</h4><p>Grupo Mafra decided to invest in aviation once we had convinced them of the great opportunities to be exploited in this industry. We made a complete analysis of cargo, scheduled, and charter aviation, and also air taxi operations. They realized that regional aviation was the element that needed to be developed. Grupo Mafra is a local group of Queretaro and really believes that what Mexico needs is to develop opportunities in the interior of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[positive-performance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights for CCIPSA of 2014?</h4><p>Last year was a positive one, especially in terms of urban fractioning/parcellation. We completed Veracruz's urban fractioning, where we invested over $33 million. In 2014, we also started the Hilton Garden Inn. These undertakings created over 900 direct jobs—over 300 were permanent contracts. Regarding the private sector, we had a strong focus on industrial parks. For example, in the plastics sector, we invested over $400,000 in Veracruz. We saw a positive performance in public works, in the oil and gas sector with Pemex and marine loading arms. We also took a step forward in the oil wells segment in Tabasco with gas injection compressors.</p><h4>What opportunities does the energy reform bring to CCIPSA and other such organizations?</h4><p>The reform has comprehensive benefits, with quality, service ,and investment being the main aspects to highlight. The energy reform should make us more competitive as a country and, most importantly, increase quality levels in the sector.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of partnering with CCIPSA?</h4><p>Our main competitive advantage is our level of professionalism. In tourism, we own some of the best properties for hotels, and also in the industrial segment. In the public works segment, we encourage cooperation with foreign partners and boost the presence of new technologies and the transfer of know-how. As a company we also monitor the market to understand its dynamics and adapt our strategies to changing conditions. This also means that we conduct comprehensive research and feasibility studies before embarking upon new projects.</p><h4>What currently are the key operating segments for CCIPSA and what is your outlook for the near future?</h4><p>We have four business lines, starting with engineering for construction and projects, which serves both the public and private sectors. In this context, the main driver is urban and industrial fractioning. Oil and gas is another business line. We have a strong focus on liquefied gas, and gas and steam injection into oil wells. Real estate is another of our business lines. This is a strategic line for us, because we focus on rural and urban properties and the transformation of the former. Finally, We manage business partnerships and alliances with other companies. The more companies we know, the more people we can train. Human resources are one of our main assets as a company and we take care of our employees, implementing bonus systems and other such initiatives that make them feel that they are a part of CCIPSA. At the moment, we have around 1,200 employees.</p><h4>What measures is CCIPSA implementing to take advantage of expected growth in the constructions sector?</h4><p>One of our main priorities is to develop competitive products. This will enable us to increase investment and generate job opportunities. If we minimize costs, we will also increase quality and I believe we will be able to grasp the opportunities that the sector promises. In this context, the government does its job with the reinvestment of taxes, also boosting the worker/consumer part of the equation.</p><h4>What is the potential for maritime port infrastructure?</h4><p>We are building the Salina Cruz port, which is now 60% complete. We have also submitted a bid for the Progreso port. We foresee even more investment potential in the area of Salina Cruz, in the industrial area surrounding the port. The Federal Government has an expected investment budget through Pemex in that area of around $12 billion.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the economy of Veracruz for the coming few years?</h4><p>Industry in Veracruz will grow rapidly, driven especially by the investment of one particular company. There is potential in infrastructure and real estate, two segments that require investment in road and rail, as well as in housing. Increases in industrial activity translate into more jobs, which means higher demand for housing. CCIPSA has already taken steps in this direction. We have purchased land in Coatzacoalcos on which to build an industrial zone, and also in a railway for the loading and unloading of vessels servicing import and export activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Competitive Rate]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-competitive-rate]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much FDI do you anticipate attracting in 2015?</h4><p>Currently, there are two plants operating in Interpuerto Monterrey. One is that of Mondelez, which is the largest cookie manufacturer in the world, producing Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, and many others. The other plant is that of Tubacero, which manufactures all the gas piping for the energy industry. A Japanese company called Hamanako Denso will commence operations—it has purchased eight ha of land for an auto parts facility of 20,000sqf. Additionally, construction of two plants has begun with an end-2015 production start date penciled in. The first is SKC, a JV between Japanese and Korean companies engaged in the automotive business. Additionally, there is Mobis, which is part of the Hyundai group. It has seven hectares of land that will be given over to a distribution center for its parts. With our strategic location, these companies are at the center of numerous export markets. The third company is Tokai Rika, a Japanese firm also engaged in the automotive business, where plant construction commences in October. This year we expect these three companies to have almost 40,000sqm of new warehouse, which will attract considerable investment and create numerous employment opportunities. We have several more companies in the pipeline that are mainly engaged in the auto business, distribution, logistics, the food industry, and furniture.</p><h4>There are six companies coming into Interpuerto Monterrey. Is this because of the Kia Effect?</h4><p>Not necessarily, although the Kia Effect is important, with many suppliers coming to visit us. I prefer to describe it as the Mexico effect. With all these reforms, a lot of companies are seeing Mexico as a good place to establish their operations. Mexico has the most FTAs out of any country in the world, so you can easily import and export from almost anywhere. Additionally, Interpuerto Monterrey is located two hours away from the largest market in the world; the US. That strategic location gives us a major advantage whereby companies can produce at competitive rates with a qualified labor force and then export to the US market as well as making local sales. Interpuerto Monterrey is not located in northern Mexico, but in the heart of NAFTA's market.</p><h4>What is the next step the country should take to make the most of its logistics potential?</h4><p>Mexico, unfortunately, compared to developed countries in Europe and the US, has almost double the logistics cost. There is a major opportunity to make logistics more efficient. With the FTAs that we have, we have to focus not only on specific markets. For example, today most of the production in Mexico is focused on the US, with it being the largest market. Yet we also cater to European markets, as well as Japan, China, and South America. Efforts need to be made to combine not only imports, but also to identify export opportunities currently not on the radar. Companies are starting to wake up and perceive these opportunities, one being the automotive industry. For example, 90% of tier two supplies are imported to Mexico. That represents a large market opportunity for tier two companies, from Nissan to GM, BWM, Kia, and so on. They can establish a presence in Mexico with no need to import, and can even export those products.</p><h4>Does Mexico have the infrastructure to cope with such development in the automotive industry?</h4><p>Interpuerto Monterrey is part of the solution to that need. Mexico needs to reinforce its transportation infrastructure to become more competitive. There should be several industrial parks all around Mexico that can offer competitive prices, adequate space, and other competitive advantages.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the remainder of 2015 and for 2016?</h4><p>I expect this year to close interestingly, with our focus predominantly on the automotive business because we have the Kia, BMW, and Audi plants. Many companies are establishing here, which will boost activity. About 20 years ago, roughly 10% of Mexico's export revenue derived from manufacturing. Today, the figure is at a huge 85%. Hopefully, we will remain on that track and ensure that most manufacturing exports in Mexico are not petroleum based.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In May, you decreased your growth expectations for the construction industry from 4% to 3%. What reasons lay behind this decision?</h4><p>CMIC works with official figures. Generally, the expectations for the construction industry are one percentage point above GDP growth. The country was forecast to grow by close to 4% at the beginning of the year. But there were two main factors that hit the economy; the fall in oil prices and consequent fall in tax income. This led Mexico into decline in an environment of budget cuts. The Bank of Mexico and other official institutions reduced their initial forecast for the economy, and hence we did the same. We rely on official data from INEGI. Up until May, INEGI had estimated the construction industry surging by 3.5%, but we opt for conservatism and our current forecast is for an increase of between 2.5% and 3%. This would be a positive result because, in 2013, the construction industry had negative growth and has steadily grown since then until June 2014. To sum up, growth between 2.5% and 3% might be smaller than we had expected, but it would be a good outcome compared to previous years.</p><h4>What is the importance of private-public partnerships to energize the construction industry?</h4><p>The private and the public sector have both realized that the National Infrastructure Plan 2014-2018, a Ps7.7 billion investment, will not be feasible if we just depend on fiscal resources. Hence, we have to find private investments to make it happen, and in my opinion it should be through two mechanisms; concessions and private-public partnerships (PPPs). That has happened in other parts of the world and we consider PPPs to be a viable scheme for Mexico, too. The country has a huge need for infrastructure; hence, that is the way to incentivize investors and convince them of the opportunities in the Mexican construction industry. Furthermore, it is a way to avoid the uncertainty of being attached to a public budget as spending cuts regularly occur when the economy decelerates.</p><h4>What opportunities do you point out for foreign investors in Mexico?</h4><p>Specifically there are three areas. One of them is infrastructure, related to the oil and energy industries. The first phase took place in the middle of the year and, although it did not bring the expected results, investment will definitely increase. There is demand for energy generation and transport. However, there is not a large enough public budget to carry it out. Another big area of investment is the ports. We have some ports that are vital globally such as Manzanillo, Lazaro Cardenas, and Veracruz. At these three ports are projects of great importance to improve services provided for major shipping companies.</p><h4>What initiatives are you taking to link SMEs to the production chain? </h4><p>The backbone of the Mexican economy is its SMEs. We have to figure out how to stimulate these companies to spur their growth through PPPs. If they perform better, national development will accelerate. The construction industry is a muscle that, if active, can spark movement in many other economic sectors. The SMEs are going to drive the development of regional economies. Nevertheless, the main challenge that these firms face is a lack of financial resources and, in my opinion, the government has to work alongside the development banks to support SMEs. The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) announced that 74% of the construction contracts signed in the first half of the year were won by local companies.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the construction industry in the year ahead?</h4><p>I think we are experiencing one of the best economic moments in Mexico's history. Changes to receive more FDI have been made. Mexico is improving its transparency and security, but there is still work to be done. I am sure that if we achieve what we set out to, we will be better off economically. To conclude, I think that it is going to be a good year for the construction industry and the country in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[to-the-top]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2014 was a year of consolidation, will 2015 shift gear to expansion?</h4><p>This year we will focus on two activities; execution—delivering new projects and starting operations, sharing this new wave of projects with people nationwide—and expansion. We will be opening new areas and divisions within the company. Last year we established a presence in key markets around the country, and gained control of key sites and destinations. The focus was on development, and while that is still a focus, we see good opportunities in acquiring income-producing assets. There are opportunities to purchase existing buildings that are not necessarily well operated or leased, which we can be redeveloped and repositioned to new market standards. </p><h4>What strategy does Thor Urbana follow when targeting an investment?</h4><p>Our underlying goal is to lead every segment we are present in, which begins by having the best site and controlling the optimum location. We avoid developing projects that could eventually be considered mere commodities. Our projects aim to be one-of-a-kind icons in their respective towns and cities that contribute to the integrity of these locations. We are disciplined when it comes to buying sites and assembling land. Two different visions exist in real estate. Many companies look outwards and they go to smaller cities that are less served than the major cities in order to provide basic needs to these markets. Nevertheless, Thor Urbana has a much more urban focus and vision. We go into city centers that are experiencing high population and economic growth, and that stand to benefit from national reforms. Most of the time, we buy land with structures already on them that need to be demolished, in order to maximize the use and value of sites through greater development. We are looking to upgrade city centers. Once we select a city, we select the most attractive neighborhood that will be experiencing economic and population growth in the near term.</p><h4>What value are your developments adding to these selected cities? </h4><p>We bring a different kind of shopping experience to cities. At many of these sites, due to the cost of the land, we need to undertake mixed-use projects and build other uses top of retail such as offices, hotel or residences. Our goal is to bring a completely innovative retail experience to markets focused on lifestyle and entertainment. We are working with globally known consultants specialized in different areas ranging from landscaping to architecture. For instance, we are building an open-air mall in Metepec that will offer a wide range of entertainment, options, gathering places and new concepts. It will likely become a tourist destination and will improve the lives of people living in that community. </p><h4>How appealing is the development of mixed-use projects for international investors? </h4><p>Mexico is an emerging economy that has shown interesting growth and opportunities compared to other emerging markets in the world. We are seeing international brands enter into the country, which translates into more growth in terms of retail and more offerings for international investors. We are mainly funded by foreign institutional investors, who invest with us because they see a healthy industry that has been growing at a stable rate. The demand is there. Mexico has a young population, and demographics are a major factor in anticipating growth in retail consumption. When talking about the growth of the middle class, it is important to mention that 60% of retail consumption and purchasing still occurs in informal markets. Real estate is a cyclical industry, and we have positioned ourselves so that we have irreplaceable assets and locations when there are downturns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[traditional-customs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Mexican customs license work for brokers, and how many licenses does Gontor have?</h4><p>The Secretary of Treasury grants a license to a person with the authorization to operate from 1 to 4 points of entry. Gontor has two main licenses, which cover eight ports of entry. However, Mexican customs law states that, by partnering with other customs brokers, you can operate under your company' s legal entity with their licenses. In 2008, we incorporated 14 additional licenses. This incorporation serves two purposes: expansion of infrastructure and services to the more than eight already held by the main licenses; and serves as a back-up license. These are the competitive advantages that we offer in the marketplace.</p><h4>How was 2014 in terms of sales revenue?</h4><p>In 2012, we had a historic year, it being our highest grossing in terms of sales revenue. Since then, we have increased by an average of 4.5%. In the last several years, we expanded our services to cover the southern Mexican Border with Guatemala due to the increased trade between Mexico and Central America. We are investing in IT, which has allowed us to defray costs, increasing profitability and making room for other investments. For example, we launched an app that allows our customers to view and monitor customs and logistics operations.</p><h4>Luis Videgaray, the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit, announced the creation of the first three joint customs points between Mexico and the US in 2015. How important will these be for trade between these two countries?</h4><p>The main purpose is to increase trust in international trade between Mexico and the US. The international airport of Laredo, Texas became the first Mexican customs office outside of the country. This new project is known as the Pre Clearance Process for Mexican Imports. They constructed a beautiful building at a cost of about $2.3 million that houses both Mexican SAT and Customs Border Protection (CBP) officials, which facilitates the Mexican and American customs processes. Merchandise is loaded onto a charter plane and is cleared at this same facility. The merchandise travels with the “cleared customs" seal on the Mexican “pedimento," which is the legal document that allows for merchandise to enter the Mexican market. The plane can only land in one of eight authorized airports, whereas this merchandise is handed directly to the transport company.</p><h4>What industry do you think could be as successful as the automotive industry for Mexico?</h4><p>The automotive and electronic industries represent about 70% of our business with the remaining 30% rather diversified. With the energy reforms, the oil and gas industry is definitely an upcoming industry.</p><h4>What are the main routes for your exports from Mexico to the US?</h4><p>Nuevo Laredo, Mexico is our main route of exports from Mexico to the US. This border crossing accounts for 8,000-10,000 of the 28,000 daily trucks that cross at all border crossings between the two countries.</p><h4>Why is Gontor set to become the strongest link in the supply chain?</h4><p>We are a third generation company, but we maintain a corporate structure. Along with our 70 years of experience, we have a great team in place. It is our standard commitment to be highly innovative along with new technology that optimizes the quality of our practices. We deal with balance scorecards and key point indicators that allow us to detect areas of improvement through strategic action plans, training, and seminars for our personnel. We are currently working on brand recognition through our marketing department.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[over-the-ocean]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe Telefónica's growth achievement over the past year?</h4><p>The year was successful; we increased our customer base above 23 million. We raised our revenues in addition to meeting all our goals in compliance with our commitments with our Madrid headquarters.</p><h4> By 2015 Telefónica will have network coverage of 70% with over 23 million customers in the country, and the company has invested in a new LTE network. How will the new network improve your services?</h4><p>Perhaps one of the key elements of our marketing efforts this year is to take advantage of the implementation our LTE (4G) coverage. To begin with we are concentrating on the three biggest cities in order to improve our customer base in the post-paid market. Then LTE will be deployed further. The speed of our LTE is comparably faster than that of other service providers. In a comparison published by a local newspaper, our LTE speed turned out to be four or five times faster when compared to other popular providers. If the consumer's interest is in data, LTE is key, and Telefónica is their best option.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook on the sector and on the impact of the telecommunications reform?</h4><p>Perhaps one of the most important reforms has to do with allowing foreign firms to have full ownership of a fixed-line operator. There were many key constitutional reforms involving our sector, but this one stands out because it will allow companies like AT&amp;T to invest in urban fiber to provide television and voice services. If other more financially limited firms like Usacel and Nextel, recently purchased by AT&amp;T, are able to associate themselves with large foreign firms, they will grow quickly. Another favorable outcome of this particular item of the reform is that in order to be the 100% shareholder of a fixed line service we don't have to rely anymore on a partner. Of course, we are more comfortable with this type of situation. The other reforms concern the provision of interconnection points by the incumbent. The Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) has already issued a resolution requiring connection points to allow us to have fewer interconnection points at a lower cost. There is also the need for the incumbent to share the incumbent's infrastructure through a partial and so far ineffective provision called Terms of Reference, but we are still waiting for additional resolutions from the IFT to put ceilings on the prices it can charge for its services. For the first time we have a small degree of asymmetry involving differentials between what we obtain in interconnection rates and what we have to pay. This is important because firms who are not incumbent are the ones netting on traffic. Asymmetry is essential since we have an infrastructure almost identical to the incumbent's, but a small fraction of total traffic, about 13%. Therefore, our unit costs are considerably higher than the incumbent's. Although we get net settlements from the incumbent, we are far from what the reform requires because interconnection rates have been set with no regard for differences in size. The fact that we have different sizes means we incur different costs, which is the point of the reform: we have to have the IFT establish differential rates. Because this has not happened we have had to go to the courts to demand that the IFT recognize the letter of the constitutional reform. We expect to see positive verdicts from the courts. Some IFT resolutions have been according to the law, but some are questionable. For example, a resolution by the IFT related to portability has inhibited it substantially.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>We plan on increasing our LTE network even more, and right now this is our main emphasis. We are changing the mix of prepaid and postpaid services, and we want to move further into the data section of telecommunications. This is where the greatest growth potential lies and where Telefónica is exerting the most effort.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2014 for Lexmark Mexico?</h4><p>We grew in every one of our business units, in particular in the services division, and overall we have grown in Latin America. We see many opportunities in Mexico, at least for the coming three years. Over the past five years we have acquired companies that have offered us expertise and knowledge. We are providing services to sort out problems with dealing with large amounts of information.</p><h4>What kind of innovations have you brought to the Mexican market?</h4><p>It varies from industry to industry. For example, for retail we have provided solutions to improve methods of communicating promotions to consumers. If you are changing prices regularly, you need the technology to do so and to match customer requirements. You need to maintain strong communication with the store to change those prices, and then you can compete with other companies and improve your marketing strategy.</p><h4>Lexmark provides services to a wide range of industries. Which is the most important for the company in terms of revenue?</h4><p>We concentrate on industries that require complex support solutions for their processes, such as retail, banking, or manufacturing. Manufacturing in particular has to be competitive, and they use large number of documents in their workflow. We also work with the government to facilitate complex bureaucratic processes. It manages tons of contracts, and needs to track these on paper and digitally.</p><h4>How important is the Mexican market for Lexmark?</h4><p>The Mexican market is extremely important to us. Mexico is the second economy in which our business has been involved, and we see many opportunities in both the short and long terms.</p><h4>Do you expect that some of your businesses will grow as a result of these reforms?</h4><p>I believe they definitely will, because in theory it makes sense, as we have seen that the manufacturing sector has been restricted by high production costs. This has forced companies to drop their prices in the face of competition. We expect to provide more services to companies in the energy sector.</p><h4>What are your the goals for Lexmark Mexico in the coming years? </h4><p>I would like the company to take the number one position in the market. For the third time, IDC, a consulting firm, recognized Lexmark as a leader in managed print and document services in its 2014 MPDS IDC MarketScape worldwide report. We are eager to increase our market share here in Mexico.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have many expectations for the manufacturing sector in the coming year, not only because there have been multiple investments made here, but also because there are a large number of SMEs to which we can provide services. We also expect growth in the healthcare market, which is becoming an important source of clients for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How was 2014 for Grupo Expansion?
</h4><p>
	Simply put, 2014 was a fantastic year for us. Grupo Expansion was purchased by an investment fund, the Southern Cross Group, and after nine years we are no longer subsidiaries of Time Warner. Over the past two years, our plans had been to grow exponentially, but our strategy had differed from Time Warner's. This has been a major shift for us because we are now in hands of company aimed at high growth through Grupo Expansion. Regarding our performance, it was a challenging environment as the media business is highly indexed to the performance of the national economy, and last year Mexico did not meet its GDP growth target. On the other hand, we have been particularly successful in terms of audience. In 2010 we changed our strategy to become a multi-platform content brand, and have risen from 11 million readers per month to 32 million.
</p><h4>
	What strategies were deployed to achieve the abovementioned rise?
</h4><p>
	The key change came from changes implemented in 2007. We transitioned our content to digital, having assumed a pure digital approach. Even though we have over 20 magazines, the bulk of our network is online, while 80% of our audience is digital. This means that only 20% of our readership is paper-based, which is the source of the prestige we currently enjoy.
</p><h4>How does Grupo Expansion's digital strategy attract new readers?</h4><p>
	When we began to consider how to implement our digital strategy back in 2006, we decided to create a media network. In other words, instead of creating a website and dividing it into different sections, we made the decision to create one site for each media outlet. It works rather like the arms of an octopus linked to a central body, so to speak. Thus, we first created CNN Expansión for economic information, we created a sports website, and another website for the real estate and construction industry, and so on. Currently we are working on our second digital wave and are focused on developing lifestyle content. This kind of content is more interactive, and attracts an audience that is more prone to participating and engaging with the content creators.
</p><h4>What trends have you observed in the journalism industry in Mexico?</h4><p>
	There are three trends that are occupying reader's attention nowadays. Most notable is the fact that today the users themselves generate content, often brilliantly on blogs. Secondly, video is taking over, to the extent that it is estimated that, by 2020, most of the data exchanged will be visual. In that regard, we have to develop into an audiovisual company. And the third trend is the rise of mobile content, where we realize that it is not enough to simply transfer existing content onto mobile platforms. That is a mistake. We have to create specific content for mobile phones, because people these days are glued to their mobile devices. Hence, we have to be able to generate attractive content for their consumption.
</p><h4>What impact has the rise in digital media had in Mexico?</h4><p>
	I have to say that, in Mexico, the disruption that the digital platforms created in traditional media was less severe because the readership levels were not as high as in other countries. People spend less time reading newspapers in Mexico than in the US or certain European countries. In that regard, the media crisis barely registered in the country and did not undercut the stability of the Mexican market. Our products have high-levels of subscription, and do not depend on being sold on the street as much as some media outlets in Europe or in the US. In spite of the rise of digital media, I do not anticipate paper copies disappearing. The news and information contained in newspapers is more focused on specific information, and has a more analytical understanding. On the other hand, the information that we provide in the media is a brief review of what is happening at the moment, and I see the digital media winning in that field.

		<url><![CDATA[suits-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>LOVIS Holdings was created in 2014. Why did you create it and what is it bringing to the IT arena?</h4><p>I might go back a bit before the creation of LOVIS and talk about DynaWare, the first company I created. What we did for many years in Mexico was develop a highly innovative and forward-thinking type of business technology. We call it the Enterprise Operating System (EOS), and the brand name of the product is DynaWare. We tried and succeeded in solving the three most important problems faced by companies, here in Mexico as well as abroad. We must figure out how to get more time to do what is important and to focus on what really matters, to make more money, or to become more profitable. And finally, how can we enhance the wellbeing of our staff? We focus on productivity, profitability, and wellbeing. To handle all three at the same time is very complex, so we work on all three fronts simultaneously. We are about 10 years ahead of the common enterprise resources planning software offered around the world. We moved the concepts to the cloud in 2003, before that term even existed. Companies need real-time online enterprise software that helps improve the business value of their companies. That underpins our decision to migrate our software to the cloud.</p><h4>DynaWare has had much success. Were you focused only on Mexico or were you planning on expanding abroad from the very outset?</h4><p>In the beginning it was just Mexico we targeted. In Mexico, we used to work with companies selling at least $10 million a year and above, and now we have moved to companies selling $30 million per year and above, our minimum requirement to work with a company. The first part was envisioning the software and building it, the second part was building the methodologies to bring in new processes and new ways of working, and the third component was working with positive and cognitive psychologists to help people adopt the new processes and technology in a much easier, faster way. All that happened here in Mexico. Then we opened a subsidiary in Madrid in 2008 for DynaWare software, our first DynaWare subsidiary with an office. We did not perform well. At the beginning of 2012, we decided to launch another attempt to globalize the company. Our first office abroad was not making money, and was not expanding. We hired a global consultancy firm and they told us we had to move to London, because of the business model. So that is what we did in September 2013, and in January 2014 we opened our first subsidiary.</p><h4>What made London the ideal location for your model?</h4><p>Essentially, it was the dynamic relationship between the UK and Mexico that has been growing over the past few years. The UK has been strengthening its presence in Mexico, and Mexico has a correspondingly strong commitment to the UK. Second is the ease of doing business there, including opening a company. Once we analyzed the strengths of the financial sector in London, it seemed like a highly reliable market. It's interesting, because in our business model, all our subscriptions to our cloud service for our business applications and enterprise applications are now signed from one of our subsidiaries in London.</p><h4>What advantages have you found to being established in London? </h4><p>It's very interesting to say the least, how reality is perceived and how our clients are more eager to sign with our London subsidiary than from Spain or Mexico. This helps us to market the company. Suddenly we found that companies in Thailand and in Turkey were interested. An impression of credibility and reliability, from basing our business in London, has helped accelerate company performance. Relations with Ireland, Canada, and New Zealand had been improving rapidly. Our Mexican and Spanish subsidiaries were already up and running. We are about to open, depending on interest, subsidiaries in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Ireland. The idea is that we will deliver consultancy services directly, while developing business partners in these countries. For the UK, the simple fact that we are based there makes us a British company. They do not care about the origins of the investment. This is fantastic, because we have the support of both Mexico and the UK at the same time, and in countries where Mexico is stronger, we will look to Mexico for support, and in other countries ask for the support of the UK. It's excellent, because the goal is to bring this highly advanced technology that we created to the world. So it doesn't matter where the help comes from.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mazda's sales in Mexico increased by 53% in the first quarter. What factors have driven this growth?</h4><p>This first quarter, from January to March, is vital to consider. This year the industry grew 22% during this time, and Mazda rose 53% due to the new products in our portfolio. We divided Mazda 3 into two models. One is a 2-liter engine model, locally produced in Salamanca, and the other is the 2.5-liter engine produced in Hiroshima, Japan. The increase in our sales is representative of the Mazda 3's success and due to our coverage of the market. Today we have 54 dealerships nationwide, up from last year's 45. We have nationwide representation, in all the major cities.</p><h4>Mazda's plant in Mexico targets manufacturing 230,000 cars by 2016. What steps are being taken to achieve those numbers?</h4><p>Last year we began production of the Mazda 3 at the Salamanca plant. If the year ends in March, by Japanese fiscal years, we have manufactured our target of 140,000 units in the first year. In the second fiscal year running from April 2015 to March 2016, our goal is to produce our maximum capacity of 230,000 units, consisting of about 200,000 Mazda cars and around 40,000 units for Toyota. To achieve those goals we have started manufacturing the Mazda 2 at the Salamanca facility, changed from 1 shift to 2 shifts at the plant, and increased staff from 4,600 to 5,200 people. Production is increasing, and 90% is export-oriented with 10% reserved for the domestic market.</p><h4>How important is the Mexican domestic market for Mazda?</h4><p>The domestic market is incredibly important. We are in the top 10 Mazda markets in the world; last year we were ranked as the 8th market in the global Mazda business. We would like to achieve the number 5 in that ranking. In order to achieve this, we will launch the Mazda 2 in Mexico, which will give us incremental volume. In addition, this summer we plan to launch the MX-5 Miata, which is a niche car that will help us in other segments. Late this calendar year we will launch the Mazda CX3, a small SUV. It will be part of an important segment of the Mexican market. In terms of commercial operations, we are getting more products and increasing our portfolio base. We are renewing cars, which helps us in that regard.</p><h4>What is the main demand of the Mexican consumer market?</h4><p>Mexican customers value design, and Mazda fits the Mexican customers' profile, which differs from Europe or the US. Consumers are looking for well-equipped cars with good audio systems, sunroofs, safety features including air bags, and the dynamics of control. <br>Mazda 3 exports go to the US, Canada, Europe, Central and South America, and the Mazda 2 is exported to Europe, Central and South America. </p><h4>By 2020 Mexico is expected to manufacture 5 million cars. Where do you expect to see Mazda by that time?</h4><p>We will have grown by 2020, and we have ample room at the Salamanca facility to expand. We have a 230,000-unit objective. If we observe demand in the global market, there will likely be an expansion of the plant.</p><h4>What are you expectations for 2015 and 2016?</h4><p>Based on 2014, the forecast for this year is for a unit sales rise of 6%. Customer satisfaction is always our goal, while growth is also a priority. Last year we sold 41,000 units, and this year we are aiming for 47,000.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[O Christmas Tree]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[o-christmas-tree]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind acquiring Galas?</h4><p>We were one of the suppliers of Galas at that time, so with that purchase, we completed an integrated line of production. We do everything ourselves, and manage to serve Bimbo, as well as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Grupo Modelo, and Heineken.</p><h4>Is Galas or Janel more important in terms of assets?</h4><p>They are about the same size, and are integrated. All of our production lines are integrated from plastic pallets to finished products. We have adhesive tapes for industrial purposes, and also for commercial use. On this side of the business, our biggest customers are the retailers Wal-Mart, Chedraui, Soriana, and Office Max.</p><h4>What trends have you seen recently in retailing in Mexico?</h4><p>The level of sophistication of the consumer in Mexico is developing, and in general has been evolving considerably over the past decade. For Christmas products, the level of sophistication is amazing. They want artificial trees that are almost exactly like a real tree, and you can really compare it to any country in Europe or the US in terms of products and the desires of consumers. </p><h4>What impact will your new acquisition aimed at exporting plastic trees to the US have on your overall operations?</h4><p>It is an acquisition of a US company, and I am hoping it will take place in 2015. Production in 2013 was around 680,000 Christmas trees, but I believe we have improved on this in 2014, and have reached closer to 800,000. Out of our 20,000 SKUs, half of them are Christmas trees and decoration articles. As a group, 18% of our revenue comes from Christmas, which is a lot. Five customers make 7% of those sales.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to make Galas Janel a sustainable company?</h4><p>We have several products in the plastic and in the packaging side of the business that are biodegradable. Around 99% of our production in Mexico is done at the eight production facilities we have in Mexico City, Toluca, and Monterrey.</p><h4>How important is innovation to your company?</h4><p>In 2014, we launched around 200 new products and stopped between 100 and 150. We have 17 graphic designers who constantly come up with new products, as we understand that we have to innovate regularly. </p><h4>What is the biggest challenge in going into the US?</h4><p>Pricing remains the most significant challenge we face in doing this. In entering the US market, you are setting yourself up for direct competition with Chinese firms. In our segment, China is getting more competitive in terms of quality. However, our products have always been high quality, so this is not too much of an issue; the problem is related to rising expenses. Shipping our products from Asia is difficult, and it is also risky as you can only sell these products for two or three weeks of the year, so if something goes wrong, the risk is relatively high. </p><h4>How much do you export?</h4><p>As a group, we export about 15% of the total. Our biggest exports are tapes and sticky notes. For now, most of our production is domestic. However, from now on we will be focusing on exports because the internal market in Mexico is not growing. Over the past couple of years, growth in the Mexican market has been between 2% and 3%, and this is not enough for us. We need to expand to other countries.</p><h4>Where do you see this group in the next decade?</h4><p>We are planning for a growth in exports, and an expanded presence in other countries through acquisitions in the US and the EU. Our strategy involves the establishment of distribution centers in Europe. Our main goal is to promote growth and our international presence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[trust-is-the-key]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been FIDEPAR's landmark achievements since incorporation?</h4><p>The most important success of our trust fund is that it has shaped public policy. In the beginning, our activity focused more on infrastructure, to enable companies to grow and enter industrial areas in the country. Industrial parks in Mexico began to develop in 1940. However, we encouraged a change in regulation to provide these areas with the services and infrastructure they required. We are helping to regulate the market and are encouraging companies to expand activities and move into these industrial zones. FIDEPAR has been a key promoter of these policies, and today we can proudly say that we were instrumental in the change and evolution of Mexico's main industrial parks. Our initial goal was to develop the parks and hand them over to the various municipalities. They managed the parks and could charge for services provided. Around a decade or so ago, we also played a key role in the arrival of many foreign companies, firms that created their own industrial parks, transforming the model I have described. In 2012, we changed the bylaws of the company to allow us to set up Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs). </p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of FIDEPAR and the services the company offers?</h4><p>We provide tax and legal security to companies. When partnering with FIDEPAR, the public sector becomes an ally in the process of obtaining permits, licenses, and certificates. We also organized commercial trips to attract foreign companies to set up operations in these industrial areas</p><h4>How have FIDEPAR's 108 industrial parks helped Mexico's industry to move forward in the value chain?</h4><p>Our work involves integrating major companies such as Nestle, Pfizer, Chrysler, and General Motors with the local production chain in order to establish a supply network. Our target is to develop micro-industrial parks, in which we integrate in one location the SMEs that are today part of the production chain. We also guarantee the support of the public sector and provide all the infrastructural and technical services in a leasing scheme. These leasing schemes move into ownership schemes after a certain period of time. We carry out such activity in sectors such as food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, and automotive. We plan to develop a training facility for SMEs as well as a research center within the food industry. We foresee two more micro-industrial parks for 2015, one for the pharmaceutical industry and the other in the automotive sector. </p><h4>What are other sectors of growth potential in Mexico for the near future?</h4><p>One of the key sectors of potential is aerospace, as we have the scope to develop more industrial infrastructure in this area. At the same time, the logistics industry offers many opportunities, particularly in areas such as Mexico City and its metropolitan area. We note that key road infrastructure projects such as the connection between Guadalajara and Mexico City are set to become a reality. Besides, it is important to highlight the road connectivity to the US and therefore Canada, which has also improved. We have also seen the increasing arrival of cargo companies as infrastructure has improved, and several companies such as FedEx have regional hubs in Mexico, located near airports. Recent developments in railway infrastructure have also been impressive. In this context, we are currently developing the logistics platform Arco 57, a PPP of more than $200 million, in which the Bank of New York is the main trustee. </p><h4>What are some of the highlights of FIDEPAR in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>We have always prioritized the development of industrial parks in urban areas with many inhabitants, as they generate notable employment. We also have partnerships with universities to link the academic world with the productive chain. The state offers facilities for companies to hire recent graduates. We have programs with General Motors, Bosch and other companies and entities that require technical workers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What value added products are you producing now?</h4><p>Innophos Mexico generates 30-40% of Innophos' total revenue worldwide. As part of Innophos worldwide, the plant that we are in charge of in Coatzacoalcos is the third largest of its kind. We are integrated into extracting phosphoric acid from rock, whereas other plants buy the phosphoric acid and then create salts from it. We buy rock that has a high phosphoric content; we process it, purify the phosphoric acid and then sell the purified acid. Phosphoric salts have a myriad of uses. They are used for pharma, oral care, baking, seafood, meat and cheese. They are also used for ceramics, industrial applications, water purification, to develop wine, as a fire retardant and as water-soluble fertilizers. </p><h4>Which industries are the most important for you in Mexico?</h4><p>We are a large force in oral care, supplying products for toothpaste. We also supply products for bakeries and meat blends. Our sister corporation in the US has developed several proprietary formulations for specialized meat blends. Another expertise of ours is water-soluble fertilizers, where our market share is between 50-55% in Mexico. Aside from the domestic market, we export around 50% of our products across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. </p><h4>What opportunities do you identify in the market?</h4><p>Innophos is an international 100% publicly owned company with stock floated on the NASDAQ. In the US, our focus is on food and pharma. In Mexico, we have seen an interesting innovation in the automotive industry where phosphoric acid is used for metal treatment. There are some petrochemical applications that also use phosphoric salts that might be an interesting longer-term opportunity for a company like ours. Our expectations are for the water-soluble fertilization market in Mexico to see continued growth. Agriculture is a traditional market in Mexico, due to our favorable climate and domestic food consumption and we hope to continue to supply the Mexican agricultural industry. Another opportunity lies in specialty mining, where there will be requirements for phosphoric acid to replace sulfuring acid.</p><h4>What is the company's strategy for Latin America?</h4><p>Our strategy for Latin America is to become a highly competitive major player in the market, and to provide our clients with both long and short-term solutions. Customer service is a priority of our operations. We have a sales presence in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, most of Central America and three countries in the Caribbean. Our target is to be a solution provider and be a majority player in the sales of salts and phosphoric acid throughout the Caribbean and Central and South America. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Innophos in Mexico for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will pursue highly aggressive growth plans, and are also working to ensure that our plants are even more multi-purpose than today. We aim to grow in capacity and be able to supply our distribution brands in the US with finished goods, particularly salts and acids. And meanwhile, we expect to increase our market-share across Latin America through acquisitions. However, the Mexican market remains a priority of ours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Silver Lining]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-silver-lining]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014, Santacruz Silver Mining reached a record of 755,000 silver equivalent ounces. What factors have led to this success?</h4><p>We started work on the Rosario mine in 3Q2012 and began production in early 2013. Full credit goes to the people in the field, as they are seasoned engineers and profesionals deeply committed to their work and. That has been the main reason why we have been able to achieve production on time and within budget. We produced on average around 280 tons per day, and in 2014 we are hoping to reach about 450 tons by the end of the third quarter. This would mean hitting maximum capacity at Rosario, giving us an average of 1.3 million ounces of silver equivalent production on an annual basis. Rosario mine has a lifespan of about seven years remaining. Nowadays, as you are aware, silver prices are not as good as they were in previous years. For us it is important to keep our ramping-up process in the sense of meeting cost efficiencies so that every ounce we produce is profitable, as opposed to merely reaching goals or targets only measured by produced ounces, in other words, we want profitable produced ounces. Perhaps this approach will prove slower in terms of tonnage, but it remains profitable. Our next producing mine will be San Felipe. A NI-43101 Technical Report was completed last year indicating strong economic potential for the mine, and with today's metal prices it is encouraging for us and also a good reason to keep further de-risking the property. Hopefully, by year-end it will have led to a construction decision. The mine will be in line to produce around 3.3 million ounces of silver equivalent once it reaches full capacity within one year after construction starts. We expect to be producing at a 1,250 tons per day on San Felipe.</p><h4>What are your plans for the Gavilanes and El Gachi mines?</h4><p>Gavilanes is a property that is undergoing the exploration process at present, but we have halted activities for the moment. The Gavilanes project has a budget for the second and third drilling phases. The property has about 36 million ounces of silver equivalent. We just need to continue with the exploration activities including drilling campaigns, so hopefully we might revisit and begin those drilling campaigns by 2016. As for El Gachi, we have finished some surface exploration works and obtained good results. We have not done much yet, but it is definitely a strategic property for the San Felipe project, being located 36km from San Felipe. It is likely that the mill from San Felipe will allow us to run ore from El Gachi, making it a more profitable project.</p><h4>Is it still a challenge for mining companies to raise capital in Mexico?</h4><p>It is definitely still difficult, as we lack a financial vehicle such as the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. Knowledge on the part of investors is rather limited compared to countries like Canada and Chile. In the past we have only had a few listed companies on the Mexican Stock Exchange, which also curbs the investor community. I assume that the community in Mexico is gradually becoming more aware of this industry, but it will take a few more years to become clear. The investment community is maturing in this industry in Mexico, but we need our stock exchange to have more appropriate vehicles.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in five years' time?</h4><p>Over the next five years I see the company becoming a much stronger entity. By then we should have at least three of our mines in production, achieving results of somewhere in the range of 8-10 million ounces of silver equivalent annually. We are eager to sustain our local growth, and feel this is where we have the leverage and knowledge required for expansion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[no-pit-falls]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Grupo Mexico-Minera performed last year in light of the worldwide fall in metal prices? </h4><p>The price of copper dropped around 7%, but the drop was more dramatic for other metals such as silver and molybdenum. Despite the decrease in the prices of copper, Ebitda has only decreased by 6% due to certain factors such the project in Buena Vista, which increased overall production. We also reduced infrastructure costs by implementing an integrated center for transactional activities (Shared Services Center)  located in Hermosillo that carries out operations for México, Perú, and America. Additionally, the inauguration of the combined cycle energy plants and a Wind Farm reduced the costs. The transportation, petroleum, gas, and construction divisions experienced growth that surpassed last year. We broke our previous record in extraction. This year, we will produce significantly more critical mass due to the exploitation of the Buena Vista Mine, with over 300,000 tons of copper, representing an increment of 178% in production and a 140% increase of molybdenum production. In terms of oil extraction, we have five drilling rigs in shallows waters in Campeche in operation, and we are installing two more, the “Veracruz and the Tamaulipas".</p><h4>Regarding the energy division of your company, what are the opportunities for the group given the recent energy reform in Mexico?</h4><p>Our aim is to be self-sufficient in terms of energy, however we also view the operation as an opportunity to enter the free market. We acquired a wind power park in Oaxaca called El Retiro, purchased from Gamesa, a Spanish company. It is running at 100% capacity and caters to the low- and medium-range activities of the group, provides green energy to the Cinemex conglomerate.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the projects in Peru located in Tí­a Marí­a and Toquepala?</h4><p>We are starting in Toquepala because we have received the construction license to do so. Nonetheless, in Tí­a Marí­a we have the environmental impact documentation in place, but the official license hasn't been issued due to opposition from anti-mining groups that have obstructed the process. We are awaiting the resolution of this problem, hopefully in a few weeks, and we are confident because we have received support from many government institutions. The project will benefit the country because it will be located in an isolated area without important economic activity, and it will generate employment for the local community. For the Toquepala project that began operations, the annual production will double to 200,000 tons of copper.</p><h4>How do you think the mining industry will evolve in the next 5 years in Mexico?</h4><p>The exploration rate has decreased due to the changes in policies requiring exploration costs to be deferred 10 years, instead of deducting the expenses immediately. As this is risk capital, the decision to implement this policy was inadequate and it had a considerable impact on the industry. The main foreign investors were Canadian companies and more than half of them abandoned their operations in Mexico after this policy was implemented. Despite this current situation, I believe that if policies are adjusted, these foreign investors will return to the country.</p><h4>For 2015 you announced an investment of $3 billion dollars. What are the expectations of the group for this year?</h4><p>We expect to finish construction of the Buena Vista project that represents an investment of $3.4 billion. We must also finish the modular oil platforms construction. The railway is also receiving an important investment of $400 million. There is a lot of possibility to expand as it currently covers only 24% of the cargo transportation routes in Mexico. We aim to complete the construction of our projects in Mexico and definitely to participate in the oil drilling round 0 for Pemex. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you outline the development of the company?</h4><p>Ours has been a family-owned business since 1963. My father established the company in Mexico City and now we have three manufacturing locations. Because of company growth, we have expanded on a year-to-year basis. Our operations started out almost exclusively in Mexico, but over the years, we looked at the export markets. Originally, it was Central and South America. Our operations in Central America are very limited. One of the major players is Costa Rica, where there is a good installed base for our products. After that, we have a presence with warehouses and inventory in Argentina and Brazil, with sister companies. We have warehouses, and have established our companies there. From those two countries, we supply the internal needs of these markets and we export to Colombia, Peru, and somewhat to Bolivia, Uruguay, and Paraguay. However, the three manufacturing facilities are in Mexico City. We produce diverse products and export them. We import raw materials into Mexico and employ local laborers and all our equipment here in Mexico. Válvulas Worcester de México has also been exporting to Asia for about 10 years. We have representation in Thailand and we have made sales to the Chinese market for the past three years, as well as in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. We do special applications, such as cryogenic values, and also nuclear applications. </p><h4>How much of your production do you export?</h4><p>Only 25% of our established base here is for exports, with 75% destined for the local market. Fortunately, we retain a solid market share in Mexico of 60%-65%. </p><h4>What opportunities will the reforms bring to the Mexican economy, and particularly to your company?</h4><p>There is increased potential for multinational companies to establish operations in Mexico. We are now in round zero of the energy reforms, and there are about 20 companies playing an important role. I hope that the government provides a well-established base that renders the Mexican market attractive for companies looking to invest.  Válvulas Worcester and other well-established Mexican companies stand to benefit most. We also must take into consideration the joint ventures that we will be able to realize with companies coming here.</p><h4>How are you positioning yourself as a key partner in the country?</h4><p>Válvulas Worcester de México has a very good distribution network with 45 distributors throughout the Mexican Republic. Millions of our valves have been installed, and companies coming to Mexico know that they can rely on a local partner with extensive manufacturing facilities and an experienced workforce. We have engaged in a wide range of industries ranging from oil and gas to chemicals and petrochemicals, among others. Companies coming here can comfortably depend on our knowledge. </p><h4>Could you tell us about Válvulas Worcester plans for expansion?</h4><p>We are set for expansion, but mainly in terms of product range, by adding automation, special valves, metal to metal, and products required by Mexico's future oil and gas industry. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>We expect to post growth of between 12%-15% on the previous year. Experience leaves us confident that the third year of an administration sees investment, and we are optimistic that 2015 will be dynamic. Of course, if everything goes well and we see key players establishing themselves here, multinational companies will need to hire many people. Meanwhile, certain states will see further grow than others, such as Veracruz, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Inco was founded in 1995. What have been its highlights over the past ten years? </h4><p>At the outset, we primarily focused on self-generation and cogeneration projects. From 1995 to 2009, we have carried out 322 projects. There are many highlights in that time period. For the company Liverpool, we developed 49 stores with self-generation projects and then 29 hotels with Grupo Posadas or Polioles. Today we are mainly doing cogeneration projects and hydroelectric plants. At this time, we are working on 12 different cogeneration projects that are medium or large-scale. We have five hydroelectric plants under operation and we are developing 40 more. All these are what we call “mini-hydro," generating less than 30 MW per site. </p><h4>In what specific areas of developing a cogeneration plant do you focus?</h4><p>We do all the engineering of the projects, we develop the concepts as well as the economic and financial models. We put up the equity that is needed for the projects. We take the debt and then we construct and do the EPC for the project, then we sell energy for a long-term period. Our payback is through the sale of energy—electricity, steam, hot and cold water. We generate electricity and thermal energy, which includes hot water, cold water, steam, hot air, or hot oil. Those are the two energies that we have in the market.</p><h4>What sectors are most important for cogeneration?</h4><p>Cogeneration is related to high thermal energy demand. That is the key for cogeneration. If the end user is a high thermal issue, then the heat balance for cogeneration has its optimal side. “Efficient cogeneration" is cogeneration, which has a thermal total efficiency that is higher than the mixture of a typical electric project and a modern boiler. That is considered renewable energy under Mexican law and that is because the CO2 mitigation you can get from a cogeneration plant is always higher than with any other technology.</p><h4>What opportunities does the energy reform bring to your company?</h4><p>The reforms have created a reality that did not exist yesterday. Cogeneration has always and will always be the most efficient and most economical way to generate energy. The size of the cogeneration opportunities in Mexico, according to the numbers of the national commission of efficient use of energy, is 28,000 MW. That is the size of the market today, but it will grow as the demand grows.</p><h4>What incentives do investors in cogeneration find in Mexico?</h4><p>The fiscal incentives are that it has a fast depreciation. You can depreciate 100% of your investment in the first year. We are a gasified country, and a part of the NAFTA system, which guarantees that the cost of natural gas is very low. It is the same price as for Canada, the US, and Mexico. The cost of natural gas is very low, and will be established over the coming years. </p><h4>What are your views on the new energy market taking shape? </h4><p>The future of this market is mainly predicated on the growth of internal demand for electricity. That is the main challenge. Demand will come from private companies and non-public investors, and it will be needed in increasing quantities in the future. Meeting this demand is a challenge. They are thinking about more efficient ways to develop the country, even though Mexico has an overcapacity of generation. Today we have around mid-30% of reserve margin and that is usually 14%-15% in developed countries. We have a capacity to play with and to develop the market around. </p><h4>Will renewables be a key factor in this?</h4><p>It is hard to know, because Mexico is an open market and renewable energy has been developed worldwide with government support and subsidies. There will not be subsidies here. If renewable energy has enough strength to compete against combined cycles and these other kinds of technologies, they may be able to compete.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently said that, “Green investments represent savings and gains for the private sector." What steps is SEMARNAT taking to boost such investments?</h4><p>Mexico is developing strategies and policies to move towards a green economy. Thus constitutional reforms will form, among other benefits, a new framework in which it can achieve several things, such as: encourage energy generation from clean sources (wind, solar, geothermal, natural gas), promote energy transition, foster the use of low-carbon technologies and fuels, and make sure that sustainability is the underlying principle for energy infrastructure project development. This has the potential to create 1 million green jobs by 2018.</p><h4>What is the main environmental significance of the National Development Plan 2013-2018?</h4><p>The aim of boosting the green growth established in the National Development Plan, can only be achieved with coordination between several actors, including various agencies and departments of the Federal Public Administration, different orders of government —and, of course, the private sector. The result from this combination and coordination of efforts will be to double the value of the production of environmental goods and services (from 1.07 % to 2.14 % of GDP), reduce by 31% the carbon intensity (from 84.77 to 58.67 tCO2e/million pesos to the prices of 2003), and to decrease by 16% GHG emissions per capita (from 6.55 (2010) to 5.51 tCO2e/capita), among other benefits. Eventually, this will increase the value of environmental sustainability competitiveness from 0.9 to 1.0 in the World Economic Forum competitive Index.</p><h4>What are the needs and priorities of Mexico on environmental issues and what are the challenges and opportunities?</h4><p>Inclusive green growth should take advantage of opportunities in terms of job creation, reducing inequality gaps, increasing levels of welfare and development and strengthening competitive advantages. These six objectives are expressed in the Sector Program of Environment and Natural Resources 2013-18. Undoubtedly, the strengthening of efforts to preserve the environment, or transiting to the 'green economy', is one of the most important challenges for the Mexican government. In this regard, it is of great importance to consolidate the "Special Program on Sustainable Production and Consumption", which allows the linking of different levels of the public sector with the private and social sectors to implement actions that could achieve green growth to generate wealth, competitiveness and employment. </p><h4>What strategies is SEMARNAT implementing to diminish greenhouse gas emission?</h4><p>In April 2012, the Mexican Congress unanimously approved the General Law on Climate Change (LGCC, as per its acronym in Spanish). The LGCC incorporates indicative mitigation objectives of 30% emission reduction by 2020 with respect to the baseline, and 50% by 2050 with respect to emissions recorded in 2000. Likewise, the Law establishes the commitment to generate 35% of electricity from clean sources by the year 2024. In January 2014, a carbon tax entered into force in Mexico. In October of that year, SEMARNAT published the regulations of the new National Emissions Registry, which makes it mandatory to register the GHG and SLCP of those emitters that surpass 25,000 CO2e tons per year. Moreover, Mexico introduced a $3.50/tonne carbon tax on fossil fuels in 2014 and will at some point allow emitters to buy and sell Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from CO2. It also will launch its carbon offset market in 2017. Mexico's tax and offset scheme forms part of its efforts to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below business as usual (BAU) levels by 2020, and halving 2000 levels by mid-century. Mexico has pledged to cut its emissions by at least 25% below BAU levels by 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ExxonMobil was initially interested in bidding in the first phase of the Round One but eventually did not participate. What opportunities do you see this reform bringing to Mexico? </h4><p>Energy reform has provided opportunities for Mexico to emerge as a global leader in international investment and enhance its global competitiveness, and we have closely followed its implementation. After conducting a thorough assessment, we decided not to participate in the shallow water round. We continually look for new opportunities around the world in which we can leverage our experience and technology in finding and developing hydrocarbon resources, and we look forward to evaluating future opportunities in Mexico. Competition is global, and projects in Mexico will compete with projects in every other oil-producing nation. Countries must offer globally competitive terms to attract companies and investment. We welcome the steps Mexico has taken on important issues regarding transparency and rule of law and legal stability, and we will carefully consider these issues as we evaluate investment opportunities in Mexico. Measures of success will include both investment levels and the type of investor, i.e. large, experienced companies with long-term investment perspectives. Companies with significant capital, execution capacity, cost efficiencies and operational safety will maximize the value of Mexico's resources.</p><h4>ExxonMobil signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Pemex in 2014. What are its key points and in what specific areas could both institutions collaborate in the coming years?</h4><p>In October 2014, ExxonMobil signed a MoU with Pemex to exchange academic, scientific and technical knowledge, and best practices. The three-year agreement was signed in the presence of Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ExxonMobil Corporation, and Emilio Lozoya Austin, General Director of Pemex. With this MoU, ExxonMobil and Pemex will focus on several technical areas across the entire oil and gas value chain, including research and development. This agreement allows ExxonMobil to share best practices regarding industrial safety, workplace health, and sustainability. The memorandum allows both companies to collaborate for training purposes and professional exchanges. This is a mutually beneficial agreement that could help us to expand our joint capabilities in the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in Mexico for the year ahead?</h4><p>ExxonMobil looks forward to evaluating future opportunities. We are supportive of regular bid rounds, which enable companies to develop a longer-term business strategy and create additional value for Mexico by encouraging a more constant level of economic activity over time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>UBS has three main businesses: wealth management, asset management, and investment banking. How important are each of these divisions here in Mexico?</h4><p>Right now UBS has 177 people in Mexico, 162 are based in Mexico City. We have two offices in Guadalajara and Monterrey with 8 and 7 people in each, respectively. About two-thirds of those 177 people are focused on wealth management. The office is primarily focused on wealth management and that's the area where we have seen the most growth. We opened our on shore wealth management capabilities 5 years ago and now we manage about $5 billion. That is the growth we have seen. Five years ago we had less than 40 staff. In addition to wealth management we have a significant investment bank presence in Mexico. It is divided into three areas: Corporate Client Services (CCS), which is focused on corporate clients and their financing and advisory needs; the equities business, on average we are responsible for 5-6% of the volume of the Mexico stock market everyday comprised of sales people, analysts and traders; the third part is the fixed income business. </p><h4>What is the profile of the Mexican investor?</h4><p>For UBS our focus is on very affluent customers. We look for customers with complex, sophisticated financial needs. Our clients tend to be heterogeneous. We have conservative clients that focus on fixed-income investments. We also have more opportunistic clients that are more aggressive in their investment style. They have significant exposure to equity or single stocks. </p><h4>A third of your activities are related to investment banking. What is your outlook on that segment?</h4><p>Last year was slow in Mexico in investment banking in general. That reflects on the uncertainty and volatility of emerging markets. We are seeing things pick up right now quite significantly. Last week there was the first IPO from Unifin, which is a leasing company. We were one of the book runners in that transaction. A number of different IPOs are coming into the market. After 12-18 months where things have been quiet you will see a pickup in activity and it will become more apparent as the year goes on. We have seen important mergers; Soriana and Comercial Mexicana have merged. On the equity side we have seen a significant increase in business this year. Volumes from the beginning of the year were quite robust. With interest rates as low as they are, local investors in particular are looking to increase their exposure to equities. In the fixed income segment we have also seen a pickup in business, again reflecting a gradual improvement in the economy.</p><h4>40% of Mexican GDP is represented in the stock exchange. What are the hindrances that Mexican companies still face with the stock market?</h4><p>There are a number of reasons why stock market penetration is lower in Mexico than other parts of the world. Firstly, you have big sectors like energy and electricity and water that until now have been off limits to the stock market because they are owned by the government. That is beginning to change with the liberalization of the energy and electricity sector. A second reason is multinational companies are starting to be very dominant in Mexico because of the proximity to the Untied States; Proctor &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Avalon, and GM are all present. Then you have the fact that a lot of companies are family owned and not institutionally managed; they want to be, but are not ready to be in the stock market. It is a family-oriented culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) reported a slight rise in its main index in 2014. What is your assessment of the BMV's performance, and what is your outlook for 2015?</h4><p>We have lower worldwide growth expectations for 2015, especially for emerging markets and certain countries in the Eurozone, due to the sharp drop in oil prices, Greece's still fragile debt situation and global expectations of higher interest rates in the US. There was modest growth of the Mexican Stock Exchange in year 2014. Even though we observed less trading activity during 2014 measured by the average daily trading amount, the good news is that the BMV has seen its trading activity improve by 20% in February and in similar fashion during the month of March of this year. </p><h4>What impact do you expect the energy reform to have on the performance of the BMV over the coming years, and what steps does the BMV plan to take in order to capitalize on it?</h4><p>Energy reform opens up new investment alternatives for companies in the energy sector. These companies will eventually need to define their funding alternatives and we think the BMV could offer such alternatives through our current products such as equity, CKDs, and securitizations. These reforms also provide the BMV and its capital market with the opportunity to create and develop new local products that have been successfully proven in other markets such as Master Limited Partnerships in the US. Together with local authorities, we are analyzing the possible regulatory and tax environment for its development. </p><h4>Mexican SMEs make up the majority of companies in Mexico. What strategies has the BMV taken to facilitate listing such firms on the stock exchange?</h4><p>The challenge we face in raising the number of listings mainly concerns eradicating outdated attitudes regarding the size of the company—many still hold a bias towards smaller companies—information disclosure, corporate governance practices, fear of losing control, and cost and excessive regulation. In recent years the BMV and certain market participants have been undertaking promotional efforts to encourage a paradigm shift in perceptions, and clarify the advantages of being a listed company, such as raising capital, inculcating a positive image, creating market value, and institutionalization, among others. Additionally, we have reduced our quantitative requirements, and any company with a paid-in capital of over $8 million can become listed. The financial reform encompassed in the Securities Market Law created new figures such as SAPI Bursátil and the Qualified Investors Offer (Oferta Dirigida a Institucionales) that make access easier for mid-sized companies. </p><h4>A major challenge the BMV faces is current volatility of the global economy. What strategies will the bourse take to cope with this challenge?</h4><p>All other economies and exchanges are suffering from current volatility, due to Central Bank monetary policy decisions. Market volatility has been evident since the 2008 crisis, but we hope that some windows will be open to allow new companies—especially mid-sized firms—to pursue the IPO route. We also think that by developing new products and financing alternatives for potential issuers and offering a wider range of investment alternatives we could help investors diversify their portfolio and see better risk-return ratios. And additionally, by promoting our derivative market Mexder and its hedging alternatives, we can offer both issuers and investors options to reduce market risk.</p><h4>You were appointed as the President of the BMV in late 2014. What are your main priorities for the coming years?</h4><p>As Grupo Bolsa's main activity is to provide state of the art infrastructure (systems, rules, procedure, etc.) in the various markets (equity, debt and derivatives) and segments (pre-trade, trade and post-trade services), it is our priority to increase efficiency in providing those services to brokers, issuers and investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The market grew 0.4%, while the company grew 2.7% in 2014. What do you identify as the drivers of this growth?</h4><p>Last year was a difficult one for the entire market. We outperformed the market average, although it was not the growth rate that we were looking for. We had an excellent year in regard to individual life insurance. We posted strong rates in individual life insurance, where we grew by double digits. We also grew by double digits in individual access in health, as well as in the SMEs market. Where we struggled was on the group side. So far, 2015 has been a positive year for us, and we are growing at a healthy 20% across all lines of business. </p><h4>About 6% of the Mexican population has health insurance. What is GNP doing in this segment to increase penetration?</h4><p>In Mexico, out of every three people that are insured, one is with GNP. Therefore, we are the major player in Mexico. Secondly, we believe we have to provide our policyholders the most options on the market; hence, we have the largest network of hospitals, clinics, and doctors on the market. Then, having secured that infrastructure, we have to provide the best service. Thirdly, we have an extensive network of agents and brokers to distribute our products and services. We provide the service to government entities, having therefore, become the largest player. We believe that growth will come from new products. We are in the process of launching three new products that we will be out at the end of the third-quarter, or start of the fourth. </p><h4>What are the main challenges in the market to promote an insurance culture in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico presents two challenges for us. The first, and highly familiar, is that Mexico lacks an insurance culture. This needs to be built gradually day by day. You knock on doors, sit down with the prospect, and tell them why insurance is important for them. We undertake considerable advertising, and try to position the brand for maximum recognition. That opens the doors for us meeting corporations and individuals, as well as government entities. Marketing helps to open doors; however, the best tool to do this is word of mouth from those to whom you have provided a good service. Most Mexicans are young, with 66% of the population aged below 40. </p><h4>In the SME segment, you posted double-digit growth in 2014. What strategies are you pursuing to clarify the benefits of coverage and sign up clients?</h4><p>We grew by 14% in the SME segment. One thing that GNP has done wisely was to create a unit dedicated to SMEs. We have a unit that conducts an analysis of their needs, and then generates the products required. </p><h4>According to Fitch, the market will grow by between 6% and 8% in 2015. What is your outlook on that?</h4><p>When we started the year, we expected the market to grow nominally by close to double-digit figures, meaning about 6% in real terms, depending on inflation. If you look back about 10 years, the insurance sector has grown by twice the overall growth of the economy on average. 2014 was the first year in which this did not happen. We expect to see double or triple the growth of the market going forward, as there are more players today, all of which are better prepared. This year, the industry is already growing by 6% in real terms, and we are growing by slightly more.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[energy-futures]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important has your firm been in the energy sector over the past 30 years?</h4><p>We set out by providing pollution control services to Mexico's state power utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), and were instrumental in the reduction of pollution in Mexico City. We worked on the reduction of pollution from power stations, and then we went into refining. From there, we started petroleum production chemicals. Basically, we provide complete solutions to the energy industry in Mexico. We are involved across the entire oil production chain. We clean, dehydrate, and desalt crude oil, and we are also active in the processes of refining, transportation, and purification. </p><h4>Which segment is the most important in revenue terms? </h4><p>The important work lies in dehydration and desalting. Before we took control of the dehydration and desalination of the oil in Mexico, there were serious discrepancies between the Brent and the West Texas Intermediate prices as compared to the Mexican mix. This was due to the consistent bad quality in the delivery of oil from Mexico. We have provided solutions on a daily basis by reducing corrosion and increasing production in five of Mexico's six refineries. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the remainder of 2015?</h4><p>This has been a record year for us. We have had thus far record sales, and the rest of the year is set to perform well. In the next year, however, we think it is going to be difficult because of the price of oil, though we expect that the dollar will stabilize and return to earlier levels. </p><h4>What are the optimum means for international companies to enter the market? </h4><p>Every country has its own characteristics and successes, though that does not necessarily guarantee success. It is imperative, therefore, to forge alliances with Mexican companies so that both bring assets to the table. Mexican companies bring valuable knowledge of the local market, while foreign firms are better placed to collaborate in terms of cutting-edge technology. </p><h4>The first phase of the energy reform took place in July. What were your views on it? </h4><p>The results were to be expected, as two out of the seven auctioned fields were awarded. Nonetheless, this marked a good beginning. There are many lessons for companies to learn from this first phase and there will be adjustments with a likely rise in subsequent participation. The remaining fields will not be abandoned. In five or 10 years from now, it will be clear that these reforms will bear meaningful results for the country.</p><h4>You have requested information in the third phase of the Round One that will auction several mature fields. How attractive are those fields for Quí­mica Apollo?</h4><p>We eventually want to collaborate with an operator and start production. We intend to develop a division of Apollo that is going to work with an experienced operator, which operates various fields outside of Mexico. We are currently in talks with two companies. These are mature fields, and that is the specialty of Quí­mica Apollo: to improve production and render a field profitable. </p><h4>What opportunities do you envision in the downstream industry?</h4><p>We are a leader in chemical treatments for oil and water, and there will be changes in that area in the future. Within the next few years there will be many players in distribution, transportation, and even certain production within the downstream business. There is a possibility of the construction of new refineries, as there are six refineries in the country owned by Pemex.</p><h4>Where do you see the company by 2020?</h4><p>I am bullish about Mexico, and expect the country to overcome any difficulties that may arise. We believe Quimica Apollo will likely more than double our revenues and will have entered into new commercial territories, such as upstream oil production and petroleum and energy infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Game Changer]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[game-changer]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what degree will energy reform allow Mexico to make the most of its resources?</h4><p>The Energy Reform brings profound changes to the hydrocarbons and electricity sectors, and the oil industry will increase its investment capacity through the granting of contracts to private companies alone, or else in association with Pemex. More capital and advanced technology will enable the exploitation of Mexico's deep water and unconventional fields, and enable recovery from mature fields, which previously were unprofitable. With this, Mexico seeks to modernize its energy infrastructure and increase domestic production of oil and natural gas, which in recent years has seen a clear downward trend. The electricity sector will be operated through a wholesale electricity market with the participation of public and private companies on equal terms. The new regulatory framework is primarily aimed at promoting investment, ensuring transparency, and improving the competitiveness of the industry and commerce through reduced electricity rates. Regarding the use and development of renewable energies for the generation of electricity, the reform establishes specific policies such as Clean Energy Certificates and the creation of a law regulating the activities of prospection, exploration, and extraction of geothermal reservoirs. In conclusion, constitutional reform pertaining to the energy sector is integral because through its new regulatory framework, the industry will attract more investment in most of the hydrocarbons and electricity activities, modernizing and strengthening infrastructure, increasing the supply of energy at better prices, and witnessing the development with a more social and environmental responsibility.</p><h4>What will be the main role of the Oil Revenues Stabilization Fund of Mexico, and what mechanisms will it put into place to increase transparency in the awarding of contracts to companies? </h4><p>The Energy Reform provides that income derived from the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons shall be administered by the Mexican Petroleum Fund for Stabilization and Development. By constitutional mandate, the resources this fund receives will be used to establish long-term savings that will minimize the impact of unanticipated events on the public finances of the national economy, as well as ensure sufficient resources for future generations. The items for which 60% of these savings will be allotted include the universal pension system, science projects, technology and renewable energy, investment in infrastructure, and human capital formation. To ensure the transparency of the fund, its committee is composed of four independent members and three representatives of the State: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and the Bank of Mexico, who will serve as its fiduciary institution. In this task, the Bank of Mexico will publish quarterly reports on the activities of the Trust and the main results, with prior approval of the committee. Also, external audits are conducted to examine the same accounting information.</p><h4>By 2024, 35% of the electricity generated in Mexico will come from renewable sources. What steps is Sener taking to achieve this objective? </h4><p>In terms of sustainability, the Energy Reform sets new instruments and renews existing ones in order to increase the use and development of clean energy sources. The new regulatory framework includes the creation of a wholesale market, which is open to generators and consumers, for the purchase and sale of electricity, under clear conditions of transparency and a competitive environment. Also in this market, Clean Energy Certificates will contribute to achieving the goal of generating 35% of non-fossil sources by 2024. Another important aspect of the reform is the creation of a specific law for the promotion and use of geothermal energy. Regarding research and technology, Sener has developed various activities, among which are international cooperation mechanisms to promote the development of innovation in the country and the creation in 2014 of the Mexican Energy Innovation Centers (CEMIEs) in terms of solar, wind and geothermal energies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were part of the team that negotiated NAFTA. What is the next step that should be taken to make the most out of the FTAs to which Mexico is a signatory?</h4><p>From my personal point of view we have not been able to fully take advantage of the different free trade agreements, especially NAFTA. We have not been able to get the necessary and potential economic growth that Mexico deserves. This is largely because of the division between large enterprises that participate in foreign trade, and SMEs that lack access to international markets. When we signed NAFTA, our vision was one of distributive benefits across the production chain; SMEs were a key component of this vision for our exports. Yet we have failed to ensure that smaller stakeholders in the economy benefit from our export drive.</p><h4>Investa Bank is online-oriented. What advantages does technology bring for a bank like yours?</h4><p>The advantage of technology today for a small bank like ours is that it allows us, without spending too much money and time, to get closer to the giants and to be able to provide a good service without the investment that these big firms have made over the past 50 or so years. We are taking advantage of technology and combing it with a professional team. We do not expect to, and do not aim to have local branches or offices nationwide. What we do expect to have is a full team of professionals that go directly to our potential customers, partner with our customers, who understand them, and are creative enough as to have the solutions tailor-made for them. We recently launched our electronic banking system. In July, we will present it to the public and expect it to be highly effective. We plan to be competitive in terms of service, and attractive in terms of both service and pricing.</p><h4>How diversified is your portfolio?</h4><p>Today we hold around $79.31  million, which is still insufficient. For a bank to be profitable, it needs more than $213 million, on average. We are already close to being profitable; so we do not have much further to go. In terms of sectors it is very diversified. The number one sector, which is still the financial sector, is at around 16% and the remainder is highly diversified. We are very much involved with the textile, automotive, and electronics industries, but not extensively with the real estate industry. We intend to have special programs, which we have already initiated, with certain potential industries that we perceive potential in, one being the automotive industry. </p><h4>One of the goals of Mexican fiscal reforms was to enable smooth credit flow in Mexico. Have you seen that happening?  </h4><p>No, the government is pushing the banks and the market to implement new systems. However, these are not down to the reforms. Of course, when you are talking about credit, there are different types, and the one I am concerned with is credit to small and medium sized companies. Because the large companies have the credit and equity they require. To date, Mexico has developed numerous schemes regarding consumer credit and that is ongoing. Of course, a huge percentage of Mexicans do not have access to credit, or financial or banking services but that is another issue. One thing that we have to realize is that in this market most of the Mexican companies, if they go through a traditional credit analysis, are not credit worthy. We have to work with them in structuring on structuring themselves and their presentations. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>2015 has been easier so far than 2014 since today we have a year of experience behind us. We have confirmed that we are on the right track and that we have a much stronger base in terms of systems and people than we had when we started last year. We do not have to look for customers because they seek us out themselves. We could be registering even faster growth had all our systems been in place today. With all systems in place our portfolio could surpass the $122 million (MXN 2 billion) mark.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2014 was a year of diversification for CI Banco. What steps did you take in that regard? </h4><p>This was a year of acquiring non-Foreign Exchange (FX) businesses. In April 2014, we bought Bank of New York Mellon, after which we merged the companies. Bank of New York Mellon is mainly engaged in the fiduciary trust business. This represents an effort by the shareholders to become a bank. In 2008, we received authorization to operate as a fully licensed bank and have worked towards that ever since. In addition to developing our mobile banking offering, we have over 200 ATMs, 186 branches, and a variety of products. CI Banco undertook to become the first Green Bank in Mexico, which is not a business strategy, but more of a philosophy, as sustainability does not run contrary to profitability. Put another way, we must be profitable and then become green or sustainable. </p><h4>What does being a "green bank" mean?</h4><p>According to this philosophy, we take care of the environment. This does not mean that we only attend to “green" customers, or that we only provide “green" products, because at this point, it is not feasible to focus exclusively on such areas. Instead, we are trying to provide services for customers keen on sustainability. For instance, if you are trying to finance a green car that produces less than 80 units per kilometer of CO2, you will receive a better rate from us. That is our green philosophy. We have developed many products, but our revenue is still derived primarily through Fx and derivatives. Over the past five years we have balanced our mixture at 40% banking and banking products and 60% Fx.</p><h4>One of the stated goals of the finance reform was to increase the loan portfolio in Mexico. Have you observed any developments on that front?</h4><p>The main goal of the reforms was to increase the provision of cheaper banking loans. On the other hand, there is also a problem with the requirements for the net equity ratio. Let us suppose we must have at least a 12% net equity ratio, but on the other hand, the loan reserves have been increased, so we have tougher rules for loan reserves. According to those rules, it is hard to increase them. The other variable is that the reserves are no longer tax deductible.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mexican economy for 2015?</h4><p>Certain key analysts have decreased their GDP growth projections. I foresee a figure of less than 3%. Analysts were especially influenced by the fact that this is an election year. All the reforms were approved and will start this year. The collapse of oil prices came out of nowhere, and there was a subsequent drop in public expenses. Thus I do not foresee growth of over 2.8%. Many of our customers are suffering because of this downturn, whereby these conditions are something we watch closely.</p><h4>What are your expectations for CI Banco for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect the upcoming year to be defined by consolidation, as we will have to consolidate investments that we made over the past six years. In other words, we will not increase our branch network significantly. We have already invested millions of pesos in creating all the infrastructure for the bank and so this year we decided to be more conservative in investing and spending and to consolidate all business lines and the branch network we have developed. That is why we decided to control and reduce expenses this year. Of course, we are increasing our sources of income, and that will enable us to enjoy a profitable year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the outlook for Puerto de Liverpool in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico will boast a hugely significant workforce within the next 15 to 20 years. The country has never before witnessed such demographics, and the middle class is growing substantially. We continue to expand the company in the upper A, B, and C classes. We are also focusing on a lower bracket as well and opening eight stores. We intend to open 10 to 15 in the lower C market, and we see huge growth opportunity there on the back of the growing middle class. </p><h4>What needs to be done to promote Mexican retail brands?</h4><p>Mexicans are highly brand oriented. If a brand is Mexican, people are less likely to buy it unless it has been marketed correctly. Liverpool offers excellent quality shoes and clothing, but the country sometimes lacks design finesse. We are expending efforts to promote new local designers and fashion lines. Another example of this is to be found in jewelry—its offering has barely changed in forty years and is mainly targeted at the tourist market. In that segment, we are promoting young graduate designers. We have a joint partnership with an American company that scans trends from around the world to better inform the sector. We bring in designers to help Mexican counterparts grasp popular trends and designs. We have top brands such as Gap, Aeropostale, and Banana Republic in addition to our own offerings, and those local brands are the ones that we are trying to promote. </p><h4>How have foreign brands performed in Liverpool?</h4><p>They have performed particularly well, especially inside the freestanding stores, of which we have opened 90 over the past two years. They remain a fairly new line for us. In terms of sales, we are still learning the freestanding store model. Aeropostale, Gap, Banana Republic, and Chico's have all done really well for us. Since we are so close to the US, most of our customers already know what the brand represents; therefore, it is easier for me to bring them here. Some brands that are of particularly high quality, but remain unknown in Mexico, do not perform well as people are unfamiliar with their message. You have to build a brand in order for it to work. </p><h4>How do you anticipate your financial services offering performing with Fabricas de Francia?</h4><p>The key for Fabricas de Francia to work, after opening up with 5,000 credit card holders, is being the first credit issuer for that segment. People are loyal to the credit card, because it is sometimes the only card to have been issued to them. Having said that, the fiscal reforms and new approach that the government has taken will affect the use of the credit card in Mexico for us and everyone else. Cash is becoming more important in Mexico, which is not necessarily a good thing. In 2014, cash and debit claimed a major chunk out of credit, and we see the same thing happening in 2015 although we do anticipate it leveling out. </p><h4>When opening a new store what strategy do you follow?</h4><p>Before we open a store, we make a comprehensive demographic study taking into account income per capita to fully grasp the location's potential as that is the driving force. There is a great deal of development going on today, such as the construction of new malls, and occasionally we may not secure our primary choice for a new location. We therefore take the list of options as a guide, and understand that our primary choice may not be available to us. Our upcoming projects are opening in areas where we already have stores, but we are closely monitoring the local demographics.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year, Mexico and the European Union celebrate the 15th anniversary of the signing of their Free Trade Agreement. What have been its main achievements?</h4><p>The past 15 years have been highly beneficial for both of us under this agreement. In just 15 years we have tripled our trade value, reaching $65 billion in 2014. The EU is now Mexico's third largest trade partner after the United States and China. Nearly 40% of all foreign direct investment in Mexico is derived from the European Union. We are the second largest investor in Mexico after the US. In 2014, the amount of accumulated EU foreign direct investments in Mexico reached $145 billion. With all this, our economies have grown increasingly connected to one other. The main achievement of our partnership goes beyond trade, however, as the Free Trade Agreement is a part of a wider Global Agreement covering political dialogue and cooperation. In particular, we have enhanced our cooperation on human rights, drug trafficking, education and climate change action. We have also established several lines of contact at the governmental, parliamentary and at civil society levels, all of which help in fostering integration. </p><h4>What political and commercial areas should Mexico and the EU work on to boost international cooperation?</h4><p>We need to increase cooperation in several areas: research and development, renewable energy and energy security, international migration and organized crime, including drug trafficking. Security is a priority for us all, and we must cooperate more on this. We commend Mexico for its decision to resume participation in UN peacekeeping operations in Haiti and in the Western Sahara. We are convinced that we can cooperate and make strides together in improving international security and that in this way we will be able to do more together in crisis management operations. Concerning trade and investment, once the process begins to modernize the trade pillar of our Global Agreement, the specificities will be left to the negotiating teams. There is no doubt that in this increasingly interconnected world—and with our economies increasingly interconnected too--we will aim for ambitious targets that are mutually beneficial. We want to go beyond current WTO levels, reducing non-tariffs barriers, while still ensuring the protection of our citizens. We have to address public procurement and investment protection and we will need to have a new chapter on intellectual property that includes commitments on geographical indications. And of course, we will have to ensure a model of sustainable development that protects workers and the environment.</p><h4>What will the EU's approach towards the Latin American region in the coming years be and what role will Mexico play in that regard?</h4><p>We had the opportunity to discuss this thoroughly this month at the EU-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) Summit. Europe and Latin America share deep-rooted bonds. Our approach to Latin America will be that of a relationship between equals, where we can take advantage of mutual benefits at all levels and where both regions assume their responsibilities towards one another and towards the rest of the world. We want to focus on building a partnership for the next generation by building closer economic links and reinforcing political dialogue. The EU is Latin America's second trade partner overall, after the United States. We are also the biggest investor in the region. Our stock of FDI there is larger than our stocks in Russia, China and India combined. We are interested in taking the next step, as we want to strengthen our bonds and we believe Mexico is the right partner to help us do this. Mexico plays a crucial role in increasing cooperation and relations with Latin America. It can be one of our ports of entrance to an even more beneficial bi-regional relationship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mexico is the OECD member nation to have carried out the largest number of reforms in recent years. How will these reforms make the Mexican economy more attractive to international investment?</h4><p>The ambitious package of reforms known as the “Pacto por México" is aimed at returning the country to a stronger growth path. Major structural measures have already been legislated to improve competition, education, energy, the financial sector, labor, infrastructure, telecommunications and the tax system. Implementation has started in earnest, and if done so to the letter, these reforms could increase trend per capita GDP growth by as much as one percentage point annually over the next 10 years, with the energy reforms having the most front-loaded effects, and the education reforms more lasting effects over the years to come. Further reforms, including that of the judiciary, health sector and agriculture, could raise growth, by an additional one-percentage point, suggesting that GDP growth could reach an annual pace of 5%. This stronger income growth would create a larger and more lucrative domestic market, which combined with ongoing efforts to facilitate market access, would render the market increasingly attractive for international investors. </p><h4>According to the OECD, Mexico's GDP will grow 3-4% this year. What do you see as the main challenges to achieving that growth, and how should the country address them?</h4><p>One main risk for the OECD's outlook comes from the pace of withdrawal of US monetary policy accommodation, which could trigger market instability. Withdrawal would affect Mexico, along with other emerging market economies and increase long-term interest rates and asset price volatility. However, Mexico's financial markets showed more resilience during previous episodes than did other emerging markets, suggesting that its sound macroeconomic framework could absorb external shocks. Another risk comes from a possible further decline in oil prices. Though Mexico's federal budget is well protected in the short term from such decline through various hedging mechanisms, in the medium term it will be significantly affected by lower oil prices, and fiscal adjustment is required. There are also upside risks, notably a stronger US recovery, yet the balance of risks remains tilted toward the downside. This underlines the need to further strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals and maintain financial buffers to better face possible periods of financial volatility. </p><h4>One of the main challenges of Mexico's economy is achieving inclusive growth. In that regard, what impact will the reforms have to reduce inequality in the country?</h4><p>The government has introduced major reforms to make growth more inclusive, reduce poverty and income inequality and encourage operating in the formal sector. Some of these policies build on past measures; such as the conditional cash transfer program Oportunidades/Prospera. Reforms to improve the quality of and access to education will also make growth more inclusive and raise Mexico's long-term growth. If these reforms reach their full potential, they will help Mexicans to live better lives. It will be particularly important for the programs put forward by the government to provide universal pensions and unemployment insurance be approved by lawmakers. If adopted, they will enhance protection against income losses. Universal health coverage has been achieved with Seguro Popular. However, not all families have access to quality care, making it a challenge for both parents and children to live healthy lives. While giving access to high-quality care to all families will increase health spending, much could be done to improve the efficiency of the current system.</p><h4>Mexico has developed a large skilled labor force. How has that made it a more competitive and appealing address for international investment?</h4><p>The Mexican economy is very open to world markets and hosts many modern firms, notably in the sectors of aerospace, automobiles, foods and drinks, which employ highly skilled and well-educated workers. Nonetheless, this accounts for a relatively small part of the economy and is highly concentrated in a few regions. Despite important improvements made in recent decades, Mexico's educational system needs to do more to increase growth and reduce inequalities. While today nearly all children between the ages of 5 and 14 are in school, the quality of education remains well below OECD average. To address this challenge, the Mexican administration has introduced important reforms, including Constitutional amendments to raise educational outcomes by improving Mexico's teaching profession. These reforms are only the beginning of a broader and deeper transformation of the educational system that should help enhance the skills of Mexico's workforce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key priorities for 2015 and what goals would you like to achieve once the “Sexenio" finishes in 2018? </h4><p>In a globalized world, foreign policy is the tool for identifying opportunities and steering clear of the risks any country faces. Mexico's foreign policy priorities hinge on the country's own growth and development and must contribute to achieving an economically prosperous country. Central and North America, as well as the Caribbean, carry special weight for us. With the Caribbean nations, we have discussed how to increase agricultural productivity and improve cooperation on energy issues. In Central America, our dialogue is centered on economic growth, infrastructure, better standards of living and social inclusion. Mexico, the US and Canada have built one of the most integrated regions in the world. Through the Pacific Alliance, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico are pushing for greater mobility of persons, capital, goods and services. We are also aware of the potential of the Asia Pacific region, and Europe has been a source of long-term productive investment. Our foreign policy toward the Persian Gulf region has focused on increasing our presence there, and collaborating in areas such as renewable energy and education. We seek greater cooperation with African nations, and to that end we are expanding our diplomatic presence in the continent. By 2018, we see Mexico as a country that is robustly contributing to cooperation and governability in the world on a global scale. </p><h4>What is your outlook on the APEC forum? What steps should Mexico take to make the region more appealing for international trade with Asia? </h4><p>Mexico will continue its active engagement in APEC, as the forum is a gateway to Asia-Pacific economies. We will work on a feasibility assessment of a Free Trade Agreement of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). In the longer-term, Mexico's areas of interest are integration of SMEs into the global economy and structural reforms. </p><h4>This year marks the 15th anniversary of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Mexico and the EU. What are the main achievements of this agreement? </h4><p>The rationale behind negotiating the FTA between Mexico and the EU was to increase trade and investment flows by allowing preferential access to new markets while fostering strategic alliances between economic actors. The EU stands as Mexico's third largest trading partner, and over the last 15 years, exchanges between Mexico and the EU more than tripled, from $18 billion to $65 billion. The EU is a strategic ally, a technological development pole, and the home of important firms in the automotive, aeronautical, and pharmaceutical industries, which are crucial for Mexico's development. </p><h4>What role should Mexico play to spearhead a larger integration between Latin America and its English-speaking neighbors? </h4><p>Because of its geographic location and socio-cultural ties, Mexico can act as a bridge between Latin America and the US. Mexico has played an important role in accompanying US efforts to promote closer ties with the region, particularly with Central America and Cuba. Regarding Central America, Mexico has engaged and supported the Alliance for the Prosperity of the Northern Triangle, through which the United States is seeking to boost the productive sector and improve security in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. We are working on the construction of a Central American gas pipeline, which will improve energy infrastructure in the region and create better opportunities for citizens. </p><h4>What policies were taken in 2014 to remain on track for the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) target of 84% for 2015?</h4><p>Mexico has succeeded in achieving meaningful progress in the MDGs, as the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day has been halved. Primary education is now universal and youth illiteracy was reduced to 1.4% in 2012. In healthcare, malaria is close to being eradicated in Mexico. Most people now have access to piped drinking water. In terms of gender equality, women's representation in Congress has increased: in 2012, women held 30% of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the energy reform, and how has it made Mexico a more attractive address for FDI in that sector?</h4><p>For decades there were barriers to foreign investment in the Mexican energy sector. However, the recent energy reform opened up a large, attractive sector to foreign investors. This reform means that for the first time in over 75 years, private companies may participate in Mexico's energy sector. The reform includes a new regulatory framework for the electricity industry, consequently opening up power generation and commercialization to third parties. Our country's current legal framework gives certainty to investors and has bolstered FDI into Mexico. Citibank estimates suggest that as a result of the energy reform over $40 billion in foreign investment will arrive in Mexico between 2015 and 2019. In the midst of this promising panorama, there are four main opportunity areas in the Mexican energy value chain: exploration and production; refining and natural gas processing; transmission, storage, and distribution; and commercialization and services. Mexico's energy sector is undergoing a major transformation. It was often regarded as one of the most closed energy sectors in the world; however, today we are one of the most attractive global destinations for investments in the industries that make up this key sector.</p><h4>What strategies is ProMéxico following to internationalize Mexican SMEs and increase their competitiveness in the global market?</h4><p>ProMéxico was created in 2007 with a mandate to fulfill three principal promotion goals: the attraction of FDI, the exports of Mexican products and services, and the internationalization of national companies. ProMéxico understands internationalization as the promotion of and support to Mexican firms, or their subsidiaries, so that they have a productive or sales arm abroad that they can use to place their products and services on foreign markets. The internationalization department was created at ProMéxico in 2012 to fulfill this mandate, seeking to contribute to the country's economic development by promoting the benefits of internationalization, identifying, following-up, and supporting projects by Mexican firms interested in operating abroad. Since the creation of the internationalization department at ProMéxico, contact has been established with 1,173 people interested in learning about the internationalization support offered by the institution, 621 out of these were companies. This has led to 426 internationalization projects. The general strategy of ProMéxico is to drive Mexico and its industries to increase their standing on the world stage. </p><h4>In addition to the well-known automotive, aerospace, and energy industries, what sectors of the economy have a stronger potential to grow in the mid-term?</h4><p>ProMéxico's focus sectors have a notable impact on the country's competitiveness, job creation, capacity building for knowledge and innovation, and on the consolidation of Mexico as an indispensable link in global value chains. This also implies a focus on new opportunities. For example, in the agrifood sector Mexico holds a position of significant leadership. We are the top exporter of avocados, beer, and mangoes, among many other products; we are also one of the leading exporters of strawberries, green leafy vegetables, limes, peppers, and watermelons; in addition, we are the second-largest supplier to the US and the third-largest producer of processed foods in America. Another sector that has substantially increased its competitiveness in recent years is creative industries. Currently, Mexico is the principal exporter of creative goods in Latin America, and we possess the most significant pool of technological talent in the region; our country has become the most competitive destination in America for the development of software, video games, and multimedia, and as a result we are the sixth-largest exporter of animation and digital content in the world. One of the industries with multiple strengths is the health sector. On the one hand, the country has a number of export advantages when compared with other countries, and on the other, Mexico has become fertile soil for new productive investments. Mexico is also making advances in the medical tourism, medical devices, and biotechnology industries, to mention but a few. Mexico is the second-largest pharmaceuticals market in Latin America and a major producer as well. Currently, 20 of the world's top 25 pharmaceutical companies have operations in Mexico, a presence that has increased in recent years. This makes the country one of the leading centers for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you think needs to be done before the end of Pena Nieto's six-year term for the economy to grow by more than 3%?</h4><p>The reforms initiated by Peña Nieto have led to long-term structural improvements in the Mexican economy, and having solidified the national economic foundations of the country, they have enabled better growth figures than would otherwise have been expected. For years, the task at hand was to initiate financial and regulatory reforms to open up the economy so that it fosters greater efficiency, dynamism, and competitiveness, and that is exactly what we have achieved since 2012. When you consider the challenges and difficulties the world economy has faced in the last few years, and how it has affected other Latin American countries, Mexico has emerged relatively well. </p><h4>How have the reforms transformed Mexico over the past few years?</h4><p>The reforms continue to have an impact, which is becoming more ingrained as time passes. Today, we can already see some of the direct benefits of those reforms. One example is in electricity costs for companies in the manufacturing sector, which have been reduced by 18 - 26%, depending on the type of enterprise and segment. One can imagine how important these savings are for companies that have heavy energy needs, be they cement, petrochemicals, or the iron and steel businesses. This has also had a significant effect on consumer savings, thanks to a decline in long distance rates and greater competition in the telecommunication sector following our reforms. There has been a big increase in FDI in the last two years as a result of these telecom reforms, with players such as AT&amp;T and Huawei investing up to $1 billion and $1.5 billion in Mexico respectively. We have seen similar levels of foreign investment in the oil and gas sector. </p><h4>What potential does the Asia-Pacific region have for Mexico, and how important is the Pacific Alliance for Mexico?</h4><p>Traditionally, Mexico has always looked first and foremost to North America. We continue to try to and deepen our relations within North America, where have created an integrated economic zone among the three nations (Canada, the United States and Mexico) where value chains have become stronger than ever, for example, Mexican manufacturing exports incorporate a 37% of US value added. Looking South, the aim is to further integrate and improve economic and trade relations within Latin America. The Pacific Alliance countries represent about half of all commerce in Latin America, receive around 40% of all FDI in the region, and if considered as a single unit it would represent the seventh largest economy in the world. Looking further West, we are participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which has gained renewed relevance as of late and has enabled Mexico to shift more attention and emphasis to the Asian and Pacific region. Looking at NAFTA, we believe there is a need to modernize and update NAFTA, which is already more than 20 years old, especially in relation to various sectors, like trade in electronic goods. With Europe, we were one of the first Latin American countries to sign a free trade agreement with the EU, and thus we need to modernize and update the terms of that agreement so as to improve trade flows between Europe and Mexico. </p><h4>What measures is the Ministry of the Economy taking to support the growth and development of SMEs in Mexico?</h4><p>One of the president's campaign commitments was to create the National Institute for Entrepreneurs. The institute offered a fund for young entrepreneurs to help them get their businesses off the ground and promote growth. Around $1 billion has been put aside for this task, helping promote and support entrepreneurs and SMEs throughout Mexico. About 40% of funds have gone to SMEs, with the rest going to truly innovative enterprises and entrepreneurs who need support to grow their business into a viable SME. The institute works with the private sector to help integrate SMEs into the value chain, to help them export their products, and to help provide training, consulting and other services so that they can succeed as businesses and also help create a nationwide network where ideas and strategies can be discussed and interchanged.</p><h4>In which sectors have you seen the most FDI?</h4><p>Before NAFTA was signed in 1994, average annual FDI in Mexico was somewhere in the region of half a billion dollars annually. After NAFTA was signed that figure was at around $1 billion a year until 2012. Under the administration of Pena Nieto, that figure now stands at $33 billion. The dynamics of foreign direct investment has been transformed with reforms in Mexico. The most direct effects are in the telecommunications and energy sector. Examples of it are Huawei´s and AT&amp;T communications announcements, the Round One and the estimation of everything that will come in the oil sector. Mexico has a great advantage, the access to the North American market, which is privileged. It allows us to move into production schemes in the field of foods and beverages that not only satisfy the national market but also the international market.</p><h4>With the huge increase in foreign investment in Mexico, what has the government done to share new opportunities evenly with all states in the federation?</h4><p>Naturally the investments have been directly tied to which parts of Mexico have the best capacity to attract those investments, which states have the best infrastructure, human capital, resources, access to roads, ports, logistical networks, offer a good standard of living for foreign expats looking to relocate there, provide security, good schools and health facilities. So obviously, a lot of those investments are going to Northern, Central, and Western Mexico. But, ultimately, we aim to transform the South of the country and make it a bigger economic player. In line with this objective, the President has outlined a plan to establish “Strategic Economic Zones" in Southern states, and also major infrastructural projects to develop ports, roads, and logistical networks so as to better connect and integrate southern Mexico into the national economy and also the regional economy. The aim is to do away with this image of one Mexico with two economies, one super connected, efficient, advanced, industrialized, and the other remaining a stark contrast to that. </p><h4>What other objectives would you like to see done before the end of this Presidential term?</h4><p>One of our big challenges has been to balance sustainability with our objectives for steady, long-term growth and job creation. For this, we have had to ensure that we can constantly add value into the public and economic value chain. About 33% of the Mexican economy is completely integrated into the global economy, producing top quality products through highly advanced, efficient, and competitive businesses; another portion of the economy is comprised of the traditional economy, with low productivity, difficulty in creating new jobs, and the inefficient use of resources and capital. This means providing incentives to actors and businesses in the first group to deepen and widen their participation in the national economy, while the other businesses are backed by associations and funds like the National Institute for Entrepreneurs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Ties that Bind]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-ties-that-bind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><em></em>The ties that bind our countries, Mexico and Spain, are founded on solid bases and multiple aspects, which have been signaled and valued frequently, not only during my recent state visit, but throughout history. Our economic, commercial and business relations are nourished by affinities and shared interests that have grown steadily for the benefit of our societies. </p><p>The economic progress that we have generated together represents a clear, positive endorsement of the favorable state of our relations. Despite the economic hindrances experienced in our countries, trade and collaboration remain constant to the maximum level and are bolstered continuously. <br>In times of international economic turmoil, all efforts aimed at creating value, employment, and promoting business to benefit general welfare are paramount. Our bilateral association acquires special value and becomes mutually beneficial. Spain and Mexico initiated a process of developing commercial and economic relations during the 1990s, which has led to the consolidation of Mexico as a first level commercial partner for Spain. It represents our most important market in Ibero-America and a priority destination for our investments, which has positioned Spain as the second largest investor on a global scale. The bilateral commercial flow between our countries was almost $9.86 billion in 2014. </p><p>Mexico is the primary destination for our exports in Ibero-America, the sixth destination in the world after Europe and fifteenth in absolute terms. Spain is the foremost buyer in the European Union for Mexico, and fourth overall. The contribution from Spanish companies is evident when we consider there are 5,300 Spanish businesses operating in Mexico, with more to open in the near future. <br>Spanish companies generate wealth, employment and become integrated with Mexico and its society. They have a vocation for excellence and leadership, and have a presence in both traditional and innovative sectors in the Mexican economy. Mexican and Spanish companies comprise an excellent binomial unit in terms of work and results. </p><p>This compilation of data does not refer only to large companies and well-known investments, as a considerable number of services and products are offered by Spanish SMEs established in the country. In some cases they have been attracted by the success of the large companies, while the visible process of the internationalization of our economy has lured other companies, which is paramount given the current economic circumstances. They represent companies fully compromised in creation of value, employment and opportunities for all, both in Mexico and Spain. </p><p>In that regard, we can attest to the high number of Spanish firms in Mexico that have joint strengths and abilities with Mexican partners. The rising interest of Mexican companies to invest Spain is worth highlighting. It represents a very positive sign of the high degree of integration that our economies have achieved. Mexico is the second non-European investor in Spain and the sixth on an international scale. Spain is truly the ideal platform to expand towards the most promising markets in the world. It represents a global reference for infrastructure, and many high-technology multinationals are based in our country. Many Mexican firms have understood this situation and are investing in the country. </p><p>The Spanish Chamber of Commerce recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. It has operated continuously in Mexico for over a century and is excellent proof of business cooperation, becoming the cornerstone of our bilateral relations. The Chamber of Commerce has acted as a place for business encounters and promotion, ideal to increase commercial trade, investments and all types of associations between companies in both countries. We have a future full of opportunities ahead, here in Mexico, Spain, and together in the rest of the world. Let us strengthen the excellent momentum our current relations are experiencing and let it continue onwards in every perspective. </p><p><em>Adapted from a speech delivered by HM The King of Spain during his official visit to Mexico in 2015.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How would Costa Rica benefit from becoming a member of the Pacific Alliance?
</h4><p>
	Regional economic integration is an essential element for our countries to progress towards greater economic and social development and better quality of life. In this framework, the Pacific Alliance should be seen as an alternative to propel growth and development, based on increasing the competitiveness of the economies concerned, and a deep integration that transcends the purely commercial aspect. This initiative offers the opportunity to establish strategic partnerships that favor the development of investments, increase real and effective competition, improve productivity and the competitiveness of goods and services, and facilitate commerce between countries, fostering better integration with other regions. Costa Rica has closely followed the Pacific Alliance as it gradually approached the initiative. As with other member countries of the Pacific Alliance, our country offers a pro-business investment environment that we continue to work on in order to improve and strengthen.
</p><h4>
	The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Costa Rica and Mexico came into effect in 1995. Looking back, how has this agreement encouraged commerce between the nations and what have been its main achievements?
</h4><p>
	The treaty contributed towards the increase of the total commerce between the countries, bringing greater commercial and competitive opportunities to the productive sector, and also foreign direct investment. Mexico constitutes a relevant market for our country, as it is the main destination for exports products such as palm and almond oil, and machinery and equipment for preparing fur and leather. Since 1995, the number of companies to export to Mexico has risen from 65 to 165 in 2014. At the same time, this country is one of the most important suppliers of diverse products, including inputs that increase the competitiveness of national production. Historically, Mexico has been one of the main investors in Costa Rica. During the past decade, it has represented about 5.2% of FDI. In 2014, Mexican investment reached a total of $132.7 million, destined mainly for service sectors and real estate. In July 2013, the FTA between Central America and Mexico came into effect. This converges the already existing FTAs between the two regions and it also creates an FTA in which Central American countries can accumulate origins in their exports to Mexico, which empowers its comparative advantages.
</p><h4>
	Mexico also has an FTA with US and Canada, which has encouraged commerce with its northern neighbors. To what extent is Mexico seen as a point of entry to these markets?
</h4><p>
	In the case of Costa Rica, there is an FTA with Canada that has been in effect since 2002. There is also an FTA from 2009 between the US, Central America and Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR). Historically, the US has been the main commercial associate of Costa Rica and it still is even though its participation has been moderated as a result of a diversification of Costa Rica's foreign commercial balance. In regards to Canada, parts of Costa Rica's exports arrive to that market through distributions networks based in the US.
</p><h4>
	During the past years, Mexico has gone through several reforms in order to stimulate its economy. In what areas of the Mexican economy do you think there will be more presence of Costa Rican companies in the next year?
</h4><p>
	Amongst the main productive sectors of Costa Rica that show a growing presence in the Mexican economy since 2011 are agrifood, metal-mechanical, textiles, leather and footwear, livestock, plastics, electrical and electronics, paper and cardboard, chemicals, agriculture, transport material, furniture, non-metallic mineral products, medical and precision equipment.

What have been the milestones of this agreement and how has it benefited those Chilean companies to have done business in Mexico over the years? </h4><p>Since the signing of NAFTA in 1999, Chilean companies have achieved expanded access to the Mexican market. Far beyond trade in goods, the FTA includes subjects such as investment, intellectual property, air transport services, trade in services, public procurement, and financial services. The signing of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in 2006 came to strengthen and deepen the bilateral relations. The EPA has three pillars: a political dialogue, which is channeled through the Commission for Political Affairs and Association Council; a business relationship, whose centerpiece is still the FTA; and cooperation, implemented by the Commission on Cooperation and Joint Cooperation Fund Chile - Mexico.</p><h4>In your speech at the 24th Ibero-American Summit, you pointed out that inequality is the main threat for social cohesion and economic growth in Latin America. In what areas could Mexico and Chile work together to close that gap? </h4><p>Inequality is undoubtedly the biggest obstacle in our societies to achieving development. Both Chile and Mexico are actively working to reduce inequality and generate social inclusion through reform of our domestic policies. The main transformations are taking place in education, health and gender equality. This requires an increase in public spending, such that both countries are implementing tax reforms backed by fiscal sustainability. Educational reform has also taken center stage in the fight against inequality, and we are working on a reform that provides citizens with a less-segregated and higher-quality education, especially by strengthening the public system. Concerning gender, both Chile and Mexico are developing active policies as part of international organizations such as UN Women, Commission on the Legal and Social Status of Women, and the Equal Future Partnership Initiative, among others. In this context, our country recently established the Ministry of Women, committed to moving towards balanced gender participation in the areas of political and economic decision, in order to reduce underrepresentation while improving economic autonomy. The struggle against inequality is an arduous task, which is all the more reason for countries to work in tandem, both in the exchange of experience in public policies and modalities of South-South Cooperation.</p><h4>Chile and Mexico are part of the APEC forum, and are both strong exporting economies. What will be the importance of the Pacific Rim in terms of foreign trade? </h4><p>Chile has a strong interest in the Pacific region, for its current importance and future potential. It is the most dynamic economic region in the world, with 40% of the world's population, 57% of global GDP and 49% of global trade. Asia, both for Chile and Mexico, is an increasingly important market. This is reflected in the active participation of the two in various initiatives such as the PA and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). We have also signed trade agreements with several regional countries such as Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei. Chile will continue to strengthen economic and trade links with Asia Pacific. It is currently negotiating a trade agreement with Indonesia and deepening the partial agreement with India. With the joint efforts of 12 countries in this region, including Chile and Mexico, toward concluding negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership Economic Strategic Agreement (TPP), we will have access to the wide coverage of products and disciplines covered, as it is the most important and ambitious trade negotiation. In this regard, we must consider that the TPP will cover over 500 million people, representing about 7% of the world's population, and with whom Chile currently has a trade of nearly $46 billion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector embarks on a new phase of reform through HAAD's five-year strategic plan, how do you characterize the importance of the Health Authority's role within the sector?</h4><p><span></span>The HAAD is the regulatory body of the healthcare sector for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and ensures excellence in healthcare for the community by monitoring the health status of the population. HAAD defines the strategy for the health system, the health status of the population, and the performance of the system. In addition, HAAD shapes the regulatory framework for the health system, inspects against regulations, enforces standards, and encourages adoption of best practice and performance targets by all healthcare service providers in the Emirate. HAAD also drives programs to increase awareness and adoption of healthy living standards among the residents of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in addition to regulating scope of services, premiums and reimbursement rates of the health system in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>How do you face maintaining international best practices and evidence-based clinical best practices with an expenditure that keeps going up each year?</h4><p>This is a challenge being faced in almost every country around the world, not just in Abu Dhabi or the region. The goal is to monitor and improve access, quality, and control cost of care. Our five-year strategy is a very robust document that has had stakeholder involvement and consensus throughout.</p><h4>What are the key objectives laid out in HAAD's five-year strategy?</h4><p>Improving the availability and access to a full spectrum of health care services across the entire Emirate is a key priority. We have developed both the Health Statistics reports and the Capacity Master Plan, which use data to identify capacity gaps, enabling us to determine how best to fill them—be it through private or public sector investment—with avoidance of duplicated efforts. Ultimately, this will minimize the need for patients to seek medical treatment abroad, which has a significant financial impact, as well as improve access to care in rural areas. Currently, under-serviced areas include intensive and critical care medicine, emergency care, neonatology, pediatrics, oncology, orthopedics, rehabilitation and psychiatry. Sub-specialty gaps also exist in pediatrics and pediatric surgery, as well as adult sub-specialties such as neurosurgery, plastics, and surgical oncology. It is imperative that we are transparent about what services are lacking in order to encourage investors to participate in those areas. Another important element in elevating the quality of care is the implementation of initiatives to attract, train, and retain healthcare professionals, with a specific focus on increasing the number of Emiratis in the sector. Currently, there is high medical staff turnover and few Emirati physicians and nurses. This must be addressed if we are to create a sustainable industry. We are working with institutions like SEHA, Tawteen Council, and the Higher Colleges of Technology to develop programs with this aim. UAE University already has a medical school in Al Ain and Khalifa University is planning to establish one as well. Sheikha Fatima College of Health Sciences has also expanded to provide degree programs in fields including nursing and paramedics. The next priority of our strategy is emergency preparedness. We were under heavy pressure during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-COV) in 2012, but our systems were able to cope with it very well and contain the infection. We optimized the way that the hospitals dealt with patients who had the virus. Thankfully, we have had zero cases of Ebola, but several suspected cases were managed according to international best practice. The final priority is public health, where we go by the adage that prevention is better than cure. A healthy diet and lifestyle is important, and that applies to non-communicable disease. Tackling smoking is an important part of this. Abu Dhabi has successfully hosted the World Congress for Tobacco or Health in March 2015. For communicable disease, vaccines are essential. The Emirate is now going through a revaccination of Polio and Measles through a nationwide campaign to make sure we have 100% participation. In a very short period of time, Abu Dhabi has evolved to the point of 100% compliance with an e-claims system, ensuring that all patient interactions with health care providers are recorded electronically. We are still optimizing and fine-tuning the system, with the most recent changes encompassing the introduction of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). However, the continued enhancement of our health care informatics and e-health platform will enable further exchange of data among providers, which will then give us the ability to achieve our goals on our specified priority areas of focus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Today, the ties that bind the British and Mexican people are stronger than ever. Whether in business, government, education, science, sport, culture, trade, in fighting international crime, promoting human rights, or protecting the urban and natural environment, I am struck by the fascination that we hold for each others' culture—and by the energy and goodwill that are generated when we work together.</p><p>I could not be more pleased to have joined with President Enrique Peña Nieto last year in order to celebrate the fact that this already excellent relationship will be further enhanced over the course of 2015 through both the Year of the UK in Mexico and the Year of Mexico in the UK.</p><p>The great Mexican writer, Octavio Paz, wrote movingly of the themes that connect people and nations: “Today we all speak, if not the same tongue, then at least the same universal language." How fitting this line seems in light of the friendship between our two nations. </p><p>I am struck by how likeminded Mexico and the UK are in a variety of ways. On the international stage on many fronts, we are close diplomatic partners, and Mexico's ability to apply calm neutrality and a spirit of friendly solidarity to the global challenges of our day is widely admired, no more so than in the UK. </p><p>And we will need Mexican leadership more than ever as we approach those other important aspects of 2015—the formation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Climate Change negotiations which culminate in Paris in December 2015. I think it is no exaggeration to say that 2015 provides a truly critical and perhaps our last chance to map out a sustainable future for mankind. </p><p>I am hugely encouraged to know that Britain and Mexico will continue to be close partners in this endeavor, which could not be more important for ourselves and for those who came after us.<br>The friendship between the United Kingdom and Mexico dates back many centuries. The archives of the Inquisition record travelers from the British Isles arriving in the earliest days of New Spain, in the 16th century. It seems to me as though we are experiencing a new impetus in our relationship, with more of us visiting, working and studying in each other's countries than ever before. The commitment the two governments have made to achieve mutual recognition of educational qualifications will boost this trend further. <br>The people of the United Kingdom are more intrigued by Mexican culture than ever before. We are amazed by Mexico's biological and cultural diversity, the strength of your indigenous cultures, the resilience of their agricultural crops and techniques, and the vibrancy of your music, art, film, and culture. <br>In 2015, our two countries aim to generate a still greater appreciation of what each has to offer the other and, in doing so, foster a momentum that will sustain an even closer, more dynamic partnership for years to come. My wife and I hope that our visit to Mexico will help to launch this process. <br>Indeed, 2015 will provide a feast of activities that celebrate our relationship, whether in the arts, business, education, science, or innovation. The cooperation between the United Kingdom and Mexico is of the greatest importance. Together, I know we will build a legacy that will last well beyond 2015, into the centuries to come. </p><p><em>Adapted from a speech given in November 2014 at the Mexican Palacio Nacional for the inauguration of the 2015 Year of Mexico in the UK and the UK in Mexico.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>The past year has been a time of contrasts. On the one hand, it was the year when Mexico dared to change after approving 11 structural reforms, which were designed to accelerate national development. In addition, certain important infrastructure works got underway, while social programs were improved and their reach widened. These changes were socially crucial, as hundreds of thousands of new formal jobs were created.</p><p><span></span>But 2014 was a difficult year for Mexico as well. The violence perpetuated by organized crime once again hit the country. We feel pain, indignation, and anger. A legitimate demand for justice took shape, questions arose, and requests for transparency were made. </p><p><span></span>The positive and negative experiences of 2014 served as a lesson. Mexico cannot remain the same; the country must continue changing for the better. That is why 2015 requests the best effort from Mexicans. The year demands unity and generosity; team work and perseverance. It is time to uplift the mood, and regain confidence and hope. </p><p><span></span>In 2015, the main priority of my government is to improve the conditions of Mexican families. At the beginning of 2015, the price of electricity decreased nationwide, for Mexican households and businesses alike.</p><p><span></span>The cost of electricity that families incur has finally been reduced due to the energy reform, and as of 2015, there will be no sudden rises in petrol prices. For the first time in five years, no monthly increases in petrol, diesel or gas prices will occur, as stipulated in the fiscal reform.</p><p><span></span>Mexican families will also feel closer as they will not have to pay for long distance calls within the country. The telecommunications reform deemed that all calls placed within Mexico are priced equivalent to a local call. </p><p><span></span>In 2015 the benefits reaped from the reforms will manifest themselves in the everyday lives of all Mexicans, as more than 10 million low income families receive free digital television signals. This initiative constitutes one of the greatest efforts in the world to bring new technologies to every home. </p><p><span></span>Paving new paths of success for Mexican youth, we will open the largest support program for young entrepreneurs in Mexico. We will be able to assist Mexican individuals aged 18 to 30, who intend to open a business or invest in their current endeavors.</p><p><span></span>Additionally, cost-effective residential construction will be propelled, allowing more families to own a home. A package of fiscal and financing measures will be issued to promote home building, which will support overall economic growth.</p><p><span></span>Finally, as of the first day of this year, agricultural activities in Chiapas, Guerrero and Oaxaca have had preferential fiscal treatment.</p><p><span></span>México is a nation united, and we must walk this road together. Employment, development and prosperity must reach every corner of the country; today the south underdeveloped and requires additional support. As a result, three essential economic zones will be established to encourage economic activity and generate employment in Istmo de Tehuantepec, namely the adjacent populations of Lázaro Cárdenas Port, Michoacán, Guerrero and the Chiapas port.</p><p><span></span>The reforms have allowed these seven actions to become a reality, and they are starting to yield the initial benefits. </p><p><span></span>This spells good news for the average family and will add up to a better year for Mexico overall. </p><p><span></span>As President of the Republic, I will continue to work with determination, strength and clarity towards the future, setting all reforms into action. </p><p><span></span>The transformation that has begun represents the most profound change for the country in many years. A shift in the paradigm of this magnitude faces obstacles and resistance, but despite difficulties us Mexicans will do our best to build a better Mexico. </p><p><span></span>I have a firm commitment to fighting corruption and impunity and strengthening transparency. I will approach the people by listening to their needs and finding solutions for their problems together.</p><p><span></span>I am sure that we have the determination to overcome any adversity. With unity and renewed spirits we will prove unreservedly the fortitude and greatness of the Mexican people.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the last decades, pediatrics cancer survival rates have increased tremendously. To what do you attribute CCCL's outstanding survival rate? </h4><p><span></span>CCCL has been here for the past 13 years, during which time we have made several efforts, which is why CCCL is considered a leading regional center in the treatment of cancer in children. Our cure rate is 80%, which also makes us more committed to helping these children. There is a specific ceiling that is covered by the Ministry of Health, while we or any other third party payer has to cover all the balance not covered by the Ministry. We cover 100% of the cost for patients that are not Lebanese or do not have any other payers, and we clarify this to the community immediately in order for them to know that we need this amount of money, which is $15 million per year. Having the mission of treating children with no discrimination and no cost to the parents is challenging, in order to raise the necessary funds. Being affiliated with Saint Jude Research Hospital in Memphis and AUBMC opens doors for research, rigorous treatment protocols, as well as for training facilities and expertise, all of which helps to improve the cure rate. Being at the AUBMC, having access to the highly-trained medical personnel and the psychological and administrative professionals, also plays a major role in having a high recovery rate. Having 13 years of experience, CCCL understands how trends in the healthcare sector are moving, and we are blessed by the support of CCCL's support. Without having had the support of our donors, we would not be here; this is a crucial aspect that we have to highlight all the time. We have the trust of the donors and the commitment of our medical and administrative team, and these are the major factors enabling our commitment to this cause. Sometimes we offer other services, or collaborate with other pediatric cancer centers in Lebanon and the region, in order to help them use these protocols and ensure that the best treatment and protocols are provided to as many children as possible.</p><h4>How does the regional turmoil affect CCCL?</h4><p>In Lebanon, everything affects donations, not only in terms of stability of the country, but also in terms of the economic situation. The past two years have been very challenging, particularly in regards to the Syrian crisis. Our mission is not to refuse children; however, because of the limited capacity the center can accommodate we have collaborated with St. Jude and assigned a specific fund in 2013 solely for the treatment of refugees. The fund was set up to cope with the added pressure and to continue to provide the same treatment for the current patients as well as for the new ones coming from Lebanon. $15 million is a huge amount and cannot be raised only from having events and programs in Lebanon. We have our fundraising programs and in Lebanon to raise more than 70% of the total amount; however, we have a few events that we hold in other countries so we can attract donations to cope with the highest number of patients possible.</p><h4>What are the origins of CCCL patients?</h4><p>We welcome patients regardless of where they are coming from—we do not discriminate, that is our mission. There are no basic restrictions for people residing in Lebanon. Lebanese patients have other party guarantors like the Ministry of Health, and we are very thankful for all of their efforts with their provided services to the Lebanese patient. However, the foreign patients do not have these third-party guarantors and probably the cost will be twice as much than the Lebanese citizen's cost, so we try to maintain a balanced split, and do not increase it more than 25% of the total number of accepted patients in the year. During the past 13 years we have provided consultations and diagnostic tests to more than 4,000 patients, and these play a major role in the treatment because proper diagnoses leads to better cure rates and better survival. Our doors are open to as many patients as we can accommodate, and the provision of the free diagnostic tests and consultations is a major factor. It helps the patients to know, and it helps other doctors to collaborate with the Children Cancer Center in order to follow the same protocols, which are considered some of the best in the world. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the development of the healthcare sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>In comparison with other countries, Lebanon has high levels of expertise in terms of doctors and nurses and the service provided. Regardless of whether or not we have proper infrastructure, in general we are up to the technological systems that are being used all over the world. In addition we have coped with these developments and innovations and still we are considered one of the major destinations for people to get good treatment. Applying AUBMC's accreditation and certifications enables our doctors and nurses to provide the children with proper treatment and services. The Ministry of Health is also doing a great job supporting many hospitals to provide more services to a greater number of people from Lebanon and beyond.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were AIC's main objectives upon its establishment in Kuwait in 2006, and how has the company's investment strategy evolved over the years?</h4><p><span></span>AIC was initially intended as a traditional investment services company, catering for unconnected parties. This purpose was further rethought by AIC's President and other members of the Bukhamseen Group Holding; therefore, entrusting the company with the additional principal objective of becoming the investment arm of the Bukhamseen Holding Group. To that end, the Group's investment activities, then spread across its holdings, became centralized under AIC. Furthermore, members of the family became AIC's shareholders, as the best way for preserving the Group's interest. Clearly, our investment strategy changes according to market developments, but is always based on high-efficiency plans and the safeguard of invested principal. We generally avoid speculation, and rather focus on robust assets with strong fundamentals in specific promising sectors. To date, AIC is operating as a knowledge-based, growth-oriented investment company with the main task of securing the integrity of invested assets and achieving profitability of investments. Currently, it is a boutique investment firm, with sizeable assets under management. Its clients' base encompasses a large number of companies representing several sectors and high net worth individuals. Earning clients' trust was, and still is, AIC's first priority.</p><h4>What is your criteria when assessing lucrative investments for your clients and shareholders?</h4><p>In general, we consider liquidity as an important criterion. Whether it is a portfolio investment, or a direct investment, we are attracted to higher-liquidity investments, as they provide readier access to the invested capital, allowing, for example, earlier reinvestment in other good opportunities. But, although liquidity is important, profitability is paramount. A main element of overall profitability is growth. We favor shares whose total value grows at above-average rates. From the risk management perspective, our focus is on reducing risk systematically at each stage of the investment process. We are also particularly wary of investment risk in volatile markets. Our risk-adjustment model ensures a lower volatility rate for our portfolios compared to the market.</p><h4>What type of clientele does AIC normally work with, and what type of investor would benefit from your expertise?</h4><p>Primarily, AIC clients are our family members; investing with us either in their personal capacity or on behalf of the companies they are heading within the Group. We also service a broad base of corporate entities and high-net-worth individuals. AIC is a boutique investment services company, whose main attributes are to be knowledge based and growth oriented. Its clients are market knowledgeable investors who go by merit-based decisions.</p><h4>How have you seen Kuwait's financial sector develop over the years, and where is there more room for improvement?</h4><p>The financial sector, through enabling capital, is a key backer of the development process. The fact remains, though, that some of the wounds left by the crisis have not yet completely healed. Yet, the potential for improvement is quite strong in Kuwait and neighboring countries. In particular, the Kuwaiti financial system is sizeable and well developed. Besides commercial and specialized banks at the core of the system, it includes financial companies and investment funds. Kuwaiti banks in particular enjoy a high liquidity level, which is a main determinant of growth. Latest market results, this year, revealed strong growth in banking and financial services, with banks being the main driver of growth in the sector.</p><h4>What role do you envisage AIC playing in Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>Since its establishment, it has been imperative for AIC to maintain a strong presence by building up confidence so as to be able to do more for the economy in Kuwait. Looking forward, our role in Kuwait's economic future will stem from our typical mission as an investment company. Our services encompass advising and assisting companies and individuals in market transactions and corporate development. Worth noting is that our corporate finance services always represent a substantial part of our core activities. Our services in this regard encompass mergers and acquisitions, divestures, business valuations and feasibility studies, due diligence, investment review and fairness opinion, capital raising, financial restructuring, and so on, therefore resulting in stronger companies in the State of Kuwait. Added to this is AIC's participation in local and cross-border markets, both at its own corporate level, and on behalf of its clients. We shall continue strengthening our position in local and international markets in what best serves the Kuwaiti economy. It is through these undertakings that AIC plans a wider participation in Kuwait's economic future.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for growth in the GCC region?</h4><p>There are some countries that we seek to invest in and believe are poised for a great future. On the other hand, we seek to divest our positions in other countries where opportunities for gain have eroded. Between both extremes, there are countries where we decided to hold our investment as we foresee an impending market rebound. There are positives to working in GCC countries. In general, our preferences change depending on the sector and the country. In the UAE, we prefer working as a local investor in sectors such as insurance, hospitality, and real estate. In other places, we prefer to be invested in diversified and well-managed companies. Saudi Arabia is a good country to do business in, because of the size of the population, and the presence of economies of scale. We also favor Oman and are studying investment opportunities there. Expanding outside of the GCC, we are looking at Egypt and Turkey. As for Iraq, it is a big market, but still has many unsolved issues.</p><h4>What are AIC's priorities over the next three to five years? Will you be focused on expanding or consolidating your investments, and where do you see the most potential for profit?</h4><p>Our first years were focused on creating a sustainable model. This target has been largely fulfilled, and AIC is currently standing on quite solid bases. Efficiency of operation has been broadly achieved. Currently, our priorities are consolidating the investments we are in, along with building up liquidity for expansion by focusing on operational profit. Furthermore, a main item of focus in our future plan is expanding in new markets in stable regions. We have identified our abilities and are investing accordingly. As already mentioned, we are also increasing our client base. We see the highest potential for profit in keeping up with the implementation of our expansion strategy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We anticipate fewer challenges than in the past few years. We also tend to believe that it will be a very busy year. We will be engaged in building up liquidity, and bringing growth into effective action, namely expanding our presence by opening new markets at the regional level, and increasing our scope of activities, with particular emphasis on generating innovative collective investment schemes. On the macro level, following the legislative approval earlier in 2015 of the broad investment plan for the coming five years (2015-20), as well as the FY15/16 capital spending budget rising notably, it is expected that a solid pace of growth will be driven and supported by public spending. This will pave the way for companies such as AIC to profitably apply their capabilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Under the current government, the budget of the Ministry of Culture (MOC) has risen by 92%. What do you think underlies this notable rise?</h4><p>The total growth of 92% over the past four years was due to several factors. The first is that the president is convinced of the importance of cultural issues, and that we worked on consolidating municipalities that have been victims of violence. Today, we have a social offering by the state in which culture plays an prominent role. This, in a country that wants to achieve peace, is indeed, relevant. The other reason is that I believe we are good executors. The budget that is given to us is executed based on goals and on the period that we were committed to.</p><h4>Between 2010 and 2014, 39 cultural heritage sites have been recovered. What is the MOC's strategy here?</h4><p>We consider the infrastructure as a whole. From the total number of new additions to the cultural infrastructure, 39 are heritage sites and over 290 are renovated buildings. This means that as an infrastructure project, regardless of whether it is a public space, the recovery of a house of culture, a theatre, or the construction of a new library, a dance studio or a music school, has a huge impact on its surroundings. The truth is that it is not only the bricks themselves, but also the content support we provide to these properties. The ultimate use of these properties is also of paramount importance. Hence, it is a project to be considered not merely from an engineering and architectural perspective, but rather as work that bears enormous cultural value in the community.</p><h4>The MOC is focusing on restoring and constructing cultural spaces, such as the Colón Theatre and the National Museum. What makes these projects significant?</h4><p>The property receiving the bulk of the ministry's is the Colón Theatre in Bogotá. In regards to the National Museum, we have been working in two directions. One amounts to new museology, as after nearly 25 years we are rethinking the way in which our heritage museum tells the story of Colombia. We want the story to be more conclusive, we want it to have our original collection, because it is important in the museum, but we also intend for Colombia's history to be told from diverse perspectives where the indigenous and Afro-Colombians are also seen holding a stake in building this country. This is an important issue, and we will open the first room with the new outline toward the end of November 2014. At the same time, we have advanced a number of steps on the legal side to look at the possibilities of expanding the national museum, adjacent to the museum a university and a school. With the support of the Minister of Finance and the President, we have been looking at the possibility of expanding in the near future through the law of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the expansion of the National Museum of Colombia.</p><h4>In what other ways has the MOC helped the tourism sector develop over the past four years?</h4><p>Negotiating agreements with the regions has been important, and our strategic partners include mayors and governors. We believe that having a policy that shows the institutional offer from the Ministry, to both mayors and governors, gives them better access to the resources in a more balanced way. Also when there are proposals from the region, department or municipality that coincide with the ministry's proposals cooperation blossoms. There is a firm commitment to encouraging reading and writing, and the strengthening of public libraries nationwide, as well as to liaising with other ministries such as the Ministry of Education, or even the Ministry of Agriculture, regarding cultural projects in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate Colombia's efforts to improve its international image?</h4><p><span></span>Colombia is improving its image, but we could always do better, although that would require peace sooner rather than later. Violence naturally breeds instability, although a larger budget has been allocated for the promotion of the country, which is significant. </p><h4>What is the state of the tourism industry today?</h4><p>We have not experienced a touristic boom in the country as yet. The government's goal was to receive four million visitors last year. And although 3.8 million arrived, the term 'visitor' means someone who crossed the border, rather than a tourist who spent a significant amount of time in the country. The figure for tourists last year was just 1.75 million, which is the same as in 1982. On the other hand, there are many corporate visitors. This is the inverse of what was happening in 1982. The people who want to discover the country might be mostly from Central and South America. We do have some backpackers and some traveling on into the Amazon.</p><h4>Has Aviatur played an important role in taking the business travel figure to 85%?</h4><p>While that is not our area of operations, business tourism has benefited from the conventions and conferences held in Colombia. For example, in 2013 we organized the Cumbre de las Américas in Cartagena. Attendance was at around 4,500 people, with many the heads of states in attendance. The traffic that goes through travel agencies, however, is primarily people that want to discover different parts of the country. Aviatur has played an important role in the rehabilitation and opening of quality services in a number of national parks, namely Los Nevados Gorgona, Tayrona, Amacayacu, and Otún Quimbaya.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the domestic tourism market?</h4><p>It is important for the number of tourists visiting Colombia to exceed those leave the country. For that, we need peace. There is an imbalance between the two figures. Right now, we are striving to regain this balance. We have a department with 10 people attending to fairs and exhibitions abroad in conjunction with ProExport Colombia, and we have promotional literature in Swedish, Hebrew, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, among others. That said, we will only see the results of this promotion once peace has been achieved, similar to what happened with Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, or Lebanon. </p><h4>How has Aviatur maintained such a high market share in Colombia?</h4><p>I believe that a company is as bad as its worst employee and as excellent as its best collaborator. My job is to understand why mistakes happen and make sure that they aren't repeated. That's the official answer, and is unchanging. Sometimes the solution to a specific problem has been to create a new company or a specialized department; sometimes it's been achieved through technology or better informing our staff, or creating our own training center. For each situation, we have tried to find the right solution. The companies that survive are not the biggest, the best, the most intelligent, the richest, or the most modern; they are those capable of adapting to changes. That is my job, and also to maintain an equilibrium inside the company and between the company and the market place, like the government and customers, staff, shareholders, suppliers, and so on. That's the secret.</p><h4>How are you continuing to expand your presence abroad?</h4><p>We have a strong niche in the market, which we capitalize on through with technology, and we administrate other travel agencies. Our competitors are colleagues, and this is important activity for us. This has grown a lot. We face a challenge to improve our share of the market in ecommerce. Aviatur has the lowest fares and excellent technology. We have to convert about 16% of our customers in order to have a strong showing in ecommerce and online transactions. Our online business is increasing exponentially, which makes it a key component of our job. Customers can buy tickets from Aviatur.com from anywhere in the world, and this will remain the focus over the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How did the company you founded in Medellí­n in the 1990's go on to join forces with Manpower?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>We started the company as a partnership of the founders named UNOA. Our goal was to become the best temporary services company in the world. The most important condition for us was that employees and clients felt it was the best possible environment to work or to have their labor requirements met. As the Colombian market shifted towards globalization, we realized we had to open our company to a new business model. I was approached by Manpower, whose managers liked our business model. They proposed to purchase the company entirely so I sold my shares as a partner, but stayed on as General Manager of Manpower Colombia.
</p><h4>What added value does your company provide to the temporary services industry in the Colombian market?</h4><p>
	We are about to carry out a study on this matter, because it is a difficult variable to assess. When we evaluate the competences of an individual to determine if they fit the required profile, we guarantee better results, and higher productivity, efficiency, and stability if we select the adequate candidate. The individual's vocational strengths will determine their success in any specific position.
</p><h4>In terms of the multinational companies that have entered the Colombian market, how are you covering their employment needs and what are their main requirements? <br>
</h4><p>
	In general terms, the highest demand is from companies that provide services. Technicians, engineers, finance professionals, and commercial and sales staff have the highest demand in the current market. Regarding specific competences, bilingualism is highly valued, as Colombian economic endeavors in general have entered global markets. There is a global necessity for skilled human capital, and it is becoming more evident as time passes and people are choosing to postpone having children until later in life. It will become a challenge to maintain a functional workforce. There is a shortage of skilled labor, Japan being the number one country facing this difficulty, and Colombia occupying ninth place in this ranking.
</p><h4>How is Manpower partnering with educational institutions to reduce the scarcity of skilled human capital?</h4><p>
	We have conducted research on this matter in Colombia and have divulged the results to companies, allowing them to better grasp the importance of diversity to partly solve this issue and participate in inter institutional networks devoted to it. Nonetheless, a long-term program needs to be established by the government to create groups composed of government, companies, and educational institutions, to create comprehensive solutions to confront this shortage of human capital, and define what the profiles Colombia requires are according to the national development plan. This prospective evaluation has to be defined to guide the coming generations when they decide their career paths starting at a young age. Unfortunately, educational institutions create programs according to their demand in terms of revenue, and not in terms of the requirements of the job market in the country.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have been taken to improve the competitiveness and academic strength of Colombia's universities?</h4><p>The strategy of the Ministry of Education aims to improve the quality of the educational provision, by promoting vocational and technical education technology, diverse sources of financing and retention in the education system. According to the National System of Higher Education, SNIES—in 2014, around 2,139,000 students were enrolled in higher education, representing an increase of about 465,000 over the past four years. Today, the country has a gross coverage ratio of close to 47% in higher education; an increase of more than 9pp compared to 2010. All these efforts have positively impacted the poorest parts of society. At present, 80% of new students entering higher education are from households whose income does not exceed three minimum monthly wages. Another of the cornerstones for improving competitiveness is to increase the number of higher education institutions with quality accreditation. The goal for the next four years is to achieve a coverage ratio of 57%, which implies government commitment to create 400,000 new places, of which about 200,000 will be in institutions and/or quality programs. Of the 288 institutions of higher education in the country, 13% (38 IES) have high quality accreditation. Our challenge for 2018 is to increase this high quality coverage from 14.6-20%.</p><h4>What measures is the Ministry of Education taking to ensure that higher education in Colombia is more accessible and equitable?</h4><p>Our master plan for expanding our coverage of quality education has nationwide scope, while on the supply-side we are trying to make education as flexible as possible, through regionalization, its inclusive and intercultural nature, the greater availability of infrastructure, institutional management, and participation in local government. We are providing temporary resources to invest in infrastructure and the training of teachers for doctoral and master's qualifications, which we hope will increase the number of students enrolled. We do this with the support of organizations like Findeter, Icetex, and other government sources. On the demand side, the Ser Pilo Paga program is one of the main strategies and will allow entry to the best quality accredited public and private universities in the country to Colombian students displaying the best academic performance, but without the financial resources to pay tuition. Each year 10,000 young people from poorer backgrounds are expected to enter higher education institutions with quality accreditation, and by 2018 we expect it to have benefited 40,000 Colombians. Another strategy designed by the Ministry of Education to achieve this is “You Choose," an ICETEX program that increases the range of financing on offer for quality higher education by making it more affordable. The student can choose what percentage of their student loans is paid for during their college career, again providing greater flexibility.</p><h4>The government has recently announced the Catédra para la Paz, or the “Department for Peace Program." What will this program mean in practice?</h4><p>This is a new challenging program that will be pursued in all educational institutions throughout the country, for the training and exercise of human rights and the development of the citizenship skills of students. Consistent with the above, since 2004 Colombia has standards that encourage citizenship skills in all schools nationwide, children learn to resolve their conflicts peacefully, participate democratically and recognize and respect diversity. This amounts to recognition of the utmost importance that education plays in the construction of peace. In this sense, we must clarify that coexistence and peace have always been fundamental to the Ministry of Education and therefore factor in the framework of the Constitution (Articles 22 and 41) of international agreements and human rights' treaties, this sector since 2004 has driven the development of citizenship skills and transverse programs for gender education, the exercising of human rights, environmental education and the promotion of healthy lifestyles in all educational establishments of the country. Working on the development of citizenship skills and the exercise of human rights is the commitment from the education sector to develop citizens capable of analyzing and contributing in collective processes, and of opting for agreements and pacts rather than weapons, that ultimately end conflict. This, in the current circumstances of Colombia, constitutes an urgent challenge that calls for participation throughout society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Universidad del Sinú started out as a modest local school in Córdoba. How has the university expanded to become one of the largest on the Caribbean coast?</h4><p>My father, of Lebanese extraction, initially founded a nocturnal school aimed at lower income individuals that wanted to study in the city of Monterí­a in Córdoba. The school had an agricultural technology program, which was relevant as Córdoba has a strong tradition of activity in that sector. After this he founded a private university in Monterí­a that began with a law program. He contacted the court stenographers in Monterí­a and provided them with scholarships so they could get a law degree. Nowadays, there are a number of different faculties in the university, including health, law, and engineering, and we have around 7,000-8,000 students registered here. It is the third largest business in Córdoba in terms of services offered and revenue. I studied in the US, but upon my return I opened our institution in Cartagena with an ophthalmology program. After careful consideration we decided that Cartagena was the ideal location to internationalize the university. Today, after 14 years the university in Cartagena has around 3,000 students. Cartagena has a major  poverty situation. Small entrepreneurs comprise around 90% of the population in the city, with just 2-3% medium sized enterprises and 7% large companies, mostly multinationals. Health coverage in Colombia has two categories. The first is the subsidized group, which represents around 60-70% of the population who are unemployed and cannot cover their own health expenses. Individuals who pay a percentage of their salary to cover their health costs constitute the second group. They ultimately pay for the health coverage of the subsidized regime. Taking this situation into consideration, and the geographical advantages of the city's location on the coast and status as a popular tourist destination and a hub for industrial activity, we decided that education was necessary to propel the development of the city. The goal is to transform Cartagena into a knowledge-oriented city with 30 universities. We believe it can become a logistics hub, a tourist powerhouse and an attractive destination for the banking sector. The ocean is another important resource, which is why we opened a marine biology program this year.</p><h4>In which faculties are you investing the most resources to encourage economic growth in the city and the region?</h4><p>We have developed the health faculty for which we built specific infrastructure with laboratories for developing biotechnology. The research will be focused on areas such as genetics, immunology, and pharmaceuticals, among others. The building will also be suited to providing medical services. The three main focuses for the health faculty are education, services, and technology, and we will also have start-ups. The new infrastructure will be able to accommodate around 3,000 students and will be opened in a month. We have also started a project to develop a dental clinic for our dentistry program. It will be around 10,000sqm, but our long-term project is to build a mega-hospital for which we have already purchased land. It will include an area which will serve as a free trade zone in addition to being a cluster dedicated to the manufacture of plastics, and this will be adjacent to the educational building.</p><h4>How is the process of internationalization developing at the university?</h4><p>We are a young institution and we believe we must establish the basic structures of the university first. We are improving the infrastructure in Cartagena and Bogotá and are planning to build a hospital and clinics. This constitutes the second phase of the internationalization plan. We aim to boost bilingualism in the region and foster an entrepreneurial culture, but the construction of a solid infrastructural base is important for attracting international students. The building will be inaugurated by the president in August, and it will mark the beginning of a new era for the university.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have led to the University's accreditation as a high-quality educational institution for 10 consecutive years?</h4><p>Our university supports and promotes scientific research, artistic creativity, humanistic education, and research in social and administrative studies. We foster research study in all disciplines, and our university is the national leader in research across all academic spheres. In 2006 the Superior Council established a research policy and, subsequently, the resources for it. At the moment we are allocating approximately $3.29 million a year in the promotion of research at the university. We, therefore, not only demonstrate a superior academic and intellectual pedigree, but also present excellent opportunities for students to participate in scientific, artistic, or humanitarian development. In scientific development, we currently hold 15 patents. We are the second institution nationally after Ecopetrol with internationally registered patents. Ecopetrol, on the other hand, is the largest company in Colombia. This provides the best practical means of demonstrating the quality of our ongoing research. Another important factor is that we are present not only in Cali, but also at branches in eight municipalities of the Valle del Cauca: in Cartago, Caicedonia, Zarzal, Buga, Palmira, Yumbo, Buenaventura, and at one in the north of the region. This allows us to maintain the decentralization and democratization of the university. </p><h4>How is the Universidad del Valle helping regional development?</h4><p>We have a university network geared at regional regeneration, wherein each university showcases its potential, not in order to compete on projects, but also to complement one another. This network includes not only universities, but also entrepreneurs and government bodies, and functions like a virtual space for the knowledge exchange and collaboration of various universities, businesses and state bodies. From this collaboration came the project 'El Centro de Desarrollo Automotriz' that works with different manufacturers of auto parts, and it collaborates with universities in order to establish in the region a center for automotive development and production. Meanwhile, we support an initiative for public healthcare, working with the municipal healthcare department, and on specific regional projects as part of an ongoing relationship. We also maintain close collaboration with different enterprises—this is in fact how our students receive practical work experience.</p><h4>In what areas is the Universidad del Valle focusing its investments?</h4><p>We spend approximately $172.7 million annually. We invest first of all in covering the needs of students, which is why we are the university with the highest levels of student life satisfaction in the country. The university has good restaurants, sports facilities, and venues for students to socialize. We serve between 4,000 to 4,500 dinners per day, 1,000 of which are free. We have professional sports sections and recreational sports for both students and employees. We have a swimming pool with full facilities, a theatre, a gym, dance groups, and bands, among others. We therefore provide our students with a wide range of opportunities to develop themselves both professionally and culturally. Most of Cali's cultural life is concentrated in its universities, ours included. Meanwhile, we have invested about $20 million into equipment for our labs and IT facilities. We also provide students with computers for personal use, such as for writing their theses. We also organize a series of exhibitions, and have our own pinacoteca (art gallery), which is quite extraordinary by Colombian standards. We also boast the best public library in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-knowledge-to-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Colciencias' restructuring affect funding for health, education, and industrial initiatives? </h4><p>Colciencias was restructured back in 2009, when it became an administrative department held by the presidency. The goal was to transform it into a department that would drive development in science, technology, and innovation (STI), in pursuit of national growth by leveraging knowledge economy. However, one of the things that we realized at that time was that we were spending very little in STI. Countries from the OECD all spend more than 2% of their GDP in these three areas. At that time, Colombia was dedicating a mere 0.3% of its GDP to these ends. The public sector realized that it had huge a responsibility in this regard. This launched a debate that culminated in a decision to spend 10% of royalties on STI. </p><h4>What is Colciencias' vision and strategy for the enhancement of STI in Colombia? </h4><p>The main challenge that we face in Colombia today is making STI a bigger part of our national development strategy. Colombia lags far behind the rest of Latin America in this regard. According to the Global Innovation Index, we are currently in seventh place. And while we are ahead in terms of input and ecosystem, we are still second to last in production terms. This means that we need to accelerate our efforts over the coming years. Our strategy for doing so is based on five objectives that are related to the improvement of the ecosystem for STI, the enhancement of our research capabilities and products, the stimulation of innovation in the productive sector, the promotion of a culture that values and manages STI, and the developing individual regions in regards to their capabilities and opportunities. For example, there are huge energy deficits in coastal areas such as San Andrés and Guajira. Guajira has considerable potential with wind and solar energy, and we need to start developing these capabilities. The country cannot risk energy, water, food, or health security. Moreover, we have to use our biodiversity sustainably. Our nation is one of the world's prime examples of biodiversity, but we need to exploit it sustainably in order to comprehensively develop across a range of sectors. Colciencias has twelve national programs, including biotechnologies, health, energy, sea, social science, agriculture, and education. We are trying to raise the discourse within these programs. Key figures from the public sector, such as ministers and vice-ministers, senior academicians, and businessmen are involved in these programs. We want to make ten-year plans for all of them and develop individualized strategies concerning what is required in each in the near future. Colciencias will invest in this, and utilize the money coming from royalties. </p><h4>How do you intend to improve collaboration between Colciencias, public institutions, and the private sector?</h4><p>Our contingencies need to be based on available resources—royalties, Colciencias, and other ministries. If we propose energy projects, the Ministry of Mines and Energy is likely to contribute resources. Another option is international resources through cooperation. We need definite plans that account for our needs, and then relate these to the relevant organizations. Royalties are also critical. However, there is another part of the story. Colombia needs to move forward with money from the private sector as well. We need to find a way to promote the increase in private investment in STI. In some countries, the private sector contributes 60-70% of investment. In Colombia this figure is at just 40% and needs to rise. The financial burden must be a cooperative one shared by the public and private sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Clinica Palermo has undergone various shifts in its managerial structure over recent years. How have these contributed to the capacity of the clinic?</h4><p>When the clinic began operations in 1948, it was administered by the order of sisters, including the general director and administrative team, and only the scientific director has always been a layperson. Initially, the clinic had 80 beds to attend to maternity patients and related surgeries. In 1953 the second building was inaugurated with six floors and close to 200 beds, which is where we are today. This allowed us to provide better offering and specialized services in gynecology and obstetrics. During the subsequent decades through the 1970s, the clinic invested in biomedical technology. Around 2009, we finalized a long process of shifting to a mixed structure shared by the sisters and laymen. In 2015, a layman assumed general direction, and a nurse assumed directorship of nursing in 2013. I was appointed in February with the task of managing the financial, administrative, and projection aspects of the clinic. Nowadays we have 200 beds, 20 of which are for emergencies, 16 for critical care, 4 for intermediate care, and 14 surgical rooms and 10 incubators in the neonatal care unit. </p><h4>How have partnerships like the one with IBM contributed to the research capacity of the clinic?</h4><p>The process was related to IBM's implementation of SAP in 2008-2009. Today it provides the hosting services for our SAP software, and holds our servers and information. It also performs updates and additional developments when required, to guarantee the correct performance of the administration of the clinic. We want to strengthen the research capacity of our clinic. Our aim is to create research groups within the institution and eventually be published in indexed journals, so as to position the clinic internationally. We have yet to establish these research groups, although we will focus on two main research lines: gynecology and obstetrics, and orthopedics, which are the strengths of our clinic.</p><h4>Do you consider this to be a step towards increasing medical tourism in your clinic?</h4><p>In fact, nowadays medical tourism is a negligible source of income for medical institutions. Around 3.5% of visitors the country are medical tourists. The projection for 2020 is 5%, in four main lines—curative, preventive, aesthetic and wellbeing, such as obesity-related surgeries. The government has promoted investment in the first two lines, because the largest revenues are currently generated there. However, there are some important barriers such as language, given that only around 55% of local medical doctors and 8% of medical nurses are bilingual. This is important given that the majority of the medical tourists we receive are from the US and Canada. On the other hand, only 32 institutions are certified by ICONTEC, and only two have international certifications, which curbs interest from potential international clients. Legislation also constitutes a barrier, whereby the investment is considerable, and the clinic would require an agreement with a hotel chain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the government's new Price Regulation Plan impact the company's activities?</h4><p>With the implementation of the regulation T770, we opened the door to the prescription of these medicaments. Around ten years ago we set up a research group to identify trends in the consumption of medication in the country. To date, we have published over 50 articles both nationally and internationally. One of the studies from 2010 was aimed at raising government awareness of the possibility of regulating prices, and the article was one of the bases of the first regulation implemented by the government. We are convinced that the regulation of prices is a legitimate and useful tool for the government to better regulate the currently abundant supply in the market, and the prevailing medication-price ratio. In this context, we have posted double-digit growth on average each year, and only in 2014 have we seen a single-digit print. The main reason for this is the new price regulation. Despite making the entire market scenario more complex, price regulation is necessary for the future development of the sector.</p><h4>What are some of the highlights of the ongoing studies Audifarma carries out?</h4><p>One of the most important studies has to do with the usage pattern of medicine—the use of more prescribed doses and medicaments, how these are combined, and to what extent international standards are followed. The results should show a difference between Colombian and international patterns. We have also carried out studies on the effectiveness of different medicines. We have ongoing studies into pain management to raise awareness among various industry players. At the moment we are working with seven hospitals to implement this study. Another ongoing study concerns active medicament monitoring, such as reports on reactions and other metrics. One successful study we recently published covers the post-operation and surgical intervention misuse of medicines. We have identified that there is insufficient palliative control for between 40% and 70% of Colombian patients post-surgery. This is a problem associated with prescriptions and the administration of lower doses, or inappropriate medicine.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of PPPs for the sector?</h4><p>PPPs are extremely important and useful for the sector. We believe their success to be based on good communication between the parties involved. We have already developed several successful PPPs and our goal is to deepen our take in this business model, despite the difficulties of the system and the work ahead. The target in the health system must be to put an end to contractual relationships between parties, as only then will we usher in the beginning of a new era in which we will enjoy better relations among them. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the sector and the role of Audifarma over the coming five years?</h4><p>I am optimistic, and we feel that we are generating added value in what we do. We believe that we will maintain, and hopefully increase, our current market share of 17%. We have huge growth potential in the subsidized regime segment. Meanwhile, as the economic situation continues to improve regulations adopted by the government will only contribute to strengthening the sector and guarantee its future development. Colombia has a mature market for pharmacies. The profit margin of each of these segments varies considerably, and our objective is to create further synergies among them all. All in all, we are working toward a more integrated network in the sector and wider system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Coltabaco's milestones since its foundation in 1919?</h4><p>Since 1919, Coltabaco has reinvented itself to be at the forefront and at the same level as the best tobacco companies in the world. The launch of Pielroja was an important moment in 1924. Later, in the 1930s, we promoted the Colombian economy through our navigation on the Magdalena river, a time when we acquired new machinery, equipment, large production capacity and the tobacco to drive forward navigation on the river, contributing to making it a vital artery of the economy. Similarly, in the 1940s, we achieved a major recapitalization through a share issuance, which allowed us to invest in modernizing and upgrading our equipment and start a decade with high technology and the possibility of territorial expansion with new offices and factories in the major geographical points of Colombia. In the late 1970s, we started our export activity of Colombian black and blond tobacco to Eastern Europe. From that moment, we undertook a wave of launches, first bringing Derby cigarettes to the market; then in 1996, we launched our Caribe cigarettes; and finally three years later, we launched the Boston cigarettes, now the number one cigarette brand in the country. With the new century came new machinery and equipment for the manufacture of cigarettes, especially for the primary sector of the manufacturing process, while we also continued with exports and launched the Green mark in 2001. Four years later, one of the greatest milestones in the history of Coltabaco was achieved with the acquisition of a 96.65% stake in Coltabaco by PMI, a transaction exceeding $300 million. It was rated one of the most important in Colombian history. Today, we ourselves are recognized as a milestone in Colombian history as the oldest and largest tobacco company in the country, holding 51.8% of the cigarette market, according to Nielsen data, and 99.9% of domestic production.</p><h4>How did the merger with PMI impact Coltabaco's corporate culture in Colombia?</h4><p>It was more about how we decided to merge the two cultures and build one among ourselves, where multinational policies from a company like Philip Morris International blended with components of a traditional national flagship company such as Coltabaco. From the outset, we knew we had to keep the national push that succeeded in developing Colombia and that had become representative of one of the most important sources of employment, keeping in mind that we would have to adapt to new processes, practices and international policies that were handled by PMI, which from then on we would part of. In essence, there were great cultural matches from the start between the two organizations.</p><h4>How important are PMI's Colombian operations for Latin America?</h4><p>In Latin America, we represent the fourth largest market after Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, in terms of total volume of cigarettes sold and market share in each country. To PMI Latin America, Colombia is an attractive market for the great competition between the two main firms; the large number and variety of brands in its product portfolio and above all, by the challenge of having a regional portfolio, where there is an unquestionable leader in each region, either ours or competitors'. Likewise, although Coltabaco in Colombia has taken important steps, as their latest launches of L&amp;M, Fortuna, and Piel Roja Blue, it is important to mention that the company has been deeply impacted by contraband cigarettes, the incidence of which has increased dramatically from 1.8% in 2009 to 19% in 2013, according to studies by Invamer, after the government increased the excise tax on cigarettes by 50%. In Colombia, legitimate cigarette sales have fallen over the past three years (about 17%), while consumption falls at an average annual rate of 1.8%; i.e. smuggling has replaced the legal product.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Agro-industry and sustainable rural development in Colombia?</h4><p>Some sources estimate that 30%, others that 50% of Colombians live in rural areas. The conflict in Colombia has also largely seen a rural setting. These conflicts have impeded the development of the countryside in Colombia, and at the same time generated high levels of poverty. If we compare rural and urban incomes, people who live in the countryside are 3.2 times poorer than those inhabiting urban areas. In terms of multidimensional poverty, which measures 15 different aspects, the rural population is 2.5 times poorer than its urban counterparts. These figures demonstrate that agricultural development is paramount, and also that additional public policy to end poverty is required in the rural sector. The ministry and a number of associated institutions have been distant from the reality of the regions in the past, and many issues have now to be addressed. On one hand, there is the situation with poverty and insecurity in the countryside due to the armed conflict that has hindered the growth of the sector; and on the other hand there is the rural potential. Colombia has 5.5 million acres dedicated to agricultural practices, and has the potential for 20 million additional acres. No other country in Latin America has this potential, especially with such privileged geographic location. A number of tools have to be implemented for this potential to become a reality. The first step is to review the procedures within the ministry to adjust accordingly; this includes institutional policies, which will be implemented in the future as they require legal intervention, therefore this will be addressed last. Firstly, in the past the Ministry processes involved public calls to regional entities to apply for certain programs. We analyzed the results of these public calls, and concluded that there was a significant impact on poverty figures, as almost 3 million people successfully overcame poverty. The centralization of the country has accounted for serious development impairment and this is caused by many factors, including the lack of capability to present adequate projects. This has evolved since the democratic election of mayors and governors were initiated, which has improved this aspect. </p><h4>What is the ministry's strategy to boost agro-industrial exports, particularly now given that prices are more competitive? </h4><p>Partially as a result of the fall in the price of oil, we have increased exports, even though our foremost priority is guaranteeing food security. We have witnessed the marked increase of imported products in many sectors, which caused a surge in prices on the market. On the other hand, the traditional export products such as coffee, bananas, and flowers, and several other new products that have entered the international export market such as cocoa beans, fruits and vegetables, pepper, fish and seafood, have all had an outstanding growth pattern. The export of cocoa bean doubled within one year. The fish product exports grew 200% in one month, and continues to grow. This shows the comparative advantages that we have as a country for certain products. However, as I mentioned earlier, the main objective for any country in the agricultural sector is to guarantee food security for its population. We have established five action strategies to increase our capability to produce quality products in the required quantity. We have also determined five strategies to confront poverty levels in the countryside. We are certain that the combination of these strategies will translate into positive outcomes. Agriculture cannot exist without taking the environment into consideration. The agricultural sector was affecting the environment negatively, as the sector utilizes the most significant volume of water. Therefore, we have to find ways to increase efficiency in the usage of water, such as drip irrigation systems, which allow for a more responsible use of this resource.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market conditions led to the creation of each group?</h4><p>Cano Jiménez is a family-owned group of companies. The company was founded in 1983, and was initially focused on road infrastructure, consulting, and transportation, as well as the construction of housing projects. As we developed and grew within the sector, we moved into other lines of business directed toward creating groups that promote road infrastructure concessions. At the time we deemed it necessary to partition the companies to promote specialization in specific areas. It also separated and mitigated the risks in each sector. Consultancy, design, and construction supervision have certain associated risks. Construction has different risks and real estate, of course, has different visions. As we defined the different lines of business, we realized that they needed to be under the direction of a corporate group that provides services to the three companies. So nowadays, we are operating with a completely independent operational structure in each line of business, but behind which is a corporate group that leads the general strategy and provides all three companies with services such as human resources, accounting, financial, commercial promotion, and legal support. The three companies today are Cano Jimenez Estudios, which handles consultancy, Oceisa, which is in charge of infrastructure, and Promobily in real estate.</p><h4>What are the key infrastructural and development projects you are working on today?</h4><p>Cano Jimenez Estudios has participated in a number of large concessions. Today, the greatest achievement is the design of the first metro line for Bogotá. Regarding infrastructure, the use of trenchless technology is a major step. With Oceisa we finished a storm drainage system project a couple years ago in the Fontibon, an area of Bogotá close to the El Dorado airport, which was prone to flooding every winter due to a lack of drainage. In this densely populated area, we installed 68km of piping without disturbing the roads, with the trenchless method. We carried out a reinforcement of the main water pipe for Bogotá and Tibitoc with interior limestone and metallic tubes. Our project in Fontibon was the largest for Oceisa, alongside the reinforcement of the main water pipe for Bogotá. For Promobily, the biggest projects are in Cedritos, namely Botanika Aqua and Botanika Telus, where we are building 341 apartments. Another Botanika building will have 46 apartments, and we are planning to commence sales and production shortly.</p><h4>What has been your role in the Bogotá metro advanced engineering process, and what is your perspective regarding the development of the project?</h4><p>Our participation in the consortium that developed the Bogotá Metro, which included two Spanish companies, IDOM and Euroestudios, was granted due to overall experience. Euroestudios is a general engineering company and IDOM is an entity with a long history of working with train and subway technological systems, while we are a general Colombian engineering company with experience in local systems, such as the research of public utilities and traffic management. Our input in the consortium, which corresponded to one-third of the project, was mainly field research and local support. The other two companies contributed with their specialized technology for railways, regarding security, evacuation, and so forth. Even though that was our main obligation and contribution, we participated in the whole design process and the transfer of technology. It was paramount for the Colombian engineers involved in the project to learn from it and make it our own. In summary, we participated in all activities related to the project, even though we didn't manage them directly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe Colombia's flower industry, and Flores El Capiro's role in it?</h4><p>Colombia is the largest exporter of cut flowers in the world. Technically the Netherlands is considered the greatest exporter, but that is because the Netherlands re-exports flowers imported from Colombia and Ecuador. In terms of volume exported from a single country of origin, Colombia leads, with the Colombian flower industry growing by about 4-6% a year, with growth for 2015 expected at around 5%. Cut-flower exports last year reached $1.3 billion. About 75% of the flowers from Colombia are from Bogotá, with 20% stem from the Rio Negro area. In Bogota we mainly plant roses and carnations, mini carnations, spray carnations, along with Alstroemeria and other floral varieties. In Antioquia we mostly grow chrysanthemums and hydrangeas, which have become an important crop for the region. I am the chairman of the board of Asocolflores, the Colombian Association of Flower Exporters, in Bogotá and Medellí­n. Flores El Capiro mainly grows chrysanthemums. The processes for roses and chrysanthemums are markedly different, with the latter being more labor-intensive. We have 75ha reserved for chrysanthemums, making us one of the largest growers of Chrysanthemum in the world. Flores El Capiro employs 1,500 people, and we operate five production centers. We export to many different markets with North America being our chief destination, accounting for 45% of our exports, followed by the UK with 35%. Chile, Australia, Japan, and Spain are also important markets. Unlike other chrysanthemum growers, we export 60% of our flowers by sea freight, which makes us the largest exporter of flowers by this route in the world. We have exported more than 1,800 containers to date, and eight years ago we commenced a major project with the Dutch Flower Group and Tesco, which pioneered selling flowers in supermarkets, remaining one of our biggest buyers. We also export to Chile and Australia by sea freight. It takes 28 days for our flowers to reach Australia, and we guarantee a seven-day life span once the flowers are on sale there, mainly in supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths. </p><h4>What effect has the devaluation of the peso had on flower producers in Colombia?</h4><p>The devaluation is a positive development for exporters. Most exporters of flowers, including us, use futures to put a flat rate on the currency. I think the devaluation has led to a consolidation of the industry among major producers, and the business is radically different from what it was eight years ago when the peso started to devalue. In the past, the devaluation would help businesses that were inefficient, but now the margins are too tight for that. Companies have adapted by diversifying their crops and adopting new technologies. They are investing more per hectare, and labor is becoming more expensive. Flowers are a riskier business today, in large part due to fluctuations in the exchange rate. To hedge against fluctuation, we use futures. This strategy guarantees margins, and we are not at the mercy of exchange rate fluctuations. Whatever exchange rate we anticipate, we peg it into the future, which ensures our survival. </p><h4>What changes are occurring in the international market in terms of the markets that you wish to trade with? How are the free trade agreements (FTAs) impacting your industry?</h4><p>We once had an ATP agreement (agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be used for such Carriage with the US exempting us from duties on exports, so nothing has changed with the new ATP. Ecuador, on the other hand, did not sign an ATP with the US, so Colombian flowers are more competitive than Ecuadorian produce on the US market. Our export duties levied by the UK are negligible. We want to sign a free trade agreement for hydrangeas with South Korea. In regard to other factors, the exchange rate between the dollar and Euro is of concern to us. The Euro has lost 20% of its value to the dollar, and the two currencies are approaching parity, which means our exports to Europe will be more expensive, since we sell in dollars. In the UK, the pound still yields us a slight advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Inelco established?</h4><p>The company was founded in Bogotá in 1937. My uncle Alvaro Velasquez graduated from MIT in 1934 and his partner, Alfredo Otero graduated from the University of Louvain in Belgium. After working for three years at Empresa de Energí­a de Bogotá (the electricity utility in Bogotá), they decided to establish their own business. Inelco is an acronym for Electrical Engineers of Colombia. In 1949, they decided the time was ripe for expansion, whereupon they founded Inelco Del Pacifico Ltda in the city of Cali. The company became Inelco SA in 2003 when the corporation type changed. </p><p>Inelco throughout the years has participated in several entrepreneurial projects, founding energy related companies. In the middle of the last century there was very little manufacturing of electrical products in Colombia, whereby Inelco imported all necessary electrical conductors as well as overhauled machinery from Canada, thereby founding Fadaltec SA (cable manufacturer) as partners of Canada Wire. Fadaltec merged into what today is Centelsa, the largest cable manufacturer in Colombia. Cables and conductors represent about 30-35% of the cost of an electrical project, whereby being able to produce our own conductors gave us a valuable strategic advantage. We also manufacture the electrical switchgear that safeguard a building against short circuits and overloads. This is performed through our affiliate company Tableros Electricos SA. Tablesa has just turned 25 years old. </p><p>At Inelco SA we have an engineering services business model somewhat different from others employed in our country. Inelco is an established company, with the holding company managing all back office processes such as accounting, purchasing, quality system, and logistics for our several business units. Our business division units are energy divisions, which acts as an EPC contractors for electrical projects. They target infrastructure, industry, large commercial malls, office buildings, hospitals. The structured cabling division is responsible for installing local area computer networks, and the voice and data communications networks. The electronic security division, is responsible for installing fire detection systems, access controls and closed circuit TVs (CCTV), and building automation. Our service ivision performs outsourcing of manual-labor for maintenance of public lighting networks in various different towns across the Cauca Valle for EPSA (Regional Utility Company), as well as industrial maintenance. Our commercial division retails electrical products. We are initiating an energy efficiency division and are searching for business partners in LED lighting, photovoltaic systems, and related equipment. Our manufacturing affiliate TABLESA SA, produces medium and low voltage electric switchgear and switchboards that are the cabinets that house electrical equipment. This is an OEM operation (Original Equipment Manufacturer) that integrates products from companies such as Schneider, Eaton and ABB. </p><p>Additionally to local sales, Tablesa performs exports to México, Panamá, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.</p><h4>Which sectors are witnessing the most pronounced growth today?</h4><p>Regarding our projects, in infrastructure for instance, in conjunction with another company, we are building the EPC electrical works for a new Aguadulce port, in the city of Buenaventura. It will provide storage for refrigerated containers for a joint venture between Malaysian and Philippine companies: or Sociedad Puerto Industrial Aguadulce (SPIA). We are currently initiating the international terminal expansion for the local airport of Cali.  In the industrial sector, we undertook all electrical works for the SAB Miller Bavaria Brewery. We also built the electrical works at the new soap plant for Unilever, which is a 10-story plant; as well as the logistic distribution centers for Unilever and P&amp;G. We have also built the electrical works for several large commercial shopping centers. Our focus has remained on EPC projects for infrastructure, industry, large commercial centers, hotels and office buildings, and hospitals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yara's Latin American office is currently undergoing a major corporate restructuring. What does this mean for Colombia?</h4><p>These are interesting times in which we have doubled our size in the part of Latin America that we focus on as our company has divided operations across the region. There is the Brazilian market and then the rest of the continent. The Brazilian market is twice the size of the rest of the markets combined when it comes to total consumption. Through the acquisition of Abocol, we are set to double our presence in Latin America outside of Brazil, which represents an important step for us. We currently have 1,350 employees in the region. I was calculating the other day that if we stacked the 2.3 million tons of fertilizer that we will sell in the rest of Latin America, in 50-kilogram bags, in a football field, it would reach a height of around 600 meters, which is quite impressive. When we bought Abocol, we acquired a factory in Cartagena, and are now producing some 400,000 tons of fertilizers there. Of course that means that out of the 2.3 million tons, a sizable volume still needs to be imported. </p><h4>In what ways does Yara act as a mediator between smallholders and governmental institutions to ensure shortcomings are addressed effectively at a political level?</h4><p>Our core task is to improve the productivity and profitability of farmers. Farmer profitability is the key to self-sufficiency and the farmer's ability to invest in his own business. This can mean producing more, but it can also mean producing better quality. Successful models to unlock the productivity potential of farmers tend to involve not just input producers like Yara. Other key stakeholders in the value chain are needed to make sure that the farmer can sell his increased or improved output. The active involvement of government, not least to provide adequate infrastructure, is also vital. We want to replicate such multi-stakeholder models in other countries and with other crops. We are working to understand how we can create a model that we can replicate faster, so we can improve productivity.</p><h4>How do you facilitate greater access to credit and financial mechanisms for smallholders that will allow them to invest and become more self-sufficient?</h4><p>We will try to get finance and insurance companies involved, because ultimately one of the reasons why farmers face difficulties in this is that their business is perceived as being too high risk in nature. One of my colleagues noted recently that even a smallholder's father would not lend him money because what he does is not really business, and often they do not have the security needed for any kind of investment. Insufficient rainfall could, for example, spell total loss. In Colombia, the political situation has also played a huge role, because just 10 to 15 years ago, traveling three to five hours away from Bogotá was a risky proposition. Today, the situation is more stable, though the fundamental problems have not been solved yet. There are a number of reasons that combined have curbed the development of the countryside and agriculture in Colombia. When we consider key crops such as coffee or maize, for example, and compare productivity per hectare over the past 50 years, we see that some countries reached a trigger point after which their productivity started to grow at a much more rapid pace. In contrast, there has been a steady, but marginal annual increment in productivity growth in Colombia, and we have never experienced a revolution in the agriculture sector. I believe we can still experience this, however, and we have the model that works.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How effectively do you feel the administration is meeting its schedule at the moment?</h4><p>We have an ambitious schedule, have closed the first 10 projects. These represent $6 billion in investment, which in itself is a record for any concession program here in Colombia. We have four packages, and expect the second package to be awarded by June 2015. We will start the third package in May 2015 and expect to have that awarded by December 2015. In parallel to these three, we will have a fourth package, which we designate as private initiatives for unsolicited offers. They are projects that the private sector brought to us, for which we have been negotiating for quite a few months and are now ready to begin publishing in the market to obtain alternative offers. If everything goes as planned, by the end of 2015, we should have $24 billion of road works contracted through the concession system.</p><h4>How many contracts have been awarded so far?</h4><p>We have been awarded 10 so far, and have completed the first group. The companies that have provided the most offers in this process have been Odinsa, Condor, the Solarte Group, Kofi Colombiana, which is part of the Aval Group, and the KMA Group, the Amin family. They have played a significant role in binding together the consortium, and are leading the different consortiums that are participating.</p><h4>Would you say that all the conditions are present for investors wanting to invest in the 4G project?</h4><p>We have introduced numerous improvements along the way and now have a system that is effective in attracting foreign companies. We have received offers from 11 foreign companies in this process, which was unheard of before. We have received offers from five Spanish companies, and additional ones from Portugal, Israel, the UK, Mexico, China, and Costa Rica. All of these are leading companies in their home countries, which confirms that we are going about business the right way.</p><h4>How significant is the port development around Cartagena?</h4><p>Cartagena has become an important hub, and is today probably the most efficient port in the southern Caribbean. It was important to have a deeper access channel, as with a depth of 20m it can accommodate large crude oil carriers and post-Panamax vessels in the bay of Cartagena. This is important for the competitiveness of the port, and is mainly focused on the petroleum and large container vessels that navigate the Panama Canal.</p><h4>How effective has PPP law 1502 been in fostering greater collaboration between the public and private sectors? </h4><p>That law was issued at the end of 2012, but like everything related to infrastructure, it takes time to come to fruition. When you see the number of projects that we are awarding and our extensive pipeline, you can but conclude that the law was successful. And when one considers the Colombian economy, it becomes apparent that housing and infrastructure are determining its current growth. The law has been successful in achieving its objectives, and we think that over the coming six years, through 2020, the main engine of growth in Colombia will be the construction sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the purpose of the OPAIN concession?</h4><p>OPAIN is an all-purpose entity. Basically, once the concession was awarded, the company was created in order to fulfill the duties of the concession contract. It is a company that only focuses on this concession contract. Since 2008, we built the new passenger terminal. We have also built a cargo terminal and several other buildings that are for operation support. We built around 230,000sqm of buildings. We have fulfilled all duties in terms of security and operational capacity, including maintenance. We also leased all the commercial areas that are available. We have seen notable commercial success among those tenants. We are now trying to close a deal with the government to expand the passenger terminal by a further 50,000sqm. This is a voluntary project. The works are worth around $160 million. This is our program for the next 24 months and will be part voluntary, and part government funded to a total of around $300 million. </p><h4>How are you attracting and working with different airline companies?</h4><p>We are trying to develop new routes and destinations to create more connectivity and have steady traffic growth. We visit them in either their headquarters or in some events that are held throughout the year with the airlines and airports. We have been successful so far in bringing new airlines and opening new destinations with the airlines that currently use the airport. We are offering them $5 or $10 depending on the route per in-plane passenger and destination in Bogotá for the first year. While that is a small incentive regarding the huge cost of an airline opening a route, it helps somewhat with their deployment costs here. </p><h4>How much will this boost the impact of the airport in the near to mid-term?</h4><p>It depends on the route and on the type of plane that the airlines use. Of course, we have 737s and 747s, which are almost four times bigger than others. We are projecting our natural growth and then adding additional growth by bringing more airlines to help growth. KLM just started, for example, and Portuguese TAP started last year. We will have Turkish Airlines by the end of this year. There are also new routes for Avianca to London and Los Angeles. We have new routes to the Caribbean as well, provided by a small airline based in the Bahamas. </p><h4>What is your key long term goal in terms of overall operations?</h4><p>We are aiming to have highly-trained airport staff capable of delivering great passenger service. We want to be the best airport in Latin America in terms of passenger experience. Skytrax is a means of measuring our performance, knowing where we are getting it right, and where we can improve. We are raising the bar every year and hope to provide the best passenger experience in Latin America. </p><h4>How could the airline boost its foreign investment?</h4><p>Some of the most important investments that we need are being made directly by the Civil Aviation Authority. They are changing their equipment and procedures and installing new technology that will allow us to have more operations. Right now we realize 57-58 operations per hour. With these changes, the Civil Aviation Authority is aiming to have 85-90 operations per hour, marking a huge improvement in take offs and landings. The government is investing heavily and within 18-24 months we are set to have all equipment, operational changes and procedures and new technology in place allowing for greater effectiveness and efficiency. We are growing the terminal in areas that will allow us to continue our growth for five to seven years, which is quite standard for any airport. In the past, we had airports for 30-50 years, but that is no longer possible with the traffic growth. And meanwhile, there are new commercial areas that are set to compensate for the amount we need to invest.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are currently in the midst of integrating the public transport system. Could you explain the major challenges of this initiative since you began?</h4><p>Transmilenio was in transition when I assumed office in June of 2014. There was a loss of public confidence in the public transport system, which we had to reverse by providing better service, reorganizing its delivery, and improving the service we provide in the Carrera Septima, a key transit artery. We needed to move some of the demand from the Caracas to Septima Avenue, establish new services, use the local service, and integrate them into the trans system. There were diagnostic problems at that time. We had a problem with the implementation of the SITP “zonal" services needing to consolidate that system, and place our assets where most productive. Transmilenio S.A. slowed the implementation process somewhat and tried to consolidate what it had. We uncovered financial irregularities at two of the companies that provide zonal services. The national government helped us take control of these two companies, and for six months we developed a plan to rescue them. We also needed to improve infrastructure. We started a maintenance plan and directed our resources towards tackling the main problems, including security. Conditions were complex, but we started registering systematic improvement. </p><h4>What have been the main achievements in making the system better and more sustainable over the past year?</h4><p>Our tactical plan is built on four pillars; the first is transformation. We put all our effort and resources into the metro system. Another project was the Upgrade Plan, which seeks to renew the fleet with advanced technologies including hybrid and electric buses, and introducing a fleet of Volvo buses. We already had hybrid buses in the Carrera Septima, but we needed to expand their use to other operators and neighborhoods. Then there is the Contract Pillar, which seeks to increase and enhance the ability of our organization to provide contracts. We faced a serious problem regarding the integration of cars into the system. We issued some directives to provide a plan for the transition and substitution of the technology such that we could accept the 17 cars in the system. The third is the Service Pillar. We want to implement the services that best serve our users. This means access to information—looking for ways to provide information to the user, using new technologies like Google Maps, and other applications. Our strategy relies heavily on the media. We are currently working with the Universidad de los Andes, and in that regard we are improving our planning capabilities. The fourth pillar of our tactical plan is innovation. We are innovating in two ways—in research and development, and in solving small problems that cause serious outcomes. On that track we are trying to find a way to connect to the industry, using new technologies, and a modern integrated public transport system. We worked with the UK Embassy, and UK-based Right Bus, to introduce aluminum bodied vehicles, reducing weight, and the cost of moving passengers per unit. </p><h4>How has Transmilenio S.A. and its partners improved its grasp of urban and transport planning?</h4><p>Our organization embraces progressive environmental public policy. We are working with companies—mainly Korean—to improve user access to information. We provide IT services at some of our stations, and have installed a new electronic door system. The third and most important example concerns our new buses themselves. Transmilenio S.A. already has a 12m electric bus in Bogotá, as well as a hybrid, and we are testing other buses and waiting on an electric vehicle from China. We have an innovation process called the City Laboratory, which allows manufacturers to test their technology on our system, with all parties benefiting from the results. Transmilenio certifies that the bus complies with all the requirements to operate in the system, which is yet another example from our innovation pillar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Odebrecht in the Magdalena River project, and how did it collaborate with Valorcon to bring about this project?</h4><p>We are a global company, so when entering new countries, we always select local partners. This enables us to better understand the communities in which our projects are based. For the Magdalena River project, we identified a partner that had broad experience in the execution of infrastructure projects, as well as knowledge of the area in which we were going to operate. For example, we chose Valorcon, which is from Barranquilla, to develop projects such as the Cartagena-Barranquilla highway. </p><h4>What are the synergies between your two main projects in Colombia, the Ruta del Sol and the Magdalena River schemes?</h4><p>The structure we put in place for both projects is the same, despite the radical differences between them. We could even have used the same office location in Barrancabermeja to reduce costs. Yet there are other elements to note, such as the fact that we will manage these two projects for some 13 years, and that both are infrastructure projects of importance in boosting Colombian GDP. This is both a challenge and responsibility for us that we are more than happy to assume.</p><h4>How will the Magdalena River project contribute to making Colombia a more competitive market?</h4><p>It will reduce transport costs significantly. Some studies show that the transport sector will save up to $200 million annually thanks to the Magdalena River project. It will also contribute to the reduction of carbon gas emissions, and many companies will opt to transport their goods on the Magdalena River. Additionally, many towns along the river will also benefit from such a major project. All in all, Colombia will improve its competitive edge as a result of the project. In fact, the impact of this project will not only be economic, but also social. It will generate job opportunities for local communities, and will contribute considerably to their development.</p><h4>What differentiates this project from other PPPs?</h4><p>The assigning of risk in this project has been well defined and apportioned between the state and the private sector, which has encouraged more applications for the tender. We must comply with several requirements to win this project, but I believe that potential social and environmental risks have already been mitigated. The state will not be financially involved in the project until all completed functional units are delivered. It has done a great job and all the rules have been clearly set out. In this context, Odebrecht's technologies and capabilities give us confidence with regard to the fulfillment of our responsibilities in this historic venture.</p><h4>What have been the main challenges facing the projects Odebrecht has already completed in Colombia?</h4><p>We are about to start executing work on the Magdalena River project. One of the main advantages of this project is that all of the considerations related to environmental and social licenses have already been resolved, whereas in projects such as the 4G-highway between Cartagena and Barranquilla, we faced numerous problems due to these issues. The main challenges we have faced in this country so far have concerned licenses. Of course, every project has its own particularities and in each you learn new lessons that help you to avoid problems in future projects.</p><h4>What are some of the projects Odebrecht has targeted for the near future in Colombia?</h4><p>We have analyzed certain private initiatives and targeted public sector projects in the water treatment sphere, and also regarding Bogotá Metro, a project that in my opinion requires private sector participation. We are also looking at certain urban highways in Bogotá and other cities. However, the Magdalena River is one of the largest projects for Colombia over the coming four years, and it is an honor for us to be part of a national project of such importance as we strive to complete our responsibilities as soon as possible and guarantee the unparalleled effect it will have on Colombia's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will 4G projects enhance national growth?</h4><p>Infrastructural improvement in Colombia is underway, with multiple investments in tendered highways and construction of dual carriageways. These include over 7,000km of tunnels and viaducts, on national, secondary and tertiary network roads across the country, and the recovery and improvement of the railway network. In ports, we have invested over $1.2 billion between 2010 and 2014, with an increase of 25% in the level of investment. In recovering the navigability of the Magdalena River we invested  COP2.5 billion, and in terms of airports, we began the modernization and expansion of the main terminals in the country, with an estimated COP2.8 billion of investment, involving 39 airports in 19 cities in the country. Without doubt, projects in road and transport infrastructure have stimulated economic growth and will continue do so. We will improve the quality of life of Colombians with over COP40 billion, generating about 310,000 jobs. We have sought to consolidate the national road network through greater connectivity between the centers of production and consumption in the major cities, port areas, and borders with shorter travel times and operating costs.</p><h4>What are the main projects developed last year and how will these help boost growth, competitiveness, and social welfare? </h4><p>The national government has launched the 4G program. In the first wave, 10 projects have been awarded for approximately 1,200km, with an investment of COP11.5 billion, which will generate about 57,000 direct jobs in the construction phase. In the second wave nine projects will be up for bidding spanning about 1,740km. In the third wave,  projects will be available for about 1,700km. Five of our PPPs projects have been awarded, while others have already submitted feasibility studies, for approximately 3,400km. We have also tendered approximately 1,500km of railways. Regarding ports, to date, the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Rio Grande de la Magdalena (CORMAGDALENA) manages 16 river port concessions and 27 maritime port concessions. The government, through the National Roads Institute (INVIAS), undertakes construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and operations on national, secondary, and tertiary network roads in the country. In addition, we define the strategic logistics corridors to facilitate trade exchange and development in general, as well as the investment needs in roads, river routes, rail networks, and airports, in order to have a comprehensive joint transport infrastructure. The project to restore the navigability of the Magdalena River will generate 1,350 direct and indirect jobs. This investment will decrease operating expenses for freight transport, increase freight revenue growth and mitigate environmental effects. </p><h4>What are the main challenges Colombia faces to adequately implement transport infrastructure?</h4><p>Colombia's difficult climate mountainous topography present real engineering challenges. Colombia is a country of diverse characteristics that make it unique in the Americas: from its coasts on both oceans, to being the only country in South America with three branches of the Andes. These peculiarities have led to a situation in which road and railway transport is complex due to the steep slopes and the presence of unstable ground which, combined with high rainfall over long periods of the year, makes transit through the roads very vulnerable. Thus, the need for greater technical requirements and  higher investment costs in infrastructure construction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claro has been reinvesting around 70% of its profits into developing the company. Where are you allocating that reinvestment?</h4><p>Claro has been reinvesting in its 4G network so as to meet the commitments we made at the time of the 4G spectrum auction. These commitments greatly exceeded those of our competitors, in terms of the towns and communities that we intended to cover. It is critical that we build a 4G network, allowing us to offload data traffic from the 3G network so as to adequately use that spectrum, given our significant disadvantage compared to our competitors in terms of spectrum allocation. We have to serve close to 30 million subscribers with the same spectrum amount that our competitors serve far fewer subscribers with. Therefore, our reinvestment is critical not only in terms of providing a better and faster service, it also in terms of improving quality for all our users. </p><h4>You plan to offer 4G services to your current subscribers at no additional cost. How will you achieve that, and does Claro have the capacity to do so?</h4><p>We intend to offer 4G services to 100% of our consumers. However, for this to occur, we need a whole new coverage network. With the necessary infrastructure in place, if 4G is not available, the customer's device will select 3G, or 2G. Today, our 4G coverage has reached 55% of homes and businesses throughout Colombia within a year, and we am at 100%. Of course, none of this helps if people are not using devices that are 4G enabled. We used to be able to subsidize these devices, but currently a regulatory restriction forbids this practice. In response, we are implementing an aggressive sales campaign for phones and installment payments. Today, you can get a smartphone with us for just $1.70 a month. Our role is essentially to make technology accessible and useful to consumers throughout the country and across all social strata. </p><h4>How are you working with the public sector to improve connectivity?</h4><p>We work with the public sector in a variety of ways, because ultimately our interests converge. Installing the fiber optic network across the country, implementing the 4G network, increasing data mobility, and introducing faster and more widespread internet access benefits for Colombia overall. These projects are in line with the government's own plans to develop the IT sector and increase broadband connectivity. In 2015, we have issued significant subsidies in education, with 300,000 tablets being delivered to students of lower socio-economic status. We also developed a platform called Educlick, which is the Wikipedia of education in Colombia, enabling teachers to upload five-minute lessons that can be shared nationwide. There is much more to be done and ways to use the network for education in Colombia, and we hope to be at the forefront of new projects like that. Another area where we are active is healthcare. Claro is tapping into some of the developments that Fundación Slim has done in Mexico. There is no such foundation in Colombia; however, we are adopting the model to, for example, reduce infant mortality. </p><h4>How do you assess the level of competition in this sector in Colombia?</h4><p>There are nine mobile and 20 fixed operators in Colombia; therefore, competition is stiff. In terms of what differentiates us in telecommunications in Colombia, Claro has clearly led on the investment side, even though particularly depressed times where investments were scarce, and in some of the toughest parts of the country. Still, we did that through our 20-year commitment to investing in the country and to driving technological growth and development across Colombia. There is no better contribution to competition other than to compete. Our efforts have driven our competition to keep up with us, and to offer services that we offer. As the government ensures the spectrum is available to everyone, competition also increases. Private entities have the task to deliver and create opportunities to convey value to consumers, to invest in delivering that value, and ultimately reap the rewards of those investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia's business journalism in general over the past 15 years has come a long way in terms of openness. Do you feel that anything in particular has inspired this transition, and how has the business community benefited?</h4><p>It is a reflection of what has happened to the country, since not only has the economy grown, but also diversified with more sectors developing today. Moreover, an emerging middle class is keen to become knowledgeable about financial and economic issues. In that sense, we reflect the positive story of Colombia. What has happened is that our audience has grown as well as our advertising base on the back of national advancement, and I believe the quality of Colombian journalism in general has improved. There is a broader spectrum of media too, which prominently includes online services. Meanwhile, rising specialization is calling for a wider range of talented journalists. Essentially, we have a larger pool of professionals available than 15 years ago.</p><h4>How are your readers' consumption habits changing and how does the pace of change in Colombia stack up in the regional context?</h4><p>Colombia's pace is basically in step with the region. I have seen the numbers from Mexico to Chile, and of countries relevant in size to Colombia, and reader behavior is more or less the same. We have been able to sustain our print readership, while at the same time increasing online readership dramatically, a trend observable across the region. Again, here traditional media is leveraging the local pace of growth that North America or Europe is not seeing. Our readership today is 60% print and 40% is online. That amounts to 80,000 daily readers of the print edition and more or less 40,000 to 50,000 stand-alone daily users on our website. The print side generates the largest percentage of revenues. At the same time, of course, we have diversified our sources of revenue. </p><h4>Do you anticipate that the reelection of President Santos will generate renewed waves of investment?</h4><p>Not necessarily, because I don't believe that investments necessarily react to continuity, which is true in this case. I believe that the main drivers of investment are long-laid plans that at the same time react to global trends. We face strong headwinds because the commodity boom that helped Latin America grow rapidly over the past few years is passing. Colombia has been less affected than certain other countries, but is by no means immune. That will impact investment, specifically in oil and mining. It will of course affect the national economy unless we are able, as we have done so far, to identify alternative sectors. </p><h4>In 2014 the Atlas Colombia de Complejidad Económica was launched under the leadership of the Centre for International Development at Harvard University in an effort to reduce regional gaps in Colombia. How effective do you feel this will be at identifying new production and export models?</h4><p>Colombia is an unequal country, not only in terms of income, but also of local capabilities. What you see in Colombia is that some regions do their homework in terms of taking advantage of the resources and doing things correctly. Other regions, however, are slower to grasp the challenges. This creates regional disparities, even on the Atlantic coast, which is clear between Barranquilla and Santa Marta or Magdalena. That is why the national government has to take steps in order to balance the situation, which has yet to be the case.</p><h4>In terms of public sector, what do you think needs to happen over the coming years?</h4><p>The infrastructure program, which is extremely ambitious, must succeed at the financing round to begin actual work on the ground, and we remain some months away from that point. For this to happen requires both private and public financing. There is still a huge question mark hanging over this. The government needs to finance the 2015 budget and follow fiscal rules, which implies the passage of tax reform in Congress, which is never an easy task.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The amount of affiliated companies has now risen to 69 from just 25 a few years ago. What explains this increase in membership?</h4><p>The CCIT has existed since 1993. And as with much else in business, trade associations are also cyclical. When I arrived there were twenty-six member companies. All of them were relevant in terms of the Colombian ICT sector—but few in number. Over the past two and a half years we have grown almost three-fold to 69 companies, which of course brings me satisfaction by confirming that people have confidence in what we do. These numbers show that there is no better way to add value than through a trade association such as CCIT. Our vision statement is that, with the ample and proper use of ICT—telecommunications, internet, hardware, or software—we will be able to better the lives of all the Colombians in both rural and urban areas. It means creating employment, and providing online education, e-health, and all types of vertical solutions that can tremendously impact the quality of life in Colombia. We exist to promote orderly growth of the ICT sector. That means combating software piracy, where Colombia still has a high share of illegal software in use at over 50%. This has to be addressed to spur local IT development. </p><h4>How effective a job of coordinating are the CCIT, the Ministry of ICT, and other bodies doing to ensure orderly and equitable sector growth? </h4><p>On most occasions, we see eye to eye with the government. That being said, ours is a private trade association. Our bylaws stipulate that for a company to be a member, it must be subject to over 50% private sector voting. We think that Minister Molano and his team have done a fantastic job over the past four years with their first Live Digital Plan, and that the second plan is also on track in terms of stimulating demand. However, they must remember the importance of supply, which is what the first four years were all about. </p><h4>What would you say are the main points of consensus between yourselves, the Ministry, and your affiliate companies regarding the types of technology you intend to focus on over the coming few years?</h4><p>There is a general consensus in terms of the convergence of IT and Telecom. We have been talking about convergence in the market for fifteen years now. We cannot think of networks alone, and need to incorporate IT security. The Colombian government has drafted a plan to directly invest a portion of mining industry royalties into the ICT sector. Accordingly, 10%, amounting to about $1.25 billion, is destined for projects related to science, innovation, and technology. We need to ensure that the private sector, and specifically our member companies, are comfortable undertaking joint projects with the public sector. Given a medium-term investment in terms of human resources and brainpower, key projects to the tune of $1.2 billion have the potential to materialize. </p><h4>What areas of the Colombian ICT sector are of the greatest interest to international investors? </h4><p>CCIT proudly represents companies from 18 countries. We have four chapters: operators, telco providers, IT companies, and content providers. Colombian entrepreneurship will present a tremendous opportunity moving forward. We maintain regular contact with Minister Molano and various public entities regarding the creation of the necessary ecosystem to start a company, develop and implement an idea, create an application, present a new business model, and so on. There is no reason to hesitate before investing in Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your performance over the past year?</h4><p>Last year was a challenging year mainly on the fluctuation of the global oil price. Even so, we can safely say that our performance was satisfactory. We could have performed better if fluctuations in the economy could have been better projected. However, these are the norms of an investment company that offers investment banking activities. Having said that, we managed to close with a net profit of OMR1.1 million and we distributed a 5% cash dividend to shareholders.</p><h4>How would you describe the state of the investment climate this year in Oman?</h4><p>We cannot isolate ourselves from what is happening in the rest of the world, and we have been affected by the low oil prices, the wars in Yemen and Syria, and the events in the rest of the Middle East. But in the long run, we think the situation will stabilize. The Omani economy itself is strong, with the government focusing on building infrastructure and SMEs, and working diligently to improve services. Due to the stabilization of the Omani economy we have seen good interest from all GCC investors to invest in the Omani market especially in the private equity market that complies with sharia principles.</p><h4>Where is the focus of most of your investments?</h4><p>We are mainly focused on the Omani market, and we are focusing on different sectors where we see that there is a lot of potential, such as real estate, hospitality, education, and healthcare. On top of that we have the responsibility to show investors in the GCC and in the rest of the world that there are many opportunities in Oman, which needs to be tapped.</p><h4>How is Islamic banking performing?</h4><p>We are now in the third year of Islamic offerings in Oman. This is considered a young sector. We noticed that the asset books of the Islamic banks and windows have been growing tremendously. However, to grow in a rapid manner, the banks need to be more creative when it comes to introducing their products and offerings. I support the Central Bank imposing some restrictions on certain concepts such as Tawaruq, which has been debatable in this industry. With these restrictions it gives the opportunity for players to introduce alternatives products. As for the Islamic capital markets, more sukuks need to be issued by government-related entities and corporates. To date, we are proud to say that we are the first to advise the first sukuk in Oman, which was the Tilal Development Sukuk issued in 2013. The regulators and players also have to conduct more awareness programs for Islamic banking to be fully understood by the Omani market. </p><h4>Is the company using any strategies to cope with the downturn in oil prices?</h4><p>Any company in the investment or equity markets has to face this problem. Our portfolio is well diversified. We have many different projects where we are collaborating together with the technical experts to add value to the entire portfolio. While the economy runs 80-90% on oil, we have other sectors as well, and the government is pushing to improve gas and tourism, for example.</p><h4>What is the major challenge for Al Madina Investments in this region?</h4><p>The major challenge is the business environment. It is a challenge to come up with different kinds of projects that will add value to the county. We developed, for instance, Al Madina Real Estate and Al Madina Takaful and different private equity companies in different sectors, and these provide many jobs for Omanis. Altogether we have around 3,000 to 4,000 employees, with nearly 85% Omani employees. Top management is a mix of Omanis and expatriates.</p><h4>How is Omanization affecting your business, and where are the existing gaps?</h4><p>Omanization started with common jobs, such as accounting and administration, and now we are seeking Omanis for technical jobs such as financial modeling, research, managing balance sheets, and so on. There are too few qualified Omanis, so competition is stiff and expensive. We recruit students from university. Right now one of our main projects is in the healthcare sector. Therefore, our responsibility is to increase the number of Omani doctors. We have wonderful Omani doctors who should be in the spotlight. Doctors are doctors, and they do not market themselves.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year and your long-term outlook?</h4><p>I am always optimistic. There is a lot to be done and we see a clear and promising path in front of us. The Oman economy is a young economy. There are a lot of projects to be built and products to be brought to the market. The railway project, the airport, and the port will open even more opportunities. Between those and the huge hospitality sector, the health sector, and the education sector, there are a lot of opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has demand for your products changed over the past 20 years?</h4><p>White goods sales correlate closely to overall economic movements. This is one of the segments where, when the economy is going well you see demand rise. White goods are also one of the first things customers stop buying during a recession. Most white goods are bought on credit in the expectation of being able to make the payments. One of the main drivers of our sales is construction because people tend to upgrade their white goods when moving home. What's more, we now have energy-efficient drivers. More and more people are aware that white goods directly affect their pocketbook. Having an old fridge is like driving an old car that consumes a lot of energy due to inefficiency. In contrast, we have new environmentally friendly materials. Our manufacturing facility is certified; it complies with the Montreal and Kyoto protocols. We work with the best eco-friendly materials available.</p><h4>How is Haceb able to compete with international corporations in this sector?</h4><p>First and foremost comes design, and we deliver a high-quality product to the market. However, one of our biggest assets is our customer brand loyalty. They trust our products due to their quality and after sales service. Our technicians go to at least half a million houses every year to repair products and we have a call center that can handle one million calls per year. Service is a key point in Haceb's strategy. Secondly, it is crucial to maintain the efficiency of our distribution networks and supply chain. Haceb is building alliances with suppliers, both local and international. We are also establishing partnerships with international brands, universities in Colombia, and designers abroad. </p><h4>What are Haceb's key export markets today?</h4><p>Brazil is an important market, but unfortunately, it is difficult to export in this region in our industry. Venezuela was a major partner for us but due to recent policies, we have limited operations in that market. In the past Venezuela made up at least 20% of our sales. Today Ecuador is an organic partner but we are experiencing some difficulties there as well because the government is closing down the inputs, mainly due to a trade balance. Ecuador is a US dollar economy and as there is a drop in oil prices, among other factors, input and output must be balanced. Ecuador is also reducing its imports from many countries. So while Venezuela and Ecuador were our biggest clients in the past, today Brazil holds that title. </p><h4>What do you feel needs to be done in Colombia to improve institutional collaboration between the public and private sectors to increase competitiveness?</h4><p>Management is a good example—integrity and trust are needed. There are companies that form successful partnerships with local governments in Medellí­n and in Antioquia, and there is trust on both sides. In terms of ties in the academic arena we have a collaboration project called Universidad Empresa Estado. In one example, Haceb partnered a university to develop an efficient water heater, as a result of which a patent was registered jointly by the Universidad de Antioquia and Haceb. We pay royalties to the university for this new product that is 15% more energy efficient, and the only product that can adjust automatically to its altitude. This means that it works equally well in Bogotá and Cartagena. Our engineers and the university's engineers worked for more than four years to create a real solution that became commercialized. Now, Haceb is returning this added value to the university via royalties earned through sales. The fact is that oil and energy add less and less to GDP, and the government understands that industry requires a boost to safeguard the country's strategic interests. History has shown that only countries with strong industrial sectors survive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[step-on-the-gas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2014 you were one of the largest foreign investors in Colombia with investments reaching almost $450 million. How has this been allocated?</h4><p>Essentially, our investments of around $450 million were focused on the port. We enlarged our on-land capacity and also installed a direct loading system, which has been in operation since late March 2014. Today we have a port with a capacity of 60 million tons. We have increased our rolling stock and maintain the same infrastructure for the mining operations, both in El Descanso and in La Loma. In time, La Loma will start to see a decrease in production, at which point we will switch the production focus to El Descanso north. Therefore, depending on the nature of the market, we anticipate opening El Descanso south, Rincón Hondo, and Similoa soon thereafter, once we get the environmental licenses.</p><h4>How important is the FENOCO train line to realizing full port capacity?</h4><p>It is essential, and we have a 41% participation in FENOCO. The railroad accounts for 100% of our coal movement to the port. With the constitutional court decision to restrict nighttime railroad operations in Bosconia, and thereafter in Algarrobo and Zona Bananera, capacity has decreased by more than 25%. And now that we cannot operate at night, mining operations in the area will be hard hit. This decision is having a major impact on us, but it also sets a bad precedent for the development of the railroads in general. The decision is supposed to stay until we implement certain measures that reduce noise. Those measures have already been taken by FENOCO. The final measure involves installing buffers, or vegetation, to provide noise insulation. And having received an approval from the environmental authority, it will move to the town tribunal. We should then receive approval to resume 24-hour operations. Last year, our total production volume exceeded 27 million tons with exports of around 24 million tons.</p><h4>What are your forecasts for this year?</h4><p>This year we are targeting production of around 30 million tons. Yet at this point, without knowing when the restrictions might be lifted, it is impossible to estimate with any accuracy. I believe that it will be difficult, though not impossible, to achieve our 30 million ton target if the night restriction is lifted soon. We have installed capacity at the mines to produce over 30 million tons. </p><h4>You are currently in the process of establishing large gas projects on the Caribbean coast. What are your plans there? </h4><p>We are developing projects for the production of coal bed methane gas both in La Guajira and Cesar. In La Guajira, we are working on an agreement with Cerrejon to coordinate the mining and gas related activities. This agreement has the support of the Minister of Mines. In the case of Cesar, we have advanced and we are just waiting for the environmental license that will allow us to start the production of gas. It will be the first coal-based methane gas project in Colombia. </p><h4>Which specific technologies render your operations environmentally friendly?</h4><p>Our mining plans are always undertaken taking into account the environment, developing and implementing state of the art technological solutions to mitigate environmental impacts. This is done on an operational level at the mines, with the railway transportation system, and with the direct loading systems at the port. </p><h4>Do you feel that the current royalties system allows for effective wealth distribution in the communities that you work in? </h4><p>We saw problems in the beginning and promoted the creation of a group to oversee how royalties were being spent in the region. We have supported this group, economically and training-wise, and the members are people from communities and universities. It is basically an oversight committee. Today, they have modified the law and the municipalities are receiving far fewer royalties. This has been a problem for all the mining and oil projects in Colombia, because the community starts to feel that the projects are not as important for them as they used to be, because they don't receive as many royalties as in the past. Now the problem is that there are many municipalities in the country that do not have mining or oil projects, but that still need royalties to be spent on the development of their communities. We have always tried to work with communities and identify their needs, which while easy to say is difficult to accomplish given the sheer extent of their needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the reason behind Swiss Re reentering the Colombian market?</h4><p>The company has been active for over 150 years as the Swiss Re Group. We have been doing business in Latin America for about 120 years, and entered the Colombian market 70 years ago. We serve the market from a number of locations. As a reinsurance company, we do not require a local presence in each country. We receive support from our Zurich office as well as from New York, Miami, Mexico City, Sao Paolo, and Bogotá. Those are the locations in which we have people supporting our Colombian business. We opened a local office two years ago to sustain existing relationships, generate additional business and new talent. </p><h4>Over the past two years multinational re-insurance and insurance groups have decided to enter and re-enter the Colombia market. Why now?</h4><p>There are many factors. One of them is rising capitalization in the worldwide insurance business. Growth in mature markets is not as fast as in emerging ones. For example, in 2013, business growth worldwide was at 1.4%. Emerging markets registered 7.4% growth, and advanced markets just 0.3%. International capital is looking to expand into high-growth markets, one of which is Colombia. The investment environment in Colombia is conducive to capital inflows. </p><h4>You recently acquired Seguros Confianza. How will this enhance your reach into mining, energy and construction? How exactly has the integration process taken place? </h4><p>In 2010, Swiss Re Group's strategy was revised. We chose to increase our growth in commercial insurance markets. We identified three main growth areas, namely high growth markets, longevity and mortality business and corporates. We created holding companies and three subsidiaries to cater for each. Swiss Re Corporate Solutions focuses on corporate business, and became the 51% shareholder of a company in Colombia. Our traditional markets remain within Swiss Re Reinsurance. The Admin Re subsidiary purchases closed books of business that need efficient administration.  </p><h4>What is the strategy for 4G projects, and what encouraged you to invest in 4G in Colombia?</h4><p>In the reinsurance segment of Swiss Re, high-growth markets, longevity and mortality are our main focus areas. We evaluate local opportunities based on their economic growth potential. These include infrastructure, agribusinesses, housing and mining. Infrastructure is a key industry. New construction is taking place in the country through Agencia Nacional de Infrastructura (ANI) and Invias. There is potential to offer reinsurance coverage for these projects as well as for existing infrastructure that is not as well protected as in other countries. 4G is one of our key priorities today. We work together with reinsurance brokers and the insurance companies to meet the government's expectations in covering this investment.</p><h4>How does the strategy for consolidation in the Colombian market differ from elsewhere in the region?</h4><p>Our responsibility at the local office is for the Andean region, namely Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. We are consolidating our position in the markets for the insurance, reinsurance and the broker sectors. Insurance companies are looking to stay in Colombia for the long term, bringing new products, capacities and services. Nevertheless, a local presence and local knowledge from local companies are valuable assets for the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Regarding your investment in TGI, why did you decide to purchase the entire stake last year?</h4><p>It was one of the alternatives when the investment was made in around  2010-11. Citi Venture Capital International entered the business and had the expectation of generating a large amount of profit. The company developed rapidly, as it initially had the capacity to transport 420 mcf and managed to transport 730 mcf/day in the last year. It also extended its existing grid by 300km and completed a 3,970km gas transportation network. As a result of this increase in sales, the financial profile of the company reached an optimal level. Given these conditions, it was appropriate to consider the acquisition of a stake. We analyzed it thoroughly and the shares were bought for approximately $880 million. TGI paid less to reacquire these shares than CVCI originally paid for 32% of the shares.</p><h4>What is GEB'S strategy to enter Brazil and Chile?</h4><p>The investment plan of GEB is backed by around $7.5 billion, and is projected until 2018. This plan included the purchase of TGI, which involved an acquisition of resources for around $2.1 billion. This would translate into a $1.1 billion investment per year. We are currently analyzing our capability of acquiring debt and the commitments with the risk-rating companies to carry out this investment plan, in terms of resource availability and the debt that the company could take on without straining cash flow, the current investments, or the maintenance of our current infrastructure. We are evaluating this investment portfolio in transmission projects that are already under way involving distribution of electricity or transport and distribution of gas. These are our main interests; however, we can also evaluate projects in electricity generation, with both conventional and non-conventional sources of energy.</p><h4>How are you developing strategic alliances with non-conventional producers of energy?</h4><p>Due to our recognition as a solid energy-related company, we receive one proposal per month from parties that are interested in these non-conventional energy-generating projects in Latin America. We have prioritized and identified the essence of these alternative electricity and gas distribution models, and evaluated these proposals accordingly to build our investment portfolio on a five-year plan. Last year we presented a few initiatives, but only the re-purchase of the TGI shares was concluded. We presented an offer last year to the Peruvian government to build the Peruvian gasoduct, in collaboration with other representative gas transporting companies such as Cempra, IGDF, and others. We also offered to acquire 100% of a gas distribution company in Monterrey called CMG. However, these offers failed to bear any results for the company. GEB was also evaluating the possibility of re purchasing the shares that Ecopetrol has in Empresa Energí­a de Bogotá (EEB); however, it was not viable as it wouldn't generate additional profit and would compromise around $500 million in valuable resources. We are currently exploring the purchase of the 43% stake that Ecopetrol is selling in Invercolsa. We would have to evaluate how to avoid the restrictions that the company has as the owner of the most important gas transportation company, with the possibility of a strategic alliance in operations. GEB is making an offer for three prime projects of the UPME expansion, which are located in the Caribbean region, Ituango, and the North West region. The project aims to increase the level of national electricity transmission up to 500,000 volts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What action can you take at the BVC to help investors distinguish between companies that will be affected by the falling price of oil and those that will not?</h4><p>It is up to the investment community to understand and distinguish what is going on in a given market. At the management level there is little that we can do but ensure full transparency and disclosure. Ensuring that the general public understands the overall environment in Colombia, the region, and the world is crucial since the financial crisis led to the bulk of capital flows around the world not being driven by fundamentals, but by the monetary policies of big central banks. When there are such major changes in monetary policy it can undermine the economy. There are companies in Colombia not connected to the oil sector, but that have been affected because they were caught in the middle of this massive capital flow and change in investment sentiment toward commodity-procuring countries. If you consider the specifics of the company, nothing has changed. The price may have dropped by 20-30%, and this seems unfair, but the risk evaluation remains the same. It would be fair to say that Colombia is undervalued at current levels. It is no surprise that the country, given the relevance of oil in its export basket, has experienced such an effect on the exchange rate and overall attitudes toward the market. If you look at domestic dynamics and specific non-oil related companies in the market, it appears that the correction went somewhat too far. The market is just now adjusting itself.</p><h4>In February you launched a roadmap concerning the developments of the BVC on infrastructure and internalization. Could you talk us through the primary areas of improvement in the institution?</h4><p>We have three main pillars in our overall strategy for the exchange and for the market. These are related to improving market conditions to encourage growth and ensure that the BVC grows in parallel. One of these is to foster quality markets, and we are aiming to guarantee that international standards are followed, whereby businesses feel comfortable operating in Colombia. Transparency as assessed by the research of brokerage firms, along with better investor access to information and sounder advice, are important elements of this. Moreover, improving liquidity, attracting market makers, reducing the bid-offer spread, and improving the quality of price relation through better regulations and higher quality products are also crucial. The second pillar is related to the internationalization of the Colombian market. This is where the MILA initiative comes into its own, linking markets together to create greater critical mass and attract more foreign participation in our local market. There are also efforts to promote investments such as the Colombia Inside-Out program, which creates awareness. The third pillar in the traditional structure concerns improving market infrastructure. Today's highly competitive world requires international standards, risk mitigation, and clear internal mechanisms that widely instill confidence, as well as financial security, DMA access for both local and international participants, and more general improvements to market infrastructure. One of the main initiatives in which we are involved is the introduction of CPP clearing for the equity market. Colombia is the fourth largest market in Latin America. The three larger markets have CCP in their equity markets, with the last one to introduce this being Chile. There is significant pressure on exchanges in general, not just on the BVC, to diversify their sources and revenue, given the rising pressure in traditional business areas. Another pillar involves branching out into other IT services related to financial transactions and the interaction of participants in financial markets. Branching out into such services is something in which we are particularly interested. We have already started work on this by creating partnerships. We have branched out into providing prices to add value to all portfolios in the local market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the bank's performance on the Bolsa de Valores (BVC) over the past year, and the reasons for that growth?</h4><p>We have had a positive performance on the stock exchange during the period. The history of Bancolombia is closely linked to our country and people. About 20 years ago, I also had the fortune to be part of the team that helped Banco Industrial Colombiana, which later became Bancolombia, list on the NYSE, the first Colombian company to do so. We have always stood out for our growth, corporate governance, and transparency. Ours was a very differently structured company to the majority of banking corporations in Latin America in that it is designed with the citizen in mind. Last year, our objective was to democratize the organization. We wanted two things, we wanted more people to become shareholders, which we achieved, whereby our 20,000 shareholders rose to 75,000. We did it not only in compliance with Basel III stipulations, but more importantly because we wanted to sustain our growth shared with that of the country. We rank first in all commercial segments, although we were never interested in becoming the largest bank, but simply the best in terms of service, which is a qualitative issue, rather than a quantitative one. Our motto is to be profitable for our shareholders, efficient, growth-driven, and sustainable. And our mission is to be the Banca Más Humana (Most Humane Bank). All these factors have contributed to our posting one of the strongest performances on the BVC over the past year, in spite of the turbulence in international markets and the devaluation of oil. We have still been capable of advancing in line with the Colombian economy, on moderate growth of 4.5% in 2014, which in the international context is very good. Ultimately I put this growth down to having an excellent team and human capital behind us, being very clear in our strategy and the way in which we interact with our clients and the rest of the world, our allies, and providers, and a philosophy that fosters confidence. </p><h4>Over the coming year you have an investment plan of $300 million, how exactly will this be allocated?</h4><p>$150 million of our investment plan will be focused on Colombia, $100 million in Panama, and $50 million in El Salvador, principally in technology-related and strategic projects. The most important could be in El Salvador. We have started establishing the Banco Agrí­cola Salvador, which will be one of the most important infrastructural projects in the country, and moreover, one of the most state of the art data centers in Latin America. Meanwhile, we continue investing in digital channels. Our strategic projects account for some $60 million and $14 million, respectively. Today we have around 1,267 branches in Colombia, 4,800 own-brand ATMs, 5,000 banking correspondents, and 206 kiosks.</p><h4>What is your strategy for regional growth over the coming year? </h4><p>We have five milestones of growth for next year. The first is related to efficiency; therefore our financial decisions are focused on achieving more with fewer resources. We also want to focus on humane banking, which refers to improving service and prioritizing the client. Other milestones are innovation and technology. In summary, these five factors make up the profitable consolidation of growth for next year. We have an extensive list of projects to be executed either this year or over the next few years. We are expecting 12% growth in our portfolio, from 10-15%. This is an important figure as it denotes that we are growing two to three times faster than GDP across all our markets of operation. Additionally this year, despite external pressure due to current global and local macroeconomic conditions, we expect a positive performance. In pursuit of profitability, we consider our participation in the Dow Jones index essential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What fiscal and monetary measures is the government taking to redress the balance of imports and exports in order to maintain competitiveness in manufacturing and other industries?</h4><p>Monetary policy is designed and implemented by an independent Central Bank following an inflation targeting regime. On the fiscal front, in April 2013, the government implemented a zero-tariff policy on imported capital goods and raw materials not produced domestically under the PIPE (Stimulus Plan for Employment and Productivity). This policy reduced tariffs to 0% for almost 3,100 items over a two-year period, with a deep impact on industrial activity and competitiveness, as it reduces costs for supply chains, which leads to a lower final product price. On the other hand, it represents relief in tax payments for the industry of approximately $550 million for this two-year period. Since its implementation in August of 2013, total imports of raw materials increased 9% in the first year of the policy, while capital goods have reverted their tendency and increased 3% during the same period.</p><h4>What structural and regulatory adjustments need to be made to ensure that FDI—particularly in the hydrocarbons related industries—leads to a greater real contribution to GDP?</h4><p>Different structural measures have already been enforced in the past years in order to eliminate barriers for oil production. The royalties reform allowed companies to redirect resources towards regional investments to increase competitiveness, mainly through transportation, road infrastructure, and greater warranties for producers. Additionally, in 2014, we took important steps toward reducing obstacles related to environmental licensing and problems with native communities. Furthermore, with the recent drop in oil prices, we are now structuring a plan to boost the oil industry in order to ease investments in oil exploration and production. This plan entails private and public initiatives, some of which have already been included in the current National Development Plan, such as the reduction of tax rates on royalties paid by oil companies. Another proposal is to allow adjustments in the production agreements for the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH). We are still studying additional proposals together with the private sector. </p><h4>Given Colombia's relatively strong GDP growth on the continent, what are the greatest vulnerabilities facing the Colombian economy over the coming years, in terms of avoiding the same cyclical recession that has befallen its neighbors? </h4><p>Although the drop in the oil price will definitely have an effect on economic growth, it is necessary to highlight that Colombia is not as commodity-dependent as other countries in the region. While oil extraction accounts for 5.2% of total GDP for Colombia, in Peru and Chile the mining sector represents almost 12% of their respective economies. Meanwhile, employment in our mining sector accounts for just 1% of national employment. Furthermore, the real depreciation of the Colombian peso will contribute to boost tradable non-oil related exports such as manufacturing products, which have already started to show recovery signs. On this front, vulnerabilities related to the behavior of Venezuela represent less of a threat to our local economic outlook. In 2014, Colombian exports to Venezuela represented just 3.6% of total exports and their contribution has been decreasing over the past few years. Moreover, imports from Venezuela have shrunk to just 0.7% of total imports. On the non-tradable side, construction, financial services, and retail continue to evidence strong leading indicators. Besides, the unemployment rate has achieved historical lows, while formal employment continues to grow. These achievements in the labor market and positive developments on poverty reduction have given birth to a stronger middle class that will support private consumption. In this sense, the biggest risk to the downside remains in the fiscal arena, especially if the drop in prices turns out to become structural at current low levels. Nevertheless, regardless of the scenario, the Ministry of Finance is completely committed to the fulfillment of fiscal rule in order to guarantee macroeconomic stability, as well as to continue nourishing confidence in our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the reasonCartagena's dramatic economic performance?</h4><p>Mining and energy-related and hydrocarbon-derived products have played a key role in our regional GDP. This sector in Cartagena uses state of the art technologies and we strive to add value to these industries that work with primary materials. For these reasons we have partnerships with prominent multinational groups such as Mexichem, Dow, and we are now competing with the refinery of Cartagena. We also need to keep in mind two other sectors that are experiencing considerable growth, namely tourism, particularly business tourism and the boom in events and conventions. We should also aim to become a hub for cultural tourism, principally cinema festivals and exhibitions, the Hay Festival, and classical music. Those have generated a strong cultural dynamic in the city. Also, thanks to the law that extends tax exemptions to new hotels, such facilities have gravitated towards Cartagena, including multinational chains such as Hyatt, BHL, and InterContinental. Another segment contributing significant growth to the city is our port industry. The ports in Cartagena today are not just the most efficient in Colombia, but are also a model to follow at a Latin American level. Many service industries are increasingly looking to Cartagena. Therefore, tourism, port activity, and mining-energy related sales have driven growth; these three sectors have together boosted a fourth sector, namely construction. Over the past 15 years, we have experienced a construction boom in residential buildings, commerce, malls, and tourist developments. 15 years ago, Cartagena did not have a single mall, while today we have numerous such retail venues. </p><h4>To what extent have the FTA's made manufacturing in Cartagena's more competitive?</h4><p>In primary materials, particularly concerning hydrocarbon-derived products such as plastic containers, the FTA's have benefited us. However these companies have naturally been affected by the falling price for of petrol. Manufacturing is continuing to grow in various forms, the growth of the petro-chemicals industry is on the rise, thanks to the efficiency of the ports. These manufacturers will become increasing competitive as specialized ports such as Puerto Bahí­a start to operate. Other related industries, such as shipyards, producing vessels ranging from 5-10,000 tons, are booming.</p><h4>There are numerous large infrastructural projects underway around Cartagena. How are these projects set to impact the city's industries?</h4><p>One of our comparative weaknesses has been our inability to fully take advantage of the benefits of globalization, because of our underdeveloped infrastructure. There are certain infrastructural projects, however, that will give our industry a huge boost. At the moment, the greatest impediment to the competiveness of our industry is the cost of inter-city transport. The navigability of the Rio-Magdalena will rectify that, and it will effectively be a source of the Canal del Dique. This will change the dynamic of commerce not only in the city of Cartagena, but also throughout Colombia. We are also at a huge crossroads with regard to 4G infrastructural projects, and the dual carriageway being constructed by the Ruta del Sol will create greater connectivity between the coastal cities of Cartagena, Barranquilla, and Santa Marta. Our main infrastructural weak point in the city is our health infrastructure. Accordingly, we have planned the construction of three large hospitals. Hospital Bocagrande is currently under total renovation, and we also have a new hospital being constructed in the Parque de las Americas Free Zone. The fourth great infrastructural project, relates to the development of educational colleges. The Chamber of Commerce is developing a strategic 20-year expansion plan for the educational infrastructure to extend to those most in need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you arrived in office, what have been your priorities regarding public policies?</h4><p>One of my top priorities was to cut the social debt the city had and develop Cartagena's government alongside the private sector, for the benefit of its citizens. This is in effect our strategic development plan. Luckily, we have been able to involve many people from the private sector in this process and that has enabled us to achieve a lot in two years of activity. We have managed to change the perception many people had of Cartagena, a feeling of lack of confidence and credibility, and level of institutionalization.</p><h4>In the next year you have allocated almost $1 billion dollars for infrastructural projects . What role will this play in the further development of the city?</h4><p>Infrastructure is a key subject for us and we understand it is a sector that has driven the catch up between the private and the public sector. Infrastructure develops the city. For example, one of the key projects is the Transcaribe massive transport system. No other city government had invested as much in infrastructure as us. In this context, Transcaribe has been a key infrastructure project for the city in the last 12 years; however, we have added dynamism to the project. For example, we have tendered the operation of all Transcaribe bus lines for around $94 million each. Additionally, we have finished the courtyard of Transcaribe for $25 million. We have even managed to obtain some funds from the national government for this project, whereas in the past, the national government regarded Transcaribe as a failed project. I hope that by the end of 2015, Transcaribe will be operating. This year we will complete a historical record of works and investment in roads. For example, we paved over 320 roads in Cartagena, equal to 40 miles. We also carried out record investments in the education network in Cartagena; we invested over $29 million in around 76 district schools. Education is one of the most effective tools to achieve change in society. The same applies to the health industry, where we invested $36 million into 30 new public hospitals in the city. Finally, the Public Market project saw the creation of a PPP for the management and construction of Cartagena's Public Market. We have refurbished other public markets across the city, increasing the area and number of sellers. All these works have been accompanied by public policies to develop Cartagena in key fields such as the port and tourism. We have the port that manages over 80% of Colombia's cargo, we are the second city in terms of air connection opportunities. Cartagena accounts for around 6% of the GDP, and we are the alternative headquarter city of the government of Colombia. </p><h4>What role can tourism play in the further development of the city?</h4><p>Previous administrations did not put a lot emphasis on the development of the tourism industry in Cartagena. We have changed this and we understand of the importance of this industry; one of our goals is to increase the number of cruises arriving in the city and that's why we build the tourism port of Cartagena with a budget of $7 million. We also developed a project to create more green areas and parks through the sponsorship of the private sector and so far we have developed more than 30 such partnerships, which have made of our a city an even more beautiful one, which can only boost tourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nutresa is today the fourth largest food company in Latin America, with a total market capital of $6.7 billion. How is the group continuing to expand its Portfolio, domestically and abroad?</h4><p>In 2013, international sales accounted for 39.5% of our sales, which in total amounted to around $3.4 billion with an EBITDA margin of 14% (Proforma figures). This group arose out of the development of several companies, and was founded almost 100 years ago in the 1920s. The National Chocolates Company (Compañí­a Nacional de Chocolates) was the result of a merger between nine or ten small chocolate companies, recently branching into other businesses as well. We have 41 manufacturing plants, and our products are sold in 72 countries on five continents. As a result of our portfolio, we do not depend on a single commodity, none of which represents more than 9% of the total cost. It allows us to have a better management of commodity risk. The main commodity today is packaging material. The business model of the Nutresa Group is based on three pillars, the first and most important being people. We have more than 38,000 employees—12,000 beyond Colombia. These are crucial for us because our company has a robust innovation model based on committed and well-trained people. The second pillar is brands, and we have a strong portfolio that reflects the respect we have for local taste and preferences. We have 16 brands that generate in excess of $50 million. We prefer to consolidate our brands to develop a stronger market status and pursue synergy in marketing investments. In Colombia, the average market share is 60.5%. During the first nine months of 2014, we have grown 8.9% in Colombia, while the finance minister is forecasting GDP growth of close to 4.7%. Over the past eight years, we have grown by 10.6%, and by 7.8% over the past five years.</p><h4>With regard to the various business units, are you concentrating on any one in particular? </h4><p>In Colombia, for instance, we are present in the cold cuts business; a particularly local segment and we have a company in Panama and another in Venezuela. Operations in the latter are currently limited at just 1.8% of our total sales and 0.5% of liabilities. In Colombia, we have a market share of 73% in cold cuts, and are growing. We are leveraging the currently positive dynamic of the Colombian economy for all of our businesses. Meanwhile, we are also focusing heavily on the biscuits industry in Colombia, US, and Peru, and have a 53% local market share. It is the most aggressive and competitive environment in Colombia because we have all the global players. But we are growing based on solid innovation.</p><h4>How significant an effect on exports do free trade agreements (FTAs) have?</h4><p>Free trade agreements such as the Pacific Alliance are positive, but bring new challenges. It all depends on how you prepare to take advantage of the possibilities that these agreements result in. Grupo Nutresa is present in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico—among other nations—at the same time we are present in Malaysia. It is not just luck, it is related to our preparation to be in the right place and use the productive platforms available. We look at free trade agreements as a two-way relationship. We will not only have access to raw materials and technology but also to markets. If we look at Mexico, it is a big country, and we believe that with innovation and a strong value offer we can increase that market and be part of their growth, and our location in Mexico has easy access to the ports so we can export from there. We can sell there and send it to other countries in the region, including the US, which is a strong neighbor, so Mexico will improve its own capabilities and experience the direct impact of US growth. This will be promoted by our new plant in Guadalajara, for which we expect to have sales in the first three months of next year, and which adds to our current facilities in Mexico. Our main goal is to duplicate the size of Grupo Nutresa by 2020 and maintain the EBITDA margin at a rate of 12-14%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Colombian banking sector saw growth figures of around 11% in 2014, which is mirrored closely by Banco Bogotá, your principal bank. Could you give us a brief overview of what you believe to have underpinned this rise?</h4><p>We look at our growth during 2014 in two ways. On the one hand, there was a slowdown when compared to the growth of previous years. On the other hand, it represented rather healthy growth when compared to other Latin American countries and when compared to the country's growth of around 4.5% in real terms. More importantly, Colombia's financial sector showed adequate provisioning of its loans, transparent and strong balance sheets and good capitalization ratios. Additionally, there were sustainable and adequate returns on equity. </p><h4>Your listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was a long awaited move. Why did you feel last September was the right time, and how will this listing change the future direction of the group in the medium- to long-term?</h4><p>The strategic benefits are easy to enumerate: deepening the ownership structure of the group in terms of attracting more sophisticated global investors, increasing the liquidity of the stock and benefiting from better analyst coverage internationally. We did have to do an enormous amount of previous legwork prior to even consider entering the NYSE; specially, because we wanted to do so with a fully registered stock.  Among the most important milestones that we hat to achieve were the reconciliation of our financial statements into US GAAP and compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. It is worth mentioning that years prior to our NYSE debut, we had already launched an IPO in Colombia and several follow-ons.  As a result, by the time the market was right to launch our New York offering, we already had about 60-70,000 small local shareholders. </p><h4>You plan to finance COP12 billion of 4G projects and participate as financier and constructor. Could you talk us through your strategy in terms of maximizing value, and how you want to lead this process?</h4><p>The financial system in Colombia is large and robust enough to finance 4G on its own. The total investment value to build the three waves of 4G infrastructure roads is about COP45 billion. Of that, the financial system had to finance about COP40 billion, which includes capex and some opex.  This amount (COP40 billion) is about 11-13% of the nation's total loan portfolio.  If you take into account that this financing will happen in a span of 5 to 7 years, you can easily see that it does not pose an undue burden on the Country's loan portfolio.  My numbers have to be somewhat adjusted because one must take into consideration that the banks' loan portfolio is part consumer and part commercial, but the point I am making remains the same. Also, in the presence of the slowdown of the economy, 4G becomes a great source of growth for the banks and the country.  I have told the Government that it does not have to look any further, and that the banks are willing to and capable of financing 4G.  Some involvement of foreign lenders will probably be needed if concessionaires request that the Government repays up to 25% of their total investment in dollars, as the law currently allow them to do. Aval will also participate in 4G as a concessionaire through our merchant banking arm, Corficolombiana, which is the largest toll road concessionaire in this country; with the toll roads that it has already been awarded under 4G, it will consolidate itself as such.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Trinidad and Tobago's role in global democracy and what steps are being taken to move forward in the international scene?</h4><p>Trinidad and Tobago is at a pivotal point, both globally and hemispherically. Our visitors like the Vice President of the United States of America, the President of the People's Republic of China, and Japan's Prime Minister are evidence of this pivotal point. In terms of global diplomacy, we have always intended to operate by certain fundamental principles, anchored in human rights, peace, security, and democracy. We have attempted to play a mediation role in global affairs wherever we are present and in that sense, we have been able to gain the respect of the global community as a country that takes its position on the basis of fundamental principles which are enunciated in international relations.  We are also proactive in global issues such as the Arms Trade Treaty. Not only did Trinidad and Tobago participate with other countries like the UK and Australia to make sure that the Treaty was actualized at the UN, we also offered ourselves as a site to host the Secretariat. That decision will be made later this year. We have also been able to secure support from several major groupings including the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC). On the subject of climate change, we have also played a very important role. We co-chaired the climate change negotiation with Germany up to December 2014 and we are preparing for the upcoming meeting in Paris, which will focus on the agreement. In global diplomacy, we have been very proactive on critical issues, as well as being contemplative on issues of conflict.</p><h4>As the leading CARICOM exporter to and importer from Colombia, what are the main areas of growth between both nations?</h4><p>During the last few years, we have taken a very deliberate position to open our borders to Latin America. We joined the Latin American Development Bank as a full member and we are an observer member to the Pacific Alliance, in which Colombia is a key player. Of course, we promoted the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) as an important regional institution and influenced them to agree to include the Caribbean in the management and governance. We have taken a deliberate position to shift our foreign relations to engage with Latin America. In our view Colombia is an important and critical country. Not only is Colombia our neighbor, but there have been strong cultural links between Trinidad and Tobago and Colombia over the years. We acknowledge Colombia's recent successes in terms of its economy and its thrust for peace. The Colombian Foreign Minister is expected to visit Trinidad and Tobago shortly. We have a number of bilateral issues that we want to consolidate. We have also worked very closely with the Association of Caribbean States; we have deepened our relationship with Colombia over the last few years. There are many other areas where we have been able to work closely, including Cuba. We have always supported the removal of the embargo. Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean countries took that position historically in 1972 and have consistently supported that cause. We were engaged in recent times with diplomacy to ensure that Cuba attends the Summit of the Americas which will take place later this year and we are pleased to see that the US has agreed to open diplomatic relations with them. We look forward to the eventual removal of the embargo.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, the commercial volume in trade between Colombia and Costa Rica exceeded $350 million, with $277 million in goods and services consumed in the Costa Rican market versus $79 million in Colombia. How can Costa Rica shift the balance of trade following the potential approval of the free trade agreement with Colombia? </h4><p>The free trade agreement between Colombia and Costa Rica has been endorsed but it is not yet effective, as a chamber of the Colombian parliament has yet to approve it. It is a modern commercial agreement that establishes a legal framework with clear, stable and transparent rules. It provides trust and security to existing commercial and investment relationships. The agreement encourages a favorable environment for the development of new investments from both sides and for an increase in the levels of commerce and cooperation. Additionally, the treaty intends to strengthen the relationship with South American countries, given that Colombia has been the second destination for Costa Rican products exported in the region. The effectiveness of this free trade agreement would improve access the Colombian market and open new commercial opportunities for the current and potential offer of goods and service exports from Costa Rica. Moreover, it is a toll to promote and develop new investments, co-investments, and strategic alliances between productive sectors and, to create greater opportunities for consumers. It is a valuable instrument to open new exporting opportunities. However, the task of promoting exports and of coordinated management for trade maximization will allow the strengthening of the export capacity not only to Colombia, but also with all countries with which we have commercial agreements. Beyond the balance of trade, the main interest is to achieve a more inclusive commercial flow, in which a larger number of small and medium companies participate. In this sense, Colombia is a market with ideal conditions due to its size—comparable to Central America, its geographic proximity, and culture. </p><h4>What would be Costa Rica's competitive advantage in its contribution to the Pacific Alliance and how would it benefit from becoming a member? </h4><p>Regional economic integration is an essential element for our countries to progress towards greater economic and social development and better quality of life. In this framework, the Pacific Alliance should be seen as an alternative to propel growth and development, based on increasing the competitiveness of the economies concerned, and a deep integration that transcends the purely commercial aspect. This initiative offers the opportunity to establish strategic partnerships that favor the development of investments, increase real and effective competition, improve productivity and the competitiveness of goods and services, and facilitate commerce between countries, fostering better integration with other regions. Costa Rica has closely followed the Pacific Alliance as it gradually approached the initiative. As with other member countries of the Pacific Alliance, our country offers a pro-business investment environment that we continue to work on in order to improve and strengthen. Proof of this lies in our efforts such as the Moin Container Terminal and the modernization of ground crossings. We have development levels comparable with other member countries of the alliance and share a common vision of the role of commerce and the development of investment, as well as of the importance of cooperation as a catalyst for progress. We coincide in our end goal of promoting a deeper regional integration in order to achieve greater growth and to promote greater proximity to other regions, particularly Asia Pacific.</p><h4>What could Colombia learn from Costa Rica's industrial reconversion program that would help encourage exports through free trade zones? </h4><p>Free zones are a great appeal for those who wish to invest in our country. This system offers a series of fiscal benefits and competitive advantages that characterize our country: the talent and value of our workers, political stability and a strategic location. The attraction of direct foreign investment is associated to the promotion and diversification of exports, the search for improving and refining products manufactured in the country. The government offers benefits and incentives to companies and investors that are interested in settling in the country as long as they comply with the legal requisites and obligations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru and Colombia's combined bilateral trade is approximately $2.2 billion, what are the main pillars of trade between the two countries, and in what areas has the Pacific Alliance boosted this bilateral trade?</h4><p>In 2013, total commercial trade with Colombia was $2.25 billion. Colombia is Peru's 13th main commercial partner, and the fourth main Latin-American destination for Peruvian exports, with $800 million of exports in 2013. Between January and November 2014, we registered $1.14 billion in exports to Colombia, which is an increase of 48.8% with regards to 2013. The main products exported are chemical products, jewelry, textiles, copper, plastic products, crude oil derivatives, sugar, and zinc. However, there is also the impact of the Pacific Alliance on Peru-Colombia relations, with the impulse that our governments are giving to the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) allowing for more alternatives for investment and a deeper market together with Chile and Mexico. Peru is committed to the consolidation of the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA) with Mexico, Chile and Colombia. To make a go of it, we must continue working on homogenization of the requirements for the regional issuance of fixed income instruments, facilitation of private pension funds' investments among the countries within the Pacific Alliance, harmonization of tax treatments among Pacific Alliance countries to reduce asymmetry and implementation of a common trading platform to allow faster and more cost effective regional securities trading. Another, important part of our relation with Colombia is that nation's experience of participating in the OECD's “Country Program", which includes a group of activities that help counties to boost their involvement with the OECD. We need all the help we can get from Colombia in this matter, because all Peruvians, as a nation, have the objective of becoming part of the OECD, which we aspire to achieve by 2021.</p><h4>In September, agreements were formed between Peru and Colombia's mining and energy sectors in order to facilitate sustainable extraction of minerals. What will be the benefits of such cooperation, and how will this impact international trade and investment?</h4><p>The Memorandum of Understanding will be an instrument of great importance in diversification and encouragement of technological and economic cooperation between the two countries, as well as in the cooperation between companies that work in the mining sector, in light of Peru's experience in the mining industry, the natural conditions of both countries, and also due to the presence of Peruvian companies that produce equipment and metallic constructions in Colombia during the stages of the mining cycle. Each country's domestic benefits from cooperation will reflect the implementation of “16 areas of cooperation," some of which represent a common interest, while others are a priority for either Colombia or Peru. In most cases, they are implemented through mutual visits of the representatives of public entities and private companies with the objective of experience exchange in mining and energy, excepting those special cases that call for other actions, such as the organization of the Bilateral Exhibition of machinery, equipment and services, and the encouragement of cooperation and promotion of investments. The impact of international commerce and investments will be achieved through the encouragement of cooperation in business sectors of each country in the form of purchase of machinery and mining equipment and metallic constructions for modernization of the sector in terms of security and automation of production processes. Bilateral exhibitions of machinery, equipment and services will be established. Also, technology and development transfers between the countries will take place, as well as investments in research and innovation activities and services for mining and energy sectors. Finally, encouragement and the promotion of mining investments in both countries will take place, creating favorable trade conditions, with the objective of investing in the start and development of new explorations, mining operations and energy projects.</p><h4>How are Peru and Colombia enhancing their cooperation to combat the illicit drug trade and what implications does this have for the economy, security, and trade of the Amazonian and border regions of Peru and Colombia?</h4><p>Peru and Colombia have important bilateral mechanisms for dialogue, coordination, and cooperation between the authorities in the fight against drugs. These include the Joint Commission on Drug Control, which aims to coordinate actions to counter the production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs. The Commission has held eight meetings to date. The last, held in Bogotá, Colombia, on December 2014, had the aim of strengthening bilateral dialogue on drug policy, as well as facilitating joint efforts to tackle illicit drug trafficking in border areas. This meeting allowed the authorities concerned to coordinate actions and exchange information and experience in supply reduction, demand reduction, alternative development, money laundering, judicial cooperation, and forfeiture. In 2014 Peru and Colombia established the Bi-national Cabinets as their highest political mechanism in order to enhance cooperation between the two countries, including the fight against illegal drugs trafficking and other related transnational illicit trade. At its first meeting it was agreed to give priority this year to the development of a common plan to control the activities of companies involved in the production of chemical precursors. This plan will include the exchange of information about each country's monitoring systems, trade, online surveillance and bordering control. Experts of both countries met again last December in Bogotá, where they exchanged ideas to further enhance cooperation in this field.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main pillars of trade between Chile and Colombia, and in what are areas of industry and trade is Chile is looking to develop further with Colombia in the coming years?</h4><p>The bilateral relations between Chile and Colombia have reached extraordinary levels, especially in the economic and commercial fields. To achieve this, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed in 2009 has contributed decisively. This agreement broadened and deepened the subjects of exchange between both countries. Every year, the number of Chilean goods and services exported to Colombia is increasing as well as the number of companies involved in these operations. And this incidentally has allowed reducing the traditional deficit in the trade balance we have with that country. We see many areas with a great potential for growth in Colombia that are interesting to Chile, such as the services sector, including information technology and software, mining and hydrocarbons, infrastructure, and biofuels. </p><h4>What diplomatic and economic assistance is Chile offering to Colombia toward the peace process? </h4><p>Chile has a tradition of contributing to regional peace, which has motivated us to be a companion country in the Colombian peace process. We have appointed a representative and a deputy representative who have actively participated in this cause. We also want to contribute together with regional countries in the post-conflict era, especially given our experience in transitional justice; that is to say, the set of policies that were taken after the military regime to repair the effects of human rights violations.</p><h4>The Pacific Alliance has emerged as one of the region's most promising unions. How do you plan to expand Chile's contribution to the Alliance, and its ability to work with neighboring Peru to grow the region's exports?</h4><p>Chile will continue to work on strengthening the Pacific Alliance through the main features of this mechanism of regional integration, namely a high degree of flexibility and pragmatism. From convergences between the four countries, Chile will look to succeed in issues that go beyond the purely commercial, but that nonetheless have clear commercial consequences. Likewise, we are working to strengthen technical cooperation with the 32 observer states by developing projects related to the pillars of the PA (free movement of persons, goods, services and investment, and cooperation); and looking to link these projects to the 18 existing technical groups, including the newly established groups for  Education and Mining Development. Regarding working with Peru, in the long-term, we are deepening intraregional trade, first through bilateral trade agreements and then through the initiatives of the PA and TPP. This will encourage regional trade and generate greater opportunities for our investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During the Summit of the Americas 2015, you raised several notions of Pan-American policymaking on behalf of Colombia based on respect and education. What is your vision for creating greater harmony and equality on the continent through education? </h4><p>I believe there is a greater conscience throughout the hemisphere of the crucial role that education must play in the development of our nations. It is a common understanding that without education we cannot prosper or have more equal societies; this leads to constructive conversations about common purposes that put some of the old debates behind us. In Latin America specifically we simply haven't done enough to harness the talents of our citizens and we must cooperate amongst ourselves and with others in order to leap forward. The world is not content to wait for us to catch up. This spirit was certainly reflected at the most recent Summit. Colombia proposed the creation of an Inter-American Education System that could support governments in formulating policies to significantly improve the quality of education and increase investments in knowledge, science, and technology. Our proposal was well received at the summit to the extent that the OAS, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Latin American Development Bank (CAF) all signed a letter of intent, in which they agreed to promptly put in motion the actions needed to move forward on this initiative.</p><h4>One of your re-election pledges was to lead the way to accession of the OECD. In what policy areas will convergence with the requirements prove the most challenging, and how do you intend to overcome these obstacles?</h4><p>Colombia has registered significant progress across all the policy areas in the accession process and we are optimistic that we will be ready by the end of this year. Clearly, there are some policy reforms that tend to be more difficult to carry out than others such as taxes and health because they may require new legislation or a broader consensus. Our government has taken on the task of communicating and engaging with all sectors of society and with the Colombian people to explain the long-term benefits of adopting best practices recommended by the OECD. We have found that these efforts have been successful in galvanizing support for most reforms that we believe will make our country more modern, transparent, and innovative.</p><h4>One of your domestic strategies for reducing regional discrepancies in productivity, representation, and equality is championed by the President in the Regions initiative. What are the main pillars of this strategy?</h4><p>This administration has focused on Colombia's regions since our first day in office. We set about working on reducing poverty, improving education, building new houses, and providing basic services like water and energy to people in areas that had been neglected for decades. But we also understood that Colombia's regions have enormous economic potential that must be unleashed over the long term. And so, we have also focused on creating the right conditions for sustainable development and prosperity, for instance by building next-generation highways, bridges, airports, and ports, and by connecting every municipality to broadband internet. Through the President in the Regions program I am able to closely follow up on hundreds of initiatives and be accountable to the Colombian people.</p><h4>You have recently estimated the cost of the peace process at COP54 billion over the next 10 years. Which stages and mechanisms of the peace process are most challenging for the state to address, for financial reasons and in terms of required structural adjustments to the economy?</h4><p>There are many challenges that will need to be addressed the day after a peace agreement is signed. Many of those will take years to resolve, but one particular area will require extraordinary efforts, including the sustainable development of our rural areas and the investments required to create a world-class agro-industrial sector; these are inexorably linked. The conflict has negatively impacted our ability to do both and the social and economic opportunity costs have been staggering. In addition, these are complex issues that must be dealt with in a sensible manner. But on the upside, according to the FAO, Colombia is one of only eight countries in the world that can significantly increase its food production. Most foreigners don't realize how vast Colombia is territorially; larger than Spain and France put together, so both the challenge and the opportunity are great. We have already begun putting the structures and resources into place that will put us on the right path. We are confident that in 10 years, Colombia's economy will have become structurally more diversified, not just in terms of agricultural production, but also in high-value exports based on science, technology, and innovation.</p><h4>Taxes generated from impuesto patrimonio will reach approximately COP8-10 billion annually. How will this tax be distributed and how do you perceive this impacting international investment dynamics in the country? </h4><p>Last August in my inauguration speech, I put forth three strategic priorities for Colombia over the next decade; a country at peace, with equity, and the most educated nation in Latin America. My job in these four years is to put Colombia on an irreversible path toward these objectives. Our investments in the National Development Plan reflect those priorities. We cannot be a country at peace if there is inequality. Long-term inequality can only be eradicated through education. And a highly educated nation is much less prone to resort to violence in a globalized world. This is a virtuous cycle that will make Colombia an even more attractive place for international investors. If we are already one of the best managed economies in the world and foreign investment is pouring in by the billions without having ended the conflict, one can only imagine what is possible in the Colombia that we want to be by 2025.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the immediate and long-term benefits of Colombia's potential accession to the OECD?</h4><p>We work with our member countries to help them establish better policies enabling better lives for their citizens. The accession process provides Colombia with the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive diagnosis of its public policies vis-í -vis the OECD's best practices. It is also an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms and upgrade legal and regulatory frameworks to increase their effectiveness. For instance, the OECD has recently provided in-depth comments and suggestions on different sections of Colombia's next National Development Plan. But this is also a two-way road. Learning from peers is also an important aspect of OECD membership. Our member countries will also benefit from Colombia's policy experience in dealing with its economic and social challenges.</p><h4>What are the most fundamental regulatory reforms that need to be undertaken to promote inclusive growth in Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia's economy has done remarkably well over the past decade. Strong growth was driven by an oil and mining boom, and by foreign direct investment in the commodity sector and broad-based investment. This has allowed for a rapid catch-up in GDP per capita relative to OECD economies. However, income inequality and labor informality are still very high. Poverty has declined, but old-age poverty is significantly higher than in most Latin American countries. Fewer than 40% of all Colombians have an old-age pension and half of the elderly live below the national extreme poverty line. The government provides old-age income support for the poor through the Colombia Mayor program, but the support is well below the poverty line. An in-depth reform of the pensions system and the old-age income support is required to increase coverage and equity. The minimum wage is high relative to the average wage, pushing low-skilled workers, youth, and those in less developed regions into the informal sector. Keeping minimum wage growth close to inflation would help with tackling informality.</p><h4>How should Colombia adapt to plummeting petrol prices?</h4><p>The Colombian economy needs to diversify beyond the oil and mining sector. The fading commodity boom requires policy action to sustain growth. Investment beyond the natural resource sector is needed to create formal jobs and reduce the high levels of income inequality. A comprehensive tax reform is needed. The gradual elimination of the net wealth tax on businesses approved in December 2014 was a step in the right direction. However, more can, and should, be done. In particular, a gradual reduction in corporate tax rates, broadening the corporate tax base by eliminating special regimes and taxing capital income more at the individual level would boost investment and make the tax system more progressive. More investment in transport infrastructure, as well as reforms to improve the business climate, such as better enforcement of bureaucratic procedures, improved monitoring of institutions vulnerable to corruption, and further reducing barriers to trade and competition in product markets will also help.</p><h4>What can be done to reduce tax evasion in Colombia, and how serious an obstacle is this to inclusive growth in the country? What other fiscal reforms ought to be prioritized in the country?</h4><p>Widespread tax evasion is a significant drag on tax revenues. Official estimates of VAT evasion are currently at around 25%, amounting to around 2% of GDP. While part of the high evasion reflects the overall high informality of the economy, institutional weaknesses in the tax and customs administration are also to blame. Strengthening and modernizing the tax administration (DIAN) would help reduce tax evasion. Tax revenues comprise about 20% of GDP, which is low compared to other Latin American countries and the OECD average. Lower oil revenues and the expiration of a number of taxes are putting strains on the budget at a time when social and development spending needs are rising. Heavy reliance on corporate income taxes reduces investment. At the same time, the redistributive impact of taxation is reduced because most income and wealth taxes are paid by firms, rather than households. All of this leads us to believe that Colombia needs a comprehensive tax reform that boosts revenues and shifts the tax burden to support more inclusive and green growth. Tax loopholes and exemptions that reduce the tax base and mainly favor the rich should be reduced significantly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The tourism sector represented around 12% of GDP in 2014. What actions drove that development, and which measures do you plan to implement to further boost its role in the economy?</h4><p>The tourism sector at an international level grows at an average of 4% annually, whereas in Colombia the figure has been touching 8%. At the same time we will close the year with a record 4 million visitors in Colombia. I am not satisfied with this because, for example, the Dominican Republic receives 22 million annual visitors. We are a rich country in terms of biodiversity and have huge potential, and hence are currently trying to boost promotional actions with airlines and to implement the Productive Transformation plan. Colombians have to understand that this is an important industry for the country. We want to promote several destinations such as natural parks and ecotourism around these areas, such as the Sierra Nevada or the Ruta Cafetera. I want to make Colombians part of the development of this segment by, for example, sharing their knowledge with tourists. At the same time, we have to think that investment in the hospitality sector has increased significantly over the past few years as the country takes decisive steps toward increasing security levels, and we are now seeing the results of this in larger tourist arrivals.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of foreign trade in Colombia?</h4><p>Some 23 years ago our current president became the first Foreign Trade Minister in Colombia, and ever since he has kept delivering the same message; openness to the world, the signing of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), and an export drive. We have a large international market around the world and Colombia has to take advantage of this thanks to its qualitative production in many fields. We need to further open to the Pacific, particularly Korea and Japan. We have developed a regional plan to raise awareness among industrial businesses of their many opportunities.</p><h4>What is your strategy for improving national competitiveness?</h4><p>This is a matter of creating synergies between the public and private sectors; we have to dare to innovate. Colombia was lagging behind in terms of infrastructure around five years ago, so the president formed the National Agency for Infrastructure (ANI), an agency that was recently awarded best agency in the world. We have a total of 42 projects totaling $25 billion, which target energy costs, competitiveness, and innovation. We are also trying to focus our resources rather than spreading them around a number of different companies. It is also important not to forget imports; we have 47 million Colombian inhabitants that are becoming more demanding and smarter consumers. We also need to further increase the portfolio of our FTAs with regional and international players that can give Colombia added value as an economic unit. Asia accounts for 35% of GDP, and therefore we see it as one of the best regions to expand our FTAs to. Colombia is the fifth largest growing economy in the world today, which is something we have to exploit as a country. Colombia also has great potential in two particular sectors, those of services and agribusiness. It has improved its business environment thanks to the availability of finance resources for SMEs, as these represent the future of our country. This is something foreign investors also appreciate, as we closed 2013 with $16 billion in export revenues, but the figure has since reached $58 billion. Colombia has also done a great job of consolidating its development over the past few years, working to lift 3.5 million people out of poverty—2 million out of extreme poverty. The potential that peace could offer Colombia is, according to various reports, phenomenal. Growth rates could be 2% above the current trends, while infrastructure would grow at 1.5% above current rates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Lebanon's potential to become a medical hub for the region? </h4><p><span></span>For years, Lebanon has focused on education and healthcare. Over time, the country has experienced a brain drain as a result of the regional political instabilities. Many of the Lebanese people who moved abroad to North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia excelled in their fields of healthcare, business, engineering, and politics. As such, the common origin of these people, Lebanon, is well placed to become a medical hub for the Middle East and beyond. An institution can have the most sophisticated equipment and cutting€edge technology, but the key to its success will be a capable team of human resources. One of the main pillars of the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) 20/20 vision and strategy set by Dr. Mohamed Sayegh, Vice€President for Medical Affairs and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the American University of Beirut (AUB), was to reverse the brain drain that Lebanon has been experiencing. The strategic plan includes bringing the experts in the field of medicine back to Lebanon, expanding and developing new programs and services as Centers of Excellence, and establishing national, regional, and international collaboration in healthcare. A vital goal for any medical center is to focus on the patients themselves and to tailor its systems and services to their needs. Over the last few years, the AUBMC has recruited almost 90 new physicians and scientists with expertise in different specialized areas. Recently, QS Rankings ranked AUB's Faculty of Medicine as the top medical school in the region. This is a major achievement considering the multitude of political and security instabilities that AUB and Lebanon have faced over the years. The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon (CCCL) at AUBMC in Beirut is a unique healthcare facility that was established as a Center of Excellence to treat children with cancer without remuneration from patients or their families. This is made possible through CCCL's partnerships with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, US, and the AUBMC. Dr. Hassan El Solh, the Medical Director of CCCL, addressed the recent advances in the management of childhood cancer and the role of CCCL in Lebanon and the region.</p><h4>What is the role of research in the drive to fight against pediatric cancer?</h4><p>At CCCL, evidence€based practice and research drives medical treatment. Research is based on data collection and analysis. We have a Data Management Unit with staff members who are experienced in entering patient data. We are investing heavily in translational research, which is the taking of laboratory research to the patient's bedside to use as novel treatment. We look at the biology of disease and at individual patient factors that influence treatment. There are special issues related to our patients as compared to patients in Europe or North America. Firstly, the genetics and cancer biology of the diseases that inflict patients in our region may not be the same as that elsewhere. Our research is based on genomic and chromosome studies that look at certain genetic indicators of the tumor itself. Some tumors are more aggressive than others, and laboratory research allows us learn more about the individual characteristics of the tumors we encounter and adjust our treatments accordingly to tailor the treatment to best match the disease. There are also call host implications that need to be accounted for. The way an individual patient's body metabolizes and reacts to different medications varies from one child to the other, so we need to perform studies to assess how an individual patient will respond to a specific treatment. This is called personalized medicine; we have to personalize the treatment based on the information we have about the cancer, the medications we use, and the patient. Our mission at AUBMC and CCCL is to support and advance services in Lebanon and in the region so that others can learn from our experience. We regularly meet and collaborate with pediatric oncologists working at hospitals and centers across the country. If physicians at these centers suspect cancer in patients at their own hospitals locally, we can help support the diagnosis through consultation and collaboration between physicians at our center and the referring physician, without taking over the care of the patient completely. This allows us to promote the transfer of knowledge and education, allowing others to benefit from our research and experience. When required, we perform specialized procedures, such as surgery or radiation therapy, that referring centers may not be equipped to perform. Two years ago we established the Pediatric Oncology East Mediterranean (POEM) group in order to support pediatric cancer centers in the region through transfer of knowledge, training, and data collection. POEM encompasses 70 centers in 22 countries across the region. We have another five centers that are now in the process of joining our growing group. We meet on a regular basis for scientific conferences and workshops. We regularly hold case presentations through teleconferences between oncologists in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Countries, Iraq, Egypt, India, Turkey, Pakistan, and other countries. We hold scientific meetings once every year where we have a two€ or three€day conference presenting updates childhood cancer. </p><h4>How do you envision CCCL advancing in the future?</h4><p>There are two pathways: one is related to research, as we need to learn more about the nature of childhood cancer in our region; and the second is related to the promotion of comprehensive care for childhood cancer so it can be provided by other centers in Lebanon. Initiatives like the Lebanese Children's Oncology Group and the POEM Group are important in engaging the local community and fostering a sense of social responsibility amongst patients, their families, healthcare providers, and the public in general. This is what the CCCL is striving to accomplish. It is not only the family of the patient who should be responsible for the treatment of a child with cancer; the government and the local community have a social responsibility to care for those afflicted with devastating disease. Without the CCCL, many children with cancer will have no option for treatment, as accessibility to advanced care for childhood cancer is currently limited in the region, and many families cannot afford its prohibitive cost on their own. Our mission is to provide accessible and excellent care to every child with cancer who needs it in Lebanon—and the wider region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your most innovative services in support of new companies coming to Zambia?</h4><p><span></span>The most recent and effective platform we have created is the one-stop-shop concept. In the past, businesspeople and investors coming to Zambia for the first time had to deal with a number of institutions and organizations to register their companies, and obtain certificates and licenses. In order to reduce the cost of doing business, and to make it easier, our one-stop shop concept facilitates such processes. We have one in Lusaka and one in Livingstone. Eventually our plan is to have one in each province of Zambia.</p><h4>Which sectors have the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>I would definitely highlight agriculture. If you consider our climate, the quality of our soil, the volume of rainfall, and the amount of sunshine, the entire country could become the breadbasket of the continent. The Zambian government has developed a farm blocks program in each of the 10 provinces of Zambia. These will be demarcated with 100,000 ha of land available for investment. We have started the process of marketing the farm blocks, and are in the process of identifying a partner for our farm block in the north. We put out a global tender and the response was quite overwhelming. Today we have shortlisted four possible joint venture partners. We will be completing the process, and hopefully signing with a partner, by the end of September. We want to see major agricultural development. The same applies to the other nine provinces. We have set up many farm blocks and there is a lot of interest at the moment. One company intends to establish a sugar plantation on a large scale, while another is to focus on producing biofuels from cassava, working with small-scale farmers. In terms of mining, the northwestern province is the new Copperbelt.</p><h4>Which countries have shown the greatest interest in Zambia?</h4><p>The traditional investors in the mining sector have been the UK, Canada, Australia, and recently South Africa. Most of these companies now are increasing their capability in terms of reequipping old mines, while many greenfield mines are also emerging. In terms of Europe, the notable investors are from Germany and France. In this country we have a major French producer of cement in Lafarge. Poland has also been a new and keen entrant into our country, interested in a number of sectors. Going further east, Japan for many years has been trading in Zambia. Every other vehicle you see is Japanese. Furthermore, India has continued to be a sustainable investor, as has Singapore. In December 2014 we signed an MoU with the Singapore Investment Center to promote new investments in our economy. We have also recently received strong overtures from the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, and China, too, is a growing investor. Its investments are broad-based, across agriculture, infrastructure, agro-processing, manufacturing, and others. Turkey has recently come on-stream with strong interest in Zambia. We have enjoyed complete political stability over the past 51 years having seen six democratically elected presidents, boosting investor confidence. And over the past decade GDP growth has averaged at 6.3%, in 2014 approaching 7%.</p><h4>Which large-scale projects is ZDA supporting?</h4><p>The farm block program is set to become a major development, and will be replicated nationwide. Also, I should mention the multi-facility economic zones that are pulling in notable new investment. Zambian Breweries has established a $32 million malting plant there. This is significant because in the past, Zambian breweries were not producing malt locally. They would get the barley and the farmers would sell the barley to Zambian breweries, but then they would export that to Zimbabwe where they had a malting plant, then reimport it. We were creating jobs in Zimbabwe and losing value because we exported for reimporting. By the end of this year, the new plant will be ready. In Lusaka south, we also have a major pharmaceutical plant, which is going to be producing medical drugs, which we haven't done before. In terms of manufacturing, we can see some major developments taking place. Zambia Sugar came to us recently and we gave them a license. They are investing another $120 million to increase their production capacity at the new refinery. We also have a Chinese-Zambian joint venture keen on the cement sector with a $600 million plant.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We need to strengthen our investments platform. Currently, we are in the process of reviewing the ZDA act and we are doing so in consultation with all stakeholders, particularly the private sector. The main focus of the review is to assess how to render Zambia an even more attractive investment destination, and, secondly, to empower Zambians. We have looked at many instruments that will enable us to empower Zambians. This alone will be a major investment in the future of the Zambian economy. Coupled with the peace and stability we continue to enjoy, the democratic institutions we have in place, and the strong annual growth rates we enjoy, this country is positioned for great performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A well-functioning civil service is vital to achieving economic objectives and driving national development. What measures have been implemented to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government delivery services? </h4><p><span></span>Among the first measures that I have taken since assuming the role of Chief Secretary in 2012 was to introduce the concept of humanizing the public service, which is in line with the 1Malaysia “People First, Performance Now" concept to create a people-oriented civil service. The concept is based on six guiding principles: openness; going down “on the ground"; engagement; striking a balance between spiritual and physical aspects; camaraderie or a sense of belonging; and collaboration and resource-sharing through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and NGO partnerships. In addition, the efficiency and effectiveness of government services depends on both the hard aspects (facilities, technology, systems and procedures) and soft aspects (human capital) of service delivery. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that civil servants are appropriately remunerated, provided with good career prospects, and equipped with the necessary training to enable them to deliver services that meet and even exceed the expectations of citizens. Moving forward, the improvements in the civil service will focus on the initiatives identified in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and on further enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the civil service. The citizen and the customer will be placed at the heart of service delivery with the emphasis on speedy execution through innovative and creative approaches, while upholding high standards of integrity. Innovation is an important driver further elevating the roles played by the public service as it creates high value-added services at lower cost. Recognizing the importance of institutionalizing an innovation culture, several key steps that have been taken include the establishment of an Innovation Unit in all government agencies as well as the creation of the Public Sector Innovation Hub as an online repository for innovations and best practices in the public sector. Malaysia's efforts in innovation have been recognized internationally. Furthermore, under the Malaysian Administrative Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), we have developed various ICT initiatives as efforts to enhance public sector service delivery systems and to create a conducive environment for the business sector when dealing with government agencies. MAMPU also continuously helps public sector agencies in revising and reengineering their business processes. As a result of these initiatives, many government services are now available online. As of March 31, 2015, the number of government online services available was 10,802, or 80.52%. The government is also tapping into Open Data initiatives to enhance and publish more datasets on the Malaysia Open Data Portal. By increasing government openness, it will help us to achieve the goal of Digital Malaysia and enable greater participation in decision making by the citizen (e-participation). Big data analytics (BDA) represents a fundamental shift in government decision-making.</p><h4>How effective has the National Blue Ocean Strategy (NBOS) been so far?</h4><p>NBOS is an innovative and creative strategy that the government has adopted in delivering touch point services to the people. When we first implemented NBOS in 2009, there was only one initiative involving a few agencies; today, the number has grown to 78 initiatives involving some 80 ministries and agencies nationwide. NBOS has been effective in reducing operational costs. For example, for the NBOS initiative on Police-Military Collaboration, the police force and armed forces share training facilities, as well as conducting joint patrols. Done conventionally, the government would have had to spend $187.7 million over the past five years. Another example is the Community Rehabilitation Program (CRP), whereby petty criminals are rehabilitated, trained, and utilized for productive work in military premises. This saves the government $2.82 million per year in the operational cost of petty offenders. The effectiveness of NBOS can also be assessed through the demand side of the program. For example, the Urban Transformation Centers (UTC) initiative provides services in 10 clusters of most needed government-related services. During the first year of operation in 2013, the UTC received 6.5 million visitors. The cumulative number of visitors to UTC increased to 9.6 million in 2014. As of April 2015, the number of visitors to UTC is recorded at 4.2 million; this shows the ever-increasing demand from the rakyat. For 2015, the government has allocated $130.45 million for the implementation of NBOS programs and activities, out of which $31.68 million has been allocated for establishment and maintenance of UTCs and Mini UTC during 2015. Currently, we have eight UTCs in eight states in Malaysia. The government aims to have at least one UTC in each state. The establishment of UTCs, Mini-UTCs, and Regional Transformation Centers (RTCs) has created momentum of its own. Apart from offering government related services, it helps increase community interaction through community-related activities. The government is continuously disseminating information on NBOS initiatives through the electronic, print, and alternative media to increase public awareness on NBOS.</p><h4>What role will PPPs play in the Malaysian National Development Strategy (MyNDS)? </h4><p>The Malaysian Government has established a partnership with the private sector since the inception of the Malaysia Incorporated Policy in the early 1980s. This policy has succeeded in strengthening the partnership between the public and the private sectors in developing the nation. In line with MyNDS measures, PPPs emphasize the need for the private sector to be the front-runner as well as the engine of growth of the economy. The government has also demonstrated a high level of commitment in facilitating PPP initiatives that are open to new ideas and innovation put forward by the private sector. Infrastructure projects listed under the MyNDS, namely highways, will be implemented through PPPs. The Public Private Partnership Unit (UKAS) under the Prime Minister's Department is a dedicated agency to oversee PPP development, and is responsible to facilitate the process. A conducive environment for investment also means being open and receptive to foreign investment. In this regard, Malaysia's PPP development policy emphasizes a “balanced approach," which is increasing the competency and competitiveness of local firms and allowing the involvement of foreign firms in smart partnerships with local firms in areas where Malaysia is yet to have or lacks expertise, such as those involving green technology and high-tech projects such as the High Speed Rail project.</p><h4>What are your priorities between now and 2020, both as Chief Secretary and as Chairman of PEMUDAH?</h4><p>My priorities between now and 2020 include ensuring the public service successfully implements the policies, plans, and programs identified under the 11th Malaysia Plan in a smooth and timely manner, guided by the five philosophies of pro-growth, pro-people, pro-business, environment friendly, and emphasis on nation building; effecting continuous improvement and transformation in the public service so as to have a lean, productive, talented, and competent public service that is able meet the rakyat's needs and expectations through excellent service delivery. Our aim is to create a civil service that is receptive, responsive, and emphatic to the needs of the rakyat in line with the concept of Humanizing the Public Service, while cutting down bureaucratic red-tape to make processes more efficient and effective, thus lowering costs and enhancing the rakyat's experience when dealing with government services. Finally, I want to utilize NBOS when looking for solutions or coming up with programs to address current needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Today the company boasts a 20-year presence in the market. What have been the main achievements along the way?</h4><p><span></span>We can look at the success of Equinorte in four phases: survival, expansion, consolidation, and internationalization. In the beginning, ours was a small, family-orientated company that was struggling to survive, especially when the real estate crisis in the 1990s struck. We managed to pull through thanks to several good friends and short-term investors during the first five years. I was successful in attracting numerous short-term investors, numbering around 40, initially though leasing our equipment to raise capital. We were founded the same year that the Metro of Medellí­n was undertaken, and subsequently began lending our services on this public contract with some German scaffolding, which was acquired by one of our investors at the time, who later delivered them with the idea of leasing the equipment on other scalable projects on the Caribbean coast. At this point, we realized how useful our machinery and equipment could be in other parts of the country on infrastructural and large public projects. It was with this same equipment that we ended up working on the largest mall on the northern coast.</p><h4>At what stage did Equinorte begin to reinvest its revenues in expanding its portfolio and capital?</h4><p>The second phase for the next five years arose from the economic crisis of the late nineties, I would say that financially we were broken, or operationally at least. We were losing $10,000 a month. In total we lost at least $100,000, at that point some of our providers came forward, and offered to finance us with loans, which was extraordinary. In 1998, I decided to go to the University of Pittsburgh to undertake a program in project management, which opened the doors to me becoming Professor of Financial Mathematics for a short time at the Universidad del Norte. When the university was in the process of developing a huge infrastructural project called the Coliseo de los fundadores, where it would hold  graduation ceremonies, we ended up becoming one of the main providers of construction equipment for the project. This put us completely back on track. We then went on to provide services to the Buenavista mall project in 2000; after this stage we did not stop growing. We had managed to restructure entirely by focusing on the malls industry, which at the time was considered a risky investment and business. We began to sell all the old capacity that we had in equipment and machinery, and then we reinvested in the company and start to purchase and become legal owners of our own new equipment and machinery, which from a financial perspective at the time was logical. We kept reinvesting in this second stage of expansion.</p><h4>You have won several iconic public contracts. Which have been the most significant projects?</h4><p>We went on to gain lots of public contracts with the municipality, which often had non-conventional architecture and required a wider range of machinery and equipment. This included high-rise buildings, whereby our original equipment was no longer useful, and we had to expand our portfolio and capital according to the growth and demands of the construction sector in Barranquilla. We have completed a considerable body of work in Barranquilla and the region in institutional construction projects, and have worked comprehensively with public health and EPS institutions. At that stage private construction was rather inactive, and had we been entirely dependent at the time on residential construction we would have faced bankruptcy. Today our ratio is divided approximately 50-50 between public and private contracts. The work we undertook in the Universidad del Norte at the time generated numerous significant contracts with other affiliated industrialists of the university from the largest industrial companies, including Nutresa and Bavaria. In hindsight, the project with the university laid down our strategic plan for the subsequent 10 years, paving the way for internationalization to enter into heavy machinery, which today accounts for 50% of our sales.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the Paris Gallery Group work towards understanding the customer better and ensuring their satisfaction in Dubai's highly competitive luxury retail sector?</h4><p><span></span>Customer satisfaction is one of the most challenging and demanding areas for all service providers. In the luxury segment of the market where we operate, expectations are even higher. We follow our customers closely on the floor to learn about their needs and how we may or may not be meeting them. We conduct research through an internal team using the services of an external agency. We regularly host focus groups and take corrective actions when needed to fix elements that can improve our service, which could be individual sales teams or supervisors, the services and products available, promotions, or the ambiance of the shop. Last year we made intensive changes to enhance the ambiance in our stores and improve our services. We pay close attention to the floor, the lighting, and the flow, the merchandising and list of products, our employees and their interaction with customers and understanding of different cultures, and our customers' expectations when they walk into Paris Gallery stores. We launched a loyalty program in January 2014 to help us understand our customers' preferences, habits, and behavior, thus allowing us to be better prepared to interact with and serve them. The program has attracted over 300,000 members. We have also firmly established our presence on different social media platforms. We utilize customer input and reply to comments, positive and negative, and if something does not fit our customers' needs, we remove it from our portfolio.</p><h4>How would you describe your overall international expansion strategy?</h4><p>We have a presence in many locations across the region, and our strategy has not changed. We want to be the pioneers in countries in which other retail companies are hesitant to move. We have made progress towards opening our new store in Oman, and we are close to opening in Baghdad and Baku. In Morocco, we are studying the market and looking for the right strategic partner. Many shopping malls are being built in this area, and we hope that the momentum of these positive changes will somehow be amplified. In Egypt, when the situation was unclear after the elections a few years ago, quite a few real estate developments happened, which helped the luxury retail business. Huge shopping malls in Cairo plus many new projects increased the purchasing power of the population, which primed the environment for others to do business. Many companies had not foreseen this, and failed to gain an early presence. We are talking with many new shopping mall managements and developers, and Egypt is an integral part of our expansion plans as it is the country with the most potential in the region. Looking beyond the region, our ambition is to have businesses in London, Paris, or Milan; we are just looking for the right opportunities.</p><h4>In which ways are you attracting foreign companies to enter into strategic partnerships with Paris Gallery Group in the UAE and beyond?</h4><p>We are always on the lookout for strong and reliable partners. In the case of foreign companies, we explain to them how the UAE, and Dubai in particular, could become a good platform for their businesses. The experience I have had with potential partners is that many aspects of the services available here are unknown to them. We educate them and give them tours occasionally so that they can see for themselves how beneficial a partnership can be. Some companies already have ambitions to be in Dubai because it is the capital of luxury retail.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Hosting the 2015 Summit of the Americas enabled Panama to gather the global community to discuss regional development prospects. What gains has hosting given industry?</h4><p>The Summit was an important marketing tool to promote the countries global diplomatic image. Panama is keen to build stronger diplomatic relations with its neighbors, a recent success being Panama's role as a mediator in the peace talks between Cuba and the US. The Summit hosted a wide range of stakeholders, including those beyond the political sphere, such as the business community, represented by the most influential business people of the region. The Summit was an opportunity to showcase the logistical prowess and liberal regulatory framework of the state to industry. This includes the Panama Canal, the safe FDI environment and a substantial number of free trade agreements including with the US and EU. At the Summit, President Obama and President Varela were witnesses in the signing of a $6 billion agreement between Copa and Boeing for the purchase of new planes. Commercial airlines in Panama travel to over 140 destinations on a weekly basis. Panama City, due to its geo-strategic location, has the capacity to be the most inter-connected city in Latin America.</p><h4>Despite being known for its robust services sector, manufacturing represents a substantial amount of Panamanian exports. Which sectors are driving the growth of industry?</h4><p>Panama's service sector is internationally competitive. Our balance of payments demonstrates a surplus in terms of services; however, we have a trade deficit on goods. The manufacturing capacity of Panama is not being exploited to its full potential. We recently legislated to provide incentives to foreign and local companies to invest in manufacturing aimed at exporting goods. We are exploring the possibility of additional legislation that will provide incentives for inter-company trading. We are planning to move the manufacturing centers of Panama close to the ports, to increase logistical efficiency.</p><h4>Colon Free Zone represents Panama's main export and re-export hub. What is the importance of this Free Zone to the national economy?</h4><p>The geo-strategic centrality of Colon Free Zone is important with regard to logistical services, $14 billion of cargo moved in and out of the country were re-exports from the free zone the last year. MNCs, such as P&amp;G, have been utilizing the facilities in Colon for their Latin American distribution operations.</p><h4>China, Singapore, the US, Belgium, and the UK are some of Panama's main trade partners. What other countries are you targeting?</h4><p>Our target is to double our exports in the next five years. We have a copper mine project in the pipeline, worth $6 billion, which is attracting FDI. Once the plant is in operation we are expecting the total exports of copper from Panama to be around $2 billion. Our investment agency, Proinvex, focuses mainly on South America, especially Colombia and Venezuela. Our European market also consists of the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain, where we are hoping to expand. Our US focus is MNCs. Proinvex will be hosting PR events in Washington and New York, and is also planning on hosting events in other US industrial centers.</p><h4>The current expansion of the Canal will be successfully concluded in 2016. How will this iconic project stimulate the growth of commercial activities in Panama?</h4><p>The Panama Canal was taken over by the Panamanian government on December 31, 1999. Prior to that, it was operated by the US government. Since we have taken over control, we have continually invested in the Canal, and our latest expansion efforts, it is hoped, will enable millions of barrels of gas to pass through Panama. This will enable Panama to become a regional energy hub. We are also investing in a third set of locks, which will create additional maritime routes. Agricultural cycles are different in the southern part of the hemisphere to the northern part; they are seasonally opposite. Companies with agri-industrial facilities have to plant on each side of the equator. We are hoping that our canal expansion plans will improve the infrastructure available to agri-business.</p><h4>What are the ambitions, priorities, and goals that you hope to achieve by the end of this year?</h4><p>We expect the growth rate to remain at around 6-7%, far above the regional average of 6%. We are growing 10 times faster than the regional average rate. The current level of unemployment in Panama is around 5.2 %. The level of inflation is just under 2.6%. Our investment package is worth over $20 billion for the next five years. Our largest government investment initiative for this year is worth around $5 billion. According to the World Economic Forum, Panama is one of the most economically competitive countries globally. We are working closely in partnership with MNCs in order to create favorable conditions for manufacturing, to diversify our economic activities. Also, we will re-legislate import/export controls.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Boursa Kuwait Securities Company (BKSC) was established in 2014 as part of the privatization plan for the KSE. What were the reasons for establishment?
</h4><p>
	The KSE was founded as a self-regulatory entity in 1983 and operated as such until the promulgation of the Capital Markets Law in 2010, which brought about the formal establishment of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) as the regulatory body for all securities activities in Kuwait. In recent years, the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) has trailed its regional peers and has witnessed a decline in liquidity exceeding 80% in the last 10 years and while the Dubai Financial Market index, for example, has recorded growth of nearly 170% in the last five years, the KSE index has increased by only 5.5%. The weak fundamentals and the acknowledgement of the need for structural reform in the KSE has prompted legislators to privatize the exchange to enhance its financial agility, improve its decision-making processes, and expand its access to capital in general. Privatization would also shield the stock exchange from government interference in operations and management and allow for a separation between shareholders, management, and traders. This brings us to BKSC. The company was established in April 2014 with an authorized capital of KD60 million by the Capital Markets Authority Commissioners' Council resolution 37/2013 and the preamble to law 7/2010. Our current goal is to assume administrative control of the KSE and to begin a 46-step strategic transformation plan that we have devised with input from all stakeholders to improve the exchange's current performance, turning it into a leading, regional market. It is important to note here that law 7/2010 also outlined the ownership structure of the exchange, dictating the sale of 50% of the exchange to Kuwaiti citizens in an IPO, a percentage not less than 6% and not more than 24% to be allocated to government bodies and a percentage not more than 44% and not less than 26% to be auctioned to an international operator.
</p><h4>
	How will the privatization of the KSE impact the financial market in Kuwait and what does it signify about the transition occurring in Kuwait's economy?
</h4><p>
	The privatization of the KSE is pending the enactment of law 22/2015 in 2015. This law amends certain articles of law 7/2010, including article 156, which grants the CMA the right to appoint BKSC to manage and operate the KSE during the transition period. This will last until the finalization of the privatization process as stipulated by article 33 of the same law. However, the change in legislation signifies that Kuwait is on a path of much-needed economic diversification, which was made all the more obvious by the recent decline in oil prices over the last year. There is value in the non-oil private sector that needs supporting legislature to allow it to reach its full potential, and that is what we are seeing now with the move to privatize the KSE. Additionally, the public sector in Kuwait is quite large; it accounts for 70% of GDP and employs nearly 80% of the total Kuwaiti workforce. Public-sector salaries in 2014 amounted to nearly 19% of Kuwait's GDP ($181 billion)—quite a staggering figure. The government is gradually reducing its role as an operator and focusing on being a regulator. The approval of a $116 billion development strategy for 2015-20 will see an increased role of the private sector from its current 26.4% to more than 40% and the positioning of Kuwait as a financial hub. A successful example from the region of a privatized exchange is the Dubai Financial Market (DFM), which was established in 2000 as a public institution and was transformed into a public joint stock company in 2005. Liquidity on the DFM jumped from 12.6% in 2005 to 158.5% in 2007, two years after its privatization. Market capitalization increased from $86.9 billion in 2005 to $138.2 billion in 2006.
</p><h4>
	How are you working to enhance communication with investors and improve both local and international investor relations within the KSE?
</h4><p>
	While BKSC exists and has been operating behind the scenes to prepare for this transformation, we plan to take control as an operator of the stock exchange in 2016, at which point we will begin our communication protocols with investors. Our priority currently is to prepare for a smooth transition of operatorship and prepare to upgrade the KSE's infrastructure. From December 2014 to March 2015, we collaborated with the Boston Consulting Group to conduct an in-depth market-scanning exercise, benchmark best practices applied by global peers, and carried out an in-depth analysis of KSE's financial performance and operational infrastructure. Not only that, but over 2,300 hours were invested and intensive meetings were held with more than 65 stakeholders and market leaders including banks, investment and brokerage firms, business associations, and listed companies to understand the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.
</p><h4>Where does the KSE stand today, with regards to investor best practice standards, and where would you like it to be in the future?</h4><p>
	Today, the KSE is getting a new lease on life. Although it is one of the oldest stock exchanges in the Gulf, it has been recording gradual declines in liquidity over the last 10 years from a high of KD33.9 billion in total value traded in 2007 to a record 10-year low of KD5.9 billion in 2014. This has partly been due to the lack of products meeting international standards and outdated infrastructure amidst growing investor requirements. As a result, the KSE today trails behind other stock exchanges in the Gulf in several metrics including value traded as a percentage of market capitalization, which dropped from 37% in 2007 to 19% in 2014 and value traded as a percentage of GDP—a metric that reflects the stock market's health versus the health of its domestic business environment. Between 2010 and 2014 alone, the KSE's value traded as a percentage of GDP dropped from 36% to 11%, while all other regional markets registered positive growth rates (some as high as 2.5 times).
</p><h4>What are your expectations for the BKSC in 2016?</h4><p>
	In our capacity as the new operator of the exchange, BKSC will execute a transformation program to evolve the KSE into a leading regional exchange that reflects the size and depth of Kuwait's private sector while implementing global transparency rules and standards to attract regional and international investors. We are currently working on preparations for the operations' takeover of the exchange, which we expect to happen in early 2016. Once the takeover takes place, our plans will then shift to upgrading the operations of the stock exchange, and the development and initiation of a detailed operational takeover plan consisting of 46 strategic initiatives, each of which contains multiple projects to ensure swift transition of systems and high-priority processes. In 2016, our objectives are to upgrade the systems and the stock exchange infrastructure.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe some of the landmark achievements of the past year?</h4><p>Launching the Master's in Nursing Leadership program in January was an enormous achievement. The program grew out of feedback we received from our students, many of whom are already in senior nursing positions and wanted more education in leadership. These were people who had tremendous skill and talent, but who wanted to continue building their expertise so they could be the best possible supervisor of those working for them, and to have the ability to lead the improvement of health and wellness in Qatar. Our program helps them acquire theoretical knowledge so they are equipped to be visionary leaders, in addition to practical skills such as budgeting, management, and quality control so they can achieve their vision effectively.</p><h4>Recently, the University of Calgary signed an MoU with Primary Health Care toward developing the skills of healthcare professionals. What was the significance of this MOU?</h4><p>The University of Calgary in Qatar exists to train nurses to the highest technical standards. As part of this, we have had a close relationship with the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC). HMC sponsors some of their nursing employees to attend UCQ in our Master's program so they can upgrade their skills and have the costs of this additional education covered. As a result of the MOU with Primary Health Care, some of their employees will now have a similar opportunity to study with us. This is important because Primary Health is looking to expand its community nursing and public health nursing programs, and we can help deliver on this vision. We also expect to be able to sign similar sponsorship agreements with Sidra and the Supreme Health Council, which deepens our partnerships and expands the expertise of those delivering healthcare in Qatar.</p><h4>What are some of the key strategic points of the University of Calgary Strategic Plan 2015-2018?</h4><p>Students are the most important aspect of UCQ. That's why they're the first of the four key elements of our strategic plan. We strive to provide a positive student experience through excellent teaching and learning, which in turn attracts Qatar's best and brightest to the nursing profession. Secondly, we focus on stability, which is about having the resources to train an increasing number of students for the future. Our third priority concerns stakeholders, which means building positive relationships with the community around us. Finally, we have to think about systems for delivering high-quality programming to our students and the wider Qatar community.</p><h4>In what ways is UCQ establishing partnerships to continue building Qatar's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Advancing health and wellness in Qatar is fundamental to what we do, and we pursue every opportunity to do so. In addition to our partnerships with a wide range of healthcare providers we conduct research with other disciplines and organizations. Our research program at UCQ has gone from nothing to $4.5 million over the past few years and has involved professionals from HMC and a variety of other institutions. We are particularly proud of our leadership role in research and professional healthcare.</p><h4>The GCC's healthcare sector as a whole is one of the most dynamic investment opportunities in the region. It is enjoying YoY increases of public healthcare spending, and Qatar alone has over 70 private projects in the pipeline in addition to the public $660 million Hamad Bin Khalifa Medical City project. How would you say that UCQ fits into the growth of the healthcare sector on the regional and global level?</h4><p>UCQ is not a huge institution, but we have been given the opportunity to have a major impact in Qatar. We are involved in many important initiatives and sit on major committees that are directing and structuring healthcare in this country. We are also involved in continuing professional education for health care professionals, and this is important because, to my knowledge, Qatar is the only place that is wisely taking a national approach to professional development and professional certification. I personally sit on a number of committees and it has been an extraordinary privilege to be consulted as the Ministry of Health and others chart the course for healthcare in Qatar.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The year ahead is set to be particularly exciting. We have recently become an accredited provider of continuing professional education for healthcare professionals, which means we will need to provide a program that meets the needs of the Qatar health care community, particularly nurses—something we are already well prepared to do. We are also working with the medical community to identify the next area of specialty for our clinical Master's program. The program is currently focused on oncology, but this will change in 2017 based on need. We have also begun a space plan with a view to opening a new building that will help us take the next step in educating nursing professionals. Finally, we have the largest ever class for the 2015-2016 academic year and are looking forward to getting to know these bright, motivated students. Of course, that also means that we have already launched a number of students into their careers, including a record high number of graduates who are Qatari citizens, and our first ever Master's program graduates. We see a very positive future ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Chamber of Commerce. What was the philosophy behind the creation of the institution, and what are its milestones achieved in recent years?</h4><p>The Chamber of Commerce was established in 1915 as an initiative designed to enable businessmen to meet and share common interests in the private sector and to develop businesses after the canal was opened in 1914. Ever since then, the Chamber has played a significant role in the private sector. From time to time, it has also been involved in the struggle for democracy. Our chamber is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2105, and looking back on all that we have done, there have been many presidents who were members of the chamber. We played an important role in the coup d'etat in 1968, and also in the cessation of the dictatorship in 1989. It was also the chamber that led the opposition in 1989. After that we assisted the new government in the restructuring and rebuilding of our economy. The private sector is now a vital force in Panama, and the nation has been one of the leaders of the past 10 years in terms of GDP growth, and the highest ranking in Latin America. We have a dollarized economy, which is stable, and also attractive for overseas investors. Panama has great connectivity through its airport, and our most important asset is the canal, which was handed back to the Panamanians in 2000. Ever since, the Panamanian government has been a great example of good management and sound investment in the economy. As a private entity we have grown in scale, with over 1,800 members today. We are divided into 15 groups or sub-chambers, with every chamber representing a different sector. We have coverage of industry, construction, and development, cars and motors, pharmaceuticals, law firms, advertisement agencies, human resources, education, logistics, and transportation, to name a few. Each sector is represented here, and each sub-chamber has between 150 and 200 members. We have good representation across all important topics and sections of our economy.</p><h4>What does the chamber do to protect its members and widen its membership?</h4><p>We offer many services through the chamber, including a legal department, which revises every law and initiative at the legislative and executive levels for the private sector. We are vigilant that none of these initiatives impair the security of enterprises and the way we do businesses. We are keen to protect the private sector, and organize five to six expositions a year. The most important multi-sector exposition is Expo Comer, which has been held in March for the past 33 years. We have representation and commercial exposure from over 30 countries, while buyers and suppliers from abroad are also in attendance. We also instigate trade between other countries with which Panama has close relations. We stage expositions for the tourism sector, too, as well as the technology and medicine and health sectors. Foreign nationals, too, are at liberty to come to Panama and join our chamber. We also provide a medium for arbitration between members, and are leaders in social responsibility.</p><h4>What advantages does Panama offer to the international investor community?</h4><p>We have the highest international direct investment rate in Central America. We have attracted close to 45% of the international investments in Panama and Central America, and are doing a good job in that regard. We have the connectivity of the canals, and among the Americas, which makes it easy for foreigner entities to visit and see what we have to offer. We enjoy political stability, and the economy, too, is one of our assets. Meanwhile, a convention center is being built, for which we have high expectations. The center will attract international multi-sector conventions to Latin America. The international business community will have greater scope to view Panama, and perhaps establish a presence as a result. We have over 100 multinational organizations established in Panama, which speaks volume about our sheer potential. These companies have their regional offices here, and benefit from special treatment, while their investments create jobs. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in Latin America, and with employment comes peace, progress, and a good quality of life in the country.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Since we have grown in membership over the past few years, one of the most important considerations is to remain in closer contact with our members; we have met with over 1,000 companies this year. Such direct interaction is a great means of showcasing what we have to offer. We stage events, conventions, and economic forums, as well a maintaining a profile in the printed medium. We are keen to work with the public sector to attract more tourists and international investors. There is considerable potential for growth in tourism, mining, fishing, construction, the agro industry, and the service cluster around the Panama Canal. These are the sectors that we have identified as the key sources of growth and business opportunities in Panama.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been in the market for 24 years. How were the companies that comprise Financreditos established?</h4><p>My father, who had been Vice-President of Banco Popular and was a recognized player in the financial sector, founded Financreditos in 1991. He established a family company with another relative to provide services to existing clients. The focus during the first 10 years was on organizing the structure of the current company. I have held various positions within the company over the years, and sought to incorporate technology into the collection business, which allowed Financreditos to become an innovative company in the sector. We rely on technology to be both leaders and pioneers. Our technological developments include unique software called Sinfin, which is a financial information system; we are able to send text messages en mass, use localization software, and conduct database research to locate clients. When I took over the company after the sudden death of my father, my greatest challenge was to maintain the client base he had established. One of the most important clients was Comcel, today known as Claro, which had a vast and growing portfolio, hence requiring collection services. We achieved the first national indicator of effectiveness for Comcel among 50 collection agencies that it employed, even though we only provided services in Cali. After successfully carrying out the operation in Cali, we decided to expand nationally. Firstly we opened an operation in Bogotá and today we have seven agencies with operations in Medellí­n, Barranquilla, Pasto, Pereira, and Cartagena. During that time, Comcel represented 95% of our client base, but we have developed new client relations and reduced our dependence on Claro. We have clients in the banking sector, among utilities companies, and in the energy sector. We offer these companies a portfolio collection service on a national scale.</p><h4>What is your strategy for securing new clients?</h4><p>We work with multinationals such as Citibank, which was a client back when the company started, but which unfortunately decided to withdraw its account after my father died. After 14 years it placed a call for collection agencies and we received the highest rank according to several internal indicators provided by Citibank, receiving the account. One of the factors that gave us an advantage was that the bank highly regarded robust cyber-security. As we perform a specialized service, our strategy to acquire new customers is to invest in targeted scenarios such as events of the National Collection Association. The collection sector has evolved over the past few years, and clients are now looking for agencies that have a strong client base, robust technological support and highly qualified human labor. Financreditos can offer a highly specialized service and we rely on our track record to target new clients. We are also considered a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company as we operate call centers. It also helps that we are members of the Asociación Nacional de Empresas de Cobranza (COLCOB), and the National association for Business Process Outsourcing and Contact Centres (ACDECC.)</p><h4>How is the company investing to train human capital?</h4><p>We aim for innovation from the heads of each area of the company. They search for new business opportunities and perfect existing processes, as a result of which we become specialized. For example, we have highly trained engineers in the technology arena. Our strength as an SME is that our staff in all areas must support the entire operation, and as a result the company works as a unified whole. We also support staff with continued higher-learning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What have been the main achievements of your Ministry since you assumed office in 2011?</h4><p>One of the critical issues that we discovered when we came to power was the issue of healthcare delivery. At that point we identified certain diseases to target in order to reduce their impact on the population, specifically HIV-AIDS, Malaria, and other communicable diseases. We also recognized the emergence of non-communicable diseases. If we look back over the past four years, though we are certain that we have had an impact on Malaria control, we aim at nothing less than its total eradication. We have also had an impact on new cases of HIV transmission, particularly mother-child transmission, which has been greatly reduced. With regard to the healthcare system itself, we were concerned about pharmaceutical supplies, as this has long been a concern. In 2011 there was approximately 110-120 million in present day Kwacha, which in those days stood at a billion, allocated to pharmaceutical supply. Since then we have come to spend three times what we had previously spent on supplying drugs.</p><h4>The vast majority of that supply comes from imports. What are your plans for trying to develop a drug manufacturing industry in Zambia?</h4><p>It is difficult to ensure availability of drugs when you are dependent on sourcing them from abroad. There is a need for some production to be realized in Zambia, although manufacturing in terms of laboratory synthesis is not a realistic proposition for Zambia today. However, in the later stages of pharmaceutical processing and production there is the possibility of setting up local operations. We need to establish some incentives as part of the Zambian Development Agency, related to tax and other critical areas. Secondly, we should work with those who are interested in manufacturing and guide them in areas where they might have a maximum impact by producing locally. The concern about both money and distribution systems is that if you do not define the essential medicines, success is elusive as there are over 3,000 products worldwide, and Zambia cannot afford to purchase them all. We have to define essential needs, and there must be absolute availability of those essential medicines.</p><h4>What is the status of your plan to build 650 health posts at an estimated cost of $50 million?</h4><p>We are progressing steadily. In terms of the contract time that we have given to our contractors, we may set April 2016 as the completion date. People have been impatient ever since we announced the plan, but we will do our best to have it ready as soon as possible.</p><p class="quote">"We have promised that the distance, or the radius, around any institution that we can reasonably expect a person to travel when ill is 5km."</p><h4>What will be the impact of this project once completed?</h4><p>We have promised that the distance, or the radius, around any institution that we can reasonably expect a person to travel when ill is 5km. At present, the average distance is between 40 and 80km. These 650 posts are meant to address that issue by reducing the distances people travel before they reach a healthcare facility.</p><h4>How will you address the shortage of healthcare professionals?</h4><p>We aim to increase our intake by encouraging both the public and private sector to engage in training. As of today, the number of nurses trained by the private sector is almost the same as those trained by governmental institutions. Unfortunately, health workers also take a long time to train, so we need to persuade our people to be patient. Even if we increase the number of students today they will not be ready to work immediately.</p><h4>You mentioned the increase in the balance of non-communicable diseases in Zambia. What does that mean for the Ministry?</h4><p>We have been conscious of the issue for some time, but I do not think that we are even close to ready at the moment. Over the past two years we have taken several steps to address non-communicable diseases. The new Cancer Diseases Hospital that we hope to commission shortly exemplifies our efforts. The structure is intended to be more than a hospital; it will be a center of excellence for the prevention and management of cancer.</p><h4>Medical and health tourism is on an increasing trend. Do you see any potential in Zambia?</h4><p>The government is spending approximately $1 million a year to send patients outside of the country for treatment, because there are certain conditions that we cannot handle. We acknowledge that the exchange of health services between countries is important. We have much to offer and will shortly be accepting cancer patients from neighboring countries. At one time Zambia was utilizing Zimbabwe's services, but today we are set to become an international center.</p><h4>What role do mobile technologies and other new technologies play in providing healthcare to rural areas?</h4><p>We have adopted e-learning, and though our initial effort was perhaps small, we have established five nursing schools and a unit at the University Hospital. This unit is called Tele-Medicine, and will offer the chance for people to access health services remotely by sending images and being assessed online. The potential for ICT solutions is huge, especially in the supply management of drugs. A good control of drug stocks is essential as instant information will allow us to react instantly.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our main objective is universal health coverage. We firstly need to raise the quality of care in general. After this we need to expand geographically to cover as much of the territory of the country as possible. We are also committed to the elimination method. We know that we can eliminate malaria and AIDS, perhaps even earlier than HIV itself. And turning to pharmaceuticals, we cannot accept any shortage of drugs identified as being essential. We must also begin to approach the issue of financing. Health financing is a problem everywhere, even in industrialized countries, so we have to start thinking about how to solve this. I am hopeful that a law will be passed within the coming period to create a social health insurance scheme. In that way we can increase our current budget. This year we have allocated 9.3% of the budget to health, and want to raise this to at least 15%. And meanwhile, we aim to pass the social health law within this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>
