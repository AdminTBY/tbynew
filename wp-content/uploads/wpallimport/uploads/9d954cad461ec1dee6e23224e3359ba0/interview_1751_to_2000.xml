		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you tell us about the origins of Prodeca?<br></strong>Our history goes back to 1986. At that time, the agriculture sector was quite important in Catalonia; however, many companies did not export. Thus, Prodeca was established to help the agrifood industry to reach new markets in Europe and beyond. At present, Catalonia exports EUR10 billion worth of food, with our main market being Europe. For many years, Japan was our primary market outside Europe, but now China has replaced it. Our main exports are meat and fine food products such as premium snacks, chocolates, bakery, and coffee. Then comes fruit and vegetables, particularly peaches, nectarines, pears, apples, and citrus fruits. Olive oil, wine, and cava are other strong categories. If we take food production, the food industry and directly-related companies represent more than EUR30 billion in turnover per year. Having one of the leading ports in southern Europe further boosts the sector. The airport of Barcelona and the port of Tarragona also provide connectivity to Europe and the world. Above all, Barcelona is a strategic point through which we can reach the Mediterranean, Latin America, and Asia.</p><p><strong>Can you give a breakdown of Prodeca's operations?<br></strong>When I joined, Prodeca mostly went to international fairs in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. From 2016 onward, we focused on attending and organizing both international fairs as well as business forums related to different sectors. The first one we organized was related to meat in 2016. Our strategy is to scout our target markets and get in contact with buyers who have high purchasing power. We invite them, and we introduce them to local companies and arrange B2B meetings. We organize this for all our departments, namely meat, fruit and vegetables, fine foods, and wine and cava. We work also on some transversal departments such as the halal industry, the organic sector, and gastronomy, through which our chefs can act as 'ambassadors' of our products all over the world. Furthermore, Catalonia receives more than 23 million tourists every year who appreciate our gastronomy. The organic food market is growing fast, and we have recently organized an international business forum of organic companies in Copenhagen to promote Catalan companies in Nordic markets.</p><p><strong>What is the potential impact of the new US tariffs, and what are you doing about it?<br></strong>The new tariff policy will mainly affect our olive oil, wine, and meat industries. They were recently introduced, so it is hard to calculate the extent of their impact. In 2018, we exported EUR56 million worth of olive oil to the US, and under the new tariff regime the same amount of olive oil will cost EUR13 million more. Similarly, we exported EUR85 million worth of wine and cava in 2018, and the same quantity will now cost EUR7 million more. Some of these tariffs only apply to certain European countries. For example, the tariffs on wine and olive oil apply to Spain, not Italy, Portugal, and Greece, which are our direct competitors in the US market. We hope that negotiations between the EU and US delegations will end up with a solution for both sides: a tariff war in the end does not benefit anyone.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals for 2020?<br></strong>Internally, our goal is to keep improving the quality of our services and to have up-to-date quality information to make the best decisions in terms of food markets and trends for our food companies. We are working on evaluating the return of every euro invested in Prodeca and see how it adds value to Catalan companies and society. Externally, we want to consolidate the markets we are in and expand into new ones. We will also monitor and evaluate the effects of Brexit, trade wars, and currency fluctuations. The third objective is to use advantages such as the Mediterranean diet and Catalonia's gastronomy in a more ambitious way in order to promote our food and companies globally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Spain's F&amp;B sector generates 3.73 million jobs and almost EUR389 billion. What are some of the measures FIAB is taking to ensure the sector continues to grow in a sustainable way?<br></strong>The main function of the F&amp;B industry is to provide a wide range of products that meet all the safety and quality standards. To ensure this and to do so by promoting greater competitiveness across the sector, FIAB has specified the objectives of the sector in its strategic framework, the end goal of which is to promote the sector as a leader in Spanish industry. Under this roadmap, which we are now reinforcing and adapting to the new context, the sector seeks to grow in four vital areas: efficiency, value creation, internationalization, and dynamization. The industry is fully aware that compliance with each of these challenges must take into account measures for sustainable production. In addition, due to its transversality, we are one of the few sectors that can contribute positively to the achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Innovation is one way to address these challenges. It enables us to increase the efficiency of the production and organizational processes, be more environmentally friendly, improve traceability, ensure the safety and quality of our food and beverages, and access new channels of distribution.</p><p>One of the priorities of FIAB is the internationalization of the Spanish food sector. What is your strategic plan for this?<br>In 2018, sales in the international market exceeded EUR30 billion. Strengthening the international positioning of companies and helping SMEs access international markets is a priority of FIAB. We have defined a series of priority markets for Spanish exports, namely the US, China, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK, and Canada. To further boost the exports sector, we have formed partnerships with organizations that carry out promotional activities through which international buyers can have a first-hand experience of Spanish products. This also involves moving toward new marketing channels, such as the Horeca sector and e-commerce.</p><p><strong>FIAB aims to digitalize the food sector to innovate consumers' taste. How will digitalization empower businesses and consumers?</strong><br>It is essential to digitalize the F&amp;B industry. We are a traditional sector but one of the most innovative; however, greater effort is necessary for the full integration of digitalization, especially in SMEs. Through digitalization, we can revolutionize every area of the industry. We can create an intelligent industry where the digitized production and organizational processes will give rise to the improvement of communication between all parties. This is in addition to increased productivity, efficiency in the use of resources, the minimization of waste generation, and the sophistication of logistics. It also offers new opportunities in terms of distribution by accessing mechanisms that can put us in direct contact with the public. Big data is key to the management of any company. Big data can help us become more efficient and get closer to the reality of consumers, their tastes, interests, and consumption habits. We can control the safety and quality of food in all phases of a product and make decisions almost immediately. In short, it brings about flexibility, rapid adaptation, and transparency in the sector.</p><p><strong>What are the main objectives of FIAB for 2020?<br></strong>Apart from being Spain's first industrial sector, the F&amp;B sector represents more than EUR116 billion in production, more than 30,000 companies, nearly half a million jobs, and a positive contribution of more than EUR8 billion to the trade balance. In the short term, FIAB will work to maintain a harmonized policy based on scientific evidence in nutrition and health that supports the market both nationally and internationally. It is extremely important at this point to bet on active communication to drive the recognition of the sector and its products. FIAB will also intensify efforts to make the sector more sustainable and to further internationalize, innovate, and digitalize it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Expo conferences provide efficiency for those offering services or products, and the industry is evolving at a quick pace; therefore, it requires our full attention. This is how we can fulfill the needs of our clients. Market research and internal and external analysis are an essential phase that we have to go through and take into account for every event. We are implementing a strategic process that will generate economic benefits for the company and increase the positioning of the company in each of the events. In 2019, HJ Becdach completed 38 years in the market, during which it organized trade fairs, events, and congresses. The key word for us is trust, because everything that we carry out or do is reflected and demonstrated through the quality of our work. We are a reference in the organizational sector and have constantly contributed to the development of Ecuador.</p><h4>Ecuador Oil &amp; Power is one of the most important events for the hydrocarbon sector in Ecuador. How has this event improved the international image of the industry?</h4><p>Ecuador's oil industry is going through a transition. As one of the most diverse countries, Ecuador has ample natural resources. The event was successful, with each of the participating companies demonstrating their commitment to invest. It is a place where private companies, government-owned firms, and national and international companies meet and share their experiences. Over the last two decades, companies who have participated in the events have been essential to exploration and production activities in the country. The global oil sector is going through different cycles, but we remain positive and believe Ecuador can produce up to 550,000bpd. But to do so, we need more investment.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the institute positioned itself as a leading training center for the oil industry in the country?</h4><p>ITP has been serving the oil sector for more than 15 years. Originally, we were established as a branch of a Colombian entity that was in the Ecuadorian market to help with the certification processes for oil companies. Soon after, we established the institute as a 100% Ecuadorian organization, chiefly focused on international certifications from the International Association of Drilling Contractors, based in Houston. The objective was to fill the gap in certification courses for firms based in Ecuador, both for the oil industry and its workforce. There have been interesting changes in the way we operate. We have shifted away from hiring only international professionals to teach the courses and have found highly skilled Ecuadorian professionals in the local market. I started to encourage Ecuadorian engineers to teach our courses so they could share their knowledge and expertise with the workforce in the oil industry, especially blue-collar workers. Currently, we specialize in courses related to fluids, production, welding, security, health, risk management, and fire control, just to name a few. We have worked for 70% of the companies in the oil industry in Ecuador, including Schlumberger and CNPC, which are leaders in the sector. We have an agreement with a leading company in the sector, Petroskills. We create international synergies with trendsetting institutions to better train oil companies. Our process works by training someone in a company who can then provide knowledge across the workforce. We are now working to expand our footprint to the industrial and mining sectors.</p><h4>How do new oil projects in the country affect demand for skilled workers?</h4><p>Ecuador is working to attract investment into the oil sector, with recent rounds of contracts for drilling, and more to come. These investments create the need for more local workers, and foreign companies that enter the country want to focus on this core business. That is where we come in. We provide a certified workforce for them to run their business. We have about 150 instructors focusing on security and health, for example. They also include in their courses information about working at Ecuador's high altitude. We have been holding as many as 20 courses at the same time across the country. We even hold them in the drilling fields, where we can bring our technicians, drivers, and equipment. At our main facility, we also have three simulators where people come every week to virtually and safely experience the possible situations that happen at a drilling unit. As the oil industry is undergoing rapid digitalization, we also include these trends in our courses.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>After the oil price fell some years ago, we realized we should not rely on just one sector, which creates vulnerability. We see opportunities now in using our expertise to create training and certification courses for similar industries, such as mining and industrial production. To this end, Tenro Industrial Training was established to meet the demands for the increasing number of projects in mining and industry. We are confident that new projects set to start in Ecuador will require skilled labor. We want to contribute to the birth of a responsible mining sector, which is why we have started establishing agreements with Peruvian and Chilean companies to offer courses in mining security.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENAP is the main energy company in Chile. How has it benefited from its domestic experience to pursue business opportunities abroad?</h4><p>In 1945, oil was discovered in Chile, and shortly thereafter the government created ENAP as a vessel to develop its reserves, in time extending its operations into the downstream and energy sectors. In 2018, ENAP went through an important transformation with a new corporate governance policy that promotes and encourages best practices to the highest standards as a state-owned company. ENAP is run by a board chaired by the government of Chile that oversees the execution of a long-term master business plan that has as its main objectives not only turning the company into a more efficient entity, but also boosting productivity. As a result, we are implementing a cost reduction plan that will help reduce the company's debt via different strategies that include strengthening current synergies and creating new ones among different divisions and with contractors and other players. ENAP currently operates in three segments: refining and commercialization (ENAP imports about 200,000bopd for its refineries, and an important portion of that is produced in Ecuador); gas and energy, which also includes geothermic energy generation; and exploration and production, which includes the company's businesses in Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, and Argentina. ENAP's decades-long experience led to the creation of an international branch of ENAP in the 1990s that set out with the specific purpose of seeking business opportunities abroad. Thus, ENAP entered the Ecuadorian market in 1992 as a non-operating partner in an oil production consortium. The performance of this market allowed ENAP to push its interests in Ecuador forward, and in 2003 the Ecuadorian branch of ENAP was awarded two contracts to operate several oilfields directly for the state-owned oil company. In 2010, those contracts were renegotiated directly with the government, and the new terms and conditions included significant extensions of the contract terms.</p><h4>What are the highlights of ENAP's exploration and production activities in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been extremely successful as operators. Our two main oil production contracts, of which we are the sole proprietors and operators (blocks 46-MDC and 47-PBHI), have seen steady increases in production output, moving from 6,000bpd in 2006 to more than 23,000bpd today. We have invested nearly USD500 million in these oil assets, which has led to a healthy diversification of ENAP's business portfolio abroad. It is worth mentioning that our operations in Ecuador are certified carbon-neutral, and we are the only oil company in Ecuador to achieve this. We have a great relationship with the government, not only because of our clean, efficient, safe and sustainable operations, but also at the negotiation table. Our consistent value proposal has allowed us to execute some 15 agreements with the state, all of which have been performed to the great satisfaction of both parties. We have not experienced any conflicts or sudden regulatory changes that could jeopardize our business operations or investments, or that could otherwise make the situation unbearable.</p><h4>What are your plans and strategies to strengthen your presence in Ecuador in 2020?</h4><p>Today our focus is set on three main drivers: sustainability, productivity, and responsibility. Sustainability is paramount because it provides the bedrock that will sustain our long-term growth. In this sense, we are directed to only selecting business opportunities that add value to our host country and to ENAP. Any and all business opportunities must be proven successful to a degree that satisfies our strict strategic decision-making filter. As for productivity, we are undergoing an innovation process that will allow us to become even more productive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Halliburton has just turned 100. How is the experience gathered over this time being shared across countries and being brought to Ecuador?</h4><p>We are really proud of our 100 years as few companies reach that milestone, and even fewer are as well positioned for continued success as we are today. One thing we learned over the last century is that to have long-term sustainability we need to collaborate with our customers to deliver unsurpassed value. Especially in Ecuador, where we have operated for almost 50 years, we are focusing our efforts on providing solutions, not just selling tools or products. We worked in partnership with Petroamazonas on the Igapo Project, for example, and brought our expertise to help develop fields that resulted in nearly tripling production in 12 months. More importantly, we are collaborating to help the field perform at its best.</p><h4>How did technology serve to triple production at Igapo?</h4><p>Using Halliburton technology, we were able to drill wells and produce from two different zones by measuring the production from each. Intelligent completion technology also allows us to intervene in a specific zone with no damage to the reservoir. There are great opportunities in digitalizing Ecuador's oil sector. For example, we can monitor operations at Igapo from our corporate offices in Quito or from a smartphone and put in place corrective actions in real time. One technology that is gaining significant traction in Ecuador is water flooding, which allows us to increase pressure and recover much more oil than we would under normal pressure conditions.</p><h4>Given Halliburton's status as a pioneer in fracking, what potential do you see in applying this technology in Ecuador?</h4><p>Unconventional fracking experienced rapid growth in the US, and many regions see it as an option to take advantage of their oil reserves. Other regional countries are already using it, such as Argentina. Regarding Ecuador, we do not have in-depth studies on unconventional reserves or if they are economically feasible for extraction. Without these studies, it is difficult to talk about unconventional fracking in Ecuador. However, Halliburton is the leader in hydraulic fracturing, and we are able to show that fracking can be done in a safe and environmentally friendly way.
</p><h4>
	Ecuador is expected to increase its oil output. What are the challenges in this regard?
</h4><p>
	There are many challenges, some quite sensitive. One is Ecuador has blocks that operators have not explored, but they have potential to entice additional investors. The key here is to have an open conversation with society and communities and explain that the oil and gas industry today is not the same as 30 years ago.
</p><h4>How has Halliburton been involved in renewable projects in Ecuador?</h4><p>
	Halliburton was the first company to drill a geothermal well in the country in 2017, taking advantage of its experience from oil fields and other geothermal projects around the world. Despite the challenges of this specific project, we proved the concept for Ecuador, and the country is now considering new geothermal wells. This is a great example of how we successfully applied superior engineering and collaborated with customers on other energy sources. The fossil fuel business is still very strong, and renewable energy is gaining ground. Our value proposition remains solid and applicable to any source of energy, and we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize value for our customers.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to Wayra Energy becoming a successful bidder in Ecuador's recent oil rounds?</h4><p>Wayra Energy is an Ecuadorian oil company with two main shareholders: a Spanish company listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange and focused on business related to electricity, power generation, telecommunications, infrastructure, and renewal energies; and a Venezuelan company specialized in infrastructure works (civil, mechanical and electrical) and oil and gas operations. In 2017, we decided to participate in the Minor Oilfields Round, the first launched by the current government, led by Petroamazonas. There were tendered service contracts for 15 fields, and Wayra Energy was awarded a service contract for a field named Paka Norte, which is a relatively small project, requiring an investment of less than USD50 million. Our strategy was to test the country through a small project. In the end, that project gave us reason to conduct bigger projects. We successfully started operations in Paka Norte and decided to take part in another round conducted by Petroamazonas called Oil and Gas 2018 Round. We were awarded the development of two new oilfields, Oso and Yuralpa. Because of these two new oilfields, our total investments in Ecuador collectively neared about USD300 million. Currently, we have the highest level of fulfillment of committed activities in the last two rounds, producing nearly 4,000bpd. We expect to reach up to 6,000bpd of production by the end of 2019. On top of that, Wayra Energy has been recording major achievements since its start in Ecuador. We drilled our first well in Yuralpa field within 16 days and our second in just 12, the fastest in the history of the field. We are not an oil service company, but an operator.</p><h4>How has the government worked to help oil companies invest and operate in the country? </h4><p>Back in 2017, investment funds were quite reluctant to grant financing for projects in Ecuador; however, the new administration started to take steps to become more attractive for investment. Fortunately, today the situation is different. If you go to a fund in the US, they would be willing to talk to you because of those changes. The main risk previously faced in Ecuador was the capacity to collect payments, because Petroamazonas had a negative record. Older contracts between the country and suppliers did not provide resolution methods in the case of fluctuating oil prices, which led to disputes. Currently, these issues are being solved. In the case of Wayra Energy, the company started producing oil in October 2018, and so far the government is fulfilling all its commitments. International investors around the world are now looking at Ecuador in another way, because the country is taking a new road to keeping the economy healthy.  </p><h4>What are the contractual conditions for Ecuador's Petroamazonas?</h4><p>In the case of our contracts, matters were eventually resolved at a court in Santiago de Chile. We acknowledge the efforts made by Petroamazonas to improve the conditions in its latest contracts, and they now have a higher level of compliance with international industry standards. Additionally, we and other service providers are in constant communication with Petroamazonas to seek improvements. We are grateful for the government's willingness to work hand-in-hand with the private sector currently.</p><h4>What upcoming rounds will you bid on in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are participating in the qualification phase for the bidding process for Sacha field. The field is quite familiar to us, because several of our employees have worked there before. The main risk previously faced by private companies in Ecuador was the capacity to collect payments, because previous administrations had a bad record. Older contracts between the country and suppliers did not provide resolution methods in the case of fluctuating oil prices, which led to disputes. This will require more than USD1 billion in investment, which is significantly higher than our previous investments, so the conditions must be attractive enough.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the main projects being developed by AMA Energy Service?</h4><p>The projects in which we have participated have significantly contributed to Ecuador's oil sector, which is the country's main revenue source. We have achieved significant success by following strict strategic, administrative, and technical policies. This allows us to meet the targets underlined in our programs, all of which require the highest level of efficiency. Innovation, technology, and our workforce's experience and technical capabilities are other important factors that have contributed to our success.</p><h4>How has the company managed to bring comprehensive solutions and become an EPC company?</h4><p>The company's objectives are clear and always aligned with transparent policies and high-level principles. The firm's evolution over time has allowed it to become a leading company in engineering, procurement, and oil facilities construction, offering the best infrastructure solutions to the market. Through this strategy, we have developed an excellent corporate image and have consolidated the company as a highly competitive and socially responsible firm.</p><h4>To what degree has the company participated in the construction of environmentally friendly infrastructure projects?</h4><p>At AMA, we understand that the development of high-quality infrastructure in line with international standards and certifications is one of the most positive steps that a developing country can take to achieve growth. By building infrastructure that complies with international standards, we can ensure that the products and services generated meet all the technical requirements. Our company's motto is "protecting the environment is everybody's duty," so adopting a green approach is one of the best strategies we can use to minimize our impact on the environment. As a company, we adopt the environmental policies of our clients and assure our commitment to the environment in which we operate.</p><h4>What business opportunities do you identify as Ecuador plans to boost oil production? </h4><p>The government is aiming to increase oil production to 600,000bpd. Once Ecuador leaves OPEC, work on pipelines, storage facilities, and refining facilities will start. This will open a plethora of opportunities for companies providing oil services. These opportunities will allow us to show our technical capacity in the development of oil infrastructure, which in turn will translate into experience and business growth.</p><h4>What will be the priorities of the company for 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, oil companies will face strategic challenges related to an environment of profound transformation. We are going through a period of transition; therefore, we should work on efficiency and boost the quality of our work in order to generate better results as a company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OCP Ecuador has been operating for more than 16 years. How has it impacted the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>OCP Ecuador has transported 855 million barrels of oil in 16 years, which represents USD47 billion of Ecuadorian exports. Each year, OCP Ecuador's operation represents 4% of the country's GDP. We invested USD1.47 billion in the construction of the heavy crude oil pipeline from 2001-2003, the largest private investment in Ecuador's recent history, which also generated around 16,000 jobs. Since the development of the pipeline, we have spent USD3.7 billion and paid around USD680 million in taxes. If OCP Ecuador did not exist, the country could not offer new oil concessions because there would be no transportation infrastructure.</p><h4>What have been some highlights of your corporate social responsibility policy?</h4><p>OPC Ecuador has invested USD45 million in social investments in around 700 community projects focused on health, education, and productivity. We always seek projects that follow specific goals in these fields so we can create value and growth in the communities through which the pipeline goes.</p><h4>To what degree is this project an example of how sustainable initiatives can be developed in more sensitive areas of Ecuador that might be subject to oil production?</h4><p>We have always had high environmental standards, so one result of the pipeline was the creation of higher environmental standards and certifications after our project started. Another strength we have as a company is that we are close to communities. We go through four provinces and have a good relationship with the community. There are always people who are not satisfied, but it is impossible to please every single individual. An example of this is that we did not suffer any impact from the October 2019 protests in Ecuador; that to some degree demonstrates we have a good relationship with local communities.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities are there for local private companies, given the bid rounds?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian government has realized it needs a key player in its attempt to boost the hydrocarbon industry, namely the private sector. The previous administration decided that developing the industry was the government's responsibility and prerogative. However, this was proven ineffective due to the plunge of oil prices. Consequently, all the social government-sponsored projects were severely affected. As such, the bidding rounds have specifically targeted private foreign investors, as the country needs foreign investment to balance certain macroeconomic indicators. In this scenario, local companies have a key role to play due to obvious factors, such as the fact that they are familiar with the market, the environment, and existing conditions. In the upcoming bidding rounds, we expect to witness a more direct and effective role of national companies. Much of Ecuador has yet to be explored, and the quality of our crude is outstanding. The fact that we do not have any insurgent groups in the areas where all the fields are located makes the domestic hydrocarbon sector all the more attractive for investment. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that Ecuador's currency is the US dollar, which provides a significant advantage for oil and mining companies, for there is no risk of currency devaluation while long-term forecasts are conducted.</p><h4>What role have you played in bringing international standards to Ecuador's oil sector?</h4><p>Sertecpet is a pioneer in the implementation of an integrated health, security, and quality-control system in Ecuador, which has served as a reference for operators in the market. As an integrated organization, Sertecpet ensures that the top executives move in that direction. We started to implement certified processes 18 years ago when we realized that if our company was to compete internationally, we had to abide by the highest standards. Today we comply with standards set by the American Petroleum Institute, and I am proud to say we were the first Latin American company to obtain the Q2 certificate. Additionally, and with the view of internationalizing our company, we understood that R&amp;D were key to our core business. Hence, we invested in our own R&amp;D as a means of creating value. It is worth mentioning that Sertecpet is one of the few private oil service companies in Latin America that has an R&amp;D department.</p><h4>Given Sertecpet's activity in R&amp;D, how has the company been innovating with regards to oil and gas 4.0?</h4><p>A company needs to plan for a minimum 20 years period. We plan to become global leaders in the implementation of innovative technologies in the oil and gas industry by 2040. To that effect, we have established alliances in this regard, such as with MIT's Energy Initiative and Edinburgh University, as well as other agreements with many local universities to train their students. We also seek to digitalize all our processes because technology is the only way to ensure a company is sustainable in the future. Just to name a few examples of how technology plays a key role in our core business, Sertecpet has entered into a contract with Pemex to reactivate 18 mature fields. From zero oil production, we were able to produce 10,500bpd applying our own software and technology. In Angola, we were able to increase Sonangol's production from 180bpd to 550bpd just by applying our own processes.</p><h4>What are your short-term priorities for Ecuador?</h4><p>We will partake in the country's push toward renewable energies. We have an office in Spain working to attract partners and joint ventures in wind and PV projects that will take place in Ecuador in the near future, not to mention the international market where we also have a presence. In this regard, we are committed to working with the relevant stakeholders to assist the government in the generation of public policies aligned with the country's long-term views and needs.\</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador's oil sector is being marked by the arrival of newcomers, not to mention plans to expand production. How do you fit into this? </h4><p>FLOPEC's vision is aligned with the country's hydrocarbon policy. We were created as a public company to ensure the maritime shipping of exports and imports of petroleum products goes smoothly. Ecuador has left OPEC as part of its expansion policy, which is important for us because there are plans to export more barrels now. This is because more production is expected due to the promotion of private investment and new rounds. Thanks to our commercial agreements and strategic alliances, we transported 90% of Ecuador's exports of crude in ships controlled by FLOPEC in 2019. Additionally, since 2006, FLOPEC has undergone an internationalization process. As a tanker shipping company, we saw the need to have a better triangulation of the cargo, namely the better occupation of ships. In this way, we not only go from Ecuador to the point of destination of Ecuadorian barrels and come back to local ports; our ships load in any other crude oil loading port. We can load Colombian or Mexican crude, too. As a result, there are times when ships do not return to Ecuador for more than two years. All this has greatly internationalized our operations. We are part of international pools and commercial agreements with other ship owners, including some of the 10 largest in the world. Some 60% of our income comes from abroad, while 40% corresponds to Ecuadorian business.</p><h4>How is the increasing amount of Colombian oil being exported through Ecuador affecting your operations?</h4><p>There are certain agreements between the Colombian and Ecuadorian governments that provide for the transportation of Colombian crude through Ecuador. In addition, the Heavy Crude Oil Pipeline is already transporting Colombian crude, and there are negotiations to increase the number of barrels of Colombian oil shipped from Ecuadorian ports. At the moment, Colombian Chaza crude makes up 2% of Ecuador's total oil exports. This creates more volume and business for our company.</p><h4>What new or existing markets will Ecuador seek to sell its extra capacity to? </h4><p>Most would go to countries where it is already present. Historically, most Latin American countries are deficient. In Peru and Chile, there is always demand for Ecuadorian oil, usually between 10% and 15%, although sometimes it goes up to 17%. The US takes 35-37% of Ecuadorian crude because its refineries need heavy crude. The oil it produces is very light, and most of the previous investments in refineries cannot process it in the best way. Demand will continue in the US, as that country tends to export its oil to new refineries with higher levels of refining or conversion, as in Asia. That market will use light crude that can be more profitable. Currently, we have access to a fleet of 59 ships through all our associations and agreements. All our partners are aware that our priority is to cover the Ecuadorian export program. Once this is assured we can look for other cargoes in other international loading areas.</p><h4>What are the priorities for FLOPEC in 2020?</h4><p>Since 2010, we have delivered close to USD400 million to the state, which is our sole shareholder—both in liquidity and in surpluses and infrastructure with the building of the LPG terminal in Monteverde. In that respect, our priorities are to keep increasing our national and international market share in the most profitable manner and continue taking advantage of our associations and commercial agreements to generate greater resources for the Ecuadorian state. As a state company, we also look after the wellbeing of the people who live in the areas where we operate (Esmeraldas, La Libertad), where we focus heavily on the full development of children and young people, whether through education, health, or labor programs. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the company's main drivers of growth in recent years?</h4><p>The growth of our sector is linked to the overall growth of the economy. Over the last three to four years, the insurance premiums generated in the country have been at around USD1.6 billion; however, the country has taken steps to solve financial and economic issues and create a more competitive economy under the new administration. We are confident that in upcoming years, Ecuador will be able to improve liquidity and its cash budgets and deficit. Over this time, there have been new regulations to improve the insurance system. For example, the minimum capital for insurance companies was raised to USD8 million, though the market has yet to witness consolidations or mergers. There are currently 26 operators in the market, which is a high number considering the size of our economy. In this context, Tecniseguros has managed to maintain growth of 1-1.6% by staying loyal to its core business, which is servicing the private sector. Tecniseguros actively participates in the country's strategic industries such as oil, mining, and agriculture, being the go-to insurance partner for flagship investments projects in Ecuador. We see the private sector becoming more important in the economy in the future because the current administration supports public-private partnerships, which creates business opportunities for the insurance sector. Additionally, the company has become much more efficient in handling its operations thanks to the implementation of technology. In addition, as part of Grupo Futuro, which is the most important insurance business group in the country, we have partners with whom we maintain direct communication and business collaboration, which has continued to grow and been made smoother thanks to technology.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of technology in the insurance business, and how is Tecniseguros specifically embracing it?</h4><p>The main impact of technology on insurance, as in any other business, can be measured in terms of efficiency and productivity. On the occasion of the company's 45th anniversary, we agreed that the development of the technological part in our organization would be a priority in the coming years. Tecniseguros has been focused on improving our predictive analytical tools through new technology and our omnichannel presence in order to improve both our internal operations and customer experience; therefore, we have quickly adopted new solutions such as mobile applications and robots, at the same time as creating a more dynamic website with specialized business chats and improving our social networks to better relate to our clients. Most importantly, we have aligned our strategic IT pillars with the overall objectives of the organization. As a result, our operations in handling vehicle cases or medical assistance are much more effective now, such as the tracking system for car repair processes or instant approval of hospital or medical budgets. A great example of our work in this field is our work with the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, where we have installed totems that insured students can use by entering their ID number to check the status of their policy. Marketing automation, business intelligence, and information security are other applications that define this innovation as our philosophy.</p><h4>What is Tecniseguros' approach to product innovation, and for which new products have you seen demand increase?</h4><p>As a broker, Tecniseguros works closely with insurance companies to create or adapt products that best fit the market's needs. There are newly created products that have seen some growth in recent years. Directors and officers are another category that covers companies' executives in legal matters, in the event they are sued personally for any decision they made during their tenure. This policy covers the legal expenses, the value of the claim, and other potential expenses. Tecniseguros has another policy called "Crime" that protects clients against fraud made by third parties or their own employees. In the field of logistics, stock throughput is an innovative policy for companies that import, distribute, or export merchandise covering all moveable goods that are traded by the company, including raw materials, semi-finished, and finished products. Finally, environmental liability is also developing at a rapid pace, given the raising concerns over companies' impact on the environment.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has driven Latina Seguros' success in such a competitive business?</h4><p>Latina Seguros is the oldest company in the local insurance sector, having been incorporated in 1879 and even issued a policy for one of the most prominent presidents in Ecuador's history, Eloy Alfaro. After several merger and acquisitions involving companies from different countries, Latina Seguros took its current form in 2003. We then decided to focus on sustainable growth instead of issuing as many policies as possible. The key to our success has been consistency, our emphasis on quality rather than numbers. Ecuador's insurance sector is marked by the presence of many players, including local and international competitors, and our company is today among the 10 largest companies in Ecuador. It is possibly among the three largest if we look at financial results. The company is strongly focused on having healthy balance sheets, and we count the largest amount of offices across the country. This has been coupled with digitalization efforts. Most of our insurance policies are filed through an electronic system. In terms of electronic processes, Ecuador is well advanced in making the market more sophisticated in that sense. As such, we have worked to boost the electronic services of our products for over a decade.</p><h4>How does the Ecuadorian market compare to others?</h4><p>Ecuador is not that different to others in Latin America. In the US, people spend 12% of their monthly income on insurance policies. In Europe, it is even larger. In Latin America, however, insurance companies hover around 3% of GDP, which is low compared to the ratios of the developed world. In Ecuador, we are among the two largest companies in the vehicle segment, which is one of the products with highest penetrations in LATAM countries. However, we want to progressively include other segments, including corporate, as well as life and health, and keep innovating in terms of products to keep up with market demands. Medical responsibility products are performing well in the market. We are launching an insurance to cover the responsibility of lawyers. There are opportunities to launch those products in Ecuador, which exist in other countries. As a society develops, the size of the insurance sector increases.</p><h4>Companies doing business with the public sector now have the possibility to choose any insurance company in the market. How are you specifically targeting this segment?</h4><p>After this decision by the Ecuadorian government, we see huge opportunities in expanding our presence in the segment of private companies doing business with the state. Additionally, a huge opportunity is being untapped, now that public entities themselves can also choose their insurance provider. As a matter of fact, when a company is the only one that participates in a market, prices rise and the quality of the product decreases. Open market competition, however, brings a completely different situation.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2020?</h4><p>For 2020, we are focusing on growing in the corporate and public sectors. The company will seek to increase in the life insurance sector and have more specialized products with a good performance. The insurance sector in Ecuador is healthy, and we need to keep working to make it more competitive. Thankfully, institutions in Ecuador are gaining more and more independence and becoming more aligned with what needs to be done at a regulatory level to be competitive internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What legislative changes were recently approved to facilitate the entry of foreign investment through the stock exchanges?</h4><p>The government is now more aware about what needs to be done to attract foreign investment in the financial sector. To do that, Ecuador has to demonstrate its capacity by managing its public debt. To boost this sector, we need to adjust the law of stock exchanges and the laws on taxes, which are underway. We have had talks with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to understand the changes we need to implement to make regulations more attractive. As a result, we have come up with a bill to reform the capital markets that the government has to send to congress and approve over the course of 2020. In addition to including new regulations and a framework, the bill has certain changes in the taxing system to make the financial sector more attractive for foreign investment. The Quito Stock Exchange is advocating for a structural and comprehensive reform. The bill reforms 94 articles. It has several articles in the taxation area, and there are many positive things that will allow a significant change in the capital markets. The IDB, World Bank, and US Treasury have been extremely helpful in conducting an analysis of our public debt and how we can better manage it.</p><h4>What advantages do investors see in the local financial sector?</h4><p>First, we have dollars. Second, our interest rates are highly attractive and compensate the risk to invest. Third, corporate governance standards are extremely high. Fourth, it is a growing market in many different industries. All these conditions are appealing to investors, so we need to sell the country. Our goal is to work together with the government and organize more roadshows abroad to attract investment in the financial sector. We provide Quito Invest with the technical support to develop its projects.</p><h4>Some large multinationals with operations in Ecuador have raised funds through the Quito Stock Exchange. What are the benefits of this?</h4><p>We have had several meetings with companies to communicate the benefits of the stock exchange and have shown multinationals that there are capacities in Ecuador to raise capital to finance local projects. In addition, it is interesting that these multinational companies have disclosure of public information in their local market, which makes risk management easier and improves relations with traditional banking. And thirdly, by participating in the stock exchange, companies realize they are developing weapons to protect themselves by having new owners of the company. It is a great decision because it forces one to better manage the savings of locals. It is a win-win situation. What's more, local firms have seen that individuals with savings are willing to invest in different options than those offered by traditional banking. In 2019, we closed with USD1.1 billion in bond issuances in every stock exchange in Ecuador.</p><h4>There are plans to allow dual listing in Ecuador's market, including mining companies that are heavily investing in the country. How receptive are they to this?</h4><p>International companies will consider participating in the stock exchange because the benefits we provide make their operations more transparent. We are extremely open to do dual listing and have been in talks with the Chilean and Canadian stock exchanges to explore those options. We are also taking steps to integrate our stock exchange with those of El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Panama to be able to purchase shares in different markets in Latin America. Ecuador can also become part of the Pacific Alliance, which includes integrating the local stock exchange in the MILA market, which connects us with Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Colombia. Those countries are net exporters of capital, while Chile and Mexico are entitled to invest outside of those countries and are aware of the importance of diversifying their portfolios.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Banco Solidario contributed to the growth of microfinance in Ecuador?</h4><p>Banco Solidario started as a bank specialized in financial inclusion. Over the last 25 years, we have added 1 million people to the financial system who were not attended by the traditional banking sector. Financial inclusion indicators in Ecuador are under average in Latin America, which means there is a great deal to do. The main players in the area, including the Ecuadorian Association of Private Banks (ASOBANCA) and the Association of Microfinance Institutions (ASOMIF), all seek to promote inclusion in the agenda of the government to boost financial inclusion. The central bank signed an agreement with the World Bank on financial inclusion, so the issue is becoming increasingly important in the country. There are about 5-6 million people who could potentially gain access to products from financial institutions. The main problem is the lack of a favorable regulation, so we expect to see certain changes from the government to boost this area. The countries with the best financial inclusion rates in Latin America have three characteristics: institutionalization of the sector, regulations, and a political agenda from the government. Colombia is a great example, as this process has been ongoing for the last decade, with success. Banco Solidario has 54 offices all over the country. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge is to start to attend to clients at the bottom of the financial pyramid and give them digital financial access.</p><h4>Given the country's potential, how does Banco Solidario plan to increase the number of people in Ecuador with access to banking services?</h4><p>Financial inclusion has been our focus, and we will be an important player to include a large percentage of those 5-6 million people that could be easily banked. The technological revolution generates certain tools that can make this process more efficient. We have a lab in which we prepare and develop new products, and we use digital transformation and innovation to improve financial inclusion. Banco Solidario was the first bank to do micro credits 25 years ago—among other products—so innovation is in our DNA. We are embracing technology without forgetting the personal approach needed for our business to work. For example, existing clients can renew their loans online, though its first loan has to be granted through a face-to-face approach to better understand the client's needs and situation.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about the history of the bank since its creation?</h4><p>BGR began its operations in 1988 with the purpose of covering the necessities of the Ecuadorian Army. The bank is focused mainly on providing service to army personnel. In 1994, Banco Pichincha became a shareholder of BGR. Other shareholders are the Institute of Social Security of the Army, ANDEC (the army's steel company), and the General Directorate of Civil Aviation. This alliance has been positive for the bank because it has allowed us to develop our banking expertise during all these years. Our focus is to provide services to military members. We also provide services to civilians and private companies, mostly SMEs. Our bank's assets are approximately around USD900 million, so we are a mid-sized bank. We are currently the ninth-largest bank in Ecuador. Our three main goals are to have strong financial stability, excellent customer service, and a great working environment. Our goal is to become the best bank in Ecuador. We have one of the best return on equities in the system. In addition, customer satisfaction levels are considerably high. We no longer talk about services, but customer experiences. We also want to have a great working environment within the institution. Employees are well trained, and we make sure everyone's ideas are listened to. We measure the satisfaction of our workers through specific metrics.</p><h4>What products and services do you offer your customers? </h4><p>We have a broad portfolio, specifically in terms of assets. We have consumption loans, credit cards, and mortgages for both military and civilian customers. For companies, we offer loans for working capital and capex. We also have a foreign trade service that consists of a service dedicated to companies wanting to import certain goods or machinery. We issue letters of credits to support these trade operations and offer competitive loan rates, but our main difference is the quality of our service.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the concept of financial efficiency?</h4><p>It is the bank's strategic goal. Today, the country has slow economic growth. As a result, competition has become more aggressive, and the only way to differentiate from our competitors is by becoming efficient in financial terms. That means we must implement AI strategies, robotics, and optimization of costs and expenses. The goal is to eliminate unnecessary processes in order to maintain our excellent customer service at the lowest possible cost.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to reach a digitalized banking system?</h4><p>We started to work on innovation and digital transformation two years ago. We want to build a proper IT infrastructure to offer the best products to our customers. Our user-friendly app allows our clients to make online payments, see the status of their accounts, and make transfers. Nearly 20% of all the bank's transfers are made digitally, and we are growing on the delivery of online credits. Digital transformation also requires a change of culture, so the entire company is thinking in a more customer-oriented model. Clients want a faster response, and the global trend is moving toward self-service.</p><h4>What are your main strategies for 2020 and beyond?</h4><p>The strategy is to remain solid in the areas I mentioned. We have a well-defined roadmap in terms of digital transformation. We are launching a new, state-of-the-art digital platform between February and March 2020, the best in the Ecuadorian market, which we want to make user-friendly. We have some technological developments in terms of cultural transformation to make this an agile bank. We want to surpass the threshold of USD1 billion in assets so we can continue growing.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the local financial sector? </h4><p>The indicators of the banking system remain strong, but the government needs to do its homework and pass certain laws to facilitate foreign investment and reduce the fiscal deficit. We need more cash flow and economic growth to generate economic development.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Banco del Pací­fico has had one of the best performances in the sector. What drove this?</h4><p>Since the beginning, Banco del Pací­fico has been focused on providing access to financial services for every sector in order to boost the country's development. In addition, we focused on the use of technology for product development, which turned the bank into one of the most innovative in the country and region. We have sought to provide services throughout the country through agencies, tellers, virtual centers, ATMs, Tu Banco Banco Aquí­ points, and other centers that provide services to more than two million clients in Ecuador. Right now, Banco del Pací­fico is one the largest banks in the Ecuadorian financial system in terms of profitability and solvency levels in the last years. In 2019, we issued nearly USD1.38 billion in credit for different sectors of the economy at the best possible rates and offered preferential conditions, including for the real estate and public housing sectors. Additionally, we have reached the historical figure of USD100 million in profits. Furthermore, we hit a 15.01% return on equity. These results are due to the specific care we have put into controlling expenses and the products the bank offers.</p><h4>The Ecuadorian economy is moving toward a pro-market model. What is the importance of social responsibility for the bank?</h4><p>We have focused our sustainability initiatives on understanding the needs of different interest groups, managing socio-environmental risks, and generating tangible value. This is done in order to promote the well-being of the community and the preservation of the environment, which will consequently ensure that the bank will continue to exist in the future. In terms of financial inclusion, we have made huge efforts because we are convinced that it is worth fighting for. Better education leads to improved living conditions of communities and improved decision-making through adding the responsibility of managing financial duties. As for the environment, we have different initiatives to diminish our carbon footprint with efficient alternatives, both innovative and sustainable, to create value and become a team that fully embodies the bank's values.</p><h4>What role do the entrepreneurial credit lines and micro-companies play in the bank's operations?</h4><p>Banco del Pací­fico has developed solutions and sought allies to ensure better access to credit for every sector of the economy, including craftsmen and micro-entrepreneurs. A clear initiative that demonstrates this is the Bank of Opportunities Program, which, alongside the Municipality of Guayaquil and Ecuador's National Financial Corporation (CFN), has provided credit ranging from USD500-1,500 for a 36-month period at a 15% annual interest to more than 5,000 clients. Regarding education, we have realized the importance of social inclusion and thus created in 2016 Crédito Estudios Pací­fico, a product that supports the professional careers of young people through education. In 2018, we provided those services to 10,394 students to the tune of USD41.3 million.</p><h4>What factors will ensure the sustainability of the financial sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The financial system has showed a high-level of adaptability to a constantly changing environment. Therefore, sustainability in the short and medium term will depend on how well liquidity is managed, what new opportunities there are to generate funds domestically and abroad, and to channel economic resources in an orderly fashion to all the economy's sectors, thus triggering an economic social model. This model is the basis of creating a diverse economy that does exclusively depend on one sector.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following the official invitation from the Republic of Ecuador, what have been your first impressions, and how do you see relations between the two countries evolving?</h4><p>It was my pleasure to have received such a warm welcome upon my arrival in Ecuador. It is a place that enjoys beautiful weather and wonderful nature. Despite the long distance between Qatar and Ecuador, the two countries have much in common. The relationship between the two countries is developing on all levels. I have visited Ecuador in my capacity as a businessperson to learn about Ecuador's investment environment, as well as to learn more about the areas Al Faisal Holding can play an effective role. Our investments outside of Qatar are mainly in real estate and hospitality. This is where we are most likely to be evaluating opportunities, particularly in light of the recent agreement between Qatar and Ecuador aimed at developing the hospitality and tourism sectors in both countries.</p><h4>Which sectors in Ecuador do you see as the most promising for investments?</h4><p>There are several promising sectors in Ecuador, such as agriculture and tourism. However, to better evaluate the various opportunities, we have to further understand the country's investment rules and regulations regarding foreign investors, export, and marketing, both in Ecuador and its neighbors. I consider Ecuador one of the world's most beautiful tourist destinations. I hope this sector receives the attention and care it deserves, as there are many attractive factors that can help drive tourism in Ecuador, including the capital city of Quito, the volcanoes, as well as the fact that the equator passes through the country. One of my favorite places in Ecuador is the Galápagos Islands. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most beautiful parts of Ecuador.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Getting the finance right</h4><p>Over the last year, the single decision of restricting hiring through the so-called special regime, we saved the state USD450 million. In the same direction, to protect our public resources, we implemented an austerity program that removed or merged, depending on each case, 13 ministries and secretariats, in addition to other institutes and other lower-level entities. We reduced the salaries of government officials by 15% and of ministers by 20%, starting from the president of the republic, as it could not be otherwise.</p><p>At the same time, we improved tax collection. In 2018 alone, it was over USD15 billion, the best result in the country's history. This improvement included the taxing alleviation program, through which we helped more than 300,000 Ecuadorians make their tax payments. It was essential, furthermore, to reduce the fiscal gap. If we did not do it, the deficit could have increased up to USD8 billion. With the simultaneous effort of spending reduction and optimization, and through the increase of our own revenues, we were able to reduce it to USD3.5 billion. A reduction from USD8 billion to USD3.5 billion—that is acting responsibly.</p><p>The Prosperity Plan, as our economic policy is known, already has USD10.2 billion in foreign financing in long term and low interest for infrastructure and productive development. In addition, we can continue protecting the most needed and the excluded, those who are always forgotten. In 2018, we had USD1.4 billion in FDI, a record in our history. We also achieved local private investment commitments for USD9.5 billion for the next five years.</p><h4>Social investments</h4><p>Banecuador has delivered USD1.75 billion and USD370,000 in credits. That is how we are helping to accomplish the dream of thousands of sisters and brothers to have their own business, through the programs People's Bank and Bank of the Street. The National Financial Corporation (CFN) has already lent USD1.3 billion, representing 40,000 direct jobs and thousands more in indirect jobs. Additionally, nearly USD110 million in credit from the National Guarantee Fund were awarded to 1,500 entrepreneurs. In 2018, public banks awarded 100,000 credits for the agriculture sector, totaling USD600 million. And in 1Q2019, USD156 million were added.</p><p>Additionally, USD450 million were used to transport more water to the fields through the Agua Segura mission: 116 projects of water and sanitation that benefited 2 million people in 94 cantons. Through the National Plan for Irrigation and Drainage, which provides more work and production in our field, we invested USD86 million in 178 projects for 100,000 peasant families. In line with continuing to carry resources for the economy, we increased social investment by USD400 million. Through the financial system, we will provide USD800 million for productive credit, which will enormously impact job generation.</p><h4>Economic reforms to attract FDI</h4><p>We need a modern taxing system that is aligned with the new dynamic of the state that is equitable, progressive, and promotes growth. We achieved investments for USD1.4 billion, in addition to the USD1.9 billion already committed by the signing of agreements to reactivate the oil sector. Additionally, in the 12th oil round, seven in eight blocks received investment offers for USD370 million for exploration and USD800 million more for development. Always thinking of investment in employment and productive activities, we renegotiated USD900 million in contracts with advantageous conditions for the country and retook the modality of participation contracts. We also carried out the most important oil development of the last three decades: Block 45, which will produce USD5.5 billion through 2021.</p><p>Regarding electricity generation, we inaugurated the hydroelectric plants Delsitanisagua, which had 275MW, and Minas San Francisco, with 180MW. We revived the project Toachi-Pilaton, which seemed impossible, and we will conclude the connection between Coca-Codo Sinclair and Guayaquil. We work across the country in solar power projects, including the sector of El Aromo, with a 220-MW capacity with a USD170-million investment. The project could cover more than half of the energy required by Manta. Additionally, we have wind projects, wind-generated energy, like Villonaco in Loja, which also will be included in the interconnected national system. And following the global trend, we have started to introduce electric buses and vehicles.</p><h4>Mining boom</h4><p>Some 32,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created from an investment already obtained of USD2 billion in the mining sector, which will surpass USD3.8 billion in 2021. The strategic projects and those of second generation will be developed through the responsible use of water under a strict control of environmental impacts. We will continue making responsible decisions in mining. During my period, more than 200 concessions that had been generously awarded were removed after irregularities had been found.</p><h4>Environmental policy</h4><p>As for our campaign against climate change, the government's policy is clear: We ratified the Paris Agreement and presented to the UN and the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization the Amazonian Initiative to halt deforestation and protect the rights of our beloved indigenous peoples. I am an Amazonian myself; I was born in the jungle and am committed to taking care of nature and, at the same time, ensuring the generation of resources that the country requires. These are not contradictory.</p><p>Additionally, preserving nature makes great sense for the strategic development of tourism, which generates huge job opportunities for thousands.</p><p>With an annual average of 1.8 million visitors, tourism attracts USD1.9 billion and generates 300,000 jobs. Our post-oil future is the tourism sector in the most megadiverse and beautiful country in the world.<br>Infrastructure projects and PPPs</p><p>With an USD800-million investment, we built, rebuilt, and expanded 14 roads and five bridges. We started making the Quito-Guayaquil road corridor a reality. It is hard to believe that there is no highway between the two most important cities in Ecuador. We have to solve that problem by building a corridor that includes tunnels, lateral and elevated areas, as well as the project known as Tren Playero. Similarly, we have awarded a concession for the Machala-Guayaquil road and the Guayaquil-Salinas road. Additionally, we have a concession project for Guayaquil's south viaduct and the road corridor of Jujan-Quevedo-Santo Domingo.</p><p>I must mention the committed support that the government has provided to the construction of the metro in Quito. It looked as though the project was halted, but we made it possible through direct investment of USD400 million and a sovereign guarantee for an additional USD620 million. Quito will now have its metro. Also, with a financing of USD200 million, we revived the project of the tram in Cuenca.</p><p>Public-private partnerships save the state millions, but more importantly generate thousands of jobs. No matter what angle we take, all these actions together put our economy on the move.</p><h4>The new face of Ecuador</h4><p>Ecuador, today, is presenting a new face to the world. We promote our export offerings, investments, and tourism. Our international relations have been refreshed and are now based on the search of a commonwealth and not ideological affinities. They are to create new opportunities to develop the country. Non-reimbursable cooperation will reach USD400 million, and very soon Ecuadorians will be exempted from the requirements of the Schengen visa to enter EU and the EFTA countries. œ–</p><p><em>* Excerpt of a speech given at the National Assembly on May 24, 2019.</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

For provinces without major natural resource exploitation such as Loja, where we are located, the services sector is the main source of income, and thus the citizens become the most important resource. We have developed our research programs based directly on the national development objective and to cover the knowledge gap in important areas. We recently opened the Science and Technology Park, the only space of its kind in Ecuador's south, where we research subjects such as cancer treatments in partnership with outstanding international research groups. We also have the leading national startup incubator in PRENDHO, which serves as a platform for entrepreneurial development. The university is also working on technological trends and their implementation such as IoT, and finally, there is significant research being conducted on Palo Santo, its benefits, and the overall commercial chain and production. Most of these activities have been worked on at the Scientific and Technologic park in just the two years since we created it in 2017.</p><h4>Regarding the strategic sectors of the Ecuadorian economy, how is UTPL contributing to the creation of an increasingly skilled workforce?</h4><p>The optimum way of promoting these activities is through supporting entrepreneurship and incentivizing innovation in these industries. Accordingly, we have created a business school that oversees entrepreneurial courses in every program we offer. Our entrepreneurial ecosystem also has a prototype laboratory that allows ventures to further study the market performance of their product through the reception of prototypes. Only after successful completion of testing can a start-up go to the incubator to receive the necessary institutional support for a project to be realized. In the established six-month incubation period, a project will either graduate to become a small enterprise or be removed from the program in favor of rising successful projects from the prototype labs. We have gone as far as securing funding for the early stages of full-on business operations for projects that need capital to cross that productivity and profitability line. Overall, there is an important humanistic nature in our institution, and we want every student who graduates from UTPL to have the integral knowledge of the career of their choice and at least the basic skills required to start a business. One sector drawing considerable attention is mining, and we have established strong relations with the mining companies operating in Ecuador. Indeed, we recently opened a mining innovation center in Zamora where we train the industry's workforce. For example, there is a heavy machinery operation school that certifies operators who go on to be hired as technicians at mining companies, which helps the company meet industry standards. Our labs also aim to certify the concentration of gold, copper, and silver in the materials extracted and to support local governments in this key task.</p><h4>UTPL has pioneered regional online education. What role does this methodology play in your academic planning?</h4><p>Effectively, we were the first university in South America to offer long-distance higher education programs. Remote studies have played a major role in the growth of our institution, and we want to make the offer better with a complete overhaul of our model. We want to modernize our remote education programs and are preparing for future trends as well. We have created a knowledge factory that constantly keeps programs up to date with the latest trends and content. Still, we want to take it one step further by opening our academic offer internationally. Although we have university centers in Rome, Madrid, and New York, these were created for Ecuadorian immigrants living in those countries or just looking to study overseas. Now, we want to globalize our offering and expand our reach to basically be accessible by anyone interested in taking our courses and enrolling in our programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Grupo Avintia evolved since starting in 2007, and what would you highlight as its main achievements?<br></strong>The group was first strongly linked to the residential sector, and we developed the group by collaborating with different financial entities beyond construction, such as assets with financial-title problems. The company has the capabilities and flexibility to adapt its business, and this is our great value. We do land acquisition, land development, debt, and investment fundraising to develop sub-assets. We look after the entire value chain of engineering development, project, promotion, construction, after-sales, and delivery. We have changed the company according to trends in the sector. Since the business changes so quickly, it forces the sector to adapt to its needs, due to the rise in construction costs, the amount of confidence in the final buyers, and surplus values of land. All this will significantly change the business model, making the business malleable. In sales figures, we exceeded EUR600 million for the group in 2019. The plan for 2020 is to consolidate our portfolio in construction and real estate.</p><p><strong>The residential area makes up a large part of the company's growth. Was this a conscious development, and do you intend for it to continue being a large proportion of Avintia's portfolio?</strong><br>Indeed, 70% of what we do corresponds to construction. We have about 111 projects underway and 7,200 homes under construction. The other 30% of our business is in civil works and macro projects, such as roads. We try to match the needs of the market to change and innovate in industrialization. Due to the volume of our platform, we can do a lot in this regard. In the real estate sector, the group has about 40 ongoing projects with different associative models with developers. Avintia's real estate business started because there were no promoter partners in the country. This part of the group seeks partnerships at the national level with promoters who can develop promotions in geographical areas where we have a relationship with asset holders but no model. We go with the financial entities, get the asset, and look for the partner offering the best solution. The real estate part has separated into three branches. One branch is the old Avintia that continues working on a smaller scale because there are fewer and fewer promotions for third parties. Another branch is Avintia Inmobiliaria, which does pure promotion through exclusive projects in areas like Ibiza. The third branch is renting, which we have generated through a rental housing platform named Locare. We have closed on a first investment of EUR120 million to construct 919 homes in Madrid with Tectum, an investment platform. This will be the first project we do in B2R.</p><p><strong>The issue of human talent and the rising cost of materials are two discussed topics in the construction industry in Spain. Is this an issue that Avintia faces in its operations?</strong><br>In the end, everything is done through people. In a sector that has many ups and downs, we must attract talent and internal productive capacity. We are working on this problem day by day. The subject of materials is complicated. No company can work on materials because it is a market, and it is a matter of supply and demand. Concerning industrialization, we are working upstream. To make a sustainable product, we can guarantee the term, price, and quality. Nobody in the real state sector guarantees all three things. Due to the low amount of labor in construction and cost of materials, both the construction and quality are much resented. We are trying to tackle the issue with a new project, Proyecta, where we work upstream with the client in the industrialization and development parts. We help the client or developer to meet their expectations of term, price, and quality. For terms, we work on construction systems with them and take the project forward.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the activities of Ví­a Célere, what is the origin of the company, and how has it evolved in recent years?<br></strong>Ví­a Célere was founded in 2007 by Juan Antonio Gómez Pintado alongside four people with the vision of growing internationally. The first operations were in Brazil and Bulgaria, followed by Poland. The economic crisis hit Spain dramatically, and the real estate sector sunk, though several opportunities emerged. Some financial entities were identifying experienced operators and servicers to develop the number of assets they were recovering from defaulting clients. In 2010 and 2011, Ví­a Célere reached an agreement with some of these financial entities, and that marked the return of our activities to Spain. In 2011, Ví­a Célere reached an agreement with Bankia, Banco Sabadell, and Catalunya Caixa. Ví­a Célere has been, since its early days, a fully owned construction company that today executes between 30-40% of its projects. In 2017, different international funds approached the founder in order to acquire Spanish operations. Ví­a Célere was eventually sold to a group of funds led by Värde Partners.</p><p><strong>Ví­a Célere has a strong commitment to innovation and industrialization. How do you embody this in your projects?<br></strong>We have more than 10 internationally recognized innovations in our business operations. Our philosophy is to do something different from what the industry has done in the past in order to develop better designs, more efficient construction techniques, and more comfortable homes. We have many challenges ahead, though the one we especially care about is the environment. Our sector has had a significant negative impact on the environment, which is why today we have transformed all our projects into eco-friendly ones. We have been building homes almost the same way in the last 50 years, so we need significant efforts in terms of innovation and industrialization. These two factors automatically imply cheaper and better homes and, therefore, better access for young people. Society needs to ensure people between 24 and 35 can afford homes. This must be a priority for any given country, including Spain.</p><p><strong>Ví­a Célere has several offices throughout Spain. Does Madrid have the potential to develop its real estate?<br></strong>Madrid is a dynamic city and has its own growth drivers compared to other mid-size cities in Spain. It can be considered a mature market since there are few land plots to be developed in the downtown area, though new neighborhoods outside the core of the city are emerging in an extremely dynamic and vivid way. Madrid was the first city to recover from the crisis and became a focus of attraction for all players in the sector. That implied an increase in construction costs, but also in retail prices. Going forward, one of the big problems of Madrid is the availability of fully permitted land plots.</p><p><strong>Why is Spain such an attractive country for foreign investment in real estate?<br></strong>Spain is perhaps one of the fundamental real estate markets in the world. We are extremely privileged in terms of weather. We have one of the best healthcare systems in the world, and we live in a safe country. Prices are extremely reasonable for international customers, and that creates an attractive business case for second residences. If we talk about first residences in big cities, we are now in a sweet moment of the cycle. Spain was hit heavily by the last crisis, and that forced families, corporations, and the public sector to reduce expenditure significantly. But now, many of the customers are in a healthy financial situation to acquire a house with savings and have the capacity to deal with big mortgages. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Throughout 2018, construction costs increased by 10.3%, according to data from the Direct Construction Cost Index. How is the government ensuring this increase does not affect the future of construction in Spain?<br></strong>It is a matter of great importance for the sector since it must respond to the increase in prices through a commitment to greater industrialization of components and processes. This policy must also serve to meet the quality and sustainability requirements established by the government as strategic objectives. The increasing costs are associated with the dynamism of the construction sector, which is again contributing to the revival of economic activity and job creation. Throughout Spain, construction employment is growing at an annual rate of 11.2%. In 1Q2019, construction directly employed 1.28 million people. Although this is well below the 2.7 million people employed in construction at the beginning of 2008, it reveals the strong demand for workers in the sector. In turn, GDP from construction has grown 6.9% YoY in 1Q2019, representing more than four consecutive years of growth. In the context of such intense growth, it is also necessary to advance in terms of training skilled labor to respond to the existing demand. Consequently, the government will continue to work in these two areas in the coming years: supporting the modernization and industrialization of the sector linked to an improvement in product quality and sustainability and boosting employment training to ensure the availability of qualified personnel, thus promoting the balanced development of the sector.</p><p><strong>The 2018-2021 Housing Plan contemplates aid for the promotion of protected housing with an allocation of EUR357 million in 2019. What has been done so far, and what role do the municipalities and regional governments have in it?</strong><br>First, the execution of the 2018-2021 State Housing Plan is carried out through agreements already formalized with the Autonomous Communities (CCAA) and with the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, through which the Ministry of Development has committed to contribute a total of EUR1.37  billion between 2018 and 2021. In 2018, 50.4% of the funds transferred were for rental assistance to shared units that have few resources, including young people and people over 65. Indeed, 51 agreements were signed through which resources will be devoted to the creation of 1,508 homes, 1,358 public and 150 private. They will be on the rental market for a minimum of 25 years. In sum, I am optimistic about what has been done so far, regardless of whether it is a plan approved by the previous People's Party government. We must promote the increase and conservation of our public housing stock and deepen aid to those especially vulnerable, such as victims of gender-based violence, people subject to eviction from their homes, and homeless people. We will insist on an effective coordination of policies through the corresponding sector conference, a cause abandoned by the previous governments.</p><p><strong>What are the main objectives and priorities of your office for next year, and what is the route forward for the rest of your mandate?</strong><br>Taking into account the situation that many families and the sector find themselves in, we want to address a series of diverse measures, but all of them need to be integrated into a joint and strategic vision. We began with this vision, creating a dynamic of common work in housing with the constitution of an inter-ministerial group, reinforcing the coordination between departments, seeking the coherence of public policy, and identifying a series of urgent measures aimed at guaranteeing the effective exercise of the right to housing. It is a vision in which, in addition to advancing in this transversal and integrated approach, the citizen becomes the center of public policies, incorporating greater social commitment to vulnerable households and the youth; the sector will exercise leadership in global strategies aimed at reaching the commitments of the Paris Agreement, the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda, and the implementation of the urban agenda, placing the sector at the forefront of renewable energy and efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been major milestones since RACC's founding in 1906?<br></strong>RACC is an association created as a non-profit entity to provide services to the first car users. Back then, it focused on tourism, giving drivers advice on driving, mechanical assistance, and as a platform for motor sports enthusiasts. As the use of cars has grown, along with the middle class, so has RACC. The great shift was in 1990, when we started giving services not only focusing on the vehicle but also on members. In 1998, we expanded from Catalonia into the rest of Spain. Today, RACC counts some 811,000 members.</p><p><strong>How has RACC diversified its portfolio of services?<br></strong>Since the club was linked to cars, our insurance and road assistance services made a great deal of sense. From then, we also started with travel services, driving schools, home emergencies, and mobile phone technologies. Our core business is our members and amounts to 50% of our business, while around 40% comes from insurance.</p><p><strong>How has RACC adapted to new technologies?<br></strong>In 2015, we started a 2020 strategic plan with a few pillars. The first is a technological and digital transformation, for which we invested around EUR18 million. The second is to go from being a club that offers services to drivers to becoming a mobility services club. We want to be close to people whether they are moving on foot, public transportation, bikes, scooters, motorcycles, or cars. We want to modify all processes of members' relationships with us. We are in contact with over 600,000 families, who can all call us about issues related to their homes, cars, insurance, travel, and so on. Previously, we had a silo system, meaning each area of the company had custom-made software, but now we have moved to a cloud-based standard system for the entire company. We receive around 10,000 calls daily that go to a single database.</p><p><strong>What objectives have you developed in cooperation with Consorci de la Zona Franca?<br></strong>In 2017, we created a new business lab that comes up with ideas related to the digital world. As a result, we have developed a few projects with a quick time-to-market. We create, develop, and launch, and if it does not work, we move on. RACC Hop is a B2B app allowing people who work together or close to each other to carpool. It is similar to BlaBla Car, but for daily life. In particular, Barcelona's Zona Franca has around 4,000 employees and is not well-connected by public transportation. RACC Hop helps to reduce costs, optimize employees' time, and encourage socialization. RACC Hop is now in pilot mode, but we also launched the City Trips app, which already has 60,000 users and is operating in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, and Santiago de Chile. In this app, one can access all the city's shared mobility systems including bikes, motorcycles, car sharing, and public transportation. The app tells users which mode of transport is the most cost- and time-effective. City Trips is open to the public. We have found investment partners, who are either providing the services in the app or are third parties interested in being stockholders. We are now looking for investment from public transportation companies. So far, we received an investment from the International Automobile Federation (FIA), which includes around 200 auto clubs globally</p><p><strong>One of RACC's priorities is to promote responsible practices on the road and reduce accidents. How do you achieve this?<br></strong>We want mobility to be safer, cleaner, more connected, and more accessible. We lobby to influence drivers' education. We supported the initiative of drivers' licenses with points and worked with manufacturers on collision tests. In that regard, we do a safety ranking of cars every year. We carry out rigorous public studies on the roads, so we can influence government on how to improve roads and reduce accidents. Thus, we work with the drivers, cars, and the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>After its 150th anniversary, the Port of Barcelona achieved a record volume of traffic, increasing 10% YoY in 2018. To what do you owe this expansion, and what is your strategy for further growth?<br></strong>First, we want to be more competitive and focus on improving our intermodal solutions. The Port of Barcelona is Spain's only port connected to Europe. We have excellent rail connections, which means we can send containers and goods to all European markets, while receiving goods from them. Therefore, the first vector of our strategy is competitiveness. The second is sustainable growth. We want to grow on a scale that can serve the market and invest in additional infrastructure only when absolutely required by market dynamics. The third focal point is innovation and digital transition for better customer orientation. We will close this year with interesting numbers, thanks to the US-China trade war. Although there is a fall in exports, we have also seen a rise in imports. Our total traffic amounts to 67.7 million tons, and 40-45% of this is imports, mainly from Asia. Two years ago, exports were significantly more important than imports, but now they are leveling out. A port can develop its business with an internal perspective, but our challenge is to explain to industries that the port is a goods gateway.</p><p><strong>What percentage of your operations comes from cruise ships, and how do you cope with the influx of tourism traffic at the port?<br></strong>We are a base port, which means the bulk of cruises begin and end here. This is an important point, because it means we can link these tourists to the rest of the city. We seek to maximize the quality of their visit in Barcelona. The link with the airport is also extremely important, because many cruise tourists arrive by plane. Additionally, some spend days after their cruise traveling around Catalonia, and we are an important partner in this. We have been working to push operations outside of peak season; today, around 60% of cruises are in peak season, and 40% are in the off season. Barcelona, though, cannot grow any more in terms of the cruises it hosts, having reached capacity levels. We have an agreement with the city to locate the cruises further from the city. We have also tried to improve facilities by joining forces with cruise companies to improve the touristic experience.</p><p><strong>What are your primary objectives for 2020, and what is the biggest challenge you face in Barcelona today?<br></strong>In 2020, we will focus on improving inter-modality between ship and rail. This is vital, as 34% of our volumes is by rail cargo. We would like to increase our radius and are keen to improve our direct shipping lines to Italy. We can reduce road traffic by nearly 100,000 trucks by putting trucks in ships, which also curbs emissions. The port's main challenge is to reduce CO2 emissions. We cannot do this alone, but must share the goal with companies, concessionaries, and the general public. Meanwhile, we plan to electrify all the port's wharves. We want to offer the most effective power-to-ship services by 2030, delivering clean energy while they are in the port. We want to be a zero-emissions port by 2030. We have started the process to create this new system and are working with the government to develop a special grid that will allow us to offer power once our model receives government approval. We expect to begin implementing the project by May 2020 and will launch subsequent phases in due course. Another area of considerable interest to us is LNG projects; we were the first port in the Mediterranean to develop bunkering in LNG. We have all the safety measures in place and have some cruises and ships using LNG. LNG is an interesting technology for shipping lines, though we know that it is not a final solution due to its emissions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[big-plans-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you present an introduction of Valenciaport and its main services?<br></strong>Right now, container traffic represents 76% of the total cargo we move. We are the top port in Spain in the Mediterranean and the fifth in Europe. It is a port mostly for cargo and freight. We specialize in moving freight to the Middle East, China, and the US, and we handle 37% of all the imports and exports for Spain. We control three ports: one in Valencia, another in Sagunto, and a third in Gandia. Thus far, in 2019 we are growing at a rate of 12%, which we had not forecasted. This growth has made us realize we have to accelerate our expansion in the north. The north expansion, as we call it, is a EUR1.2-billion project; nearly a third of this is financed by the port, while the remainder is through private investments. We expect to move 5 million containers more, and as a result, we would be able to move up to 12-13 million containers. This is an ambitious but necessary project. This will be a semi-automatized infrastructure, and I imagine the rest of the terminals in the port will take the same path. The future of the port is heading toward semi-automation, which will boost our productivity levels.</p><p><strong>What has allowed Valenciaport to hold this position in the market?<br></strong>We have been extremely entrepreneurial and have a great geographical location. Valencia is well located because it is the closest port to Madrid; we move 60% of Madrid's imports. However, additionally, there is a great deal of cargo traffic between China and the north of Europe, and vessels make several stops during their long trips. The advantage Valencia has is that it is the largest and closest port to the flow of traffic between Suez and Gibraltar. We have the best location, and, moreover, we generate cargo or the vessels, because we represent near 39% of all the exports and imports from Spain.<br>Who are your main competitors in the Mediterranean?<br>In transshipment, the port that is growing the fastest is Piraeus, though Greece does not generate much import and export cargo because its volume of traffic is smaller. Marseille, another well-known port, is far away. Our main competitors are Barcelona, Tangier, and Algeciras.</p><p><strong>What measures are included in the strategic plan for 2020?<br></strong>We have to think what ports will be like in the next 20 years. It is extremely difficult to do that, because it is difficult to know what will happen in the future. However, these investments are extremely expensive, and we need to plan ahead, which is a huge challenge. We are in a globalized world, and we analyze developments in the market and in other ports.</p><p><strong>What transformations do you seek to achieve by investing in R&amp;D?<br></strong>The cost of not being up to date in terms of innovation is so high that it can mean one can lose competitiveness. We have an innovation plan with several programs for the coming years. Some years ago, there were no Spanish ports among the most innovative, and we took certain steps to improve in this area. We have many areas in which we can become more innovative, like in waste management, CO2 reduction, or our production processes. Our efforts are focused on paying attention on the developments in other ports and how we can bring them here. This is a business line that can help us obtain more competitiveness.</p><p><strong>What are your goals in the short term?<br></strong>I would like to award a contract to a private company to do the north expansion. Then, I would like to have all the railway projects launched and, more specifically, get the wind power plan authorized. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main achievements of your mandate in 2019?<br></strong>With regard to management, I have prioritized its rationalization and a reorientation of resources where they are most needed. We have made progress in this direction by promoting measures, investments, and projects aimed to improve quality of life. Among the main achievements, I would highlight the package of housing measures included in the Royal Decree Law on urgent measures regarding housing matters and rents. Some of the measures limit the rise in the rental price, the extension of three to five years of the mandatory extension of these contracts, measures aimed at improving information and market transparency, and specific procedures to deal with situations in which eviction affects vulnerable people or homes. In our commitment to mobility as a right, we have ensured the necessary investments for maintaining the system with high quality standards and guaranteeing user reliability, frequency, and punctuality. We have formalized the OSP contract with Renfe to guarantee an integrated, intermodal rail service offering until December 2027. Its approval has allowed us to address an ambitious EUR3-billion plan for the acquisition and renewal of rolling stock. We have also solved the problem of the motorways whose concession period ends in this legislature. In the international arena, we succeeded in getting the EU to approve the reform of the Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors. This means that important investments in Spanish infrastructure will be able to access European funds.</p><p><strong>The Mediterranean Corridor is under development as a future freight corridor. How was the final proposal reached?<br></strong>The investments in railways in general and the Mediterranean Corridor in particular fulfill an important social function of structuring the territory and must be considered state policy. This project will contribute to strengthening the Spanish economy in sectors including tourism, industry, agriculture, and logistics, among others. For this reason, we are concentrating efforts on offering a competitive service of passenger and freight transport by rail, focused on the needs and demands of customers, in terms of mobility and logistics. The territories through which the corridor passes must take advantage of the opportunity. We must not see infrastructures as an end in themselves, but as a tool to guarantee a service, improve quality of life, connect territories, create business opportunities, and boost economic growth.</p><p><strong>The toll motorways and the radials stopped being profitable at the hands of private companies. How does the government intend to make them profitable again?</strong><br>We have solved this situation by resolving the respective contracts and modifying the Highway Law to allow the State Company State Transport Infrastructure Company (Seitt) to collect tolls and manage these highways. From this point, we have encouraged the use of these roads. An increase in traffic will increase revenues, improve mobility and road safety, and make better use of infrastructure. For this, we have approved a generalized reduction of around 30%. We have already received the first satisfactory results with a 12% increase in average traffic since January.</p><p><strong>What are the ministry's priorities for the coming months and the purposes for a new mandate?<br></strong>For the ministry, one of the main priorities is to guarantee the right to housing, promoting the use of social rental housing, mobilizing public land that is available through the transfer of surface rights, and favoring the use of public-private mechanisms. Another fundamental priority is to carry out a new concept of mobility and inclusive transport, oriented to the user, and offering adapted mobility solutions for all, including integrated transport, where all the means are synchronized and sustainable in economic, environmental, and social terms. We must adopt a more advanced vision in the infrastructure policy, thinking more about the mobility it offers to the citizen, than in the construction of new infrastructures.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an introduction into how Diplocat started and its evolution?</h4><p>Diplocat is a public-private consortium that was started in 1982 under the name Patronat Catalí  Pro Europa to bring Catalan citizens closer to Europe before Spain entered the EU. In 2012, it became Diplocat, the Public Diplomacy Council of Catalonia. After the intervention of the Spanish government in Catalonia in 2017, we were forced to stop the activities for a year, though the consortium never disappeared. That is why it was not so difficult to start again with our 38 members. There are many institutions of Catalonia that belong to Diplocat and give it a diverse and cross-cutting structure: the main public institutions; 12 public and private universities of Catalonia; 13 chambers of commerce; entrepreneurial organizations such as AMEC, FemCat, PIMEC and Foment; the two main trade unions; social and sports organizations such as Football Club Barcelona, and others.</p><h4>Can you tell us about how you promote abroad?</h4><p>We practice public diplomacy but we are not “classic“ diplomats nor a delegation of the government of Catalonia. We are a team of 12 people working in Barcelona, and from Barcelona we connect to the world. The three pillars on which we base our activities are connect, project, and empower. Firstly, we connect Catalonia with the international arena through classic tools of public diplomacy such as inviting international visitors, being in touch with the media, organizing seminars and exchanging best practices. Secondly, we project the image of Catalonia while promoting the transit of people, projects, and ideas. We are working in the field of digital diplomacy and we organize debates and seminars. In October, for example, we had a debate on sustainable food systems where we covered some of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. The third pillar is empowering. We have a master's program in foreign action and diplomacy for civil servants and we organize specific courses in terms of digital diplomacy and science and technology diplomacy. We also have a scholarship program that awarded eleven scholarships to conduct international studies abroad in its 36 edition.</p><h4>Are there any areas or specific regions that you would like to have more response or activity from?</h4><p>We aim to reach the global world, but our main area of influence and natural environment is Europe and the Mediterranean area. An activity we carried out recently was an international documentary market of the Mediterranean called Medimed. It was the 20th anniversary of Medimed and the first year that we co-organized it. Such activities are a form of cultural diplomacy, which is a great field to exchange projects and ideas. It also helps people to do business. Everyone was pleased with Diplocat and the chance to come together.</p><h4>How are you working to raise greater awareness of the benefits of Barcelona for foreign investment?</h4><p>Getting Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia known to the world, with its many values and assets, is our way to help attracting not only more foreign investment, but also more Erasmus students, tourists or top researchers. Of course we are not alone in this mission. We work closely with ACCIÓ in the business field, with Institute Ramon Llull when we do cultural diplomacy and with The Catalan Tourism Board in matters of tourism. That's what we also do when we organize any kind of activity: we look for partners so we can provide them with the tools of public diplomacy and our expertise in terms of international contacts and they provide us the expertise of their specific field.  And of course our partners are very often the members of Diplocat.</p><h4>How did you go about doing the promotion of the Catalan Day of Books and Roses, Sant Jordi?</h4><p>The day of Sant Jordi, on April 23rd, is a great opportunity to show Catalonia's best side to the world. The Day of Books and Roses is a tradition that we are extremely proud of and therefore we like to show it to the world. We have a few activities around the day of Sant Jordi.  The first one is an international visitors program. In 2019 we invited 10 journalists, mainly from the cultural pages, to experience the day live in Barcelona.  We also manage the website booksandroses.com to gather all the activities organized in cities around the world celebrating Sant Jordi. A citizen of Hong Kong, for example, who wants to celebrate the Day of Books and Roses can exchange culture and love by checking where this is possible via the website.</p><h4>What are the top assets and values of Catalonia that Diplocat looks to represent?</h4><p>In terms of activities, for example, we highlight the Sant Jordi festivity and the castellers, or human towers. We also promoted a documentary about Johan Cruyff as a player and member of FC Barcelona. Although he was Dutch, his idea that if you work hard you will achieve your goals connects very well with the Catalan society. We organized a few seminars on immigration and refugees to show to the world that we are an open city and open country.</p><h4>What do you do to promote tourism in Catalonia?</h4><p>Tourists flood to Barcelona and Catalonia, so little promotion needs to be done and the Catalan Tourism Board does a wonderful job in this sense. But we do try to go beyond Barcelona when we organize our programs. That is why in the last few months we brought activities and people to Sitges, Manresa and Arenys de Mar, to name three cities. On other occasions, we went to Girona. We want to show the country as a whole, and this is important because more than 30% of our board comprises Catalan municipalities. For instance, the Barcelona City Council is a member of Diplocat but so are Girona, Tarragona, Lleida and Vielha.</p><h4>What is the biggest challenge that you are facing today?</h4><p>For Diplocat, the challenge will always be to build the best bridges between Catalonia and the rest of the world.  We are not diplomats; we do public diplomacy and everyone can do it. Sub-state entities are very active in the international arena, but so are enterprises, NGOs or big football clubs.  Barcelona is very well known worldwide and the political situation has brought Catalonia to the media front pages, Diplocat's task is to create relationships of trust between the citizens of Catalonia and the rest of the world.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2020?</h4><p>We will carry on connecting, projecting and empowering. At the end of the day, we are just a small part of all the actors involved in a global change, so we want to contribute to it and make the world a more peaceful and sustainable place to live. All the activities that we organize have this global purpose.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dubai led by example on the global stage in terms of logistics?</h4><p>Dubai has led by example with regards to logistics on the global stage due to several factors. The most prominent include the Emirate's strategic location and the contributions of DP World and Emirates Airlines — both key market players based in Dubai that connect Asia and Europe through a broad scope of operations. As the logistics sector has developed and expanded in the last two decades, DP World and Emirates Airlines have used more routes over longer distances and invested heavily in technology and human capital; contributing significantly to the competitive and sustainable logistics sector we now have. As the market has transformed, shipment sizes have decreased while shipments themselves have become more frequent; emphasizing the flexibility of the logistics sector to promptly respond to changing markets demands while continuing to deliver world-class services. Furthermore, Dubai has established itself as a world leader in logistics through the continuous successful construction of world-class infrastructure such as seaports and airports. Looking ahead to the future, the main challenge for the logistics sector will inevitably be soft infrastructure and we are already seeing significant changes in terms of laws and regulations throughout the UAE. Dubai will, however, still present many opportunities for employees, organizations and investors alike; with several exciting new initiatives and expanding trade and diplomatic relations with Africa set to contribute greatly to regional growth. The scope of markets that Dubai serves as a hub continues to expand, particularly in terms of connectivity, and the Emirate is aiming to secure more opportunities as part of the Silk Road, in line with the determination to achieve growth instilled in our society through the vision of the wise leadership. Additionally, the adoption of e-commerce and our partnership with Amazon will present even more opportunities within the logistics sector.</p><h4>How is Dubai South's Logistics District pioneering technologies and digitalization?</h4><p>Digitalization is among our top priorities as the Emirate transitions to paperless operations as part of the Dubai Paperless Strategy, in line with the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to transform Dubai into a fully-fledged smart city.  We are upgrading our entire IT system with our own ERP software so Dubai South has integrated applications to manage the business and automate all functions related to technology, services and human resources; and we are coordinating with our partners to share data and streamline processes when we complete the transition.</p><h4>How is e-commerce changing demand and shifting strategic priorities for Logistics District?</h4><p>e-Commerce is changing demand and shifting strategic priorities for Dubai South's Logistics District through EZ Dubai — a unique project launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed that has facilitated a whole zone dedicated to electronic commercial transactions on the internet. We have created a positive environment through this platform where less well-known entities and entrepreneurs have access to e-markets such as Amazon. e-Commerce also comprises many multi-channel retail organizations, a prominent example being Marks and Spencer, who still do retail but also have online operations; and includes several elements ranging from large fulfilment centers to last-mile deliveries. Consumers no longer have to go to a mall to pick things up because the industry has become digital and, although 30%of goods are returned on average, the advantage and demand of faster inventories have shifted our strategic priorities.</p><h4>What developments are happening within transport in Dubai South and how is Logistics District capitalizing on those advancements?</h4><p>We recently launched a program dedicated to technology and sustainability within logistics and supply chains, in partnership with the University of South Wales. This also promises to be an important initiative as mobility and sustainability are two key themes of the upcoming Expo 2020. Logistics contributes 14% of global CO2 emissions and we need to explore different avenues that will allow us to address the challenges we are facing. We have begun implementing several initiatives in relation to sustainability and there are many more still to come in the years ahead. We are in the process of automating all our processes, despite its many challenges, and we have hired a company to take all our plastic bottles and make them in threads that can then be made into t-shirts for export. Our clients are also adopting similar trends to achieve sustainability and Aramex has launched 10 electric vehicles that are charged directly from solar panels and capable of making 200km delivery runs after a one-hour charge. These vehicles do not require fuel and Aramex aims to have sustainable transportation for all their delivery goods by 2021.</p><h4>How does Logistics District plan on leveraging the exposure expected from Expo 2020?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is part of the entire community and many activities associated with the event will contribute to the overall theme of Dubai South. The project was initially called Exhibition City, and this progressed into the bid for Expo when the government brought in Dubai World Trade Center. Winning the Expo bid changed the dynamic as road networks and transport linkages had to be reworked. Looking ahead, the potential extension of Dubai Metro to our office location could provide tangible benefits for us because of the exposure of Expo 2020.</p><h4>What is your vision and what are the strategic priorities for Logistics District moving forward?</h4><p>Our efforts will be aimed towards technology and sustainability moving forward. There will be much less demand for labor as the UAE moves closer to automation in terms of warehousing and robotics. China has already made the transition, with their operations expanding all around the world to countries such as Vietnam, Africa and Mexico. I recently met two professors from MIT and Harvard, and we discussed why Dubai has not become automated in terms of warehousing and robotics. The main challenges are labor being cheap most warehouses still being operated by third party logistics (3PLs) companies, which are not best able to invest in robotics. As a 3PL, flexibility is important due to the frequency of contract turnovers. That being said, cargo owners should be making investments moving forward and they can start by putting in place their own facilities, embedding innovative technologies and bringing in the 3PLs to manage the facilities. The reason they have not done this to date is because the warehouse is a minor item in their P&amp;L calculations, essentially meaning automation is not a priority. In the month and years ahead, technology, sustainability, and e-commerce will be integral as we make the transition.</p><h4>How is Business Park using the synergies of Dubai South and complementing the Logistics District?</h4><p>Comprising 11 buildings with a total of 2.3 million square feet of office space, the Business Park fully complements the entire 145-sqkm Dubai South project. The park is carefully designed to facilitate the growth of every business, from startups to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to multinational corporations (MNCs). With complete turnkey business services and cost-effective office solutions, the Business Park is aligned to suit global business needs. Dubai South itself is the emerging face of Dubai. Its main components are the airport and two free zones: one for aviation and aerospace and the Logistics District. The Mohammed bin Rashid (MBR) Aerospace Hub focuses on turning the region into a hub for general aviation, both fixed-base operations and maintenance and repair. The Logistics District, on the other hand, is meant to support Dubai's focus on trade and logistics and to develop a district that will link Jebel Ali Free Zone with the airport. There are many players from different scales here, from MNCs to SMEs and start-ups. Most of them do not need to operate from a warehouse in the Logistics District or in a facility in the MBR aerospace hub. All they need is an office space. This is where we factor in as the Business Park, giving these companies space from which to operate. In the aviation sector, we cater to private charter companies. There is a big market here for new and used parts traders, drone's technology, aviation management, air cargo, as well as aircraft sales and refurbishing. The entire MENA region is accessible from Dubai within six hours. Logistics works similarly to the aviation sector. Agents in shipping industries do not always need warehouses; they can work from their offices where everything is online. The Business Park bring together all these players in several industries to create large-scale business opportunities.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of investors in the Business Park?</h4><p>About 25% of investors in the Business Park come from outside of the region. As part of our commitment, we help them minimize the risks and promote sustainability in their respective business activities. We cater to a range of businesses across different industries, from marketing consultancy specializing in logistics to start-ups and MNCs involved in technological innovations.</p><h4>What features do you offer to facilitate activity and attract companies to Business Park?</h4><p>In terms of soft features, we have worked with the government to come up with four different products and solutions to optimize growth potentials. We also consult with business councils and country delegations to support companies from their own countries. We help them establish a company as well as network with the right people and institutions once they are here. We invite investors from different parts of the world to establish a networking office here at no cost. We want people from abroad to hear about the positive experiences of investors who have entered the local market. Another feature is the dual licensing service. Many companies have two registered offices in Dubai, one within a free zone and another is a mainland office outside the free zone for all their GCC operations and sales. At Dubai South, companies can keep their two registrations but under one location which is an integrated solution through dual licensing. This is significant because dual licensing has long been demanded by free zone companies and entrepreneurs who are interested in operating multiple enterprises across the wider UAE market. Dual licensing allows businesses to explore multiple avenues at the same time, thus enabling entrepreneurs to take advantage of various benefits offered by both free zones and mainland business models, as well as save on costs and efforts as a result of tapping on this solution. There are already about 10 companies that have utilized this advantage, and their savings were about AED1 million (USD272,260) and above annually. This advantage drastically reduces the cost of facilities rental, its utilities, visa administration and licensing. Organizations consider the budget and costs implications. For example, the attractive advantage of free zone employment visa on cost (less by 35%) and term (three years instead of two) is a great pull factor. We aim to attract more companies related to aviation and logistics and provide them with quality support. Being an entrepreneurial hub, 20% of our customers in Business Park offices are upgraded customers from our business centers. Their business is growing, and they have been moving with us to bring their companies to the next level. To date, we have achieved 88% customer retention. Our rent or fees for the past four years have also remained the same and our plan is not to increase anything. Together, we are meeting our targets, and we want to continue to grow with them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has Accenture company developed in Spain, and what are its main achievements?<br></strong>Accenture has been in Spain for over 50 years. Of the 100 largest companies in Spain, we work with more than 70. We have helped companies in all areas throughout the different stages through which Spain has passed, including the internationalization of Spanish companies. We have helped them overcome crises and work with them on cost and infrastructure restructuring, technology, and human resources management. Now, more than ever, we help them with the digital transformation they are going through. Accenture has also transformed, and we are now the undisputed leaders in the country in everything that has to do with the digital transformation of the business, infrastructure, and operations. Accenture Spain's business exceeds EUR1 billion, of which 60% is digital, security, and the cloud. These drivers push the transformation of companies.</p><p><strong>What role will technology play in the future of Accenture?<br></strong>Everything points to our goal of selling value to customers. In the past, we sold projects; we installed a system, trained employees, redefined processes, and made acquisition strategies. Now, we sell fewer projects but more value. Companies' incomes will grow, their profitability will improve, they will obtain better efficiency radios, and so on. However, to have this kind of growth, which is more difficult, they must look into those who install the technological system and those who provide training and a business plan to execute. There must be communication, creativity, and marketing skills for customers. We generate value for our clients, and a part of our income depends on its success. This cannot be achieved without communication, as we live in a world that has become multi-channel and is moving from traditional media to other media. This causes an extremely important convergence between technology and communication-advertising. There is a combination of advertising, creativity, and technology that we want to make. We want to bring all that content and creativity applied to 20-second ads and take it to the millions of interactions that any consumer has at any time with their brand.</p><p><strong>With what institutions of the public sector do you work?<br></strong>We work with the autonomous communities and ministries. Accenture is behind many things that are done in Spain, although its work may seem invisible. For example, we work on programs with AI to control social security fraud, and we detect when an employer is lying or defrauding social security. We also work with town halls like in Bilbao, where we replaced its technological platform, resulting in it collecting 30% more fines than before. Another area we work extensively is the justice system, which is slowly changing in this country. We have worked on this for many autonomous communities such as Canaria, Navarra, Asturias, and many other places where we digitalize processes so that judicial management is easier and accelerated.</p><p><strong>What are Accenture's goals for 2020?<br></strong>Our goal and motto is to help improve the world in which people live and work by serving companies. We do it through digital technologies, though we also have an important social vocation, especially in these moments when everything is changing due to digitalization. Not leaving anyone behind is also a goal for us, and this is achieved in the long term. We work hard to prevent vulnerable people from being excluded from the digital transformation process. We dedicate 80,000 hours of free work per year to ensure nobody is disconnected, and to this end, we have an initiative called Together for Employment that adapts people to the new requirements of the world. For example, we use augmented reality to teach people to be hotel or bar waiters, apps to learn how to respond to the public, and so on. Everything is radical, and everything is being redefined. Being able to define the game and its rules while also being a player is an interesting challenge for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Size matters]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[size-matters]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an introduction to the company?<br></strong>GFT is a German company that was founded 34 years ago and went public in 1999. In parallel, Deutsche Bank was developing an internal hub for international projects in Barcelona. GFT saw the potential to run projects in Spain through Germany, later running the same projects from Spain to save costs. In 2001, Deutsche Bank decided to move its subsidiary to the market, which is when GFT acquired the subsidiary and entered the financial services sector. We were 300 people, growing locally while also supporting the growth of our international business. We decided to focus on banking, which is our expertise, and thus certified many of our people and developed our knowledge of investment banking, growing from 300 to 1,000 people. From Spain, we began the process of internationalization to Brazil, the US, and Mexico as well as expanding our operations into the industrial sector. Today, the GFT team in Spain is made up of around 2,000 employees, working for local and global projects in 6 locations.</p><p><strong>What services make up the majority of your global operations?<br></strong>Our core business is developing projects, maintenance, and consultancy. We accompany our clients through the process of digitalization with tools including AI, blockchain, or cloud technology. In the finance sector specifically, our focus is on clients adopting open banking systems with our help. Some customers have asked for more end-to-end solutions, which sometimes require partnerships. We are partners with the three main cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services. Such partnerships are fundamental in our line of work as the majority of companies have such partnerships, creating a special relationship with the provider of a product or service. This helps to give a better portfolio to the customer. </p><p><strong>What differentiates the Spanish financial market?<br></strong>From 2008 onward, there were many mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector. That process has yet to end; when it finishes, we will probably have five or six big banks. This makes dynamic movements in technology with the banks competing hard for customers. Santander and BBVA are two large international banks. Sabadell is now in process of internationalization, now in the UK and with a subsidiary in Mexico. This means that the banks cannot be seen as just local. Given our international footprint, we support these banks globally. For instance, we work for BBVA and Santander in Spain and Mexico as well as for Santander in Brazil. Size matters, so you can be more efficient. You are also able to access certain markets that you could not enter if you were smaller.</p><p><strong>How should the traditional banking sector evolve to tackle the rise in new players such as fintech companies?<br></strong>Despite the rise of fintechs, banks still represent size as they are based on legacy systems. However, that is set to change in the future. In the past, one of the KPIs was the number of branches, which is no longer the case. Fintechs decide which part of the cake the banking industry takes. This is only a slice, but it is very promising. If you can go to customers without a number of branches, employees, and IT systems, then you can get the benefits without a huge cost. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are making a great deal of noise. The banking industry as we have known it will disappear, forcing banks to reinvent themselves for the future with technological changes happening, including open banking that works to personalize and adapt banking services to clients depending on their needs.</p><p><strong>Where do you want to go forward with your expansion?<br></strong>In our eyes, the two most promising sectors for future expansion are retail and automotive. We have a team working in Valencia for an industrial company in Germany that only builds robots. We also aim to help banks accompany their clients in their day-today journeys by facilitating all their concerns related to finance wherever or whenever it occurs.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is T-Systems Iberia's history in Spain?<br></strong>One of the company's significant achievement since its establishment has been a clear vision to be a strategic IT partner for its clients. As you can imagine, much has changed over the past 20 years, but we are always applying our mantra of simplifying, being innovative, and helping customers. The way customers interact with providers, and more recently partners, is all about how to apply technology to their business and how to understand our customers' customers. Since its beginning, the company has undergone a number of changes and acquisitions, starting with the acquisition of Debis' worldwide systems. Locally, we acquired the IT department of an important government entity, which put us in the public sector. More recently, we acquired an IT company from an automotive group. T-Systems has experienced multiple transitions and what we call digitalization is not new to us; it was simply called something else in the past.</p><p><strong>How does your work in the public sector differ from working with private clients?<br></strong>Previously, both sectors used to have certain needs but at present, all parties are focused on technology. A few years ago, we acquired a company called TAO, which is being integrated into our systems. While most of the people in Spain do not know about us, they interact with our products; we are present in most of the important cities across Spain. We have an enterprise resource planning (ERP) product in the public sector that deals with taxes, citizens, asset control, and accounting in local administrations. We saw the evolution of ERP products and have now created a platform and module that help cities and the public sector evolve. Gijón was one of the first smart city projects we had in Spain. The first wave began in 2017, and T-Systems is responsible for installing smart lighting, reducing air pollution, and collecting data. Within the public sector, the Catalonian government is another important client, and we are serving several of its departments. For example, we have already digitalized 75% of the justice department's legal documents. There is still a long way to go, but it is one example of something we have been transforming over the years.</p><p><strong>How much of your client base is in the automotive sector?<br></strong>Looking at the local industry in Spain and specifically its IT ranking, we are ranked fourth in the automotive and public sectors. Worldwide, 13 out of 20 automotive manufacturers are customers of our systems. All sectors are moving toward Industry 4.0. There are many transformations taking place, and what we see in terms of less power, high performance, is not only true for automotive but for every sector in which we operate, be it healthcare or finance. The automotive sector is increasingly adopting technologies such as IoT to automate their processes to be more competitive. Some companies are already testing technologies related to 5G. One key challenge moving forward is security; with thousands of devices connecting to the system on a daily basis, not much is being done to secure the data. </p><p><strong>What role do you believe regulation should play in cybersecurity?<br></strong>Public authorities must count on companies that are developing these kinds of solutions, since these companies understand how to detect, prevent, and counter all sorts of threats. There is a lack of regulation regarding cybersecurity currently, since it is so new. Technology is evolving exponentially, and new things are being learnt on a daily basis. Some companies are prepared to help customers, like Deutsche Telekom, but we do see and understand the level of worry. It is more and more on the agenda of the public authorities, with specific ministers talking about it. If there is more need for the private sector's involvement, we are ready to join in. We have already been in talks with the European community on how to regulate and operate cybersecurity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an introduction to the company?<br></strong>We are a young foundation that started in 2014 as a public-private partnership (PPP) led by GSMA. On our board we have the three public-sector entities: the Spanish government, the Catalan government, and Barcelona City Hall. We also work with Fira de Barcelona, the entity that manages events and conferences in the city. We have also opened the foundation to private companies, with large telco carriers such as Telefonica, Vodafone, and Orange, in addition to Damm and CaixaBank being on our board. We have two major objectives. The first is to contribute to make MWCapital Barcelona the most dynamic and impactful event regarding technology and transformation. The event generates synergies and opportunities that contribute directly to the digital hub in Barcelona, acting as a vehicle to generate the conditions that attract senior executives from large to the city. Our second goal is to leave a legacy of mobile technology in our society that improves people's lives. To this end, MWCapital focuses on four areas: the acceleration of innovation through digital entrepreneurship, the transformation of industries through digital technology, the rise of digital talent among new generations and professionals, and the reflection on the impact of technology in our society. Collectively, our programs are positively transforming the economy, education, and society.</p><p><strong>How do you work to foster technological talent in Barcelona?<br></strong>We built Barcelona Digital Talent, an alliance with public and private entities that coordinates initiatives under a common strategy and promotes new projects to foster talent. The program ensures the alignment between the needs of companies and digital talent initiatives, helps citizens to develop new digital skills, and positions Barcelona as a global digital talent capital in Europe. This also means helping people from abroad to find great job opportunities in the new digital space in Barcelona. It is urgent to upskill people from other industries that generates less employment than the digital economy. The first aim is to reduce the gap between the demand for talent and our offerings today in universities, vocational training, academies, and so on. It is important that the public sector plays a key role here. One of the things we need to solve is the express visa for digital talent through simplifying the process, thus lowering the cost of attracting international talent. </p><p><strong>How do you address the reluctance to change based on ethics and regulation concerns?<br></strong>The only way is to bring about scenarios and agreements that give everyone security through the good use of technology. Technology is agnostic, and it must be seen as an acceleration tool that generates opportunities. The challenge is that the speed, deployment, and use of technology, especially in terms of disruption, is always faster than we estimate. That is why we created Digital Future Society, a program promoted by the Ministry of Economy and Business and MWCapital that analyzes the impact of technology on society and the economy. </p><p><strong>What is your main objective for 2020?<br></strong>We want to take a step forward to build conditions to ensure MWCapital is impactful. But our main objective is always to drive the digital advancement of society while helping improve people's lives globally. We will continue focusing on the acceleration of innovation, the transformation of industries through digital technology, the rise of digital talent, and the reflection on the impact of technology in our society. In 2020, we also have an ambitious project: Digital Future Society is preparing a world summit on technological governance to be held in Barcelona. Its goal is to analyze the major challenges raised by technological transformation, to establish recommendations, and to seek public and private commitment to promote better governance of the digital future and thus build a more inclusive, fair, and sustainable society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the company evolved over the years in Spain, and what are its main products and activities?<br></strong>LG Electronics Iberia started in Valencia in 1996. We started humbly, with only 15 members, and progressed to the point where the average household in Spain has four LG products, and there are 15 million houses in the country. Our main businesses are consumer electronics, home appliances, telecoms, and B2B, which includes air conditioning, solar, and signage. We are either number one or two in the main categories. The only category in which we are not number one or two is mobile, though we are number five in this area. We are well consolidated and are perceived as the preferred brand in most the businesses we operate in. We are working to democratize innovation and technology by bringing state-of-the art technology to the point where almost 100% of the population can access it. Our B2C business is bigger than B2B; in Spain and Portugal, around 20% of our business is B2B. Our aim is to be at 50% by 2025. This area is growing by double digits every year, and we expect to maintain this growth until we reach 50-50.</p><p><strong>What is LG's most innovative product right now?<br></strong>One of the most innovative is our AI technology, as well as our ThinQ platform and Web Os smart TV line. We are the market leader in smart TVs in Spain and many other places, and the difference between our smart TV and others is the usage. 90% of the smart TVs we sell are in use, while our competitors average around 50%. Our technology is significantly better and safer than our competitors, our smart TV being the only one certified for cybersecurity. We are in the business of efficiency, which is why we are strong in B2B. We help companies become more efficient across the country. In the transition to digital business, we help many companies make their operations more efficient, and technology is essential for this. We are also one of the top five companies in the world in terms of green technology investment. In Spain, we entered the solar market early in 2019. We are also number one globally for battery production and self-driving technology, breaks, info-tainment systems, and so on. In the GM Bolt, LG makes 65% of the components. Our business model is to help existing brands and to partner in order to enter the new electronics era.</p><p><strong>Do you have a strategy to push forward your mobile products to become a leader in the product area?<br></strong>Our aim is to lead every category we operate in. In mobile, we are improving in the market. Our aim is to get closer to the top of Spain in the coming years. We are excited about 5G and believe this will provide a big push for our business. We also have other state-of-the-art technologies like Time of Flight (TOF), which allows people to interact with the phone without touching the screen.</p><p><strong>What measures will the company take to make itself more sustainable and build sustainable products?<br></strong>We have the LG Smart Green program in place for just this sort of thing. This program was developed in Spain, though it was already activated in the head company in Korea. LG is one of the top-five companies in the world in terms of green energy technology and sustainable investments. Our business is efficiency at all levels and in all things. We have applied many of these things to the market in Spain in order to create an additional story. One of the first decisions we made in Spain in 2018 was to challenge ourselves to reduce our CO2 emissions by 55,000 tons. The company as a whole reduced CO2 emissions by 30 million tons are just one facet of a global LG strategy. Our factories, products, packaging, and everything else are planned with the intent of becoming greener. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Huawei evolved since entering Spain in 2001, and what is the importance of this market for its global operations?<br></strong>Spain is one of the first countries where we started developing our foreign operations, back in 2001. At that time, we had only one country manager, one local sales person, and a secretary. It was challenging work in that the telecommunications industry is highly complex and the density of technical requirements is such that at the beginning we had to solve the issue of how we could gain the trust of operators in the industry. At first, it seemed that in order to get a meeting, we needed to spend three weeks explaining ourselves, knocking on the doors of mid- and low-tier managers and engineering chiefs; however, we quickly gained the trust of consumers thanks to our superior technology. Our success in Spain was partially possible due to how open the Spanish market is. Medium-sized telecoms operators like Jazztel started in 2004/2005, followed by the big operators like Vodafone and Telefónica. Throughout our time here, our innovative spirit and the quality of our products has consistently won the trust of the industry. This would not have been possible without the openness of the Spanish market and consumers. During this journey, we have treated Spain as a top priority and even built a joint innovation center with the top operators here, always introducing our latest technologies in this market first.</p><p><strong>What is the strategic plan in terms of expansion in Spain as Huawei looks to maintain this growth?<br></strong>Spain is the perfect place to introduce innovative digital technologies, such as AI, 5G, big data, and cloud services because of the strong long-term relationship we have with the telecoms operators such as Telefonica, Vodafone, and Orange. Thanks to the government, regulations, and ambition of the leading operators, the Spanish digital infrastructure is amongst the best in the world, especially in terms of the fiber backbone. This is highly important because it can provide opportunities to everyone, not only the rich and middle class, but also those in rural areas, to leverage broadband and gain more opportunities, such as those wrought from e-commerce, online education, and external communications. 5G is a key technology, and Spain was quick off the mark, with the government making the decision in 2018 to finalize the first step of the C-band spectrum auction. There are large accounts in Spain, but also a lot of medium-sized, global corporations that are agile, intelligent, and fast moving, and these companies are open to new digital technologies. During this digital transformation, we were able to not only collaborate and introduce our solutions to those companies, but also work to jointly promote our technology as part of a greater solution.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on the division of your consumer and corporate operations? Which takes priority in Spain?<br></strong>Globally, we have four business groups. One is the carrier network division, which serves the telecoms operators to provide digital infrastructure. The second is the consumer division of smart devices, watches, and wearables. The third is the enterprise division, which provides digital solutions and digital infrastructure to different verticals, such as public administration, transportation, energy, utilities, banking and financing, and manufacturing. The last division is the cloud, through which we provide public and private cloud solutions. We operate that cloud business independently in China and via collaboration with Deutsche Telekom and Orange in Europe. In Spain, we operate all these business units, and they are all priorities in their own right. Our consumer business accounts for almost 50% of our total revenues, but our enterprise and cloud businesses are growing quickly. After so many years of silence and since access to financing has increased, Spain's green energy sector is now exploding. Many Spanish EPC companies are working with Huawei to expand their business into Latin America, especially Brazil, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2019 was the company's 55th anniversary. By way of an introduction, can you tell us about the origin and evolution of the company?</strong><br>Belonging to the Burdeos family, the company has over 50 years of experience in the chemicals sector. In 1978, my father and current president Miguel Burdeos took control of the company, seeing a market opportunity in drugstores that sold bulk products. With new consumer-safety legislation introduced, he began selling bottled products to drugstores. First, the company sold products destined for home improvement, such as solvents. Observing the market's evolution, he increasingly focused on cleaning products and less on home improvement. An important milestone was when he saw fragranced ammonia products being sold in France. He went on to create a similar product for Spain, distributed by Pryca (now Carrefour), el Corte Inglés, and Mercadona back in 1999. The company went from being an SME to employing over 500 people, operating three manufacturing plants, a research and development center in Cheste, and another manufacturing plant in Sevilla. At the time, we generated around EUR30 million in volume, which today is approximately EUR130 million. When we decided to join the Mercadona strategy, it had just 300 stores and was not the market leader. Yet we supported its innovative strategy in retail distribution.</p><p><strong>In terms of innovation, you have invested over EUR40 million in new products. Are there any new products to highlight from the Bosque Verde or Deli Plus brands?</strong><br>We have four product categories: laundry, dishwashing, household, and personal care. In laundry, we have formulas specifically developed for sports apparel, and we are currently developing an innovative detergent capable of modifying fabric properties to protect them against stains. In terms of personal care, we are launching a textured soap for children to make washing hands a fun experience. We developed cleaning products with a dispenser that can help save on product and plastic.  We have dish and laundry capsules suitable for all automatic dishwashing and washing machines. We were the first own-label manufacturers to launch the triple chamber capsule in retail distribution.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us what you are doing in terms of sustainability?</strong><br>As it is one of our core values, we are working on environmental, social, and economic sustainability. In terms of environmental sustainability, we are not only concerned about our products but the processes too. We aim to consume less water and electricity and have more efficient processes by investing in machinery. For our products, we are optimizing plastic use, which we aim to reduce in 2020, and use recycled plastic in our blowing process. Our team uses eco-design guides to develop product packaging that improves the product's life cycle. We have joined the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, an agreement led by the Ellen McArthur Foundation in the UK. The most disruptive innovations in the market will focus on improvements in packaging rather than the product formula. For example, an initiative called Loop involves refill packages, which the consumer returns to the company for a refill. However, the Spanish consumer does not have the same environmental sensitivity as in other countries. Change will depend on three key players: the producers of raw materials, who must be prepared to offer the industry eco-friendly alternatives, producers of the final product, and the consumer.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about some of your programs promoting CSR?</strong><br>Taking care of our people is a core company value. We have a program called Wellness Formula created by our team to boost wellness through sports, nutrition, and volunteering. For example, they organize activities to clean forests and plant trees. Another project, called People Who Shine, has over 30 participating companies. It features an app where you add kilometers by doing sports, meditating, and sustainable development goal (SDG)-related activities. Those kilometers translate into money that is donated to charitable causes. It also creates healthy competition within the team. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Considering the sector, GTD is an established company. How has it evolved since it started?<br></strong>My business partner and I set up this company together with others who have since retired. The takeoff was fast; we did not have to seek financing or capital increase, nor did we have to let in partners. From the beginning, we were hired for projects in the robotics industry—it was our specialty at that time and still is, though now we are also in other sectors—and the automobile sector. We quickly started working in other sectors, and two years after our foundation, we started our first contracts with the European Space Agency. Although the core of the engineering work has not changed, it has changed in terms of quality control, work regulations, and project organization. The space world is much more demanding than the automotive world. In 2004, we separated from the automotive sector, as we could not continue working with a sector as demanding as the automotive industry at the same time as the space sector. Since 2004, we have five sectors with which we develop our engineering: aeronautical; logistics and transports; science, infrastructure, and robotics; and defense and security. More than 80% of our billing is with customers outside Spain. We have offices in France, Germany, the UK, and Morocco as well as partners in Latin America where we do projects. Currently, the balance is between services and projects, which took us a long time to achieve. Our services are selling standard software, licenses, user licenses, and adaptations of previous software.</p><p><strong>Since the company's beginning, so much technology has been developed, and the use of big data has exploded. What change has been the most significant in this industry?</strong><br>The most significant change is the way we buy information that is generated from space to determine the exact position of all aircraft on the planet. A Canadian initiative, alongside the US, took advantage of a constellation of 66 satellites by putting a small radar on board every spacecraft. Depending on the meteorological data and the position of the plane, we can recalculate the flight plan to save fuel and arrive on time. There are many things to do with the data that space provides us. There are many more military applications but the applications of space to the civil field are fundamental. The new space will allow the launch of small satellites with a shorter life cycle but at a lower cost. Logistics will change thanks to space, although we still lack satellites. The problem is how to put these small satellites into orbit at a decent price.</p><p><strong>What are some of your most innovative projects in the space sector?<br></strong>Currently, we have a positive evolution. For us, space is mostly space transportation. Since 1990, we have worked on the European Space Agency's launchers program, and we are now with Ariane 6, a spectacular new rocket that will be launched for the first time in 2020. We are already working with Ariane Next Gen (the new generation after Ariane 6). There will be two pitchers of this project: one is large and one is smaller, and both will be recoverable. We have to make everything recoverable because it is profitable.</p><p><strong>What developments do you want to see in 2020?<br></strong>Our aeronautical business is the one growing the most at the moment. Every year, we double its size. The market is aimed at airlines, air traffic controllers, airports, and airport management. The aeronautical sector is complex and very 'tech demanding.' It costs billions of dollars, and airlines have to deal with many parameters to be profitable. We provide solutions that can help them save up to 3% per year, and that is a big deal. There is much work to do, especially because the sector is growing exponentially and presents many opportunities for attentive engineers like us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The automobile sector is in a transition process due to the increase in demand for electric cars. What strategy is ANFAC following to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible?</strong></p><p>The automotive industry is committed to the decarbonization objectives of the EU, which is why we are continuously working to ensure that the transition to zero emission vehicles is as orderly and efficient as possible. It is essential that the consumer understands that the purchase of a new vehicle is a safe bet for the future. We need to establish a framework that gives them confidence in their purchase. We need these messages of confidence to come through a government plan to encourage the renewal of the car fleet. We also need the standardization of transportation policies throughout the country. It is also a priority to carry out industrial reforms that promote the competitiveness of factories in Spain.</p><p><strong>The change of regulation at the national and European level is affecting the sector. ANFAC recently petitioned the government to reduce VAT on electric cars. What is ANFAC's relationship with the government, and what other measures should be taken to improve the efficiency of the sector in the medium to long term?</strong><br>ANFAC is committed to the development of the automotive industry in Spain. We have worked and will continue to work alongside the government to achieve an orderly transition to the transportation modes of the future. We have an easy relationship with all the ministries. The Ministry of Industry and its minister, Reyes Maroto, have been a high-level partner with whom we hope to progress further. Stability in the administration is fundamental for investment security. The help of the administration is essential in terms of incorporating new technologies and supporting R&amp;D in production processes. We need to focus on both Spanish factories that are strong and segments where investment should increase. Any innovation that can be developed in the automobile sector can be applied to other sectors and small businesses. Furthermore, it is necessary for concrete measures to be carried out by the administration. Those measures include subsidies and reduced taxes for alternative vehicles, as well as a unified tax scheme for all autonomous communities that take into account environmental criteria and decarbonization goals. These reforms will promote the renewal of the vehicle fleet. It is also important to design a national strategy for the implementation and development of recharging infrastructure. These infrastructures can be slow, for public parking, or fast, for example, on intercity roads.</p><p><strong>One of the main challenges today is the fall in production. Spanish factories registered a 5.5% drop in production between January and April 2019. What factors contributed to this fall?</strong><br>There is uncertainty, not only in Spain but also throughout Europe, regarding the future of the automotive industry. It is undergoing change because of the international trade environment, where protectionism is on the rise. Protectionism is happening alongside particular economic crises, as what happened in Turkey in 2018. Spain is seeing a cut in its production, though it is not alone. Markets in Europe are reducing their production and their orders in recent months, which is the cause for a reduction in orders sent to Spanish factories.</p><p><strong>What are the main objectives and priorities of ANFAC for 2020?<br></strong>It is necessary to define a common roadmap for decarbonization. We need a strategy with real solutions, including plans to help alternative vehicles, taxation with environmental criteria, and reduced taxes for alternative vehicles. We must follow the examples of other EU countries passing legislation across their entire territory that adopt important accompanying measures for the development of their automotive sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the advantages for Epiroc being an independent spin off?<br></strong>Epiroc understands this segment better than the traditional industrial segments. The mining and construction industry is fairly unique. With mining, the planning process lasts between five and 15 years before any substantial development takes place. A mining project requires a long-term perspective and investment, whereas construction is the exact opposite. Before every election, politicians need pictures of tunnels, roads, and highways, meaning construction cycles are between three and five years. For a company like Epiroc to live and make a living in such an unstable environment is not a problem, but it can be different for the industrial segment, so it made sense to have a spin off.</p><p><strong>How is energy efficiency and automation at the center of your innovation strategy?<br></strong>Our timing for the new Spanish mining industry was perfect, as we had already moved from the old technologies to the new ones with the Spanish construction boom. In Spain, we went into a rush to do tunneling faster than ever, so the jump in technology was truly unique. When the country became interested in mining and decided to open the Magdalena and Matsa mines, choosing the method was critical as they wanted to do nearly everything underground. This requires companies to venture into new technology. They were able to start from scratch with new equipment, and notably, to date, the Magdalena mine is one of the main examples in Europe of mines with fully automated machines operating from the surface.</p><p><strong>What is the future of the public work sector in Spain?<br></strong>Spain has a fully developed infrastructure now, and in my opinion we have far too big a network for our needs. There are airports and highways in the middle of nowhere, and moving forward maintenance will be the key issue as opposed to the construction of new projects. Spain still needs to finish the connection to the Basque country, which is critical, though high-speed connection to every big city in Spain is needed. The need of the hour is to improve the existing network in an economical way.</p><p><strong>What is the commitment of Epiroc to the advancement of engineering and mining infrastructure?<br></strong>For many years, we have tried to promote the image of mining, as we firmly believe in an environmentally friendly business model, even for this industry, which also allows the development and growth of our society. This is one of our main challenges. We have been trying to work in the different sectors in terms of promoting the mining industry. Sweden helps us in that case because it is seen as a leading country in terms of environmental issues, and yet it has a strong mining industry. We work extensively with the Swedish Embassy and Swedish companies to develop the interest of students in the mining industry because that is vital for the future of mining. At present, we train engineers but we need to take the next step and start training operators because there is a shortage of skilled operators.</p><p><strong>What are Epiroc Spain's objectives for the coming year?<br></strong>Our primary objective is to keep moving into the automation and future concept of mining, including the use of battery-powered equipment by our current customers. We have customers that are really committed to it, and that requires an increase of base knowledge. The other sectors regaining prominence in Spain are the quarry and cement industries, and we need to develop those channels. Around 80% of Spain has the potential for mining or resource extraction, so the aim is to continue promoting a positive image of mining and gain support from the public and the politicians. The export potential of Spain's mining sector is huge and on top of that, not many countries in Europe have a quality infrastructure like Spain. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How would you evaluate 2019, and what have been the ministry's main achievements in 2019?<br></strong>The balance is fairly positive, as President Pedro Sanchez has put industry at the forefront. My job has been to put the industry on the public agenda in order to talk about industry and the challenges it is facing in this country. My job is to activate the industrial agenda in this country in order to overcome challenges such as Industry 4.0 and digitalization, which includes the development of blockchain and AI. In commerce, we have launched two important projects. One has to do with the approach of intrusion in trade. There is a great deal of illegal trade on the internet, and it now represents a 9% loss in turnover in the Spanish commercial sector. This has been, and still is, a priority for the Spanish office of trademarks and patents. We have transposed the trademark law and created a discussion where different public administrations participate with the private sector. The second is Commerce 4.0, which represents a huge opportunity to modernize trade. It is important not to see digitalization as a threat. We created Commerce 4.0 to start working on a private-public forum. This government has built bridges to talk to companies and sectors because to us it is the most efficient way to work. Another priority is the ecological transition in the fight against climate change, which this government has also put on its agenda. The results from the macro point of view, such as the creation of employment, GDP growth, and the competitiveness indicator, all show we have maintained our commitment.</p><p><strong>Spain has advanced with the implementation of Industry 4.0 in many sectors, though SMEs still lag behind. What steps is the ministry taking to support SMEs in this regard?</strong><br>Currently, 98% of our companies are SMEs; in fact, 54% of those are micro SMEs, with fewer than 10 employees. We needed to bring our programs closer to them so that the SMEs can benefit, and there are two important elements to consider here. One that we have effectively configured is the SME policy for 2030, which gives us some guidelines of what each of us should do. In terms of the strategy, we have already defined where we have to act. These actions are related not only to innovation and internationalization, but also to sustainability as a way to improve the production models of SMEs and elements that have to do with delinquency. Regarding Industry 4.0, we are also bringing programs closer to SMEs through the network of chambers of commerce. In terms of digitalization, we are working with Red.es, the Center for the Development of Industrial Technology, and the education sector, both on a university and professional level. We are working with professional training centers to acquire digital talent and boost the skills of our workers. At this moment, increasing human capital is a priority for the government.</p><p><strong>What is the ministry's opinion on the fall in production in the automotive sector, and what are you doing to ensure growth moving forward?</strong><br>The fall in production is due to many factors. The markets to which we export have slowed, and Brexit has generated a great deal of uncertainty in a sector where value chains are global. We have an electric car project starting in Spain and Europe, but with small penetration. We must explain the value of the industry in Spain, because eight out of 10 cars produced here are sold outside. The decisions that are made in the markets where we export affect us in our production. We have defined a model according to the European one, which has been a model of success. We are currently the leaders in global production, though if we want to retain it, we have to make a transition that we have not made yet similarly to countries such as China, Korea, or Japan. The decisions we make are long-term investment decisions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the process of creating an interbank ATM provider, which culminated in the establishment of Banred?</h4><p>Banred is the result of an interbank agreement between 12 banks. It was founded in 1994, when three ATM networks decided to merge. From that moment, it was preferable to provide support to financial institutions rather than duplicating investments and competing for services that could be shared. Banred was born with 255 ATMs and 12 banks. At present, 100 financial institutions are part of our network, representing 6,000 ATMs. Since we started operations 25 years ago, our installed capacity, number of customers, and range of services have grown continuously. The development of Banred's activities mainly occurs with agreements with other shareholder institutions that define Banred's guidelines regarding service provision. The range of services we provide include ATM network services, online wire transfers in real time, and transaction processing for non-banking correspondents. We pay the human development bonus, which is a social program promoted by the government. We also have a payment system for the public sector. Banred provides its services within a scheme of electronic payment system based on the electronic processing of financial transactions.</p><h4>Developed by Banred, BIMO is seeking to make Ecuador a cashless society. How has this progressed so far?</h4><p>The latest service Banred has implemented is BIMO, a mobile wallet for people who have a bank account. This app allows users to make use of their money from their bank account, while in addition to this, BIMO serves to promote bank usage and financial inclusion. A person who does not have a bank account or is not a member of a cooperative can use BIMO to open a basic account in a few minutes without submitting any documentation. This is a first step toward achieving financial inclusion. As a micro-transaction-oriented electronic payment method that was created to replace cash, the maximum amount you can pay with BIMO is USD50. The monthly limit is set at USD300 and the daily limit at USD100. These are initial referential limits that will remain until we stabilize the platform and measure the risks and demand. In the future, all limits will be adjusted. BIMO is a fintech project. In the future, every single financial institution, from large banks to the smallest cooperative, will use BIMO. This is one of the advantages of the interbank agreement, in which we agreed to develop a payment method that will be shared by everyone on equal terms. This is the first time an app of this kind is being developed and shared by the entire financial system.</p><h4>Financial inclusion is becoming a key topic in Ecuador's development agenda. What other services are you planning to implement in 2020? </h4><p>In terms of financial inclusion, and as part of our future vision, we have proposed to the banks the interconnection of the non-bank correspondents' network. Each bank has its own network. Pichincha Bank has Mi Vecino (My Neighbor), Guayaquil Bank has Banco del Barrio (Neighborhood Bank), and Produbanco has Pago Ágil (Rapid Payment). Banred aims to integrate all these networks into one so that customers of these institutions can share their networks. By doing this, the 25,000 non-bank correspondents that make up the network will greatly raise the financial system's coverage and capacity to make services available to the population. Moreover, they will also greatly support financial inclusion because these correspondents are usually located where banking institutions are not, that is, in rural and deprived inner-city areas. The integration of a non-bank correspondence network is important, especially in terms of financial inclusion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the extent of your regulatory role in the banking sector?</h4><p>Until 2012, the Superintendency of Banks was responsible for overseeing the banking institutions (including public and private institutions), as well as the sector of 40 cooperatives of savings and insurance firms. We also oversaw investment banks, currency exchange bureaus, and other entities within the financial system. That year, a law removed the cooperatives from the oversight of the Superintendency, and another law in 2014 placed insurance and reinsurance firms under the control of another entity. Today, we control over 200 institutions, including 17 that are undergoing liquidation. We also have a banking board that regulates monetary policy.</p><h4>Ecuador is progressively becoming a more internationally open economy. What role does the Superintendency play regarding these changes and the readiness of its banking system?</h4><p>Much has to do with the scope of regulation. We have developed plans to detail potential improvements to the regulatory model. Many countries are moving toward the adoption of the Basel III standard. The problem with the Ecuadorian system is that we have fulfilled Basel I, but still have many steps remaining to apply Basel II, which results in improved levels of competitiveness for the financial markets. We must adopt regulations that have allowed the innovation somewhere else across the financial markets. The Superintendency is currently applying new operational plans to increase our efficiency and capacity to oversee the sector and increase financial inclusion. We also want to increase legal security in the market to make Ecuador more appealing to the international investor.</p><h4>What relation do you have with other regulators abroad?</h4><p>Back in 2008 and 2009, the Superintendency worked to strengthen the instruments and tools used to oversee the market in collaboration with certain transparency regulations. I mention this because we established certain MoUs with regulatory bodies from other countries in the region. The economy of Ecuador has not been in its best shape, having seen smaller budgets as a result. The current administration is revisiting certain critical elements that improve the oversight capacity.</p><h4>Financial inclusion is squarely on the public agenda as a key tool for national development. How does the institution work in this regard?</h4><p>I have been working toward and talking about financial inclusion for years, and we have made certain projections in support of it. If we compare ourselves to countries like Chile that have social similarities, we observe they enjoy greater financial inclusion. Ecuador in recent years has been doing a great job in financial inclusion by expanding the reach of micro financial services, but the pace has decelerated. We also have a problem in terms of connectivity. Compared to countries like Colombia, Ecuador has not been able to develop a better telecommunications infrastructure conducive to advancing financial inclusion. As a result, there are areas within Ecuador that lack a network system. If a citizen cannot make a basic phone call, it is hard to imagine them using the online banking system. Additionally, we need a law on data protection to foster user confidence in these systems. As long as the public policy is for tax collection only, it will be difficult to attract other telecoms to invest in a better network. One thing being discussed was the potential reduction of sales tax for online payments. Although this is a good idea, such incentives should be temporary.</p><h4>Do you have any shorter-term priorities?</h4><p>We are working to re-establish our autonomy in budget definition and the scope of our policies. We currently have a lack of optimal institutional structure within the Superintendency to attract foreign investment, which is why we want to re-institutionalize our organization to oversee the banks and wider sector, because the financial sector has torn down barriers in terms of internationalization. It is one of the most globalized and technology-hungry industries. Also, we are dollarized economy, which means the industry has enormous potential in Latin America.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank been a source of fiscal stability in recent years?</h4><p>BCE has experienced an important change in recent years. Until May 2017, we were transferring funds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. However, after June 2017 and after analyzing the balance sheet of the BCE, we decided to stop financing the government. That decision was supported by the president as an attempt to strengthen BCE and the status of the US dollar as our currency. Since then, we have recovered USD613 million. Over the last year, we have worked on a law to strengthen BCE as an institution and create a central banking directorate. It will comprise five members designated by the president and be managed by a chairman of BCE's directorate. This individual will also be the legal representative of the institution, and the directorate will be responsible for monetary policy. We will also have a general manager of BCE responsible for managerial matters, as well as corporate governance. Three of the five members will work part-time and two full-time. The former will play a surveillance role in all the decisions taken. We have also proposed the creation of certain committees to improve the decision-making process and internal control of the institution in areas like auditing, investment, and others. Meanwhile, we have focused on the publication of our information. BCE is the largest producer of statistics, issuing more than 5,000 publications per year. In that regard, we are working to update the methodology and the data we use to calculate our balance of payments. In a dollarized economy, the balance of payments is a key consideration, which clearly shows the state of the economy. The Achilles' heel of a dollarized economy is the foreign sector, which we have observed in the balance of payments. We must obtain more refined information, which will be vital for us, particularly in developing our politics.</p><h4>BCE and the IMF are working on a new regulatory framework for the bank. What can we expect from those changes?</h4><p>Since January 2019, we have worked with the IMF to develop a new law for BCE. The decision to stop lending money to the Ministry of Economy and Finance was established under a prohibition in the second law of economic development. We are returning to ratify that disposition in this new law, and we are working on the independence of BCE in the decision-making process on monetary policy. Right now, the top authority of BCE is the general manager, and all the political decisions are made by the monetary policy regulatory board, which is chaired by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, a delegate of the country's president, and two additional ministers. This is not the ideal method for decision-making. The law has three goals: to strengthen the balance of BCE and international reserves, given how crucial the institution is to maintaining dollarization; recovering a government advisory role; and obtaining autonomy in financial resources.</p><h4>There have been fluctuations of international reserves. How can you combat that? </h4><p>The international reserve is closely connected to external flows of resources. In October 2019, the reserves totaled USD4.7 billion, which is a reasonable level. With that, we are able to cover all the private deposits in the bank. With those results, we expect to reach the goals established under the IMF program.</p><h4>How do you see BCE and the fiscal and macroeconomic situation of Ecuador?</h4><p>With respect to economic growth, we had an estimate of 0.2% for 2019; however, we are calculating the effects of the halt experienced in October 2019. We want to not only quantify the size of the economy but also the social aspects and environmental effects that impact the country. With respect to the tax reform, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has said it is possible to collect USD700 million. This will help improve revenues in 2020 and prepare us to reinvest in public construction projects.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is solar energy evolving in the country?</h4><p>Solar energy is relatively new in Ecuador, although it has existed worldwide for many years. At present, there is no established legal framework, though one is now being created. The country is embarking on its first large-scale PV project with El Aromo, which will most likely boost overall interest in the area. Moreover, the project will serve as a catalyst for regulations up to the local level, which will allow PV technology to be implemented in standard houses and buildings. The El Aromo project is a step toward changing Ecuador's energy matrix. Solar energy is clean, and I am pleased to see that the government is finally starting to focus on this energy source. This will also benefit from the fact that private power generation plants can now sell surplus energy to other stakeholders. In the context of the importance of solar energy in Ecuador, Canis Energy's main focus is on cities. We want to help cities across the country start generating electricity through PV glass. In this regard, we are the exclusive distributors for Onyx Solar in Ecuador, a world-class producer of solar glass, and we are already working with local institutions in Ecuador. For example, we are working with the city of Quevedo to develop bus stops with solar glass panels.</p><h4>What needs to be done to educate potential consumers on the benefits of solar energy?</h4><p>We show clients in-depth studies that demonstrate advantages in terms of savings and social impact. Additionally, Onyx Solar is carrying out a project to promote the installation of solar glass panels on buildings. For every meter of glass sold, the company has made a commitment to plant a tree in the Amazon. Solar glass panels not only generate electricity, they also have the same transparency as standard glass and a UV filter of 99% and IR filter of 95%; therefore, it is a construction material that has a return on investment. Each customer that comes to us receives a personalized study on savings and environmental protection.</p><h4>Which projects have used your solar glass panels?</h4><p>We have worked on many projects, though we take pride in a warehouse that has 900sqm of PV glass and is expected to generate around 9,000kWh per month. The warehouse demonstrates the savings that the product offers and its significance for energy-intensive buildings. Notably, Onyx Solar will plant 900 trees because of this project.</p><h4>How are private and public stakeholders promoting the implementation of green practices in Ecuador?</h4><p>For example, there are many green financial products, including programs by private and public banks that support renewable projects. These initiatives have somewhat boosted renewable energy projects. The next step for the country is to establish a regulatory framework to support these sustainable initiatives. Developers are paying more attention to LEED certification, and Ecuador already has one LEED Platinum certification. Our product can provide points for the LEED certification, which is a great advantage.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define the trajectory of Plusambiente as a company specializing in environmental services, and where do you have the most experience?</h4><p>Plusambiente has been in the market for more than 10 years, offering a wide range of environmental services in Ecuador. Our mission is to be a strategic ally in environmental matters for all our clients. We carry out a comprehensive management and revaluation of waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous and contaminated and uncontaminated. The company also promotes a rational use of renewable and non-renewable natural resources as well as the recycling, reuse, and revaluation of waste. Plusambiente started by providing services for the oil and gas industry. We work mainly with multinational and oil service companies in the value chain. It has been inspiring to work with world-class companies that operate with high-quality standards, which in turn has led to exponential growth. In recent years, we have expanded our services to the food, mining, automotive, and other sectors. We seek to always help clients manage their environmental issues, in addition to carbon footprint measurement and social responsibility projects.</p><h4>What environmental services is the company currently offering to mining companies?</h4><p>Plusambiente Integral Environmental Services currently maintains the integrated waste management plant in the province of Orellana, providing an adequate final disposal for waste with national coverage. We started our operations after acquiring an environmental license from the Ministry of Environment in order to meet the requirements as an environmental services provider. Additionally, we have a license to transport hazardous waste and substances. Plusambiente also offers consulting services for management systems, which is carried out by our highly trained, internationally recognized personnel. Finally, we offer PLUS Compliance 360, a product that helps companies address legal environmental affairs and safety regulations.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the environmental regulatory framework in Ecuador, and how are the changes affecting various sectors?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian regulatory framework serves as the basis for the environmental management of companies. With the promulgation of the Organic Environmental Code, companies have adopted a framework that is beneficial to the environment. We must recognize that mutual support with the control authority is beneficial for the environment. This regulation will encourage companies such as Plusambiente and help them minimize the potential costs of poor organizational management and potential fines for non-compliance.</p><h4>What are your recommendations to mining companies to address environmental issues in Ecuador and overcome environmental legal issues?</h4><p>Companies must view the environmental issue as an opportunity, primarily as an occasion to make a significant contribution to the area where they are executing their activities, as well to ensure the success and continuity of their operations. The basis of good environmental management is to know the application of environmental legislation in its operations and avoid violations. The help of a strategic ally with proven experience in environmental matters is of great value to avoid subsequent infractions.</p><h4>How receptive are companies to better environmental practices, and what are the challenges in this respect?</h4><p>A company's level of receptivity to best environmental practices is a function of its corporate culture. Based on our experience, companies in Ecuador basically take two types of approaches: a purely reactive approach, which is solving problems and dealing with penalties; and a proactive approach. We have the privilege of having a portfolio of clients who take the proactive approach and maintain high-quality standards. Our challenge is to lead the change in Ecuador regarding the approach of companies toward environmental management.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2020?</h4><p>We constantly seek to position ourselves as a national reference in the waste management and consulting sector, for which we have international certifications. From the beginning, we have been consistent in fulfilling our promise of value, which is to provide adequate, timely, and conscious management of waste and winning our customers' loyalties. Our focus in 2020 is to apply new strategies in different national and international sectors. We will focus on strategic alliances and the application of methodologies such as sustainable memory management and minimizing carbon footprints. We will also align our corporate objectives to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen our digital and technological portfolio. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are GRUENtec's services helping companies meet increasingly higher environmental standards?</h4><p>All our clients seek to meet environmental regulations and prove to the regulatory bodies that they are doing things right. Our main goal is to help them achieve that. We also want to ensure we provide high-quality services at a technical level and therefore have the ISO 17025 certification and other certifications like ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 by Bureau Veritas. GRUENtec is an Ecuadorian company but its founders are German. That German DNA makes us make different compared to other laboratories. Our advanced technological equipment and a wonderful professional team of more than 100 people are our competitive advantages. We have state-of-the-art laboratories, and many of our processes are automatized. This makes us one of the few and perhaps the only laboratory with such level of automatization in Ecuador, and we can be easily compared with high performance laboratories around the world. GRUENtec has the only environmental and commercial lab with certain special equipment in Ecuador. In addition to our headquarters in Quito, we own a network of three more labs in Ecuador. Ecuador is a small yet diverse country, which is why we need to have the capacity to quickly adapt to the needs of different industries. On top of that, we work to promote the benefits of being a green company. There are not many companies in Ecuador that value the benefits that being green can bring to them. For example, a metallic mining company does not need to evaluate the impact that plastics residues can generate, although monitoring that could generate a huge benefit for society. It is necessary to consider that all of us live in the same environment and our actions affect everybody in some way.</p><h4>How are you adapting to the new demands posed by the booming mining sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>GRUENtec has high expectations because mining is one of the industries that require many resources. The company is currently investing to meet future demand in three strategic fields: infrastructure, personnel, and technology. The expectations are extremely high. However, there has been a great deal of political instability in the country in recent years, which has concerned foreign investors. Nevertheless, we like working closely with our clients and growing alongside them. As the sector consolidates, we are seeking to implement feedback from our clients to learn and promote best practices in the sector, and that includes the social and economic aspects of their activity. Local communities will see changes in their environment, and the challenge is to find ways to mitigate the harmful effects. That said, mining is extremely crucial to the country's development.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the different services you provide as a laboratory?</h4><p>We are the most comprehensive lab in the market conducting analysis on water, soil, waste, noise, air quality, gas emissions, solids, liquid, vibrations, and all different kinds of environmental samples. We are not just specialized in one area but in several. We also have many different chemical parameters that are certified. The company has 23 years of experience and a great responsibility in terms of innovation. We train our staff and provide them with different materials to become innovative. Of more than 100 employees, nearly 30% of them work on new ideas. We have a program to develop new ideas, make them real, and enable collaboration and cooperation across the company. We are focused on providing services for the mining industry. We permanently invest in personnel, communications, infrastructure, technology, and other areas, planning CAPEX investments to cover the needs of the industry.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has technology marked PECS' trajectory since its inception, and what role does it currently have in the development of more efficient environmental solutions?</h4><p>PECS is an Ecuadorian company that has been characterized by investing in technology and innovating in a disruptive way for more than 30 years. From the beginning, we sought to innovate. Our budget includes a percentage for R&amp;D, which has allowed us to expand the portfolio of services we offer from a couple of lines focused on spill care to more than 20 at this time, covering the full spectrum of environmental services, including the application of the circular economy and the revaluation of waste. We are challenging ourselves to not have final disposal of waste in five years' time, but instead reuse 100% of them. Technology is a crucial part of this challenge.</p><h4>What approach does PECS have in terms of innovation and development, especially for the conception of organic and biodegradable products?</h4><p>In 2018, we completed an ambitious project at our Integral Solutions Center (CSIGAV), located in the Joya de los Sachas, for the revaluation of organic products. At the moment, large quantities of chemicals that are not compatible with sustainable production with the environment are used within the market in general. Our initiative focuses on improving the type of fertilizer and fertilizers that are used in eastern Ecuador for agricultural plantations in the area. The organic revaluation project generates a product with high nutritional qualities, which is subsequently donated to the community near our facilities or used in our palm and cacao plantations. The fertilizer—waste derivative—is already in production, and we hope to launch it for sale in 2020.</p><h4>How is the company innovating in terms of waste management?</h4><p>PECS is the first company in Ecuador to focus its business model on researching, developing, and applying cutting-edge and disruptive technology while applying the circular economy. As an important part of our business model and vision, in PECS Environmental Solutions, we specialize in providing customized solutions and advise companies on how to stop having linear economies and convert their waste management to circular economies, minimizing pollution. To achieve this change, investment in technology and continuous training of human capital is essential, both within PECS and its clients. Additionally, we focus on providing follow-ups to the implementation of the new technologies that we bring to the country to be a success and to develop new technologies that fit the reality of the country. Having this flexibility, monitoring, and continuous improvement application, our technology application is technically and economically viable, which is usually where many environmental projects fail.</p><h4>What are the great environmental challenges for the mining industry and its consolidation?</h4><p>The mining industry is under a magnifying glass in the country, so in addition to the social resistance that has developed, its great challenge now is to meet the expectations of the environmental authority and the Ecuadorian people. Our guarantee is that we will support this industry to be successful in the country, providing solutions to cover the environmental needs they may have, and that guarantee this compliance with the environmental authority and the Ecuadorian people. We believe and focus on developing clean technology that supports the different industries in the country, minimizes pollution, and applies circular economy, taking care of non-renewable resources.</p><h4>What are the priorities for PECS for 2020?</h4><p>Our goal is to achieve 100% revaluation of waste generated by our customers in five years, and this is a crucial part of the company's strategic decisions. This objective fills us with optimism; we know there will be many challenges along the way, though we are sure we will achieve it. We will look for clients committed to the environment that are our strategic partners in this new adventure that will be a guide to produce without polluting. The true mark is not to leave a mark.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is SENAGUA's role in the management of water resources?</h4><p>Water is a strategic, important, and influential resource in the development of economic and social life of a country. Development, production, and life depend on its availability. SENAGUA efficiently guarantees compliance with the rights enshrined in the constitution regarding access, and fair, equitable, and rational use of water. We understand the management of water resources in an integral way because it is an element that allows a decent life and ensures health, food, and nutrition. The government seeks to guarantee the conservation, recovery, and integral management of water resources, river basins, and ecological flows associated with the hydrological cycle. By doing so, we can regulate all activities that may affect the quality and quantity of water, and the balance of ecosystems, especially in water sources and recharge areas.</p><h4>What plans are being carried out to improve access to water in the country?</h4><p>Our mission is to reach all sectors of the country by delivering water through usage authorizations. We must reach all users who require it personally, for uses such as human consumption, irrigation for food sovereignty, ecological flows, and productive activities. Through the mission Water and Sanitation for All, we reach the sectors that lack access to drinking water and basic sanitation. We provide potable water and sanitary sewer systems together with the decentralized autonomous governments. Social water organizations that help manage and operate the country's rural systems form a fundamental axis in water planning.</p><h4>One of the fastest-growing activities in the country is mining and its future depends on the management of permits granted by SENAGUA. What changes have been made to expedite the granting of permits and at the same time ensure responsible use?</h4><p>Most of the raw materials used today come from the subsoil and are extremely important for Ecuador's future. In order to safeguard the water resource, and as established by the Organic Law on Water Resources, Usage, and Efficiency and the Mining Law, this institution issues an administrative act prior to the execution of mining activities, in which it is verified whether or not there will be any eventual damage to bodies of surface or underground water and if the project follows the order of priority over the right to access water. This state portfolio has developed a technical standard that establishes the minimum requirements and guidelines for the issuance of the previous administrative act, which considers the principles of simplification, standardization, and optimization of processes, without neglecting the technical requirements regarding the preservation of hydric resources.</p><h4>What priorities does SENAGUA have today?</h4><p>SENAGUA has the responsibility of guaranteeing fair and equitable access to water through policies, strategies, and plans that enable a comprehensive and integrated management of water resources. SENAGUA has established the following axes for its management: Optimize the procedure for issuing authorizations for use of water considering the principles of simplification and standardization in order to provide an effective service to citizens; digitalize the issuance of authorizations for use of water; simplify, standardize, and optimize the requirements and procedures for the issuance of administrative acts in compliance with the Mining Law in order to guarantee the effective exercise of the sovereign rights of the state to administer, regulate, and control mining activities while preserving hydric resources; conserve and protect water sources by identifying and delimiting the water protection areas, and guarantee the water supply and the preservation of the ecosystem services of these areas; implement a unique information system for the management of water resources that collects stores, processes, and supplies data for decision-making, control, and regulation of the water sector; implement the Water and Sanitation for All mission, which aims to guarantee fair and equitable access to water, improve the quality of basic services, and reduce the presence of diseases and protect water-related ecosystems; and planning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's your evaluation of Assistec's performance in the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>Over the last two decades, Assistec has stood out as a company that understands the client's needs and society's expectations. From the beginning, we have worked to become strategic communication allies of our customers, forming a sort of a communications umbrella. We have implemented programs to improve a CEO's image, public relations, corporate image and reputation, crisis management, and digital communication. The latter two have had a bigger impact in the last few years due to the evolving requirements of our clients, who value the sharp and professional manner in which our plans are executed.</p><h4>How important is the role of digitalization in a company's communication strategy?</h4><p>Digital communication is a must. Digital media has expanded the communications options to such a degree that it has become a challenge. New digital channels allow us to display our clients' messages directly to their stakeholders, who also have migrated to these new spaces. At Assistec, we are abreast of all digital advances and we stay up-to-date to manage this form of communication. We always start by defining our goals, and then developing and implementing comprehensive strategies. For example, we have developed synchronized mobile applications that use AI to advance our messages.</p><h4>What does Assistec recommend to companies facing a crisis?</h4><p>Our first objective is to prevent or avoid a crisis, so we aim to detect where and when a crisis could take place and, consequently, recommend defensive actions; however, if a crisis does take place, we are able to respond immediately. Our team is well prepared to act quickly, in a matter of a few days or even a few hours. Our team employs comprehensive communication strategies that address both external and internal actors. Additionally, we conduct an accurate mapping of the potential reactions to our messages. Since we have experience dealing with most of Ecuador's business sectors, our executives understand every sector's issues and problems, therefore, we are able to rapidly develop tailor-made plans for each case. Our key recommendations to companies facing a crisis is to act immediately to evaluate the risks, identify the key actors, develop a clear and convincing message, and then transmit it effectively through broad traditional media and/or focused social media.</p><h4>What role does communication play in the success of a company?</h4><p>In this digital age, internet and social media has made communications a key component of corporate success, to a degree that was unheard of in prior decades. Companies need to manage their corporate and product images carefully, as well as their ongoing public dialogue with employees, customers, journalists, and people in general. Within Assistec, one leg of our success is that we execute strategies that are carefully crafted to meet the particular needs of each client. The other leg is our team of almost 50 professionals, among them experienced journalists and digital media experts, as well as highly trained PR, marketing, and business analysts. Our customers place their trust in the hands of a multi-disciplinary team that applies thoughtful strategies and rigorous execution to address all challenges, particularly crisis management. On a personal note, I must emphasize that I firmly believe that true leadership means that the people who work with me will grow and develop professionally, thus building our strength on a daily basis.</p><h4>What are Assistec's priorities for 2020?</h4><p>Our first priority is to continue guiding and supporting the executives of our domestic and multinational customers. At the same time, we must continue to learn and evolve constantly, always aware of the latest technical innovations as well as the most influential social and political trends shaping Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Seminarium work to improve the executive education of high-level businesspeople in Latin America?</h4><p>Seminarium was born as a Chilean company and entered the Ecuadorian market about 20 years ago. As part of its offering, Seminarium provides courses for Latin American executives at leading universities in the US such as Wharton, Yale, and Michigan, among others. The idea is to bring around 70 Ecuadorian businesspeople every year to the US to participate in business courses, seeking to improve the performance of those executives. One of the main goals is to improve networking across these businesspeople and offer them different management programs in the various universities we work with. We focus on the specialties of each university. That is why we are constantly updating the program to match the needs of Latin American executives and the services provided in each of those universities.</p><h4>Seminarium Ecuador also organizes events, including the Annual Meeting of Mining, Energy, and Petroleum (ENAEP), bringing together stakeholders from these strategic sectors. How has this event evolved across the years?</h4><p>The goal of our events, including ENAEP, is to address hot topics and organize them in a way that reflects the situation of the country. We have done that in Ecuador by adapting our events to the current topics in the country and addressing the main issues of businesspeople in the country. A key factor for the development of these three industries is the relationship with indigenous communities; therefore, we decided to focus the event on that, even bringing in representatives from these communities so as to create a space of conversation between them and representatives from the public and private sectors. The government has taken a number of initiatives to increase FDI into Ecuador, and we will see a lot of those efforts come to fruition in 2020. Mining companies are interested in investing in the country. When talking about Ecuador, it is important to keep in mind that it is a country where inclusion is critical. The protests in October 2019 were a wake-up call to companies and the government to be more aware of the needs of indigenous peoples. We have an opportunity to establish better agreements that are beneficial for the communities, as well as the environment. This is a process that will take a while to completely develop as new issues will have to be addressed. In particular, we have to increase women's participation in the mining sector. Our events are attended by the main players and decision makers, as well as representatives from the communities, public institutions, students, and the media. The point of these events is to promote discussion between the different stakeholders.</p><h4>What new events are you bringing into the market?</h4><p>Recently, we started organizing an event to promote the role of women in industry. We were able to bring women leaders from the Galápagos and other areas to talk about women rights and to bring improvements to different sectors. Three events in this line have been organized so far, and we want to host another in 2020. Another topic we are covering through events is risk management. We are trying to bring professionals from Europe and Chile to attend our events for risk management. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your analysis of the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian economy and its prospects over 2019 were, at best, unpredictable. Notwithstanding forecasts of economic decline, various events served to strengthen confidence, including the signing of the agreement with the IMF in March, the new economic plan, proposals for legal reforms to reactivate the economy, and other measures. In June 2019, Ecuador put into operation a plan to restructure the sovereign debt by repurchasing USD1.12 billion of its 2020 bonds. The agreed 10-year term, under better rates than previous issues, reduced the default risk on obligations due in 2020. In September, the country managed to raise an additional USD2 billion with terms of between five and 10 years, thus covering part of its financing requirements arising from the fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, by 3Q2019, Ecuador's economy and outlook had deteriorated, and the pressure to achieve the goals established in the economic plan led to further adjustments. In October, the government's announcement of economic measures provoked protests among various local groups, bringing economic activities to a halt and resulting in the subsequent repeal of the measures. Local and international confidence took a beating as debt holders and investors became alarmed at the prospect of an ungovernable country. Reduced profits saw the country risk rise to levels last seen at the beginning of 2016, when Ecuador suffered an economic recession caused by the massive withdrawal of deposits and the contraction of credit. Fears were subsequently allayed after the approval of laws governing tax collection coupled with the IMF's support for an economic program. The country's risk level has fallen in tandem with improvement of the Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) indicator, issued by JP Morgan. Ecuador's biggest challenge now is the low or zero growth rate for 2020 forecasted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and other economic analysts.</p><h4>How did this context influence business?</h4><p>Notwithstanding the above, local and foreign groups still believe in Ecuador. In 2018 and 2019, merger and acquisition activity revived following enactment of the law that lowered taxes on profits from the sale of holdings, shares, and capital rights from a 25% maximum to 10%, while permitting deductions on transactions. Relevant transactions included international and local groups acquiring major companies in the pharmaceutical retail industry, as well as in the distribution of food, beverages, and personal items. Local groups also branched out into Central America and the region through strategic acquisitions, while Mexican, European, Central American, and regional capital has entered Ecuador through the acquisition of major companies in the poultry, processed foods, meat, food, and beverages industries, among others. Investments have also been undertaken in the mining, manufacturing, aquaculture, and fishing and shrimp industries, among others. This is evidence of the attractive niches and investment opportunities available in the Ecuadorian market. Although government investment will be limited in 2020, PPPs and key asset concessions will be targeted opportunities for the private sector. This translates into great challenges for companies with a local presence that are seeking growth, profitability, and value generation for their investors. They will have to prepare strategically and seek out opportunities that generate sustained growth and provide for a competitive position. It is clear that looking for inorganic growth through acquisitions of companies, business lines, brands, and so on may make the difference and enable companies to accumulate synergies that generate the sought-after value. The need, then, is to be able to call upon teams of process consulting experts in M&amp;A who can manage and leverage their guidance and experience to attain successful closures. This will enable the C-suite to concentrate its efforts on operations and, subsequently, the transition toward the union of firms, different cultures, and all those elements implied in a merger if expected results are to be achieved.</p><h4>What is Deloitte's experience in these processes?</h4><p>According to MergerMarkets, in recent years, Deloitte has advised on several regional transactions totaling approximately USD4 billion, positioning the firm as the strongest M&amp;A processes consultant among the big four.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the origin of Grupo Spurrier and its shift from producing oil-related information to a multi-sectoral offering?</h4><p>When we began operations in 1971, our clients were international oil companies that were expanding into Ecuador. The majority of these companies did not have much information about Ecuador, so we started publishing a weekly report in English. It was not a news service as such, but an analysis of current events relevant to the business community. Afterward, local businesses started to demand our services, and in 1975, we started publishing our report in Spanish as well. Back then, Ecuador was undergoing a momentous transformation, and both multinational and local businesses were eager to understand the changes it brought. In 1975, for the first time, Ecuador started participating in global financial markets, and since then we have published our weekly reports in both English and Spanish. Moreover, we have expanded into consultancy services as a think tank; we produce reports tailored to the needs of individual businesses. We started catering to the oil industry, but early on we expanded into other industries, such as finance and foreign trade. We have been covering the mining sector since the 1970s and have gone over the government's failed attempts to open up the mining sector through the issuance of a new specialized law. The government's recent efforts have been successful; therefore, we are covering the sector more thoroughly now.</p><h4>What factors will determine the future of mining in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador is drawing the attention of international mining companies because of two key factors. First, despite the fact the government of Gustavo Noboa drafted and passed an investor-friendly mining law at the start of the 21st century, in 2008 the government halted all mining projects. This situation lasted until 2015, when the government of Rafael Correa reversed the anti-mining policy as a result of declining oil revenues. Ecuador has immense untapped mining potential, and a number of recent gold and copper discoveries have aroused interest from international miners. Second, Ecuador is a small and densely populated country, which can be advantageous for mining activities, which ordinarily require large infrastructure projects. The biggest challenge is ensuring a stable political and social environment. There is no doubt Ecuador will enter a buoyant mining era sooner rather than later. All the political parties are in favor of the mining sector, and any successor administration will be aware of the contribution of an expanding mining sector to the national economy.</p><h4>What will joining the Pacific Alliance mean for the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>Membership in the Pacific Alliance may require Ecuador to open its market to Mexican manufacturing, which will not bode well for import-substitution industries. Joining the Pacific Alliance will also mean Ecuador has to open its economy to international trade.</p><h4>What will be the impact of Ecuador leaving OPEC?</h4><p>I was a delegate at the OPEC meeting in 1992 when Ecuador first left the organization. The decision to leave OPEC was an honest one; Ecuador accepted quotas as a temporary solution, however, as they become a fixture, Ecuador could not heed a quota that hindered its plan to develop reserves and increase output. Ecuador cannot delay discovery and development of oil deposits. Electric vehicles are becoming a reality, and, as a result, demand for oil for transportation is set to stagnate or fall, which means investment in oil exploration will become less attractive.</p><h4>What does 2020 hold for Ecuador?</h4><p>2020 will be challenging for the local economy. The recently passed tax bill falls short of generating the funds required to meet the deficit-reduction goals of the economic program, and there has not been much progress in reducing current budgetary expenditures. Ecuador' access to international financial markets will remain limited. The best bet is that Ecuador will experience zero growth in 2020. However, sectors that are not dependent on the local market, such as mining, will not be affected. Investment in mining will be one of the high points of 2020.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us some background on the company, along with some of the current investment trends you have noted?</h4><p>FERRERE is one of the two largest professional services firms in the country and one of the three largest firms in South America, with 1,300 employees in the region and 13 offices throughout Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. In Ecuador, we currently have more than 75 lawyers and 170 employees in our three offices in Quito, Guayaquil, and Manta. We are active in areas such as hydrocarbons, mining, and different forms of activity related to natural resources. This footprint gives us a great position to measure changes in the investment climate, as we are involved in the development of our clients' activities related to new investments and existing ones. In Ecuador, the changes in the Productive Development Law of 2018 were positive. Various provisions on arbitration and the participation of the private sector were included, which targeted the creation of a more attractive environment for investment. There are more decisive steps to be take; for example, it is necessary to revive bilateral investments agreements, which were all renounced in 2017.</p><h4>What other changes are still due to further dynamize the economy?</h4><p>Ecuador must continue on a path of openness and integration, following a clear set of changes. First, Ecuador should continue working to become a full member of the Pacific Alliance, then resume discussions to sign bilateral investments with countries vital for our economy such as the US, Spain, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Second, Ecuador must develop an international arbitration law that strengthens the recognition and enforcement of foreign awards, which would help our country generate a greater integration of Ecuador in the international arbitration system. Third, our country needs to see a much more holistic simplification of the tax regime, especially regarding the reduction and subsequent elimination of the tax on the exit of foreign currency (ISD). Despite its name, ISD also acts as a tax on the entry of capital. Since it is expensive to repatriate earnings, investment does not come. Fourth would be to speed up investment processes, including approvals for investments, environmental permits, approval of assignments of state contracts, and others.</p><h4>What are your views on the mining sector and its future?</h4><p>We work with existing players in the sector on corporate and mining issues, dealing with topics such as JVs, development of mining projects, and constitutional matters. All Ecuadorians should understand that mining is a key revenue generator in the country, as is the case in Chile or Peru. Mining allows sustained growth to the point of dynamizing the economy in such a way that national per capita income grows substantially. For Ecuador to achieve parity with its neighbors, it is estimated that we need at least a decade of continuous growth. Mining growth in Ecuador requires the attraction and long-term presence of responsible companies that encourage the adequate distribution of mining wealth through responsible mining. If mining continues on a positive track, it is expected to exceed oil investment in the coming years, which will have other effects. First, mining will boost other parallel investments such as infrastructure and construction. Additionally, unlike oil, mining distributes the income much faster among society. Second, large-scale mining takes a longer time to develop, creating a broader and more diverse process. In this sector, there are also changes that are highly needed, including the reopening of the mining cadaster so Ecuador remains attractive. And last but not least, the most important thing is for Ecuador to work on providing legal certainty and full protection to existing investments in order to attract new ones.</p><h4>How will 2020 shape Ecuador's economy?</h4><p>Despite the near-zero GDP growth rate expected, 2020 should be a year of consolidation of the current pro investment policies. The government needs to speed them up and implement measures that will pave the way for greater growth in 2021.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the legacy of the Yúnez administration helped position Samborondón as one of the most prosperous and safest cities in Ecuador? </h4><p>Samborondón welcomed my great-grandfather when he migrated to Ecuador from Lebanon. My father was the first in the family to enter politics, followed by me. We see politics as a way of serving people using our knowledge, experience, and administrative skills. Today, Samborondón is a safe and well-planned city where everyone wants to live. Security is part of our legacy, and we have achieved it in different ways. Our focus is to ensure that progress reaches all corners of the canton. Samborondón is not only La Puntilla, its most renowned area, but also all of its rural areas. We are continuously working on providing clean drinking water and bringing bring free internet to rural areas. We provide tablets and backpacks to high schools and maintain the infrastructure. We achieved development in the La Puntilla area by working on the security aspect. We are currently conducting a study that will help us maintain a high level of security for the next 10 years. Our broader security strategy includes cameras, a monitoring center, panic buttons, and interconnected radios.</p><h4>What steps is the municipality taking to develop its tourism offering, and what are the main assets of the canton in this regard?</h4><p>Samborondón has all the ingredients to keep attracting an increasing number of both local and international tourists. Besides, we are situated next to Guayaquil, the city that receives the highest number of tourists in Ecuador. We are a satellite city next to Guayaquil and offer our own tourism products. We are attracting investments in restaurants, hotels, convention centers, bars, and theaters to create a better offering for tourists. Besides, Samborondón is famous for its bird sighting activity, as many unique species can be found here. Other notable attractions include a museum-house, a beautiful pier, and an old tradition of equestrian sports. Remarkably, the municipality is building Ecuador's first artificial beach in Samborondón. The boardwalk will feature several recreational spaces.</p><h4>How is the municipality encouraging development in the agricultural sector to make it more competitive?</h4><p>Samborondón depends mainly on agriculture, especially rice and cattle. We created a rice research center in cooperation with a university to help us carry out research on soil. One of our priorities is to help the farmers in Samborondón improve their competitiveness. We are doing so by teaching them about different technologies such as tractors, machinery, and drones.</p><h4>Samborondón offers the highest returns on real estate investments among all cities in Ecuador. What are the reasons behind this?</h4><p>Security is the most important asset of our city. Samborondón's stability has helped properties across the city gain tremendous value. Urban planning is a fundamental issue faced by the majority of municipalities. To tackle this, we have formed a 50-year master plan based on an innovative and planned vision for the canton. This plan clearly defines areas for residential, commercial, and educational buildings. This will further generate economic growth and ensure high returns for those who decide to invest in Samborondón. The city has experienced the highest growth among all cities in Ecuador in the last 20 years. To further develop the canton and attract investors, we are working on city legislations that will generate tax incentives for new companies, which in turn will promote entrepreneurship. Samborondón already has the highest level of entrepreneurs per capita in Ecuador. Companies of all sizes and nature decide to establish their bases in Samborondón. All these factors together have contributed to develop a dynamic and strong real estate market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What reasons led the Municipality of Guayaquil to create a public company for innovation and competitiveness?</h4><p>Current world dynamics and globalization have led cities to gain more prominence in social and economic contexts. Cities share the responsibility of facing global challenges whilst their efficient processes and relatively faster reaction times allow them to present development plans and set economic investment landscapes specific to the conditions and needs of their communities. Empowered decentralization allows communities to create social and economic policy adjusted to their interests to complement the national agenda. EPICO was conceived as an instrument to create a municipal development plan through innovation, science, and human development based on sustainable and inclusive principles. The idea was to create an institution that would orchestrate stakeholders of different areas to push economically progressive initiatives without being distracted by the daily administrative burdens of the municipality. We are preparing, for example, significant reforms for our environmental policy and coordinating with key private-sector players and academia to carry out major programs to build a sustainable city. We are rethinking the Guayaquil Smart City program with the objective of improving the quality of life through technology rather than measuring success by the installation and technologic output of the project itself. The program will be called “The REAL Smart City, Guayaquil.“ We have also assigned taskforces to re-engineer our transportation, public participation, and social inclusion policies. EPICO aims to promote partnerships between academia and major economic groups, specifically within the agro-industrial sector, to improve our production performance through research-based initiatives. We will create a brain belt in Guayaquil, a vibrant ecosystem to promote economic growth through innovation and joint collaboration. EPICO is the connector that will facilitate and coordinate this ambitious yet reachable goal.</p><h4>How do you expect EPICO to increase collaboration between public, private, and academic institutions?</h4><p>We decided to base our starting agenda on the main concerns of our citizens. 67% of the surveyed population expressed that sustainability is their main priority and concern. To them, sustainability involves not only an environmentally friendly city but also the expansion of public recreational spaces, the gentrification of historically significant districts of Guayaquil, and a significant improvement of their safety on the streets. When we formed our board of directors, we included local stakeholders from the public and private sectors alongside representatives of main academic institutions. Guayaquil's municipality has always led public policy related to all aspects regarding life in Guayaquil, and EPICO is just an extension of that trend. We want our people to perceive the municipal identity and influence our economic and social policies and initiatives.</p><h4>Despite being a young organization, how would you describe EPICO's achievements to date?</h4><p>We have already launched two innovation challenges, one of them applying NASA's research methodology. Both initiatives are in their beta stage for a duration of three months, as it coincides with the launch of the official strategic development plan. We have signed partnerships and developed joint collaboration programs between private-sector companies and academic institutions to promote entrepreneurship by challenging students to solve operational challenges of major retail chains and present them to their CEOs. We are set to release short technical education programs for 100 young, unemployed people not currently studying in university. These programs will develop specific skills and certifications related to the digital economy. Our expectation is to deploy this program on a quarterly basis and train at least 500 professionals by the end of 2020. We want to promote the green, blue, and orange economies. In addition to the above, and since October 2019, EPICO has assembled a team of 15 employees with multiple backgrounds committed to helping EPICO reach its goals and objectives. We have also completed the “Ideando Guayaquil“ Challenge with the participation of 250 students from eight universities. Within the “REAL Smart City, Guayaquil“ program, five projects will be launched in 2020 related to mobility, health, the environment, risk management, and urban planning. Furthermore, over 300 entrepreneurs have been reached through local programs <br>and activities.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Guayaquil represent for the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>Guayaquil is the economic engine of Ecuador. When we talk about Guayaquil, we have to include the greater Guayaquil and the impact it has had on its sister cities of Daule, Durán, Samborondón, and Milagro, as well as the rest of the Guayas province. Guayaquil is a vibrant city that is open to new businesses. It is home to important industries such as manufacturing, professional activities, real estate, trade, construction, and agriculture. Notably, the city generates 21% of the country's GDP. Guayaquil is home to the largest port in Ecuador and the seventh-largest port in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2018, the port moved a total of 19,794 tons for cargo. Additionally, we have the deepwater Port of Posorja, which was recently inaugurated. It promises to be one of the most important ports in South America. It will position Ecuador as one of the fastest-growing markets in the region and boost the country's competitiveness in global trade. Guayaquil has 15 universities, including the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral, which is among the top-100 universities in Latin America. Guayaquil offers an ideal business climate and it is renowned nationally and internationally for its political and institutional stability. The city has always stood out for having a public administration model that focuses on infrastructure development and the overall living conditions. Our goal is to attract more private investment for large developments. To that end, we work hand in hand with the chamber of commerce, the chamber of industry, the chamber of SMEs, the chamber of construction, and the chamber of aquaculture to meet the needs of different sectors.</p><h4>Guayaquil will inaugurate Aeroví­a in 2020. What benefits will it bring? </h4><p>Aeroví­a Guayaquil is a cable-drawn urban transport system. It will be inaugurated on October 9, 2020, which will mark the 200th anniversary of Guayaquil's independence. Construction started in June 2018 under the PPP model with a USD134-million loan awarded by the Agence Française de Développement. Aeroví­a Guayaquil will also be linked with Metrovia and Corredores Viales. It will have the capacity to transport 40,000 passengers per day, 2.1km over urban areas, and 2km over a river. In total, Aeroví­a Guayaquil will cover 4.1km with five stations.</p><h4>Guayaquil stands out for its infrastructure thanks to developments such as Posorja Port. The government is also working on a plan for a new airport. What will the new airport represent for the region and the country? </h4><p>The project will be developed on an area of 2,020ha. The goal of this megaproject is to ensure that Guayaquil, the region, and the country have a state-of-the-art airport in a location that will not face limitations or restrictions, enabling the city and the region to boost tourism and trade. The new airport will be a development hub and will be fully aligned with other megaprojects that we have planned for the next 50 years. At present, we estimate that the new airport will start operations somewhere between 2020 and 2026, depending on how the growth in air traffic will evolve at José Joaquí­n de Olmedo International Airport. According to our estimates, the construction and operation phases will require around six years, which includes the certification period for the new aerodrome. The airport will be located 28km away from the city of Guayaquil, in a sector named Via a la Costa. The location is around 50km away from the new deepwater Port of Posorja. Linking all three means of transport will add value to the city of Guayaquil, the new airport, and the region.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Guayas province's contribution to Ecuador's economy?</h4><p>Guayas province's economy is the largest among all the 24 provinces in Ecuador. It represents nearly 80% of the food and productive chain of domestic consumption in Ecuador. Nearly 87% of our land is arable, and we produce products such as banana, coffee, cacao, corn, and rice. Our province has been actively involved in recent years in the production of organic goods. The goal of our current administration is to restore the competitiveness of the province, and the only way to achieve that is to open Ecuador to international markets using Guayas as a gateway. The best way to increase exports is by signing new FTAs, which the current government is working on. Moving forward, we want to focus more on public-private cooperation. When I took office, I met with the relevant representatives from main chambers and business associations in our province to work on a vision for 2030. The vision's underlying goal is to establish an internationally competitive productive sector so that the provincial economy can become more resilient.</p><h4>What steps can the provincial government take to further boost economic activity in Guayas?</h4><p>We are thinking about developing a free trade zone in the province. Coastal regions in Peru and Colombia have been able to develop their competitiveness because of incentives such as special zones or investments in innovation. Promoting research in the main economic sectors of Guayas is one of our priorities. This will help us produce more value-added goods, especially in agriculture. We are considering creating a public company for the future development and digitalization of the agricultural sector. We have to focus on short-cycle crops. We have started to harvest moringa, a crop that grows within three months. We are also harvesting jicama, another that grows in three months. We should go for alternative crops and leave monoculture behind. The public company would identify crops that have high demand in international markets, so that our farmers can then harvest them. We will then take care of all the work to commercialize them abroad.</p><h4>How is infrastructure being developed to serve the dynamization of key economic sectors?</h4><p>This province has to develop more, especially water projects to bring more water to the region. The idea is to build a dam with the support of the central government and private investors to provide water to more than 120,000ha of land that we use to harvest rice and corn. We are also focusing on building new bridges and roads to connect Guayas with other municipalities and areas. The deep water port of Posorja started operations recently, and we are working on building a road to make the port better connected. This project would involve a 32-km road from Chongón to Posorja. We are aligning ourselves with Posorja Port because it is expected to move more than 1,200 TEUs.</p><h4>The province is working actively with multilateral institutions. What can we expect from this cooperation?</h4><p>We are renewing our working framework with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and have resumed talks with the Inter-American Development Bank (BID). We have their support for a total of USD100 million. Additionally, we have achieved a financing agreement for 32 bridges through the support of two European countries that will provide more than USD65 million. These projects are extremely important to bring development to the province.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Cuenca managed to attract the interest of investors?</h4><p>There are a number of reasons behind this trend. In general, it is due to a historically sustainable economic development strategy. Cuenca has the highest literacy rate in the country.  On average, people in Cuenca receive over 11 years of formal education. Thus, the city has the most skilled workforce in the country, attracting value-added industries. On the subject of value-added industries, Cuenca is the only city in Ecuador where the income from industrial activities is higher than the income from commercial activities. There is an important entrepreneurial spirit in our people. By 2020, we are on track to be recognized as the second-most important city worldwide, and the first in Americas, in local crafts. Obviously, the potential is huge, considering that Cuenca only represents 3.8% of Ecuador's current economic output. We are primed to receive projects across every sector and have the right conditions for businesses to prosper in our city. Furthermore, we are adding to our offer a plan to build an innovation space for collaboration between technology-related businesses, institutions, and other stakeholders.</p><h4>On the subject of tourism, the city's center is listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. How does the municipality plan to capitalize on its tourism potential?</h4><p>There is untapped potential in this sector, and we need to properly plan to seize it. In the past, the city won awards as a great destination for short vacations. We are trying to evolve our brand by developing the destination as a whole, creating a promotion strategy, starting a tourism observatory to provide statistics and trends, and making a public-private development fund for future JVs. We are also interested in exploring our opportunities in MICE tourism. Alongside construction, this is the sector that creates the biggest amount of jobs, and we want to find ways to improve our offer as a tourist destination for both international and local markets. In this regard, we have identified connectivity as one of our key areas that need further development. Improved connectivity will significantly increase the number of incoming tourists and investors. We are working on an airport expansion that would connect us to major regional hubs such as Lima and Bogotá. We are building a new land terminal at the northern part of the city to better connect with routes to and from other important cities in Ecuador. Within the city, we are developing a tram project that will cover 27 stations.</p><h4>What will be the role of private companies in the long-term growth of Cuenca, and what is your message to investors?</h4><p>Adding to the previously mentioned projects, we will build four markets, including one with  a 40,000-people capacity to connect local producers to end consumers. We are developing a gentrification plan to enhance public spaces through improving some areas and building new recreational spaces. Securing funding is key to successfully execute planned projects, which is why we have created a relationship with CAF, the development bank of Latin America. We have also approached others organizations to change the paradigms and elevate the importance of local governments in the policy execution process. We need to reduce the housing deficit by easing access to credit and incentivizing the residential construction sector. We have discussed the possibility of building a new football stadium and a new theater with a private contractor. Similarly, we have identified the need for a wide range of recreational activities that can be built and operated through PPPs. Cuenca has a strong local identity and an important set of traditional values that translate into a skilled workforce of motivated, honest, and hardworking people. We are confident that our people are our best resource and the key factor that can attract successful business ventures to come to Cuenca.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps has FEDEXPOR taken to become the main voice of exporters in Ecuador?</h4><p>FEDEXPOR is considered a third-level entity, which means we can group chambers of commerce as well as companies together under our umbrella. Fedexpor represents 85% of Ecuador's non-oil exports. Our partners include a wide range of exporters from traditional sectors such as banana, flowers, mango, and cocoa as well as growing ones such as chemicals and cosmetics. Furthermore, we represent companies of all sizes, which means we are a transversal entity that represents all sorts of exporting companies. FEDEXPOR focuses on two areas: interests of the sector within Ecuador and services to help companies reach international markets. For example, we work to include several proposals to change the legislation and make Ecuador more competitive in terms of logistics or employment. We also offer training courses for companies and employees, as well as organize events. Over the last 10  years, FEDEXPOR has gained a great deal of strength due to the country's need to boost its exports. Ecuador's economy has experienced significant development over the years; however, it is still a small market, so exports are vital for the healthy development of its economy and people.</p><h4>What is the weight of non-oil exports in the Ecuadorian economy?</h4><p>Non-oil exports represent around 11% of Ecuador's GDP. In other words, USD11 of every USD100 in the Ecuadorian economy is related to exports. If we consider the spillover effect, the indirect impact of non-oil exports is as high as 20%. In 2018, Ecuador generated USD12.8 billion in non-oil exports, and 2019 is expected to surpass the USD13-billion mark.</p><h4>How have Ecuadorian exports to the EU developed after the signing of an FTA in 2017?</h4><p>If implemented properly, FTAs are extremely helpful in boosting exports. Trade between Ecuador and the EU has increased over the last two years. Exports to the EU have increased by 7% since the signing of an FTA in 2017, and the number of regular exporters has also increased. Ecuador currently counts on 1,400 companies that export to the EU, out of a total of 3,600 exporting companies. Most importantly, the EU is one of the largest markets for SMEs in Ecuador. Thanks to this agreement, more than 20,000 new jobs have been created. It is crucial for Ecuador to open its doors and realize its role in global value chains. That should be the main strategy not just for the exporting sector, but for the development of the country as a whole. The country is going in the right direction with measures to reduce bureaucratic red tape and increase the role of the private sector. At the same time, the government is signing new agreements and engaging in negotiations with other countries and regions.</p><h4>What opportunities could be unleashed for Ecuadorian exporters after the country's entry into the Pacific Alliance?</h4><p>Ecuador's entry into the Pacific Alliance is a key part of our current strategy, and the relevant stakeholders in the country understand the alliance's importance. The Pacific Alliance has demonstrated that it can keep up with a rapid growth rate if we compare it with other regional blocs. In addition, joining the bloc can also be key to boosting FDI into Ecuador, as it will mean a market-friendly economy is being consolidated. The main opportunities would come from access to Mexico, specifically for products such as cocoa, shrimp, processed food, wood, and construction materials. Access to neighboring countries such as Peru and Colombia would also improve. Chile is also part of the alliance, and we are currently negotiating an agreement with Chile that would be bigger in scope than the alliance itself. Additionally, we see opportunities in Eastern Europe, specifically Russia. Negotiations are taking place with Japan and South Korea, as well as with Costa Rica and Guatemala. Furthermore, after years of being on hold, talks on a trade agreement with the US have resumed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What needs to be done to make the Ecuadorian exporting sector more competitive at an international level?</h4><p>Ecuador's economy is dollarized, which means we have to constantly work to increase our competitiveness in order to safeguard the economy against political instability. This goal can be achieved through several areas of work, like developing and fulfilling a commercial agenda through signing new trade agreements that generate preferential access of our products and eliminate tariffs. International trade is a two-way road; hence, the signing of commercial agreements reduces the cost of acquiring raw materials and capital goods that are part of the productive process. The prices of goods reduce as the markets get more options. Moreover, we must reduce bureaucratic red tape. At the same time, it is equally important that we improve our logistical capabilities and the process of tax returns, as well as modernize Ecuador's labor relations. In other words, we must work to improve Ecuador's domestic agenda.</p><h4>Looking at Ecuador's trade policy, what regions or countries are a priority?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important countries because we cannot join the Pacific Alliance without having an FTA with Mexico. Additionally, we need to strengthen our trade relations with Central American countries because it is a big market for our industrialized products, which always helps to develop a portfolio of exportable products with added value. We are also interested in Canada and a number of markets in Asia.</p><h4>What opportunities will emerge for the exports sector with the expected FTA with Mexico?</h4><p>The main issue will be the productive chain and JVs. Mexico currently represents one of the countries that invests the most in Ecuador. The potential is huge, not only for the Mexican market, but also for the business opportunities that can be created to collectively try to conquer markets in Latin America and the world.</p><p><br><br>What are the main challenges to generate a more diversified export portfolio with higher added value?<br>We are in the process of undergoing an export portfolio revolution in Ecuador. We want to work on a National Exports Plan that will allow Ecuador to diversify its products by 2030. The potential is huge given Ecuador's agro and industrial potential. We want to develop a strategy that will focus on tripling Ecuador's non-oil exports by 2030. œ–</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main changes in investment conditions and fiscal policy will be implemented in 2020?</h4><p>We are shifting the existing economic paradigm from a productive-sector driven economy, in which state-owned companies are responsible for the main source of national income, to an innovation-oriented mixed model where the state diversifies its risk and revenues. The government is working to establish a sustainable economic plan that includes the private sector, promotes partnership models, and reduces the national debt. The expectation is to implement structural reforms that overhaul the existing model and re-arrange those national institutions that have grown to unsustainable bureaucratic levels into enablers that serve as point-of-contact and orchestrators of all economic stakeholders that include not only local corporations, state-owned companies, and foreign investment groups, but also SMEs and entrepreneurship promotion organizations. To sustain our dollarized economy, it is crucial that we diversify our exports, reduce dependency on oil and gas, and become friendlier to foreign investment in order to keep the flow of foreign currency open. Our focus is on prioritizing the productive sectors and empowering the private sector across the board by including it in our economic policy planning. The state needs to function as a catalyst for economic and social synergies rather than being a player itself. To sustainably transform economic growth into social development, we need to provide producers with the tools to increase productivity, rather than expand into expensive social programs that hand out benefits, thereby depleting state revenues. National production needs to grow only to the extent that it ensures the government has greater resources to support business promotion, tool development, and increase access to the instruments of economic advancement. The most significant progress we've achieved is complete harmony between our words and actions, and the private sector, both local and foreign, has noticed this. There is renewed trust in our public institutions, which has translated into over USD700 million in economic agreements and investment pledges signed over the past six months alone. We have proposed a new tax system that frees our lowest earners from large imposed charges, while increasing the collaboration of established economic groups that will ultimately benefit from a better skilled workforce. In broader terms, this policy stands to reduce inequality and close economic and social gaps.</p><h4>The government is developing two main instruments for investment promotion: public-private partnerships and contracts of investments with the ministry. How are you expanding the scope of these tools?</h4><p>These tools are meant to stabilize the investment climate through securing the specific set of conditions or incentives agreed upon at the time of negotiation for the duration of the contracts and operations. We need to guarantee the consistency of our legal framework, as predictability is the key indicator foreign companies look for when considering investment in any country. Securing long-term operations and production from foreign companies will allow us to shift away from dependence on the profitability of our public companies. That in turn will reduce our need to over invest in these organizations. This administration has aligned local, national, and social policy with foreign trade policy and set the roadmap to achieve shared objectives. Public and foreign policy based on political ideologies has been replaced with pragmatic integral sustainable policy based on key social and economic principles. Under the new scheme, APPs have benefits such as exemption from income tax (Impuesto de la Renta) for 10 years, or currency exit tax (Impuesto a la Salida de Divisas) in some cases. Notably, major projects such as the Port of Posorja by DP World or Port Bolí­var of the Yildirim Group have been realized under this scheme</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe SEMAICA's track record in the construction sector, and which projects have made it the organization it is today?</h4><p>SEMAICA started as the entrepreneurial venture between two engineers who made a name for themselves. They were sought after to build the National Social Security Institute's headquarters in Quito, Ecuador, in partnership with a major developer. That building, the largest project in Ecuador at the time, made us the company we are today. From the beginning, our philosophy has been to holistically approach the idea, design, and building of any project and to include innovative trends, practices, and techniques into every project. We hold important sector milestones in Ecuador such as pioneering the use of Italian marble and being the first company to use a computer made for construction. It was important for us to transform the company from a family-owned enterprise to a process-driven corporation that would provide our stakeholders the confidence to invest in our growth. In 2015, we obtained our ISO 9001 certification that standardized and stabilized many of our procedures and practices. Other projects that have marked our trajectory in Ecuador are the CFN headquarters, the CIESPAL building, and the Rumiñahui Coliseum. We had the privilege of participating in the NASA satellite tracking antennas project and the two main tunnels in Guayaquil. We were the first Ecuadorian company to build a tunnel. Overall, our biggest strength is our versatility as we can jump on a trend quickly. We are currently building five new hotels after a long hiatus without projects in this sector, which reflects the increasing importance of the hospitality sector.</p><h4>How have you adapted to the country's needs?</h4><p>We have historically supported Ecuador by obtaining the know-how and fulfilling needs such as building viaducts in the 1960s to solve drinking water shortages and distribution problems. A few decades later, we built tunnels and roads to better connect cities, and now we support tourism growth by allowing big chains to increase their offerings and satisfy demand. We have also diversified and reduced our dependence on public projects and shifted focus to the private sector, with industrial and tourism projects currently in our pipeline.</p><h4>Regarding the extractive sectors, how will you increase your participation?</h4><p>As a construction company and EPC services provider, we created the concept of high-value engineering. We approach all projects by working with the idea, materials, and design to make sure we are comfortable with the projects. Over time, we developed the knowledge base to become a consultancy partner for our clients, and by improving the faulty elements in other stakeholders' work, we acquired the skills to become a project integrator. We are now able to orchestrate and harmonize all stakeholders in any projects. Although we participate in tenders, we are focused on building megaprojects in a way that we can design, prospect, build, and service the whole project. With regard to mining, we were involved in building the largest tunnel in the history of the country, delivering it six months ahead of schedule. If Lundin's operations are successful, it will generate trust amongst global players to invest in Ecuador. We are open to joint ventures. We have successfully partnered for every major project we have built, as we understand the need for the expertise of different stakeholders. We have also been able to apply the lessons of every project on to the next one.</p><h4>What are some of SEMAICA's main plans and projects for 2020?</h4><p>For 2020, we are looking to further expand regionally with two projects in Peru and growing our office in Bolivia. Historically, we have had great success working abroad, and we are confident it will both diversify our operations by hedging our risks whilst also better positioning our brand internationally and give us a better chance to become the preferred partner of choice for major foreign groups in future projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With more than 102 years of experience, how do you evaluate the company's main accomplishments so far? And how do you plan to keep innovating in the centrifugal technology?  </h4><p>Western States' main accomplishment is the installation, upkeep and product development of over 6,000 centrifuges worldwide.  Though not all machines are still operating today for various reasons, Western States has long been a proponent to never obsolete a machine and is committed to providing service and support to each machine in operation today. Western States continues to innovate our centrifuges to provide the most technologically advanced machines with the greatest separation and throughput capabilities to produce the highest quality product— no matter the industry. </p><h4>Which are your main countries of operations and where are you expecting to expand them? What's potential does Western States see in the Latin America Cannabis Industry?    </h4><p>The United States is our main country of operations for sugar, chemical, pharmaceutical, and cannabis Industry. However, we have a strong position with more than 6,000 centrifuges installed across North America, South and Central America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Our established presence in Latin America for Western States keeps us poised and ready to provide centrifuges for the cannabis industry in those country. There is a huge potential for companies to benefit from Western States in the Cannabis Industry in Latin America as we provide quality centrifuges to meet the high demand of separation needs because of our presence and experience in those countries for other industries. </p><h4>How are you making sure to provide the best part, rebuilds and upgrade services for cannabis centrifuge system? What is further down the road in terms of services? </h4><p>Western States is committed to providing only original high-quality parts and the best solution for rebuilds and modernizations of all our centrifuges.  We have a 24-hour emergency hotline for parts and service to support our customers. The ability to stock parts on site gives us the opportunity to provide immediate shipment and our already established international logistics department is knowledgeable in customs procedures and document preparation to get our parts anywhere in the world. Furthermore, we have dedicated service engineers trained in both mechanical and electrical problem-solving who are available for factory visits and inspections in as little as 24 hours.</p><h4>How have innovation and the investment in R&amp;D been strategic to stay up to date in the industries you serve? </h4><p>Innovation is fundamental for Western States. Our skilled engineers continually strive to improve our products based on customer expectations and needs. With technology evolving every day, our centrifuges are designed to provide maximum performance and maximum reliability while incorporating new programming, monitoring capabilities, and safety features. Western States is committed to testing different solutions for new projects and has a partnership with leading engineering company in the cannabis space.</p><h4>What is the impact that the growth of the medical cannabis business in America will generate for the commercialization of your products and services? </h4><p>Though centrifuge separation and extraction has been around for over a hundred years, it is a newer endeavor in the cannabis extraction industry.  As companies are looking to find solutions to meet a high production demand with the most recovered oils and liquids, they will be looking for an expert in the field.   This industry has given Western States the opportunity to examine how our centrifuges handle Biomass Materials and have allowed us to enhance our already effective designs even further to meet this specific plant material.</p><h4>How does Western States centrifuge technology generate added value to the medical cannabis industry? What's Western States' competitive edge?</h4><p>Well-known for high-quality centrifuges, Western States' industrial centrifuges are essential to extract all oils and dry biomass. When centrifuges are operated as a filtering, they can remove most if not all the unbound moisture without the need for thermal processing to deliver a cost-effective and dependable method of separating solids and liquids for medium to full scale production.  </p><h4>What potential do you see in complementary cannabis sub-markets such as cannabis infused beverages, hemp-based Oils, cosmetic products or other?</h4><p>As the world becomes more receptive to the potentials for cannabinoids and their benefits to the Endocannabinoid System in humans and in animals, the sub-markets to the cannabis industry are set to explode!  CBD and hemp-based products have been shown to reduce a wide-range of ailments from stress related anxiety all the way to relieving epileptic episodes. People are interested in learning the long-term effects of ingesting CBD through various methods—be it tinctures, edibles, and oils.  The more high-quality products available to the consumer—the better for the industry to receive approval and acceptance.  Getting these products produced safely and legally is paramount to the success of the cannabis industry.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Western States in the 2020?</h4><p>Western States continues to advance and to innovate centrifugal technology with state-of-the-art engineering and design as it expands its footprint into the cannabis industry. Along with our foundational principles established in 1917—distinguished service, unprecedented quality, and cultivating relationships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have created an initiative to formalize illegal small-scale miners in Colombia. Can you tell us a more about it? </h4><p>The only successful initiative in Colombia for formalizing small or illegal miners is that of Gran Colombia Gold. We have 46 cooperatives for miners producing and complying with security, safety, and environmental aspects. We support them from a technical point of view, they serve us the material they produce, and we remunerate them according to international standards.</p><h4>How have you managed in others way to have a positive impact on those communities? </h4><p>We have a scholarship in place; the school is bilingual, and we meet the expenses (salary, house, food and transportation) of volunteer teachers. Currently, we have 475 students in primary school and are shortly set to open a secondary school.</p><h4>The company is also trying to reduce the use of mercury, correct?</h4><p>That was a problem arising from illegal mining, where the output was sold to small processing facilities. We use mercury to amalgamate the gold. In other cases, we buy material for the processing facility that does not use mercury. Nowadays, we are building a plant to recover zinc and lead to sell. Our is, therefore, a combination of an environmental project and a profitable one.</p><h4>The company is still the largest producer of gold and silver in Colombia. What has been the strategy in the market?</h4><p>This company was once on the verge of bankruptcy and the key to success has been its people. A company is its people, which is why we give our people the best benefits according to international standards. Second, we have financial discipline and, third, we comply to obtain all environmental and social licensing or permits.</p><h4>You broke your gold production record last year. Could you please explain how you achieved this?</h4><p>The company has been growing at a rate of 20% per year since 2014. Our production in 2014 was 90,000 ounces of gold between Segovia and Marmato and in 2019 was 240,000 ounces. Financial discipline has been a key issue, but our people are a key element in our success, as is the technology we utilize and our work with the local community. When we arrived in the territory, we grasped the situation of illegal mining and determined to work with those engaged in it. The initiative was created, and to date, we have signed with 44 mining units, and have a small mining team in place dedicated to them. Other initiatives have to do with the issue of education, which is basic for development, and that is where our scholarships come into play. We also have a training program for women to integrate them into the economy. Women that are heads of households who, if they don't have a husband, have no way to support their children. For example, our security team is mostly made up of women, single mothers, for example. We have an alliance with The National Training Service (SENA) that helps us to provide proper training. We are also building a school with them and investing in other such initiatives.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020? </h4><p>The main goal in Segovia concerns drilling and infrastructure, since we are expecting to find and extract. In Marmato, we are expecting to finalize it mid-2020 and then we have to start building the new mine. We expect by the end of 2022 to have the first bar of gold.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Upon its 75th anniversary in 2020, what are Wema Bank's core strengths which have led the firm to its success in the market today?</h4><p>Our core strategy has been agility. We are constantly evolving to meet the changing business and economic landscape. This has allowed us to remain resilient and relevant even during extremely bearish phases of our market. It is agility that led us to switch to a regional banking model when it suited the business. This relieved us of some operating pressures and allowed the bank to stabilize. The same spirit of agility led one of the oldest banks in the country to emerge as leader in the digital space with the creation of ALAT, the first of its kind in the industry. We are constantly reviewing and refining our business and operating models to ensure that we are properly positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in our rapidly changing industry.</p><h4>What market opportunities drew ALAT into existence, and what strategies were implemented to set the product in motion?</h4><p>The growth opportunities in the Nigerian market at the time were clearly in the retail segment with increasing saturation in the corporate and commercial segments making them a red ocean. Retail is also a segment that is best served digitally to reduce costs and align with shifting consumer behavior driven by the mobile revolution evidenced by increasing device and data penetration and digital disruption. Our demography is also largely youthful and as our engagements at the time revealed, were not interested in the traditional financial services model that was built around the bank branch. It was clear to us that to deliver an experience that was a radical departure from what obtained in the market, we had to leverage a different structure from our traditional bank. So we created a separate, stand-alone digital bank, with its own operating model — different people, processes and (to a large extent) technology. This allowed for the kind of focus, speed and agility required to birth ALAT.</p><h4>How does ALAT leverage the country's fintech industry further?</h4><p>Following the success of ALAT, the bank took a decision to embed innovation in its DNA to guarantee a sustainable pipeline of innovation. We also witnessed the rising influx of FinTechs and other Technology Startups across other sectors of the economy and the disruptive value they were adding. So, the bank set up an internal innovation team, and one of their primary objectives was to establish business and technical relationships with FinTechs and other Technology Startups. This led to Hackaholics, our first ever hackathon event that saw hundreds of these FinTechs sign up to partner with the bank to co-create the next wave of innovative ideas. We eventually shortlisted to about 20 teams and after intense engagements a winner was selected. After Hackaholics, some of the most promising ideas were selected to participate in a bootcamp to further incubate/accelerate those ideas. We're about to hit the market with a few exciting ones. Watch this space. We're also advocates of the API economy. It is no longer feasible to expect to create all your technology capabilities internally, so we're taking the open, collaborative approach. Through partnerships, we are mutually extending capacity to offer services through open APIs.</p><h4>What strategies are you undertaking to maintain your original clientele while attracting a younger customer base?</h4><p>Quite the contrary, we do not view this as a challenge, but instead as an opportunity. All technology will go through different phases and will follow the normal distribution of the adoption curve. The youth population happen to be the enthusiasts and early adopters, while the older ones are usually late adopters or laggards. This is to be expected. The engagement framework for each sub-segment of the adoption model is where the hard work lies. Enthusiasts and early adopters will be drawn by the technology for the sake of it. To attract and retain them, all you need is novelty and innovation. The late adopters, however, will be attracted and retained by utility and quality of experience. You need to engage them, educate them, making abundantly clear what your value proposition is and how it impacts their lives. Laggards will only follow, after your innovation has become mainstream and they are constrained by available options in the market. We realize that our customer base is split along all these lines and we are not using a one-size-fits all approach for engagement. From product design, to marketing communications, to support, we ensure that we have a very clear view of the customer we're solving for. And as time progresses, we will see a gradual shift of customers across all the various buckets.</p><h4>How does the surge of mobile transfers improve financial inclusion, and allow products and services to be more accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses?</h4><p>The numbers clearly show that more and more people are adopting mobile transfers. It also stands to reason that more financially excluded people will have access. This will be driven by a number of factors. At the lower end of the market, in addition to the agent-led distribution model, the primary driver will be USD-based transactions that will allow customers with low/no data or feature phones to transact seamlessly. Today, a number of banks allow a customer to open a low tier account/wallet, fund and transact, all on USD. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for the financially excluded. At the other end, falling prices of smart devices and data subscriptions will also enable more and more people even at the mid-lower mass market to perform transactions on their mobile phones. With this increase in accessibility, we will witness the continued growth in the volume and value of mobile transfers across the country.</p><h4>Will the proliferation of mobile transfers contribute to a reduction of bank charges for electronic transfers? In what other way can this increase be leveraged?</h4><p>Beyond even this observed trend, the Central Bank also released revised tariffs that materially impacted bank charges on transfers. Also, across the industry, we are now witnessing some banks using low/no charge transactions as a value proposition. Ultimately, this will help further drive adoption, particularly at the lower end of the market. It also means that older transaction artefacts such as cheques are on the way out and will be completely phased out in the next few years. This also puts the onus on banks to ensure stability and reliability of their platforms in order to provide customers a delightful experience, and maximize revenue growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Globally, the continued pace of protectionism will dampen overall trade as major trade blocs increasingly impose tariffs on one another. The ongoing U.S.-China trade war while pulling back from the brink recently by stopping short of imposing the 3rd round of sanctions is still affecting global trade. For the local economy, the outlook is slightly worse than at the start of the year. Though most analysts had predicted a slow growth environment, this has now been further exacerbated by the public health issues in China with the Coronavirus epidemic. As one of our primary trade partners, the expected slow down in trade volumes will have considerable effect on the economy. Specifically, for the banking industry, we expect to see revenue pressure with the income lines shrinking as a result of the new tariff regime. However, one area of opportunity is in the consumer loans space. Although this is already proving to be a red ocean with nearly all the banks looking to play in this space, and an onslaught of competition from the FinTechs focused on this area. We also see the continued rise of the cost of compliance as we try to navigate a complex business and regulatory landscape. In addition to reduced tariffs, the industry in line with the Loan-to-Deposit (LDR) policy will be looking to grow their loans aggressively. All these in addition to the various ratios and reserves that we pay attention to. We will continue on our digital journey keeping an eye on how this translates to cost efficiency and ultimately our bottom line. It is also clear that business model innovation is now imperative. New ways of creating value and unlocking revenue generation potentials have become critical to the continued growth of our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[vicente-izquierdo-aguilera-founder-president-inmaia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has INMAIA evolved as demand for balsa increases following new uses for this wood?</h4><p>INMAIA is a wood company located in the center of Ecuador, and most of its production is destined for balsa wood products. Balsa wood is now considered a high-quality product. It originally served as a transportation vehicle in rivers to transport bananas and other products from the central region to the ports. Before colonial times, Ecuadorian indigenous communities used it as transport to trade products into Mexico. The French came to Ecuador and discovered that balsa wood was a light product, and then they innovated it and used it for navy ships. Balsa wood was used in World War II both for ships and planes. Currently, the product undergoes several processes, and, thanks to the use of genetically improved seeds and our unique climate conditions, Ecuador's balsa is considered the best in the world, and it is the top producer of balsa wood globally. The largest consumer of balsa wood is China, where it is being used to build windmills for wind parks in China. Today, balsa wood is also used in fast trains floors, transportation, air transport containers, in the military industry, as well as wall panels in recording studios and more. It can also be mixed with other strong materials such as aluminum. It has low thermal conductivity, low density, and high resistance to compression, flexion, and traction. The country aims to continue being the top producer, and we need investors that want to develop other lines of business out of balsa wood.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your corporate social responsibility practices, especially those related to the environment?</h4><p>Since it was founded, INMAIA has used a species of trees that can be re-planted. We are a company that is respectful toward the environment. We are always carrying out campaigns to protect the environment. In 2017, we planted 20,000 fruit trees around Quevedo and taught children and young people to look after the environment. We consider our corporate image related to taking care of the environment. We are always looking for new initiatives. It is not only the responsibility of the local and national government; it is everyone's social responsibility, including companies. The product guarantees the sustainability of the industry, and INMAIA is fully aware of that. We promote reforestation as one of the most efficient mechanisms to capture CO2. Reforestation can capture 10 tons of CO2 per year on average, if we plant 1 million trees per year. INMAIA planted 1.05 million trees in 2019 alone.</p><h4>How are your investments meeting increasing international demand?</h4><p>Currently, we have a project to increase 30% of our production in 2020 due to demand, which means we have to go from 30 containers per month to 40-50. We will create new jobs, and it will entail a larger investment. It is important that demand increases every year, and the more we plant, the more we produce. We will additionally have doubled our positive impact on the environment, because while balsa is growing, it captures CO2, improves the condition of the soil, and increases collection of water by aquifers. Its large timber surface attracts rain, and as it filters, it produces aquifers that can be later used for water in agriculture and other purposes. As per the balsa industry in Ecuador, we are an important part of the productive sector, and we want our country to continue on the path of the current government. The country has great conditions for the agricultural sector. Our country is privileged because it has a relatively small territory with diverse and fertile terrains that start at the ocean, go through the mountains, and end up down at the Amazon jungle. We hope the country keeps growing, and we have open arms for investors who have adequate technology to improve the quality of life.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has the company evolved since its founding? <br></strong>The presence of ABB in Spain well reflects how the industry has evolved. ABB began its activity in Spain more than 100 years ago, with technologies that helped in the development of electrification. Since then, we have also accompanied industries that as large consumers of energy also needed these technologies, albeit having automated different processes to make them more efficient. We are currently undergoing two major revolutions that affect these two areas: the energy revolution and the fourth industrial revolution. At ABB, we are still pioneers in responding with our technologies to the challenges that both revolutions bring in utilities, production, infrastructure, and transport. In transportation, although ABB does not manufacture vehicles, its technologies are behind most of the means by which we move or transport goods, and we are leading the international evolution toward more sustainable transportation models. We are the world leader in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, in addition to the railway sector, with technologies for both railway infrastructures and rolling stock (equipment for trains). We are also pioneers in ultra-fast charging technology for electric buses and are currently leading in developing technologies for autonomous vessel navigation. Another segment in which we are at the forefront in Spain are automation technologies, such as home automation equipment like our brand Niessen, which started working more than 100 years ago, in 1914, in Renterí­a, and whose factory is in Oiartzun. We are also pioneers in solar energy in Spain, collaborating in the first developments of the Plataforma Solar de Almerí­a in the 80s, and now remotely managing the automation technologies of more than 400MW of solar thermal plants in Spain. Nowadays, we are still leaders in solar energy and large-scale PV solar plants, where we deliver the complete electric balance of plant, as well as the systems needed to integrate this energy to the grid in a reliable and efficient way.</p><p><strong>How can your products increase companies' productivity?<br></strong>Trends such as automation or the increase in the adoption of industrial robotics are based on a greater demand for flexibility, agility, and productivity of production processes to be more competitive and maintaining the same or better levels of quality and safety. An example of this greater productivity and efficiency that we talk about can be found in how we manage energy consumption within industries. For example, being aware that 60% of energy in industry is consumed by electric motors, we can make decisions about what type of motors to install in production processes and how to accompany them with systems such as drives, which can achieve savings up to 40% of energy consumption in certain infrastructures or processes. This not only benefits the owners of these industries, improving their cost competitiveness, but also has great environmental benefits, reducing the amount of emissions. ABB is also one of the few companies in the world whose portfolio and technical and market expertise close the circle of productivity and efficiency, from collecting and analyzing data to implementing solutions with the best equipment.</p><p><strong>What role does innovation and R&amp;D have for ABB?<br></strong>We have been innovating for more than 130 years, so it is part of our DNA. Nowadays, we are aware that the innovation paradigm has dramatically changed, and no one in this age can successfully innovate on their own in the industrial world. Therefore, we have started relevant partnerships with companies such as IBM, HPE, and Microsoft. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the origin and evolution of the company over six year ago and what are its chief activities?<br></strong>Aldro Energí­a is a energy retailer and service provider that was born five years ago within the PITMA Group, led by Alfredo Pérez y Pedro Ortiz. PITMA was founded 25 years ago and today operates principally in five business areas: telecommunications, security, energy, commercial services, and a wide range of business services, ranging from the documentary custody to the management of urban mobility or insurance. Aldro Energí­a was born to bring to life ideas within the group, such as assembling the technical part of a marketer to give continuity to what we had started. The first electricity sale was done in 2014, and in 2015, we started with retail gas. In 2016, the company stabilized, and we launched the energy efficiency line. In 2017, we had a plan to enter Portugal, so we started to process permits. The business in Portugal exploded in 2018, while the business in Spain is also doing well.</p><p><strong>In six years, the company has achieved almost 200,000 customers and billed EUR600 million in 2019. What is your winning strategy?</strong><br>We have a good price on the market, we are transparent, and we are close to our customers; in addition, we are also adaptable. Adaptability is one of our strong points. Aldro Energí­a is not a company assembled by electricians, economists, or engineers; it is a marketer assembled by sellers to sell. The DNA of PITMA is in Aldro Energí­a, bringing us closer to the customer and making us attentive to building what the client needs at any time. We adapt to the needs of users.</p><p><strong>Aldro Energí­a focus on domestic clients but SMEs take a strong part of your portfolio. From which sectors do your clients come from?</strong><br>Half of our contracts are from households, and half are with SMEs. However, the more intensive load curves and greater powers are installed in SMEs and large companies, and they therefore represent a bigger part of our income. We cover the entire world of gas and electricity consumers, from the small consumer who has a domestic contract to public administrations or large companies that choose much more complex products.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations from the new government and the public sector?<br></strong>We would like the new government's policies to be developed in an environment of total agreement to provide stability beyond legislature. The energy transition should be driven by a breakthrough in technology that makes it possible to reduce the cost of emission-free energies, give consumers an increasingly active role, and ensures competition in the market, which will result in more competitive prices for consumers. We would like to propose that the government establish a maximum period for consumer complaints to be resolved, forcing both marketers and distributors to create a centralized information platform that is not managed by traditional power companies, like other countries around us are doing; enable the orderly deployment of smart meters for SMEs and businesses so that these customers can have more accurate information on their consumption; and promote self-consumption and distributed management by regulating the figure of the demand aggregator.</p><p><strong>What are the main highlights of Aldro Zero, and what are its expectations for the year ahead?<br></strong>Aldro Zero represents the firm commitment of PITMA Group toward renewable energy. It is intended to be the future platform for all final customer green energy developments, including renewable energy retailing as well as self-production facilities, energy efficiency, and other services. 2020 will be the year of its implementation in the market, and we have big expectations about how it will develop. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Elecnor was founded in 1958. How has the company developed since then? <br></strong>Elecnor has transformed significantly over the years, venturing into sectors such as energy infrastructure, renewable energy, and new technologies. The company has also expanded its international presence over the years and is a listed company on the Spanish stock market. In 2018, Spain made up approximately 45% of our turnover, with the rest coming from international markets. At this time, we have a presence in 55 countries, while the order book also shows the relevance of international business for us. In 1H2019, 78% of orders came from non-domestic markets, meaning the backlog of our international portfolio was more than EUR1.7 billion in this period.</p><p><strong>In 2018, you reported almost EUR74.3 million in net profits. What is your strategy to grow further?<br></strong>We have two areas that complement and strengthen each other. First, Elecnor has evolved into a world leader with the capacity and determination to develop, create, and operate energy infrastructures, as well as becoming a leading provider of specialized industrial engineering services. We have a strong culture of service that serves to build strong, trusting relationships with our long-term customers. The second part is our concession business in the renewable and transmission lines sectors. Our first subsidiary was launched in Venezuela back in the 1960s. We lead international expansion and have decades of experience in America and Africa. As a result, we have a deep knowledge and experience of the countries we work in. Elecnor will keep opening new markets, always driven by prudence. In this sense, it is crucial to analyze all the details of a potential new market, as well as study the competitive environment and evaluate our strengths over competitors. In keeping with this strategy, profits have registered increases of around 4% per year for the last three years. Thus, in 2016 net profit was EUR68.5 million, in 2017 EUR71.2 million, and 2018 EUR74.3 million. In the first six months of 2019, net profits increased by 5% on the same period YoY.</p><p><strong>Do you work with local partners in countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico? <br></strong>Consolidating and positioning the company in these markets has taken many years of work, and involved collaborating with and learning from local private- and public-sector partners. We enter a country alone or by forming temporary unions. Depending on the potential of the country, and whether there are real possibilities of long-term success, we establish a branch or a subsidiary. The three countries that you mentioned are an example of this. We have been working there consistently for several decades. Thanks to our solid 35-year history in the country, Brazil is the second-most important market for Elecnor after Spain. Notable projects include the wind farm in Rio Grande do Sul, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, and building more than 8,000km of power transmission lines. Elecnor first began operations in Chile in the 1980s. By 1994 we had already overcome a great challenge: building two hydroelectric power plants on the River Duqueco. Elecnor now plays a crucial role in energy development in the country, in terms of transmitting power, developing non-conventional renewable energy, and ensuring efficient energy use in installations. Mexico is also a key market for us and the result of an extensive 25-year history in the country, evidenced by remarkable projects such as the construction of 65 electrical substations with a total of 7,000MVA of installed power, in addition to the laying of 1,100km of transmission lines and 255km of optical fiber, without forgetting our EPCs in combined cycle plants.</p><p><strong>How much is the company focusing on Latin America?<br></strong>The Latin American market was our first international one, but Elecnor is a global company and we are present in all five continents. In the Americas, we are also working in countries as competitive as the US and Canada, while we also have a stable presence in Africa, particularly in key markets such as Cameroon, Angola, and Ghana. We also work in Middle Eastern countries such as Oman and Jordan. Australia is as an interesting market where we have also undertaken some ambitious wind and solar projects. I would also like to highlight the international expansion we have achieved in Europe, where we have won unique projects over large local companies in the UK, Italy, Portugal, and<br>Norway. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>EDPR opened its first plant in Spain in 1997. How would you describe the evolution of EDP Renewables?<br></strong>EDPR in Spain has grown over the last 20 years. It is one of our home markets and the second biggest in terms of installed capacity with a total of 2,312MW. More specifically, we operate wind farms in Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, the Canary Islands, Castile-La Mancha, Castile, León, Catalonia, and Galicia. We have more than 400 employees in the country based in our wind farms and headquarters in Madrid.</p><p><strong>EDPR is one of the main players in the wind energy production sector, reporting 14% growth in 2018. How does EDPR sustain this growth?</strong><br>Our growth reinforces the conviction that our business plan is sound, and that we need to continue on the same path. Indeed, our growth is sustained by the pillars on which we base our strategy. First, we invest in markets with potential, regulatory transparency, and legal certainty. Second, we seek out opportunities, branch out into new markets, and consolidate our growth in markets where we already operate. Finally, our commitment to innovation has allowed us to diversify our business' technology mix. At present, our business is bolstered by three main types of technology: onshore wind farms, offshore wind farms, and photovoltaic solar installations. Nevertheless, this is consolidated by other technological innovations such as the renewable energy storage models. We also recently opened a plant in Romania. Another innovation is the hybrid system like the one we piloted in Cadiz, which sought synergies between an onshore wind farm and a photovoltaic solar power facility.</p><p><strong>EDPR is now present in 14 markets following the recent launch in Colombia, its third market in Latin America. How important is Latin America for EDPR?</strong><br>We constantly study possibilities to enter new markets, which has enabled us to position ourselves in 14 countries across three continents, generating electricity in 11 of them. In this regard, branching out into the Colombian market was a milestone that was made possible after winning a 20-year electricity auction. The concession from the Colombian government was for two onshore wind energy projects, Alpha for 212MW and Beta for 280MW. We are currently working on both, and they are expected to commence commercial operations by 2022. These Colombian projects will be in addition to the 467MW of installed capacity that we already have in Brazil and the 200MW in Mexico and will highlight the importance of the Latin American market in our business plan. EDPR will also continue investing in markets with regulatory stability and solid growth opportunities. Several countries in Latin America meet these criteria.</p><p><strong>EDPR recently signed an asset rotation agreement for wind farms in Europe. What role do such partnerships play for EDPR and the sector?</strong><br>EDP Renewables has reached an agreement with institutional investors advised by JP Morgan Asset Management to sell all its shares and outstanding equity loans in an operating portfolio of onshore wind energy with an installed capacity of 997MW for EUR800 million. This agreement is part of our asset rotation program for 2019-2022. In this context, we will sell our majority stakes in projects that are in operation or under development, while we continue to provide operating and maintenance services. This will help EDPR boost value generation and secure immediate profits to reinvest in the company's gradual growth.</p><p><strong>EDPR was named Spain's best employer in 2019. What does this mean for EDPR given that employee retention is one of the biggest challenges for companies?</strong><br>We were named best employer in 2019 in Europe overall as well as in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and the UK. This would not have been possible without our human resource policies, since EDPR aims to support employees at every stage of their development within the company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the motivations behind the founding of association? <br></strong>The birth of APPA Renovables was based on the union that existed between different mini-hydraulic producers in the area of Catalonia. Renewable energies were set to develop because Spain had an opportunity in that field, considering its energy dependency and existing resources. The growth has been gradual, and since the country is rich in renewable resources and previously had a great dependence on fossil fuels, it was considered opportune to bet on renewable energies. We know that fossil resources are exhaustible, unlike natural recourses. Spain is a country with a high dependency on fossil fuels: Europe has a dependency of 50%, while Spain is at 75%. This is an opportunity to develop policies that stop the exit of hard currency due to this dependency.</p><p><strong>Will the transition to renewable energies dissipate that dependence and create a more stable energy market?<br></strong>Of course, it is an opportunity. The issue is that energy dependence leads to the outflow of foreign currency in a country that mostly earns revenues from tourism. Resources can be provided to avoid this outflow and consequently the exit of jobs. If we start from our strengths in energy resources and technology, the possibility of development is great.</p><p><strong>What kind of companies are associated with APPA, and what advantages does it offer?<br></strong>Wind energy is the source that has generated most development When the first wind energy promoters started installing parks in 1998, the quotas, deadlines, and prices were rational. We did not make the mistake of doing everything in one year: from 1998 to 2018, Spain has developed 23,000MW of power. At present, wind energy accounts for 20-40% of electricity supply of renewable energy. Years later, photovoltaic energy entered the market. There was a hasty development of photovoltaic because quotas, prices, and developments were not adequate, and those mistakes turned out to be expensive. We have 4,000MW of solar PV but with inadequate prices. If we talk about installed power, installing 1MW of electricity cost EUR6 million in 2007, whereas today it costs EUR600,000. Biomass is another technology that has worked. In addition to biomass companies, there are marine wind and geothermal companies within APPA. </p><p><strong>How can you help developed and developing companies?<br></strong>Within the association, multinational and small companies coexist, so we have expertise in all the different development grades of the companies. Also, as the different technologies have evolved, specific associations of the different technologies have been born, and we work closely with all of them. As partners, APPA has multinationals or mid-level developers with 300MW of installed capacity, as well as small individual promoters who may have a specific wind or hydraulic installation. It is clear that some technologies, such as wind and photovoltaic, have greater competitiveness, but there are others that still need support because they are in the growth stage. They may need an appreciation of the kW price or an analysis of their contributions. Biomass is a technology that creates a lot of employment for its management, in addition to helping clean forests. We won't be doing it justice by focusing on the price of 1kW alone, rather than considering all other factors. Then, there is CSP, which is currently experiencing lower costs and providing support to storage facilities. The complementarity between renewable energies demands that they not be seen in isolation in terms of price or competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[3.5% Growth in Global Islamic Finance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-adnan-chilwan-group-chief-executive-officer-dubai-islamic-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai's prominence as Islamic finance hub: In our conversation with DIEDC, we talked a bit about a paradigm shift whereby the direction of knowledge transfer has shifted and others are looking to Dubai as the standard.  How do you asses so far Dubai's ability to establish itself as a model for Islamic finance and its strengths? </h4><p>Islamic finance has made an enormous impact on the global finance industry, with more and more banks establishing Islamic finance operations. According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2019/2020, Global Islamic Finance assets have grown 3.5% year-on-year, exceeding USD2.5 trillion assets in the Global Islamic finance industry and are projected to reach USD3.8 trillion by 2023. There is no doubt that Dubai has played a significant role in this strong growth trajectory as the emirates aims to become the global capital of Islamic economy. The wise leadership of the UAE have simultaneously ensured a strong business environment that is conducive to innovation, growth and transformation within the profession. Today, Dubai is widely regarded as the epicenter of Islamic finance between east and west and has established itself as a model not only for the industry but also the wider global Islamic economy, which includes key pillars such as halal food, travel, tourism, entertainment, art and culture. It is also no coincidence that Dubai is the birthplace of Dubai Islamic Bank; the world's first Islamic bank. Notably, the Emirate is also one of the world's largest venues for Sukuk listings - and a number of diverse issuances that meet Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria have been made this year, a further evidence of the sustainability of the business model that Dubai is showcasing to the world</p><h4>Market trends: fintech &amp; innovation: A recent report from S&amp;P Global identified technology and fintech as one of the key accelerators for Islamic finance. Can you elaborate on Dubai Islamic Bank's progress in integrating and developing fintech and other innovative solutions? </h4><p>The global fintech market continues to grow, now valued in excess of $150 million and expected to triple in the coming five years to exceed USD150 billion. At DIB, we have always believed that continuous innovation is vital to our growth strategy. We have always championed innovation in order to remain the most progressive financial institution in the world, a key part of our vision and successful business strategy. Our primary approach to digital banking is always formulated with a clear focus on dissecting each step of the customer journey and removing any pain points for the customer. Notable examples include the creation of paperless branches and our state-of-the-art Mobile Banking App. More recently, we launched 'Banking in Minutes' - making us the first to own the element of “time" in the industry. Now UAE nationals and residents that were previously not DIB customers can open a bank account anytime anywhere, within a few minutes via the powerful DIB Mobile App — eliminating the need for them to visit a branch or complete copious amounts of paperwork. Going forward, the emergence of technology, robotics and artificial intelligence will all assist in providing opportunities for clients to experience ultimate banking. We continue to utilize and transform fintech to improve our internal processes, thereby enabling our customers to manage their finances more effectively.</p><h4>Recent company developments: As Dubai's, and the country's, largest Islamic bank, what other recent company developments would you like to highlight?  </h4><p>We have reported strong Financial Results over the years, with Net-Profit crossing AED 4.0 billion, up by 8% year-on-year in 2019 so far. If we look at the last 5 years, DIB has transformed into a regional financial powerhouse on the back of successful growth strategy which has seen our balance sheet double in size, and profitability more than quadruple. This has placed the bank among the top two Islamic banks in the world, and the top 3 most profitable banks in the UAE. We have also grown our international presence, becoming a torchbearer in promoting Sharia-compliant financial services across number of markets worldwide. Our international expansion is focused primarily on the “PIK" region comprising of Pakistan, Indonesia and Kenya, allowing us to connect the dots from Far East to South Asia via the Middle East to Africa. Our operations in Kenya will serve as a stepping stone to tap into the growing market in Eastern Africa. Simultaneously, the rebranded Panin Dubai Syariah Bank in Indonesia is set to serve a thriving population of 200 million, 95% of whom are Muslims. DIB has also prepared to position itself as one of the largest Islamic Banks in the world through the acquisition of Noor Bank in 4Q2019. The acquisition is set to strengthen Dubai's position as a global center of Islamic Finance by creating the region's most progressive Shari'a banking group.</p><h4>Strategic priorities: What are your strategic priorities and vision for Dubai Islamic Bank as we look beyond 2020 and at the next decade? </h4><p>Our core mission is to make Islamic Finance the norm for everyone. We believe the model offers value to all customers irrespective of beliefs. As we expand our legacy throughout the region, we see significant opportunity in educating different markets on the advantage that Islamic Finance can offer. We are also cognizant of the fact that the banking profession is going through major transformation. At DIB, we know that continuous innovation is essential for growth and sustainability.

		<title><![CDATA[Over 600,000 passengers in 2019]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ado-sanusi-managing-director-ceo-aero-contractors]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of Aero Contractors?</h4><p>We have stabilized the business at this moment, and we are on our way toward recovery. Our revenue post-liquidation has risen almost 200%, and we have also seen a steady increase in passenger numbers, reaching over 600,000 in 2019. We also have stabilized our aircraft numbers; we are steady on the fixed wing, with four aircrafts in operation, and in the rotary wing, with four aircraft operating at the same time. With rotary wing, we are in the process of establishing ourselves back where we belong: as the first name in oil and gas logistics support. We will shortly reposition ourselves and reinvest as the number-one in logistics support to oil and gas companies.</p><h4>What strategies have you implemented for success, especially in the rotary wing division?</h4><p>The business model we are currently looking at is a sustainable model that does not depend on oil prices. We have a stable logistics company that maintains particular fleet and is efficient, but it is not dependent on barrel prices being USD50 or USD40. It is a business model where we look at our client's specific requirements. Whatever happens, we are going to give them the support they need. If there is an increase, we are, of course, flexible enough to increase our capacity but we will do so in a controlled manner. The moment we see the oil prices rising exponentially, we will not start buying equipment. Instead, we will advise rig operators if they need extra flights, which we can carry out without investing too much in the equipment due to our efficiency. We want to have a lean business.</p><h4>How do multinational airlines coming to Nigeria impact the aerospace sector and the positioning of local airlines operating in the market?</h4><p>The foreign legacy carriers coming into the country affects the growth of domestic carriers. If you give an international or legacy carrier multiple entry points into your country, you diminish the growth of the domestic carrier. Of course, you are also giving passengers the choice of flying out of more airports but at the detriment of your own aviation sector growth. If you decide to give limited access to entry points, you grow your own aviation sector.  We must sacrifice little things, such as the comfort of flying domestic to reach international destinations, and have international carriers sign agreements to act as feeders with domestic carriers. Any country must protect growing industries to ensure they mature first before they have to fend for themselves in hostile markets.</p><h4>What is your viewpoint on how the government is addressing the issues currently in the sector?</h4><p>The current government is addressing the issue of infrastructure extremely well and have done a great job in upgrading most of the airports. We have even seen critical changes like runway resurfacing, navigational aids, and the upgrading of terminal buildings. However, the truth of the matter is that we are not yet where we are supposed to be, but we are going toward the right direction. Nigeria is a country of 200 million people. If we can target 10% of the whole population, that is 20 million. If we have 20 million people flying, then we need a formidable carrier in the country to cater to that hungry market. The government has done a fair amount to try and establish a national carrier, which is commendable as any country loves to have its own national carrier. The challenge in this country is most airlines do not survive a long time and usually get into problems after five to 10 years. We must address those issues and find out what is causing this abnormality to happen. We must stimulate the growth of the aviation industry and not allow it to organically grow by itself. Nigeria is placed strategically to be a hub, and Lagos Airport can support 15 to 20 million visitors annually. If we are able to stimulate that growth, all other sectors will fall into place. Aviation plays a major role in the economic development of any country.</p><h4>What is your opinion of budget airlines' role in Nigeria?</h4><p>We cannot bring mass transport to aviation as is being done for railways, ferries, and busses. We have not had one successful budget carrier in Africa. There are some that are trying to survive but the problem for Nigeria with low cost carriers is the kind of fundamental services needed for this type of business are not here. For example, the classification of the airports is a major cost benefit that is not here. If Lagos City Airport in Lekki catered only to domestic flights, then the cost of landing would be reduced, the cost of parking would be reduced. Furthermore, you would only need limited infrastructure at that airport. The airline would allow check-ins on phone, which would further reduce costs and result in a reduction in ticket prices. Another aspect is more cultural: In Nigerian culture, we always like to welcome our guest with water and food. So Nigerians expect to have a full complimentary services.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We will upgrade our hangar to a bigger space so we can have up to three or four bays. We also want to upgrade our training facility so that we can partner with a training organization either in Europe or the Middle East to provide training for pilots and engineers. The main thing we are currently looking at is fleet renewal. We have also signed a MoU with the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology in which they will be supplying young engineers to our maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities for on-the-job training. We will keep the best talent to replace our aging workforce. We are also in the process of automating our activities and have entered into an excellent software agreement from a developer specializing in MRO software called Ramco Aviation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important mandate areas of INAMI? </h4><p>INAMI was established in 2014 as a regulatory body with financial autonomy for the mining sector with the passing of a new law concerning mines. INAMI now manages all areas of the sector under the same roof, from exploration to licensing and governance —areas that were previously under the directive of different ministerial bodies. Since the start of activities, our main ongoing concern has been modernizing the mining licensing process through digitalization. By the end of 2019, we introduced the latest update to the system. The end goal is to improve interaction between all interested parties by transforming analog paperwork into a digitalized process. Our next step, to ensure cyber-security, will be to transfer all data onto a government-controlled cloud. Through our portal, all information regarding licensing has become visible to everyone anywhere in the world, ensuring the maximum level of efficiency. Another priority area of our mandate is geological research through publishing reliable geological information about the country and delivering it to the public. Since 2007, the government has embarked on a concerted effort to thoroughly map the whole country on a 1:250,000 scale; so far, INAMI has executed the airborne geophysical survey of 75% of the national territory. INAMI has also mapped in higher detail the mineral-rich provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado Tete, and Manica, on a 1:50,000 scale. In 2015, INAMI started mapping a 950,000-sqkm area between the provinces of Nampula and Zambezia potentially filled with mineral resources. In 2019, we started producing 25 maps of this area on 1:50,000 scale and five maps on 1:250,000 scale. We have already finished 10, and we expect the remaining 15 to be ready by 2021.</p><h4>What is Mozambique's record with transparency in the sector? </h4><p>Mozambique is making significant progress in transparency, and our online portal is an example of this process. We are walking towards the goal of being Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)-compliant by the agreed deadline. The biggest remaining challenge concerns deadlines for mining titles and licensing. The process is now fully in place, and companies operating in the field must be informed on ongoing procedures.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities in the mining sector? </h4><p>Mozambique is a rich country in terms of mineral resources, with countless opportunities for investment. We have mineral resources for energy production, coal, natural gas, and uranium. Beyond these, there are precious metals, gold, silver, iron, magnesium, chromium, titanium, copper, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and rare metals such as niobium. In 2016, we granted about 1,400 licenses; today, we have granted 2,000 licenses. Opportunities are growing, and so is the interest of international investors in the field.</p><h4>With Vale's operations currently scaled down, do you think the coal industry in Mozambique is eventually destined to phase out?</h4><p>I do not think so, as the prices of mineral resources are highly volatile and reflect shifts in demand. Despite a general decrease of the price of raw materials on the international market in the last couple years, the demand for coal is still high in countries with high energy demands, such as India. This has happened all the more so through the recent introduction of “clean coal“ on the market, a treated type of coal that pollutes very little. We might even see an increase in the demand in coal.</p><h4>What are INAMI's objectives for 2020?</h4><p>We are working alongside the National Institute of Statistics (INE) to establish a census of small-scale artisanal miners to understand where they are, who they are, and what they do. This is pivotal information we do not possess yet. We will also continue the process of geologically mapping the country; we want to finish five maps made on a 1:250,000 scale by the end of 2020. We will also follow up with companies in order to make sure processes and production starts within the established deadlines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[African Bank with Global Links]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rui-barros-ceo-absa-bank-mozambique]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the pillars of Absa's strategy in Mozambique?</h4><p>Absa Group is one of the larger financial institutions in the continent, where it operates under full banking licenses, insurance businesses, asset management, and investment banking services. The group's strategy is adapted to each country of operation, responding to local needs. Absa is the fourth-largest bank in Mozambique, with a 7% market share. Corporate and business banking—especially our premier and prestige offerings—have been the source of our success in the country. We pride ourselves on the relationship we have cultivated with the investors that have chosen us. The relationship banking type of client tends to be an affluent one who is tech savvy and insists on uninterrupted and direct access to their portfolio via multiple digital channels. Progressively, clients are preferring face-to-face relationships for advice, recommendations, and clarifications, while giving preference to digital channels for all transactional and information-gathering activities. Relationship quality and customer care are the cornerstone of our success. Broader retail banking is not a core market in Mozambique yet, though significant investment is being made in the retail business as we prepare for rapid growth in the years to come. At the end of the day, Absa is an African bank with links to the globe; our mission is to serve the growing needs of the African market and connect it to the world. Thus, delivering to a Mozambican mass consumer market will be undoubtedly a priority in the next future.</p><h4>How has the bank incorporated internet and the digital world in its offer in Mozambique?</h4><p>The digitalization of financial services will continue to be the main driver of our growth and expansion, while we promote the bancarization of the Mozambican population. We offer a full range of digital solutions from internet banking—differentiated for individuals, SMEs, and large corporates—to mobile banking for basic USSD and smartphones. However, we have also partnered with two of the larger telcoms in Mozambique to expand our own mobile money wallet offerings and link it with theirs, making the flows of funds seamless in these digital ecosystems.</p><h4>How did the recent mega-rebranding from Barclays to Absa in 2019 affect your image in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have received extremely positive reactions, and our market share has grown accordingly. This marks the beginning of a new chapter as we adopt our parent company's name and brand while retaining our unwavering commitment to Mozambique and our customers. The separation presents a strategic and operational opportunity to effect improvements, with the majority of technology infrastructure and systems being replaced and refreshed with transformational elements. The brand itself—the red logo and simple letters—has sent a positive image of Absa to the market as a bright, fresh, tech-savvy, and more African in a way. It appeals to a younger, tech-driven crowd and talks to a new generation of corporate. The brand is new, but it is just an element; the team is the same. Crucially, what has remained unchanged is our relationship with investors.</p><h4>What are the risks and opportunities in the Mozambican market?</h4><p>Clearly, Mozambique stands out for its tremendous economic and social growth opportunities driven by LNG projects. These will allow the private sector to leapfrog and gain scale. In addition, the value of gas revenues will represent a short-lived gain through capital gain taxes; it will be up to the government to reinvest this money in a way that can best target development goals. All these come with huge risks connected to redistribution of wealth and the “resource curse." However, politically neutral institutions such as the central bank, as well as donors such as Norway, have been centrally involved in the process of assisting the state designing a strategy for sustainable development, so I am confident Mozambique will not see the same scenario that has characterized other resource booms in African countries. More importantly, the shock of gas revenues will eventually slow down and turn into a more low-key, yet sustainable opportunity for development, with the creation of jobs, infrastructure, economic diversification, a domestic robust market, and greater social equality. I am excited to see how this will all look in 30 years. For this to happen, the country must take the right investment decisions now. We are already seeing huge investments in the economy. 2020 will be a year for foreign investors to be in Mozambique. From Absa's perspective, we are centrally committed to supporting the sustainable development of Mozambique, feeding the LNG projects as well as the whole supply chain. Through the years, the group has developed an ambitious growth strategy outside South Africa. We grow with the countries in which we operate. Clearly, Mozambique presents great growth opportunities, and we expect it to be one of the top three markets in corporate and investment banking for Absa Group.</p><h4>What opportunities will be opened through the agreement signed with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)?</h4><p>MIGA will issue guarantees of USD497 million to Absa. The guarantees are valid for 15 years and apply to Absa's subsidiaries in Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Uganda, and Zambia. This agreement is in fact another enabler of our growth, and other than the obvious balance sheet impact, it will add value in our corporate citizenship identity. Under this agreement, the bank will be able to increase sustainable financing for corporates and SMEs, as well as projects with climate benefits. The transaction also gives Absa Mozambique access to MIGA's expertise in applying global best practice social and environmentally responsible lending principles. It will also enhance the bank's offering to clients, as we are able to extend the global best practices and social and environmental expertise gained by MIGA to our clients, to aid them in their journey to have a positive environmental and social impact. In this respect, I want to also highlight the recent agreements with CDC—the impact investor vehicle for the UK government—to support mainly SME trade finance in the region, where again Mozambique will play a major role. CDC has committed financing of USD100 million in external trade through Absa Bank.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fredy-salazar-ceo-salazar-resources]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your personal experience been as part of Ecuador's mining sector?</h4><p>The mining industry in Ecuador took off in 1985, when large foreign corporations arrived and started exploratory works. One of the companies that arrived was Newmont, which provided jobs for many Ecuadorean engineers and geologists. These engineers and geologists went on to acquire years of invaluable training and experience. I was part of this first mining wave in the country. At the time, there was a transition from oil exploration to mining exploration. I was working in oil projects when the mining projects arrived. During this period, I learned about the technical side of the business. Later on, Newmont sent me to Mexico, Peru, and the US so that I could bring back the experience I accumulated to Ecuador. I previously worked on a project in the La Zarza region, which has great potential for exploration. The Fruta del Norte project, a gold reserve considered as one of the five main strategic mining projects for the country, is located in the La Zarza region.</p><h4>How is Salazar Resources currently involved in tapping Ecuador's mining potential?</h4><p>Being located in the Andean mountains, Ecuador has great geological potential. As a result, many large reserves are being discovered in Ecuador. The main challenges in Ecuador are social and environmental issues, which are the same as in the rest of the world. However, in Ecuador, mining companies still have to work to create a culture of responsibility that can be filtered down across society, focusing on the fact that responsible mining with international standards can work to the benefit of the country, the same way it works in neighboring countries. In this context, Salazar Resources started its own projects in Ecuador, financed largely by international investors through a listing on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2007. We made a new deposit discovery in Curipamba and continued exploration there for several years. We also signed joint venture agreements with foreign companies operating in Ecuador. Thus far, we have developed three projects, including the Curipamba project, a volcanogenic massive sulfide district located in central-west Ecuador's western mountain range, where the company owns seven concessions of about 30,000ha. We also have other projects in the exploration stage in Ecuador, which offers the investors of Salazar the great opportunity to obtain a new development project. In the short term, we will focus on our main discovery, the El Domo deposit in the Curipamba project. We expect El Domo to start operating in three years' time. Over this time, we will carry out feasibility studies and then start construction.</p><h4>How is the company working on diversifying its project portfolio?</h4><p>Our technical team is based in Quito, though our shareholders are in London and Canada. Our main objective is to keep making discoveries in Ecuador, as we have a competitive advantage by being Ecuadorian. The future prospects of Ecuador's mining resources are one of the highest in the world. We also have a subsidiary in Colombia, where Salazar Resources has applied for five mining concessions in the department of Nariño, with a total of 25,000ha.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are the drilling results of Lumina's Cangrejos deposit expected to accelerate the project life cycle?</h4><p>Cangrejos is a world-class gold-copper porphyry deposit. It is estimated that the life of the mine can be anywhere from 16 to 20 years, with a production of 373,000 oz of gold and 43 million pounds of copper per annum. In 2019, an important area adjacent to the Cangrejos main deposit was also drilled, and this will significantly increase the mineral resource of this project. The next steps will be to run a drilling program to define if the two deposits are connected and can become a single open pit in the future. In the next few years, Lumina Gold will continue to advance the project to take it to the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and bankable stages. These steps will move the inferred mineral resource amount to a proven resource. We originally expected to be ready in six years but now expect to start production five years from now. Cangrejos could potentially become a large-scale mining project in Ecuador, similar to the size of ongoing projects, such as Fruta del Norte or Mirador.</p><h4>How are you approaching environmental and social responsibility?</h4><p>Lumina Gold has put in place a holistic approach addressing current and future needs. One of our more active action lines is education, environment, and productivity. We have contributed to a partnership between Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS&amp;T) and Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ). It will create a professional mining school in Ecuador with an undergraduate program. In the environmental aspect, Lumina Gold has planted 12,000 native trees with the participation of the community. On the productivity angle, an organic bio-garden has been built in the community of influence for women and elderly to produce for their own consumption and to sell.</p><h4>How can Lumina Gold's successful story in Ecuador be replicated in other mining projects in the country?</h4><p>Mining projects require capital at early stages in order to carry out assessments and feasibility studies, as well as to carry out the permitting processes. To raise capital abroad, it is key to show the quality of the project, demonstrate the high-level of the professionals in the company, and establish a track record showing how the exploration group has a high return of investment to its shareholders. Investors follow the development of our projects. We have fortunately been successful throughout South America. We have a story to tell about bringing another large-scale mining project to an incipient mining country such as Ecuador.</p><h4>What strategy are you following by dividing the concessions in Ecuador into two corporate entities: Lumina Gold and Luminex?</h4><p>Lumina Group decided to invest in Ecuador in 2014, obtaining the Cangrejos project and the Condor project one year later. In 2016, we obtained 32 new concessions, making us one of the largest hectare holders in Ecuador, with 147,000ha. These concessions eventually turned into 11 projects. Looking at the evolution of each projects, we realized Cangrejos was a more advanced project that could yield benefits at an earlier stage and decided to spin off this project from the rest. The remaining projects were assessed according to their potential. Three joint ventures were signed, which include Anglo American, First Quantum, and BHP. From the remaining Luminex Resources projects, the most advanced one is the Condor project, which contains two porphyry systems and an epithermal gold-silver system. The project includes the deposit Santa Bárbara, with 4 million oz, and Los Cuyes, with 1.7 million oz, among others.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the future of mining in Ecuador?</h4><p>The mining industry will become a reality in Ecuador soon. It will have potential to balance the weight of oil in our economy and diversify our source of revenue. The sector agrees it is feasible for mining to make up 12% of Ecuador's GDP in the following decade. The country now needs to set up a clear regulatory framework for responsible mining and enforce its application.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update about the Loma Larga project and the support you are receiving from the government?</h4><p>The Loma Larga gold-copper-silver project is our flagship asset. Loma Larga will be an environmentally responsible underground mine with an initial 12-year life. It will produce over 200,000 of gold equivalent ounces per year and employ almost 500 employees when in production. In 2020, our plan is to obtain environmental permits, perform community consultation, and secure project financing, with the goal of commencing construction in 2021. INV Metals and our team has received significant support from the government. We appreciate the strong support we have received from the minister of energy and non-renewable resources and the vice minister of mines. The mining industry has the potential to become a pillar of economic development and growth. A responsible mining sector will provide safe employment opportunities, a stable tax revenue base, and a source of GDP growth.</p><h4>What are your strategies to navigate the demands of local populations and the different regulatory authorities?</h4><p>INV Metals maintains an open and transparent partnership with local communities in its area of influence. We have been working with local communities for 15 years, supporting programs that focus on training, animal husbandry, micro enterprises, and environmental stewardship. In 2020, our team will focus on the permitting phase and will liaise with the relevant governmental ministries as we progress. Consultation and communication with the local communities will be based on accurate and scientific information. Our focus on environmental excellence and our dedication to stewardship will be highlighted during this phase. The mine will have minimal surface disturbance as it is underground and accessed through a ramp. Our tailings facilities will utilize a filtered tailings method, which will be covered and revegetated upon closure. Notably, the project is not located near rivers or lakes, and we will try to divert as much surface water as possible. Water collected from the mine will be used in the process facility and recycled, while all the water that comes into contact with the mine site or process facilities will be treated in line with international standards. We will set an example of how the mining sector should partner with local communities.</p><h4>What impact do you expect the mine to have on the local economy?</h4><p>There are many benefits that stem from the development of mining projects, and we expect Loma Larga to generate significant development and employment opportunities for the local community. Loma Larga will employ approximately 875 people during the construction stage and almost 500 employees during the production phase. Training programs focused on the skills required for mining and safety will be offered to local communities. Given that the price of gold is USD1,250 per ounce, the mine will generate USD177 million in corporate income tax, USD107 million in state profit-sharing taxes, USD108 million in royalties, and USD27 million in employee profit-sharing taxes. There is also potential for more increases in case there is a rise in the price of gold.</p><h4>How attractive is Ecuador compared to other neighboring countries?</h4><p>Ecuador has significant untapped exploration potential. Due to improved mining laws, many international mining and exploration companies are interested in doing business in Ecuador. Two large-scale mines began production in 2019, and our goal is to make sure Loma Larga the next large-scale gold mine to enter into production. In order to attract investment, the country needs to maintain stable laws and regulations and have a comparable tax regime. We believe Ecuador will emerge as one of the leading mining countries.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, our primary goal is to acquire environmental permits. In addition, we will execute communications strategies to support our community consultation process and focus on obtaining project financing. We will also continue working on our four greenfield exploration properties. Our goal is to be one of the leading socially responsible gold producers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the overall economic and commercial relationship between Ecuador and Canada and the role of mining in it?</h4><p>The trade relationship between Canada and Ecuador is solid and increasingly growing. Canada and Ecuador are two countries of the Americas that share similar geographies in terms of an abundance of natural resources and the same values on trading in a transparent and responsible manner. Because of these fundamentals, there is great potential for growth in our trade relationship. In 2018, when Canada was the number-one investor in Ecuador, mainly because of our investment in mining. There was USD2 billion of investment in Ecuador for many sectors, but mostly mining. The more Canadians do business in Ecuador, the more confidence there will be in Ecuador. The new direct flight between Toronto and Quito will ensure the relationship will grow. Already, trade in goods between both countries is worth USD520 million. Most of Ecuadorian exports to Canada are natural products, including fruit, cacao, and shrimp. With this direct link, we can create more opportunities for these products to reach Canada. This flight will also boost tourism on both sides. Ecuador is becoming a more familiar, attractive destination to Canadians as Canadians are attracted to Ecuador's nature. Over 36,000 Canadians visited Ecuador in 2018, and that number will grow. Ecuador is the third-largest source of South American students who come to study in Canada, and the new flight will help more students study in Canada. Additionally, major Canadian players in the oil business returned to Ecuador and participated successfully in the Intracampos oil round due to their world-renowned experience. </p><h4>What is the potential contribution of Canadian companies to ensure that a more responsible mining sector takes shape?</h4><p>The contribution from Canadian companies is hugely important, and they have risen to the task in Ecuador. One of the goals of the Ecuadorian government is to grow exports, and mining is essential to achieve that. The development of the mining sector is important, not only because it can help diversify the Ecuadorian economy, but also because most of that development takes place in remote regions of the country. These communities are marginalized, so the development of mining can help them prosper. This has to be done in a sustainable manner, however, and Canada has significant experience in this area. There are many Canadian mining companies in Ecuador, so we can expect this contribution to grow. Furthermore, Canada is the only country with an international Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise who can review certain complaints from a Canadian company's operations abroad and take actions accordingly.</p><h4>How does the Canadian embassy in Quito and its commercial team help ensure investors a smooth journey in Ecuador?</h4><p>The embassy has an extremely well-trained team of experts, and we work hard to accompany this government to make their strategic development a success. We recognize the challenges in going from an economy that it is highly dependent on oil to one that is diversified and has many sources of revenue. When we talk about the mining sector, we work in a collaborative manner with the government to develop large-scale mining projects. We have a great deal to share in terms of framework, bureaucracy, permitting processes, and other areas, because Canada has gone through much of this already. Like Ecuador, we have many natural resources and indigenous peoples who live in remote areas where extractive activities take place. We have gone through the process and can share our experience. We also have a great deal of experience in terms of PPPs. The Quito airport is a great example. It is a PPP project that the Canadian government and a Canadian company developed together with local authorities. It is one of the few airports in Latin America that is carbon neutral and has been a catalyst to connect Ecuador to the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities do you see in Latin America, specifically Ecuador, for the mining sector and the exchange?</h4><p>The recent social uprisings across Latin America highlight how important sustainable economic growth is for this region. The good news is that the natural resources of the region are undoubted. Governments across the region have a responsibility to explore these opportunities to drive economic growth. The Ecuadorian government has made it clear it intends to pursue policies and initiatives to increase mining's proportion of GDP. In 2018, we went to Ecuador and left with renewed confidence in the government's commitment to growing the mining sector. Latin America remains the largest jurisdiction for TSX and TSXV outside of North America. Currently, the region represents approximately onefifth of properties in our markets. This shows that the region is not only familiar to our issuers but favored by the global investors who participate in our markets. Moving forward, mining will play an even bigger role in the economic growth of the region, especially within the parameters of the responsible Mining 2.0 framework, embodying environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives.</p><h4>Ecuador has a goal of doubling the value of its mining industry by 2021. What role do you see TSX playing to facilitate the necessary investment to realize this?</h4><p>We welcome this news and will continue to assist our issuers in the region to highlight the development of projects, as well as the progress made in building social acceptance and promoting responsible mining in the region. As the leading global equity market for mining, we play a central role in the growth of the mining <br>sector in Ecuador. We will continue to collaborate with government and industry organizations to bring transparency and information to potential investors. This is a cornerstone in building investor confidence and attracting investments.</p><h4>Ecuador's mining sector reached a few important milestones in 2019, such as Lundin Gold (TSX:LUG) being granted the final two permits required to move the Fruta Del Norte project into production. How do you see such developments impacting the attractiveness of Ecuador's mining sector to the global investor community?</h4><p>Lundin Gold's success in Ecuador continues to play a key role in the country's efforts to attract mining investors. Transparency and consistency in policies is vital to build investor confidence. Investors take note, and this influences investment decisions. This is not to say investors do not expect opposition and challenges. The challenges in mining are often of a global nature. The concept of social license is perhaps no more relevant in any other sector. Lundin Gold and SolGold are the larger examples where the Ecuadorian government demonstrated a consistent and transparent judicial and regulatory system that gives all stakeholders a voice and companies a fair resolution process. There have been historical challenges; however, the recent trend in Ecuador is a blueprint for the region to attract mining investment. If this consistency can continue across government changes, the future is bright for mining in Ecuador.</p><h4>What is the TSX's current strategy regarding further collaboration and possibly dual listing with the Quito Stock Exchange?</h4><p>We do not currently have a formal arrangement with the Quito Stock Exchange. We are, however, committed to exploring all potential opportunities to expand the pool of capital available to our issuers. The Quito Stock Exchange may be an important vehicle for this strategy. We have started discussions to explore how we can work together and intend to continue exploring these opportunities.</p><h4>What are TSX/TSXV's goals and targets regarding the mining sector in Latin America for 2020?</h4><p>Our expectation is that Latin America will play an even larger role in our markets going forward. Our commitment to the region is demonstrated by hiring representation in the region. Earlier in 2019, Guillaume Legare joined our team as Latin America regional head and is based full time in Lima.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the scope of action of the Ministry of Territory and Sustainability?<br></strong>The Department of Territory and Sustainability manages the classic policies of territorial planning, urban planning, infrastructure, and mobility together with the environment and sustainability. This means the department is the first layer of everything that involves planning, execution, and management of the territory. It has public companies on its perimeter such as Railways of the Generalitat, Catalan Water Agency (ACA), Catalan Waste Agency (ACR), Catalan Housing Agency (ACH), and the Catalan Soil Institute (INCASOL), among others. We want to fit these competencies within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and the new urban agenda, both concepts developed by the UN. In addition, there is the incorporation of the recent concept of climate emergency.</p><p><strong>What are the logistics of the low-emission zone in Barcelona starting in 2020, and what benefits will be obtained?<br></strong>We came to this decision because there is a real concern over air quality, especially in the metropolitan area of Barcelona and partially in the metropolitan area of Tarragona. We also reached the decision because we are facing a climate emergency. Under this umbrella, we developed a set of concrete and urgent actions to face this climate emergency focusing on energy transition, circular economy, and decarbonization of mobility, from which the low-emission zone emerged. We established a geographically important and ambitious area that shares territoriality with five municipalities of the metropolitan area and will prohibit vehicles that do not have the qualification of zero emissions (ecological, mixed, hybrid, A, B or C vehicles, depending on their level of emissions) by the General Directorate of Traffic. Those vehicles that do not meet these criteria cannot drive on certain days or certain times; however, that said, we cannot fail to meet the basic needs of people or companies that do not have vehicles with these characteristics, so the prohibition is not total. Given the above, we will need more and better public transport to accompany the low-emission zone.</p><p><strong>What steps have been taken to ensure bicycles play a role in promoting safe and sustainable mobility and decongesting the city?</strong><br>We have presented a bicycle strategy in line with the cycling user and town hall's sections. This document follows efforts to decarbonize mobility, which means reducing the share of private transport that emit greenhouse gases and increasing public transportation. We have seen an increase in daily bicycle trips, but want to reach 5-8% of all trips. Currently, that figure is just over 3%. This can be achieved with more infrastructure, more bike lanes, intercity facilities, planning and road reports, and better governance on the use of bicycles, which has had a difficult relationship with vehicles and pedestrians. Finally, the promotion of bicycles will help promote certain areas via cycling tourism. Municipalities and regions are interested in implementing this bicycle strategy.</p><p><strong>How is the ministry working to ensure affordable access to housing?<br></strong>Housing is one of the competencies of the Department of Territory and Sustainability that we share with city councils. There has been a sustained crisis in access to housing for many years because of the market price and rental price. There is greater demand from foreigners to settle in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and there are many expatriates who come to Barcelona to work for multinationals or launch their start-up in an attractive ecosystem such as Barcelona's. We must face this reality and welcome them while avoiding the gentrification of neighborhoods and Barcelona in general. The affordable rental housing stock must also be increased, and the government of the Generalitat and municipalities must promote public housing with various vehicles such as Incasí²l, the Housing Agency of Catalonia, and the Municipal Housing Board of Barcelona. There must be assistance in financing and maintaining this public housing stock for affordable rent. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the initial challenges the ministry had to face? <br></strong>The greatest challenge was to recover lost time. The world, Europe, and Spain are immersed in the process of an important transformation of its economic model that involves incorporating environmental and climatic variables to overcome the modernization of the economy. This transformation had been postponed, and we were nearing the deadline for an important part of European regulations regarding stability, visibility, and anticipation. We were also late on issues of the structure of costs, monitoring of emissions, making decisions regarding thermal plants, and incentives for the transformation of the energy model. Our challenge was to catch up and generate confidence in investors and society regarding our capacity for transformation. This required not only a clear explanation of our vision in the medium term but also the activation of some specific reforms that would make some decisions that should have been made a long time ago socially bearable. Unfortunately, the term was over. We had to recover the strategic vision and the time that had been lost in a short period.</p><p><strong>What have the most outstanding achievements of the last months been?<br></strong>We have achieved important goals. We held an honest and transparent public debate about the need to transform our economy and the way it has to be done. We underlined that it is impossible to make that transformation without the social component. We followed up with the toughest measures such as stabilizing or mitigating the evolution of the price of electricity and making it bearable for households and industrial consumers, and addressed our commitment to ending the use of coal, which had a deadline of December 2018 for mining and 2020 for the majority of thermal plants. We also addressed the safety of nuclear energy material and the forecast of nuclear energy in the medium term. The forecast and evolution of the protection of the oceans were extremely important for the integration of the environmental variable, as well as an analysis on how to update the hydraulic policy. We have not had the time to elaborate an in-depth reflection on the politics of water. Water, soil, climate, and energy are fundamental for any economic activity, but these are limited resources. Spain has a highly complicated position regarding water, and in a climate-change scenario, uncertainties and threats are greater. We must manage water efficiently by eliminating beliefs such as surplus or historical rights and approach the issue with a different perspective of governance in addition to incorporating the values and recommendations of the EU framework. Spain is paying fines for judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union for a lack of compliance with obligations regarding sanitation and purification. Our level of development makes this data scandalous, but we can improve our water tradition. Our infrastructure must think beyond the transportation of water to consider the efficiency and the interconnection of the desalination facilities in case of shortages. We have begun to work on these aspects, but the process has been put on hold although it deals with important issues for the next legislature.</p><p><strong>How can the energy transition solve Spain's dependence on imports of fossil fuels?<br></strong>Spain is one of the countries with greater energy dependence from abroad due to the volume of imports of fossil fuels. However, we have a great potential to replace these fossil fuels with local renewable resources. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you tell us about the Barcelona Stock Exchange and how it has evolved in recent years?<br></strong>The Barcelona Stock Exchange is an old institution. Its transaction records date back to 1830, and its activity was carried out at Casa Lonja de Mar. Throughout the 19th century, Barcelona had the most important stock market in Spain. In Madrid, public debt and public effects were basically contracted, while the conventional private income exchange was in Barcelona because this was where the first public limited companies in Spain were established. The Barcelona Stock Exchange remained in a self-regulation regime until 1915, when the official stock exchange was introduced. In 1987, the stock market law was introduced, as a result of which markets were unified, exchange agents disappeared, and the stock market became a limited company. Thereafter, four exchanges were integrated into a holding company called the Spanish Markets Exchange (BME). In 2006, BME went public.</p><p><strong> How do you evaluate the future of this market?<br></strong>The economy is based on two pillars: the real economy, where raw materials are transformed into finished products, and the financial economy. In an economic system, it is the real economy that creates wealth, not the financial economy. The financial economy creates efficiency because it brings together savings and investments. Since those who save are different from those who invest, the system would lose effectiveness if there were no mechanism to bring them together. As a result, potential resources would not be fully utilized. The financial system links savings with investment. <br>How has the political crisis in Catalonia influenced the Barcelona Stock Exchange?<br>Everything influences the stock market. The political crisis may occasionally affect a Catalan company, but it does not influence the global market. In spite of this, there is a real psychological impact. For example, people who invested in the stock market may no longer want to invest in certain Catalan securities. There are other factors that can have a bigger impact, such as the US-China trade war, Brexit, crisis in the Middle East and Turkey, and fluctuations in oil prices. <br> <br><strong>We always talk about technological development, especially in Barcelona, which is a hub of technological development and innovation. What is the exchange doing in this regard?</strong><br>Technology has monumentally transformed the stock market in every aspect, including hiring, liquidation, and the individual behavior of those who operate in the market. All stock exchanges have specific departments trying to innovate and implement the latest technologies. We often work with major IT and tech companies on a global level. We try to promote tech companies of different types since our intention is to assist innovative entrepreneurs form consolidated companies and support them going public on the stock market. Blockchain is another technology we are working on. We are taking into account all high-frequency latency systems, even if they do not currently have a direct influence.<br> <br><strong>The stock market is complex and fluctuates greatly. What has been the most difficult part of your career?<br></strong>The most difficult part was integrating the Barcelona Stock Exchange into the BME holding after the reform of the stock market. On the one hand, this gave us greater business opportunities but on the other hand, it diminished our capacity and independence. At present, one of our main challenges is to clearly distinguish between functional centralism and geographical centralism. Since four exchanges were integrated into the BME, it makes sense to have only one accounting department. This concentration is acceptable and necessary but not all operations have to be based in Madrid. In our opinion, functional centralism is valid but the geographical one is not. This is a topic that currently concerns the peripheral exchanges and particularly the Barcelona Stock Exchange. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are CESCE's main activities, and how have these changed over the years?<br></strong>CESCE was founded by law in July 1970 and began operating in 1971. The main objective of the company remains the same, which is to cover the risks of Spanish companies exporting or investing overseas. However, CESCE has become bigger and more complex over the years. Originally, we only subscribed insurance policies on behalf of the state. We later started to work as a private insurer covering domestic and export credit risk and, in this private part of our business, compete like any other company. As part of this business, we acquired INFORMA, the leading commercial information company in Spain, Portugal, and Colombia, integrating it into the CESCE Group and the Dun &amp; Bradstreet network. We also expanded our geographical presence throughout Latin America, where we now have seven subsidiaries. We also opened subsidiaries in France and Portugal. Additionally, CESCE has been working on a digital transformation plan to optimize its operational model by achieving a high level of automation through the use of advanced analytics, a method through which we have automated more than 95% of our credit risk decisions and 80% of the claims decisions. We have also developed new digital products and services based on a flexible subscription model. Finally, we are working on creating a more digital culture that is agile, lean, and innovative by developing an open innovation ecosystem in collaboration with start-ups and high-tech companies.</p><p><strong>Who are your public and private clients?<br></strong>CESCE operates through two accounts: the state account and the private account. CESCE is the Spanish export credit agency, whose credit insurance activity we manage. CESCE is well known in the market for being the insurer of large Spanish engineering projects abroad, such as the Panama Canal, the AVE high-speed train, which links Medina to Mecca, and other major projects. Those who use CESCE the most in terms of risk volume are large global Spanish companies, especially in the industrial and construction sector. But keep in mind that we subscribe 1,800 policies per year on behalf of the state, 1,700 of which correspond to small operations. Our main clients with regards to the number of operations are Spanish exporting SMEs, for which we insure tens of thousands of euros in short-term credits. Within the private sector, we insure the payment of commercial credits for Spanish businesses that are mainly SMEs: 57% of these commercial credits are for debtors located in Spain, and 43% are located overseas. Our private insurance business is highly competitive: for this business we cover up to 95% of the commercial credit, the highest rate in the sector, and we normally indemnify in 60 days, the fastest in the sector. </p><p><strong>Against what risks do you protect SMEs, and what is your advice to those seeking to export?<br></strong>CESCE is not a general insurer; it only insures the commercial credit risk for non-payment of invoices, which we do for both the state and private businesses. In the case of the state's account, we insure political and extraordinary risks, insuring non-payment due to acts of nature such as earthquakes and floods, but also catastrophic risks such as revolution and war, mainly in emerging markets. Our main recommendation for SMEs is that they need to correctly manage their commercial risk, be it by utilizing their own professionals or by transferring this risk to a specialist such as a credit insurance company like CESCE. For us our competitors are not the other credit insurance companies in the market, but the use of self-insurance. Only 30-35% of commercial invoices are insured. The rest is not, which is not advisable unless companies have the necessary resources. Therefore, our recommendation is to transfer the risk to a specialized company. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The free zone consortium was the first of its kind in Spain. Can you tell us about its evolution?<br></strong>The consortium was born over a hundred years ago. At the end of the 18th century, Spain lost the colonies of Cuba and the Philippines, and a problem related to international trade arose. In addition, after World War I, trade opportunities appeared that Catalan society wanted to take advantage of. There was intense pressure to rent a free port in Barcelona, a claim that was demanded in the meeting of 499 municipalities in the city of Barcelona. In the end, a consortium was created in 1916, which included the city council of Barcelona, the Chamber of Commerce and Navigation, the Chamber of Industry, and the Association of San Isidro (an association of farmers). From that moment onward, the consortium was created to manage this free port, and it has evolved ever since. Besides this, there was also an interest in having a physical public space, and it focused its attention on part of the Delta del Llobregat. The state, through a concession free of charge for the exploitation of coastal sands, granted the exploitation for 50 years, and the consortium obtained the necessary resources to expropriate this part of Delta del Llobregat. It was no longer only a free port. In the 1950s, the first installation of SEAT marked an important step for the consolidation of the industrial estate.</p><p><strong>This consortium is a good example of the power of collaboration between the public and private sectors. What is the role of this alliance on the philosophy and expansion of the free zone?</strong><br>Its origin comes from the public and private sectors. We have the economic world of the city of Barcelona, town hall, and the Spanish state. The performance of the consortium since its inception has gone hand in hand with this relationship between the public and private sectors. In fact, current projects are sustained on that type of relationship. Our current flagship group is the 3D-printing business incubator, which is the result of the relationship between the consortium and the Chambers of Commerce of Spain through the INCYDE Foundation; we have received aid from ERDF funds, the EU, and the private technology center, Leitat. These three public and private entities have come together to create something new in an innovative field. In June 2019, we held seven international events at the same time, including the world congress of the World Free Zone, the Mediterranean Summit, and the meeting of the free zones of Latin America ATSFA.</p><p><strong>A priority for the consortium is DFactory, a 3D-printing project. What is the strategic plan for its implementation?<br></strong>The project was inaugurated in April 2019. The idea is to incubate 100 companies there over the next five years. The project was inaugurated by the Minister of Science, Innovation, and Universities, Pedro Duque, as well as the mayor of Barcelona. We are currently incubating 26 companies, surpassing 2019's objective of 20. It is extremely useful because in the incubator the companies can interact with each other. 3D-printing works with different materials: plastics, resins, ceramics, and so on. There is one company manufacturing glasses and another that manufactures motorcycle parts. Other companies also manufacture aeronautical or automotive parts, as it is possible to manufacture more resistant pieces with less weight, which is key. We have all that here. In the next five years, we will incubate all these companies, though we are also building DFactory, a factory in line with Industry 4.0. In that factory, we will do 3D-printing, AI, robotics, and aspects related to cybersecurity. Architecturally, it is different and more expensive. What we are building in this first phase will be ready in June, and the first companies will begin to occupy it after the holidays. It is around 17,000sqm with an investment of EUR17 million. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the evolution of the company?<br></strong>SENER Group was founded by two brothers in 1956 and started out as a marine design office, as one of the brothers, the late Enrique de Sendagorta, was a naval architect with a PhD in naval engineering. A few years later he asked his younger brother José Manuel, an aerospace engineer with a PhD in aeronautical engineering, if he was interested in pursuing research, and they both worked to develop the company. Opportunities began to arise, one being an international bid for a rocket launch tower in Kiruna in the north of Sweden in 1967. Later, we expanded into infrastructure, then energy, and naturally became a diversified company. One major milestone was getting a contract in the 1980s from the consortium developing the European fighter aircraft called the Typhoon, for which we helped develop the jet engine. We were awarded the contract to develop 13% of the project. Then we entered into a partnership with Rolls Royce and developed an industry in Spain for the manufacturing and maintenance of jet engines; a partnership that has lasted for over 25 years. The culture of this company has always been driven by its founders' spirit of innovation and excellence. In fact, one of them, José Manuel de Sendagorta, came from the academic professional development with a focus on R&amp;D. We have always positioned ourselves at the high end of engineering. After starting in engineering services, we moved into products such as mission critical electromechanical systems onboard satellites. To give you an idea, if you look at the Mars Rover, Curiosity, all the data coming to earth goes through an antenna that was partially developed, manufactured, and qualified by SENER, as we did the antenna's pointing mechanism. We are proud to remain at the cutting edge of technology. </p><p><strong>What is the most prominent line of business or product you offer?<br></strong>Being a diversified company, we have been involved in the design and development of civil infrastructure, transport infrastructure, urban transport, metro systems, trams, high speed rail, and so forth, where sometimes we team up with construction companies. That is one business area. Another is marine, where, in addition to developing marine engineering projects, since the late 1960s we have developed the FORAN System, a commercial CAD/CAM software to design and build ships. In the energy arena, we have been involved in construction, first as a designer, and later as a designer, engineer, and turnkey constructor of energy power plants. Lately, we have been involved in renewables and solar power plants. We have developed numerous power plants in Spain, Morocco, and South Africa, among other markets. Finally, we are active in the aerospace business in which we have two key products: the onboard telecommunications systems and the aforementioned mission critical electromechanical systems. These are mission critical because if the antenna's pointing mechanism on Mars fails, so does the entire mission. We also have an investment arm through which we invest in cutting-edge technologies that we develop as engineers. Therefore, we have a broad range of engineering services: we design, integrate, test, and manufacture aerospace equipment, products and systems, while in civil infrastructure, we provide a full range of services for complex integral projects. We are also an internationally renowned technology company in railways and mass transit, in addition to delivering marine engineering services, whether designing ships and through our FORAN CAD/CAM system or by delivering turnkey plants in the energy arena. We are well known for our space projects and our leading technology for solar thermal power plants. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>CEOE established its international division at the end of 2018. How would you evaluate its first year of operations?<br></strong>Our president, Antonio Garamendi, has been clear since the beginning of his mandate that he wanted to strengthen the international arm of the CEOE. The degree of openness of the Spanish economy, representing more than 66% of GDP, is 20 points higher than what it was in 2009 and nine points more than the highest point prior to the 2007 crisis. It is more international and open than Italy, the UK, or France. The number of companies that export on a regular basis has been expanding year after year, and Spain is one of the main recipients of FDI. However, the climate in which international economic and trade relations takes place has worsened. In the EU, developments such as Brexit generate great uncertainty, and within the national context, imports outweigh exports. Given these circumstances, CEOE International advocates intensifying efforts to identify new opportunities for Spanish companies abroad and correct existing barriers. After a year of operation, we can say that the activity of CEOE International has increased on the back of its proactive agenda that defends the interests of Spanish companies.</p><p><strong>Digitalization is a topic much discussed in every sector as it has become an inevitability. What is CEOE International doing to help companies in this process?</strong><br>CEOE has developed a roadmap to improve Spain's position in the international digital context, specifically within the framework of the European Digitalization Strategy, the 2025 Digital Plan. This incorporates more than 280 concrete proposals based on three crucial areas: education, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Given its cross-cutting nature, which encompasses all sectors and actors including civil society, business, and public administration, the plan entails a series of challenges, chief among which is increasing the digitalization of Spanish society by 10%. In turn, this could increase Spain's GDP by 3.2% by 2025 as well as raise the employment rate by 1.3%. The plan also aims to create 250,000 additional jobs, further develop the enterprise ecosystem, and double the number of start-ups by 2025.</p><p><strong>Spanish companies are increasingly present in the region, particularly in the construction sector. What importance does the Middle East have for Spanish companies looking to expand globally?</strong><br>The Middle East plays an important role in the internationalization of Spanish companies since it is a highly diverse market with great potential for growth. Large-scale projects are currently being developed there in priority sectors such as infrastructure, engineering, energy, transport, and the environment. Good examples include the largest solar park in the world in the UAE and large tourist complexes and infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia. The participation of Spanish companies in these projects is a great business opportunity that can also help consolidate Spain's position as a global leader. In addition, given the geostrategic position of the Middle East, it represents a good entry platform for both Asian and African markets that will encourage the expansion of Spanish companies even further.</p><p><strong>Spain has some of the highest unemployment rates in the EU, estimated at 13.9% in February 2019. What does the CEOE propose to tackle this problem?</strong><br>This figure of unemployment represents, without a doubt, our biggest concern; however, we should not overlook the important progress made in creating jobs. Over the last six years, we have generated 2.5 million jobs, more than any other country in the EU. The number of unemployed people has fallen from 6.28 million to 3.35 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 26.9% to 14.7%. This is testament to the strong recovery of the Spanish economy, which is in its sixth year of economic expansion. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the agency evolved since its creation?<br></strong>ACCIÓ is the Catalan government agency in charge of FDI promotion. It helps Catalan companies internationalize and innovate, working from both its headquarters in Barcelona and the 40 offices around the world that collectively cover 115 markets. It is a dynamic organization that was created in 1985 and has evolved significantly since then, always trying to adapt to the needs of Catalan industry. The agency opened its first international offices in Tokyo and New York 30 years ago, and the office network has handled more than 20,000 company projects to date. The agency also works actively on promoting clusters; in fact, Catalonia was a pioneering region internationally when it began to put public promotion policies for clusters into practice a quarter century ago. </p><p><strong>What have been some of ACCIÓ's recent projects?<br></strong>As an agency, we have traditionally been firmly committed to internationalizing Catalan companies. In fact, for the last eight years Catalonia has been consistently breaking records in terms of exports. For example, we are working above all to minimize internationalization barriers via a specific team that helps SMEs export to the UK after Brexit or the US after its new agro-tariffs. But now is the time for innovation. Today, we have a clear strategy focused on digitalization and new ways to innovate both locally and worldwide with multiple cooperative programs in other regions including Israel, South Korea, Chile, Germany, France, Scotland, and more. In 2020, we have decided to go even further and have launched an initiative called Catalonia Exponential, through which we help the more disruptive companies contrast their projects in different international innovative environments, such as Silicon Valley.  </p><p><strong>Where is the urgency for innovation coming from?<br></strong>The 2007 crisis was a crucial point for everyone. It forced our companies to find their way in the international market. Furthermore, we are now facing on-going revolutions, like Industry 4.0, which involves challenges that we must face very differently to how we have in the past. We used to have many constants with only one value that was changing. Now, changes come from many directions, from consumers, the process, technology, the materials, and more. It is a huge revolution that evolves on a day-to-day basis, and imminent changes are harder to predict. </p><p><strong>Do you have specific examples of such changes?<br></strong>If a company wants to continue exporting, it has to incorporate new technologies into its processes, products, and business models. In the automotive sector, for example, if we move toward electric vehicles, there will be a lot of companies producing parts for petrol-powered cars with no market. They need to change and take into consideration the new products they should be developing for a broader sector. </p><p><strong>How important is FDI for Catalonia?<br></strong>It is crucial for the economy: Catalonia has attracted EUR23 billion over the last five years, 45% more than the previous five-year period. We have 8,600 multinational companies that are the motor of our economy and that work with many local companies. We try to have as much foreign investment as possible, such as in R&amp;D, where Barcelona and Catalonia are highly competitive. In this sense, our offices and strategy here are mainly focused on attracting technological projects, R&amp;D centers, and industrial investments (both greenfield and reinvestments) through tailor-made projects. Our international offices work to get Catalonia on the shortlists of these projects. It is worth mentioning that the Financial Times Group recognized Catalonia as southern Europe's top region for investment in 2018-2019. They also gave an award to Catalonia for having the best FDI attraction strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has ICEX evolved over the years, and what have been its main achievements?<br></strong>Since 2012, Invest in Spain has been integrated as part of ICEX, which has been a major development. The integration was a complex process but was also rewarding and beneficial in supporting the internationalization of the Spanish economy. Now, we have a one-stop shop for the internationalization of the Spanish economy dedicated to assisting Spanish companies in their internationalization process, as well as attracting FDI. A second important development has been the way we have been adapting and broadening the services we offer to international investors seeking investment opportunities in our country. We have also been improving the personalized advice we provide investors on a wide array of issues that are key to their decision-making process, such as sectoral information, so they can get to know who the key players are from the supply and demand side and where the clusters and niches of opportunities are. We also provide key information on legal and fiscal issues, labor market regulation, visas and incentives packages. Basically, what we do is assist investors in a way that will help them make the right decision, and, once they have taken it, we help them land softly. To do this, we work closely with the different departments of the administrations responsible for each specific issue, as well as with regional and local authorities. We also have the help of a network of 103 economic and trade commissions that Spain has all around the globe. A third important development since our integration has been the work we are doing with Spanish companies seeking international partners to help them grow their businesses in Spain and access other markets; as a matter of fact, more often than not, when looking for an international partner, Spanish companies seek financing and integration into other companies' value chains in order to help them access other markets more quickly. </p><p><strong>Is the legal and fiscal framework for foreign start-ups favorable in Spain compared to elsewhere in Europe? <br></strong>Indeed, we have key competitive advantages that have contributed to making Spain one of the most attractive destinations for international investors. This is evident in terms of how FDI flows are entering the country, the way the M&amp;A market is performing, and the volumes of investment in the private equity and venture capital industry. In 2017, Spain received more than EUR38 billion in FDI. In 2018, for the first three quarters, we exceeded this number by more than EUR40 billion. Compared to 2017, this represents, in gross terms, a 75% increase and more than 150% in net terms. Looking at how the M&amp;A market performed in 2018, we can also see national investor's interest in Spain: there was more than EUR116 billion in investment, with 80% coming from international investors. And, finally, in the private equity and venture industry, we had record numbers of more than EUR6 billion of investment, 77% of which was led by international investors. Investors are seeing how strongly the Spanish economy is growing, with strong job creation and large competitive gains. Spain closed 2018 with 2.6% GDP growth rate, the fastest-growing economy among the largest economies in the eurozone. Going forward with a 2.2% GDP growth rate, we are set to be, again in 2019, the second-fastest growing economy among the world's most advanced. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Diplomatic relations between Cyprus and Spain were established in 1967. How do you evaluate relations between the two nations today?<br></strong>In 2018, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first exchange of ambassadors between Cyprus and Spain. We have come a long way since then. The two countries are bound by traditional friendship, as well as European and Mediterranean solidarity. We share the same values of democracy, rule of law, freedom, and respect for human rights, and cooperate within the EU and in international fora. As southern European states and close partners in the EU, we share the same goals and aspirations. At the same time, we are faced with the same special challenges, such as increased levels of sea pollution, the impact of climate change, and growing migratory flows, to name but a few. This makes our cooperation all the more meaningful, inot only to address these challenges within the EU, but also to reach collective solutions with our neighbors in the Middle East and North Africa. I note with satisfaction that our bilateral cooperation has developed to an excellent degree in various fields, and I am confident we can continue to elevate our ties to even higher levels, especially in areas such as trade, investment, tourism, and education.</p><p><strong>In 2013, both countries—along with five others—became members of the EU's Mediterranean Group, which holds an annual meeting. What is the strategic importance of promoting common interest among the Mediterranean nations?</strong><br>Sharing a common sea has defined us historically, offering us a wide perspective and cultural richness, as well as many encounters down the centuries. We have common interests and face common challenges that range from issues such as deepening the Economic and Monetary Union, the consequences of Brexit, relations with the southern neighborhood, digitalization, demography, migration, combating terrorism, hybrid threats to sustainable tourism, the accelerating climate change and environmental protection of the Mediterranean basin, responding to wildfires, and water scarcity. It is thus reasonable to wish to promote those interests, face the challenges, and discuss issues that have numerous implications to the Mediterranean region as a group, as do other groups of EU member states. </p><p><strong>In 2018, almost 4 million tourists visited Cyprus, a 7.8% increase from the year before and the highest ever recorded. What is Cyprus doing to boost this sector?</strong><br>In 2018, tourist arrivals reached a new all-time record of 3.94 million on the back of the previous record of 3.65 million set in 2017. Arrivals from January to August 2019 amounted to 2.73 million, marking an increase of 0.6% YoY. Given the importance we attach to the development of our tourist industry, we have created a deputy Ministry of Tourism to facilitate the implementation of necessary horizontal policies, the planning of tourism development, and the overall political supervision of the sector. Over the past decade, Cyprus has established the sun and sea model, which can now serve as the backbone that allows us to go for the more detailed and special forms or tourism. In this respect, the Deputy Ministry of Tourism is in the process of finalizing the National Strategy for Tourism for 2020-2030. The draft should be concluded by the end of 2019, following an environmental impact assessment and a carrying capacity study. The opening of new markets and the upgrading of the quality of Cyprus' general offering could boost arrivals up to 5 million by 2030, which is why they are the main targets of this 10-year strategic plan. It also focuses on short breaks and attracting visitors from new markets such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, America, China, and Japan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The UN will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2020. What are the primary goals for your presidency of the General Assembly?<br></strong>As we look forward to the 75th anniversary of the UN's founding, it is important to acknowledge the challenges that confront us, as well as the opportunity for the UN as a multilateral institution to highlight its key role in tackling complex global problems. As president of the 74th session, I will focus on promoting peace and security, with a special emphasis on conflict prevention. Strengthening global action to tackle climate change is integral for the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that will naturally receive my attention. I shall also give high priority to inclusion, human rights, and the empowerment of youth and women. Above all, my presidency will adopt measures to strengthen partnerships for the purpose of advancing the achievement of the SDGs and to eradicate poverty, hunger, and achieve quality education in particular.</p><p><strong>The UN will hold its 'biggest-ever global conversation' on the future of the planet to address issues such as climate change. How will this conversation transform into policy? </strong><br>The General Assembly is the space for dialogue and consensus building. The Biodiversity Summit, also known as the Nature Summit, is an important opportunity and milestone to highlight the planetary emergency and accelerate action for people and the planet. According to the 2019 World Risk Report, biodiversity loss and other climate-related factors are among the top-10 global risks for 2019. Yet, 10 of the 21 targets of the SDGs set to mature in 2020 are related to biodiversity, so 2020 will be a critical moment for environmental decision making. The global biodiversity framework for post-2020 is expected to strengthen the linkages between and among diverse initiatives, notably the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and other relevant processes adopted under the biodiversity-related conventions. Member states are still making their final decisions on the timing for the 2020 Biodiversity Summit, its modalities, and the specific issues it will tackle. Ultimately, the Biodiversity Summit will build on the political momentum from the climate and SDG summits in New York in September 2019 to accelerate action. As president, I will call on world leaders to set ambitious commitments and find robust nature-based solutions. It is my hope that this will make nature and climate change key to every major political, economic, cultural, and social decision, especially since environmental pollution and climate change pose grave threats to agriculture, food, and economic security. Ensuring the long-term resilience of the world's most vulnerable people warrants making hard choices about the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>During the 74th session, Spain recommitted to tackling security within the UN's global cybersecurity, nuclear non-proliferation, and terrorism framework. What is the role of collaboration and legislation in addressing these threats?</strong><br>When it comes to global security threats, it is essential to have dialogue and build agreements based on consensus. Collaboration among countries and within the entire international community is crucial for a successful fight against security threats. The threat of a nuclear war still exists and cannot be ignored. Any use of nuclear weapons would be a humanitarian and ecological catastrophe and will cause irreparable damage to communities and livelihoods. Nuclear disarmament is therefore one of the UN's top priorities. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, including the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This year, the 2020 NPT Review Conference will take place, and I hope these discussions provide momentum for a stronger commitment toward a nuclear weapon-free world. When it comes to terrorism, what affects one country affects all. There is a need for all states to adopt and stringently implement counter-terrorism laws at a national level. Furthermore, implementation should not end at countering terrorism, but should place high emphasis on counter-terrorism strategies that address the very conditions that give rise to the menace in the first place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Spain is a stable democracy that seeks to strengthen its values by developing the rights of citizens, fighting against inequality, and committing itself to social justice and equality between men and women. Given the nationalist regression in all areas, my government is firmly committed to an effective and inclusive multilateralism as the only solution to meeting the labor challenges of our times. A southern European country joined by fraternal ties with Latin America due to its history and language, Spain is also a neighbor of Africa, shares an ancient friendship with the peoples of the Middle East, and has a greater aspiration to strengthen its ties with Asia, now the engine of the global economy. An open country, Spain will continue to fight for a more open and cohesive world inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Precisely because Spain is a country open to the world, it is fully aware that the challenges of all continents in the second decade of the 21st century are the same for everyone, with varying degrees, intensity and urgency—but still the same. A few days ago, I presented the government's program before the Spanish Parliament to obtain its trust and support. Our program describes the five challenges facing Spanish society and the five transformations necessary to overcome them. However, let us also remember that the challenges of Spain are also those of the world at large. In the first place, economic growth at any cost is unacceptable. Growth that widens the social gap, for example, is not acceptable. Growth that creates more pockets of poverty is not acceptable. We have to grow and distribute at the same time, and finally ask ourselves, what are we specifically doing to prepare ourselves for the great changes affecting our labor market? The Spanish economy continues to grow at a faster pace than the eurozone, but we have to improve our competitiveness, productivity, and cohesion so that this growth is sustained in the long term. Nor do we want to lose sight of employment: we do not want a future of precariousness or labor poverty. Instead, I want to tell you about the second challenge, which is the digital transformation of our economies: AI, biotechnology, and robotics are not mere links in a chain of economic change, but real levers for transformation.</p><p>During this very decade, our production systems, mobility, cities, health, and daily lives will be totally different from what they are now: there will be new products, markets, and ways of getting things done. Our goal, therefore, is, from here, to contribute to the greater economic and social wellbeing of the majority of our citizens rather than bet on the gradual decomposition of our welfare state. Human capital will also be key to promoting technological change. The new government of Spain wishes to turn education and research into its center of gravity, because they are guarantees of a brighter future. We will commit ourselves to training at all levels, but above all vocational training needs an important boost in our country. Until 2025, Spain will need to have created 200,000 new vocational training positions, in addition to training trainers in the main productive sectors. <br>The third challenge is that of the ecological transition. There is no other challenge better documented regarding the challenges we face in Spain. Yet, these are challenges that all of us face, especially when parts of Australia larger than the Netherlands and Belgium are on fire. While torrential rains flood Puerto Rico and, much closer to home, the Swiss glaciers are melting, contracting by 10% in the last five years alone. The climatic emergency is a disaster that knows no borders and must be met immediately. For the first time, Spain now has one vice-president for digitalization and another for ecological transition, which puts climate action at the heart of the government's policy. Just this year the government approved the Declaration of Climate Emergency, a sign that we are firmly committed to advancing a decarbonized energy model supported by renewable energy sources.<br><br>To achieve these objectives, Spain has presented its Strategic Framework for Energy and Climate as a road map to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years. Our goal for 2030 is to reduce our emissions by 20% compared to 1990, and our ultimate goal is to achieve climate neutrality in 2050, with a 100% renewable electrical system. That being said, no economic growth can be good if it does not reduce inequalities, and no ecological transition will be positive if it is unfair or leaves people behind. This is why the government of Spain has developed a Just Transition Strategy, the first of its kind in the world, which, in accordance with the European Green Pact, wants to protect the most vulnerable from the fallout of these necessary transformations. Indeed, it is a strategy that allows all citizens to take full advantage of their employment opportunities, improve competitiveness and social cohesion, and ensure that no one is relegated. With regard to the ecological transition and consequent changes to the economy, I want to highlight something important: it is in our hands to ensure the impacts constitute a great step forward and turn these changes into opportunities for modernization, useful investment, job creation, and in general boost the world economy. The government of Spain is working toward this horizon through its National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030, which it presented to the EU. We will mobilize EUR236 billion in public and private financing between 2021 and 2030 and create between 250,000 and 364,000 new jobs in a decade. <br><br>The fourth challenge we face is true equality between women and men. Half the world's population cannot continue to suffer sexual assault, employment discrimination, and low incomes. But neither can the other half of humanity continue to allow this loss of female talent and a flagrant violation of the most basic human rights. It is neither fair nor effective because greater participation of women in the economy will have positive effects on growth as documented by many studies. Pro-women policies are one of the main characteristics of my government, a fact that is reflected in the composition of our balanced Council of Ministers and the fact that three out of our four vice presidencies are women. We favor equality and are advancing a law that establishes equal pay, equality in paternal and maternal leave, and a fairer balance of working hours. In addition to the relentless fight against gender violence, it is a great challenge in Spain to encourage sharing family responsibilities. Finally, the fifth challenge we face is that of social justice. We live in prosperous societies that have alarming levels of poverty and social vulnerability. Instead of being reduced, inequality is becoming more acute, something that poses a huge threat to the strength of our social fabric. <br>I remember the Dutch writer Rutger Bregman once saying: "I hear people talk about participation and justice, equality and transparency, but almost nobody mentions a real problem: tax evasion." Indeed, tax justice is a huge problem. Let's not be deceived. There can be no social justice without tax justice. And you have to go one step further: it is not enough to redistribute income through taxes; we must advance in predistribution by ensuring that markets function more fairly and democratically. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is T-Systems Iberia's history in Spain?</h4><p>One of the company's significant achievements since its establishment has been setting a clear vision to be a strategic IT partner for its clients. We always put our customers at the center, which is why some of them have been with us for more than 10 years. As you can imagine, a lot has changed over the past 20 years, but we are always applying our mantra to simplify, be innovative, and help customers. The way customers interact with providers, and more recently partners, is all about how to apply technology to their business and how to understand our customers' customers. This was the core of the beginning of the company. Since then, the company has undergone a number of changes and acquisitions. It began with the acquisition of Debis' worldwide systems. Locally, we acquired the IT department of an important government entity, which put us in the public sector. More recently, we acquired an IT company from an automotive group that adds to our knowledge about the industry. T-Systems has experienced multiple transitions and what we call digitalization is not new to us; it was simply called something different in the past. We have always been focused on improving our offerings.</p><h4>How does your work in the public sector differ from working with private clients?</h4><p>Previously, both sectors used to have certain needs but at present, all parties are focused on technology. A few years ago, we acquired a company called TAO, which is being integrated into our systems. While most of the people in Spain don't know about us, they do interact with our products; we are present in most of the important cities across Spain. We have an ERP product in the public sector that deals with taxes, citizens, asset control, and accounting in local administrations. We experienced the evolution of those ERP products and have now created a platform and module that help cities and the public sector evolve. Gijón was one of the first smart city projects we had in Spain. The first wave began in 2017 and T-Systems is responsible for installing smart lighting, reducing air pollution, and collecting data to create an ecosystem. Within the public sector, the Generalitat de Catalunya is another important client, and we are serving several of their important departments. For example, we have already digitalized 75% of their legal documents. Notably, we are working with the justice department to transfer everything from paper to digital. There is still a long way to go, but it is one example of something we have been transforming over the years.</p><h4>How much of your client base is in the automotive sector?</h4><p>If you look at the local industry in Spain and specifically the IT environment ranking, we are ranked four in the automotive and public sectors. Worldwide, 13 out of 20 automotive manufacturers are customers of our systems. All sectors are moving toward Industry 4.0. There are a lot of transformations taking place, and what we see in terms of less power, high performance, is not only true for automotive but for every sector in which we operate, be it healthcare or finance. The automotive sector is increasingly adopting technologies like the IoT, automating their processes to be more competitive. Some companies are already testing technologies related to 5G. One key challenge moving forward is security; with thousands of devices connecting to the system on a daily basis, not much is being done to secure the data. T-Systems portfolio is made up of four pillars. The first is connectivity, for which we are already testing 5G services with Deutsche Telekom and examining ways to use it for B2B and factories. Studies predict that by 2025 there will be 4.2 billion devices connected to each other, which means there is potential to use our platform to connect and protect these devices. The second pillar is the cloud where we have a solution for multi-clouds and the orchestration of it. Some companies choose to use public clouds whereas some prefer to own their own infrastructure. They all have a need to operate and orchestrate their data, whether it is in their own cloud or on a public one. We have partnerships with companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and we also have our own cloud solution, OTC. We have 13 data centers all over the world, and one in Spain. It comprises our own private cloud, which helps our customers understand and make the necessary changes. The third pillar is the digital, where our team develops and implements solutions for customers, but also moves legacy applications to state-of-the-art, cloud-based applications. We do this for our clients since we know that 80% of their business will move through digital channels within the next one or two years. That is a need, and the customers of our customers are really pushing for this change. The last pillar is security, for which we are making huge investments as a group. The largest cybersecurity center in Europe belong to our parent company.</p><h4>What role do you believe regulation should play in cybersecurity?</h4><p>I believe public authorities must count on companies that are developing these kinds of solutions, since they understand how to detect, prevent, and counter all sorts of threats. Currently there is a lack of regulation regarding cybersecurity, since it is new. Technology is evolving exponentially, and new things are being learnt on a daily basis. Some companies are prepared to help customers, like Deutsche Telekom, but we do see a level of worry. It is more and more on the agenda of the public authorities, with specific ministers talking about it. If there is more need for the private sector's involvement, we are ready to join in. We have already been in talks with the European community on how to regulate and operate cybersecurity.</p><h4>Could you highlight one or two of T-Systems' objectives from now through 2020?</h4><p>For 2020, I could highlight 20 of our main objectives, but I'll settle for four. We want to offer the best services to our customers; acquire and train the best talent; and offer the best solutions so that our customers have the best results. These are our four primary goals. We will also push our four dimensions or pillars that I previously mentioned: connectivity, cloud, digitalization, and security. We want to position the company as a partner that can help companies solve their IT-related issues. We also want to position ourselves more and more as a digital provider and partner of choice. It is not only about our legacy as a strong ICT partner, but our ability to help companies digitalize. We are pursuing 11 portfolios internally, and some are related to new technologies. We are studying how to apply IoT, blockchain, and AI to businesses, but at the end the final product varies according to different needs of every business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Customer-centric Strategy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ahmad-idris-ceo-abu-dhabi-national-insurance-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does ADNIC differentiate itself in a competitive insurance landscape?</h4><p>The key to ADNIC's strategy is that it is customer-centric. We have invested heavily in pursuing this approach by improving service delivery and developing our human resources. Investing in talent will inevitably translate to sustained success in the market, and this is how we differentiate ourselves in the industry and build the ADNIC brand.</p><h4>What cost pressures does ADNIC face, and what are the company's strategies to mitigate them?</h4><p>The main challenge is the severe level of unhealthy competition and price warring in the market, which, unfortunately, we expect to continue for some time. Similar to others in the region, the Dubai market is driven more by price, and the margin for loyalty is smaller in most of the cases. Interestingly, the SME segment is larger in Dubai than other Emirates, and that is considered in our approach to this market. Although there are large segments of the market in which price is the only driving factor for customer decision-making, ADNIC remains competitive by playing separately from other companies. We may not be always the best regarding price, though we compensate for those challenges by catering to clients who consider both price and service delivery. These clients, including corporate business and individual customers, are able to pay more for superior service. Of course, service expectations are continuously changing. ADNIC strives to continuously enhance the customer experience and service offering. New technologies allow us to explore and apply new delivery methods. For example, it has been observed that the clients' patience diminishes through time; if one year they are happy to wait 10 minutes for a service, the following year they only expect to wait five minutes. Automation allows ADNIC to shorten this time for walk-in customers. Moreover, we continuously update our mobile app, as our clients benchmark us against peer insurance companies as well as the major banking apps in the market.</p><h4>As a national insurance company, what role does ADNIC play in raising awareness of genetic diseases, and how do initiatives in this area reduce the number of claims?</h4><p>Building awareness of pre-existing health conditions is an important task for an insurance company, and there are two sides to this. One is ADNIC's CSR and commitment to the wellbeing of the people of the UAE. The other is the positive impact on our business if the population is healthier, and the consumption of health services decreases. There is a prevalence of genetic and lifestyle diseases in the region that costs the governments millions of dollars annually. ADNIC has an audit unit within its risk management division that comprises a group of doctors who frequently meet with health providers to help reduce fraud levels, overuse, and abuse. This partially addresses the issue; however, efforts are also required from other stakeholders, such as the regulatory bodies in the sector. This is also a matter of concern for them, and they are working hard to address this.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the work you are planning with the Al Etihad Credit Bureau?</h4><p>Receivables is one of the most serious challenges facing the insurance industry. Our relationship with Al Etihad Credit Bureau allows us to mitigate the risk proactively. By evaluating credit risk in advance, we are in less danger of incurring defaults. It helps strengthen our ability to control and manage credit risk exposure in our operations, and in turn proactively select clients on the basis of appropriate credit and financial screening. Other innovative technologies we are applying allow us to assess the level of risk immediately when the underwriters submit a quotation, so that we can be aware of risk before making a commitment.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the sharia-compliant insurance market?</h4><p>The sharia-compliant market has grown but not as expected. An important feature in the takaful concept is that the policyholder is also a shareholder, so at the end of the year he or she receives part of the profit. Only few companies in the region were able to distribute dividends to policyholders over the last few years, which is good news.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[26 Years on Cluster Policies]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[joan-romero-ceo-catalonia-trade-investment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the agency evolved since its creation?</h4><p>Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment is the Catalan Government agency in charge of FDI promotion and that helps Catalan companies to internationalise and innovate, working from both its headquarters in Barcelona and the 40 offices around the world that collectively cover 115 markets. It's a dynamic organization, created in 1985 and that has evolved significantly since then, always trying to adapt to the needs of Catalan industry. The agency opened its first international office in Tokyo and New York 30 years ago, and the office network has handled more than 20,000 company projects up to now. The agency also works actively on promoting clusters; in fact, Catalonia was a pioneering region internationally when, 25 years ago, it began to put into practice public promotion policies for clusters.</p><h4>Could you mention some of Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment's recent projects?</h4><p>Traditionally as an agency we have been very firmly committed to internationalising Catalan companies. In fact, Catalonia for the last eight years has been consistently breaking records in terms of exports. In this area we are working above all to minimise internationalisation barriers via a specific team that, for example, helps SMEs to continue to export to the United Kingdom with Brexit or to the US with the new agro-food tariffs. But now is the time for innovation. Today we have a clear strategy focused on digitalization and new ways to innovate, locally and worldwide, with multiple cooperative programs in other regions including Israel, South Korea, Chile, Germany, France, Scotland, and more. This year we have decided to go even further and have launched an initiative called “Catalonia Exponential,“ through which we help the more disruptive companies contrast their projects in different, international innovative environments such as Silicon Valley.</p><h4>Where is the urgency for innovation coming from?</h4><p>The 2007 crisis was a crucial point for everyone. It forced our companies to find their way in the international market. Furthermore, we are now facing on-going revolutions, like industry 4.0, which involves challenges that we must face very differently to how we did so in the past. We used to have a lot of constants with only one value that was changing. Now changes come from many directions; from the consumer, the process, the technology, the materials, and more. It is a huge revolution that evolves on a day-to-day basis, meaning the changes that are coming are harder to predict.</p><h4>For example?</h4><p>If a company wants to continue exporting, it has to incorporate new technologies to its processes, products, and business models. In the automotive sector, for example, if we move toward electric vehicles, there will be a lot of companies producing parts for petrol-powered cars with no market. They need to change and take into consideration the new products they should be developing for a broader sector.</p><h4>How important is FDI for Catalonia?</h4><p>It's crucial for the Catalan economy: Catalonia has attracted ‚¬23,000M over the last five years, 45% more then the previous five-year period. We have 8,600 multinational companies that are the motor of our economy and that work with a lot of local companies. We try to have as much foreign investment as possible, for example in R&amp;D where Barcelona and Catalonia are highly competitive. In this sense, our offices and strategy here are mainly focused on attracting technological projects, R&amp;D centers, industrial investments (both greenfield and reinvestments) by means of tailor-made projects. Our international offices work to get Catalonia on the shortlists of these projects. It is worth mentioning that The Financial Times recognised Catalonia as Southern Europe's top region for investment in 2018/2019. They also gave an award to Catalonia for having the best FDI attraction strategy.</p><h4>What is it about Catalonia that makes it a hub for entrepreneurship?</h4><p>It's a mix of assets that connects our past with our future. Ten years ago, Barcelona was not on the rankings in terms of entrepreneurial environment, and yet now we are ranked fifth in Europe in terms of the number of startups and third in preference by startup creators given that 20% of startup founders would choose Barcelona to set up their new company after London and Berlin. What makes us a unique hub worldwide is a mix of different things: a growing economy (the Catalan GDP grew in 2018 more than the EU average); a strong research ecosystem that is both mature and world-renowned; top universities and two high-ranking business schools. We represent just a few million people, but we are responsible for more than 1% of published scientific information in the world. Furthermore, Catalonia has a privileged geostrategic position, extremely well-connected to the rest of the world, home to internationally class-leading facilities such as the MareNostrum SuperComputer and the Alba Synchrotron. In the end, it's all due to its solid industrial base, given that industry represents 20.7% of the Catalan economy.</p><h4>Which would be the key point?</h4><p>Talent. The talent pool in Catalonia is a massive competitive advantage we can count on. And it's international. There is a multicultural environment here, with 26% of people working at startups having come from abroad. This is important for startups, as they look for a multicultural environment in a place where you can attract even more talent.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2020?</h4><p>We have different approaches for the short and long-term. Our short-term approach is to face these new revolutions and try to adapt our different industrial sectors to these new challenges. In the long term, we need to be more disruptive and more international, which is why we started the Catalonia Exponential project. To achieve this, we need to strengthen our startup ecosystem and increase the number of scale-ups happening in the city. We want to ensure that any company thinking about technology or innovation in southern Europe considers Barcelona first. Increasingly more, people are understanding that this is the right place to be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Expansion for El Dorado International Aiport]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[manuel-felipe-gutierrez-president-agencia-nacional-infraestructura-ani]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia receives a significant number of tourists and is the gateway to South America in terms of air transportation. What is the status of El Dorado Airport expansion?</h4><p>The government, through the Ministry of Transport, ANI, and the Civil Aeronautics, is working on an expansion plan for Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport, which has the capacity to mobilize up to 40 million passengers. In 2018, it already received 33 million passengers. Currently, the Agency has under structuring phase two different unsolicited proposals which have the goal to increase the productivity of Bogotá International Airport. The first one, aims for the execution of works within 36 months to increase the effectiveness of the existing infrastructure in El Dorado Airport. The second one, aims for the expansion of the current terminal, the construction of low-cost terminal, and the construction of a third track. These activities will led us to increase the space for aircraft parking and the possibility of new positions in the cargo and maintenance area of the airport.</p><h4>How to ensure that projects structured by the ANI guarantee economic, social, and environmental sustainability?</h4><p>In ANI we will seek to strengthen the entity to follow and fulfill the OECD standards, which implies a series of gradually reforms in order to start the fifth generation of concession projects. These projects will have some adjustments, especially in terms of sustainability, understanding the concept for its environmental, social and institutional dimensions. We will make some improvements from the experience and lessons learned from the first, second, third and fourth generation projects. We will also continue with the transparency that has characterized this entity. We will develop this through a public policy document (CONPES), which included the guidelines for the fifth generation of concessions in Colombia.</p><h4>How, from its functions, can ANI attract foreign investment to Colombia?</h4><p>ANI is an investment reference at national and international level, recognized in different scenarios to specialize in infrastructure projects. Its purpose is to plan, structure, contract, manage, and evaluate concession projects and other forms of Public Private Partnerships (PPP), mainly in public transport and related infrastructure. Based on this, since its inception, ANI has developed the 4G program, a portfolio of projects with investments of more than USD60 billion, which was considered the most important infrastructure program in the region. This clearly caught the attention of large construction companies and financial institutions worldwide. Thus, companies from more than 20 countries participated in the development of these bidding processes, reflecting the interest in investing in the country in this kind of projects. Then foreign investments funds such as CDPQ or the Chicago Pension Fund, or investment funds such as Blackrock, Macquarie, or John Laing have invested in the secondary market in ANI projects. It is therefore notorious the effort made by the entity to attract foreign investment in the projects in its charge, which lead to business opportunities at a local level. </p><h4>What are the goals set by the National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) for 2020?</h4><p>The main challenge of the National Infrastructure Agency for 2020 is to continue the reactivation of 4G projects. Now, we have 22 reactivated projects, six that we hope to reactivate during the first half of 2020, and one with significant drawbacks. We also intend to move forward with the implementation of OECD corporate governance standards for the Agency and to issue the policy document CONPES for the fifth generations of concessions that promote environmental and social projects. This will allow us to consolidate the structuring for the new projects that will be awarded soon. We also have CONPES 3918 of 2018 and the National Development Plan 2018-2022 in which some strategies were prioritized. Those strategies prioritized were the reactivation and implementation of programs and projects for construction and maintenance of the country's road network, reactivation railroads, strengthening air transport, improve urban mobility and efficient and safe logistics. These strategies are also set out in the Pact for Transport and Logistics for Competitiveness and Regional Integration, where we contribute to the objective of sustainable development, industry, innovation and Infrastructure. Therefore, the Agency in its strategic plan to work in three areas to contribute and manage the priorities of the sector. First, governance and modern institutionality for efficient and safe transport and logistics. Second, develop PPP projects that advocate intermodality, mobility and sustainability. Finally, develop 4G transport infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>New companies are entering the medical cannabis business all the time. How does FCM differ from other companies?</h4><p>We are highly focused on providing high-quality extracts for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and nutritional companies while maintaining an excellent relationship with our customers and off-takers by having a solid understanding of their needs in terms of what product to deliver and launch in the desired market. We have the central ingredients—CBD, THC, CBN, or CBG—for any final products for consumers.</p><h4>How does FGM Global seek to differentiate itself to improve its position in the market?</h4><p>In the supply of cannabis extracts, we define quality as the consistency of the supply of a product with the specifications expected by the client, free of heavy metals, pesticides, or any component other than expected, satisfying the client's expectations. All these parameters should be based as much as possible on complying with the methodologies given in European or Canadian pharmacopoeias, among others. Hence, one of the promises of this industry is that cannabis extracts are as natural as possible. It is important to know that quality management is the set of planned and systematic actions to provide confidence considering all those aspects have an impact on the product's quality and service. Hence, we focus on implementing a quality culture with all members of the company and close friends, achieving a generalized commitment to quality practices, and process improvement at all hierarchical levels.</p><h4>What have been your efforts to achieve that quality and consistency in your products?</h4><p>This quality is achieved through a rigorous and standardized quality process at every step from seed, propagation and cultivation, cutting, drying, extraction, refinement, and packaging. These standardized processes are internationally recognized under ISO standards, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).</p><h4>What efforts have you made to achieve this quality and consistency, and what are your processes to strengthen the agricultural part?</h4><p>When it comes to plant growth, there is an entire standardized process to ensure they are healthy. Within the cultivation process, it is important to highlight the GLOBAL GAP, which allows us to trace and control the production chain at all times. We establish control parameters such as good collection practices, the correct use of personal protection elements, and information records of the plants 24/7 in order to guarantee safety and avoid cross contamination throughout the whole process. On top of this, we make sure to implement processes of evaluation and verification of the behavior of our varieties; this is how it all starts from the rigorous selection of those varieties with characteristics of commercial and agricultural importance, adaptability to the tropics and yield. Prior to the establishment of the crop, it is necessary to verify all those elements that are in contact with the plant and that can intervene with its development, such as high levels of heavy metals and pesticides, harmful microorganisms, or foreign elements. Subsequently, during the establishment and growth of the crop, the environmental, microbiological, and nutritional conditions to which the plants are exposed are monitored with the aim of detecting changes that may affect the cannabinoid content of the plants or their health.</p><h4>How does FCM Global achieve quality of the final product?</h4><p>One of the main items within the quality management system is to establish a program for cleaning and disinfecting areas, equipment, and utensils, since the quality of the product depends on the hygiene present in any implement, personnel, or related area in the flow process. Cleaning is the absence of dirt, and its purpose is to reduce or kill microorganisms that can contaminate products and cause deterioration. Disinfecting, meanwhile, can be defined as partly eliminating the number of bacteria found in an environment or surface, so that it is not harmful to people and products. The main objective is to establish guidelines that avoid cross-contamination and ensure the safety of the product, environment, facilities, and personnel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Now, it makes a difference for hemp, taking it out of the catalogued substances list, which is used in the production of industrial hemp, and general cannabis. Nonetheless, with this differentiation, industrial hemp would still be regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture. Cannabis with THC, or the psychoactive element, would be regulated by the Ministry of the Interior. In the future, all health-oriented developments and research would fall under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health, thus allowing experts on each area to regulate accordingly.</p><h4>What would be Prí¦torium's strategic role in the advancement of the industry and linking up all stakeholders for the development of medical cannabis?</h4><p>We are already consulting the major private stakeholders of the industry in Ecuador, which has led to us playing an important role in the talks with the government on the subject. Through this collaboration, we have been able to communicate with key European, Canadian and American players in the industry, which have pledged to invest over USD200 million through 2025 in our local cannabis industry. We have asked these groups to invest first in the geological and ecological research studies to identify where in Ecuador, according to our conditions, we should grow our hemp and which strains in particular are best suited for us. We want to learn from the mistakes of other countries and alongside the foreign sector leaders identify and establish our own high-quality brand of hemp as a country. We have also gathered a long list of local companies looking to partner with foreign firms and explore business opportunities in the sector.</p><h4>What do you expect to be Prí¦torium's contribution to the development of the private sector?</h4><p>We expect to support all players and potential ones through guidance in navigating the legal framework of this rising and complex industry. Our goal is to be certified nationally and internationally, through partners, as a firm able to assist local companies also on the commercial aspects of the business helping the country secure international demand and identify the market trends that create economic opportunities for the country's future cannabis industry. Therefore, we have an obligation to inform all interested groups how to invest and what to produce based on international demand. In this way, we can create jobs and economic growth out of the industry, hopefully while building up our brand the same way we did with our bananas and cocoa, which are globally recognized as the best in the world.</p><h4>How would you define the services an interested company can expect from Prí¦torium?</h4><p>We will support a company with all the due diligence regarding regulations on opening and operating a cannabis-related business in Ecuador. This includes nationalizing or registering a foreign firm in the country, acquiring properties and land for the business, every region's regulations, and limitations on acquiring cannabis seeds, creating the company, registering the company with the treasury into the tax system, and even with the migratory process for foreign executives looking to come to the country to operate their businesses.</p><h4>Looking at your expertise in the sector, how would you define your strategy to attract the ideal partners considering how different conditions are in Guayaquil and Quito?</h4><p>We have prepared a package of incentives nationwide to promote investing in the sector. From tax cuts to other fiscal benefits, there is a wide-ranging set of conditions and regulations that properly managed make investing in cannabis a great business opportunity regardless of where you are based in Ecuador. We also have legal security and fiscal stability to boast and solve the main concern for a foreign investment group when looking to open businesses overseas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[5% Stake in Ghasha Concession]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[iskander-nasyrov-general-manager-lukoil-upstream-abu-dhabi]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>LUKOIL has recently been awarded a 5% stake in the Ghasha ultra-sour gas concession. What resources and expertise do you anticipate Lukoil will bring to this project?</h4><p>LUKOIL is the first Russian energy company to enter Abu Dhabi's upstream sector. In Russia, our company holds leading positions in offshore development. Our benchmark project is the North Caspian integrated production complex, consisting of 10 fields and 10 prospective structures with the total recoverable reserves of 7 bln barrels of oil equivalent. In terms of technical complexity, the Caspian project is one of the most advanced in Russia. The company owned institute (LUKOIL Engineering) engineers this development. An Integrated Operations Center allows us to perform real-time control of production and this significantly increases operational efficiency. Moreover, LUKOIL has very strict environmental policies. All our offshore projects follow the Zero Discharge principle. We are ready to share our expertise in the fields of integrated offshore developments, digitalization and environmental protection with our business partners.  </p><h4>What are some of the synergies that you expect to be created between LUKOIL and the other concession holders; Eni, Wintershall Dea, and OMV across the various shared operating environments?</h4><p>The Ghasha ultra-sour gas project is known for its challenging operating conditions. To ensure smooth synergy and positive outcomes, effective communication is necessary. I believe that for streamlined cooperation with the concession's partners and with ADNOC, it is beneficial to have a "think pot" for digesting solutions and articulating ideas. The success of the Ghasha project ultimately relies on the professionalism and mutual decision making from all the concession holders. Furthermore, I think that working on such challenging and sophisticated projects is a great opportunity to share the best practices of corporate culture.</p><h4>As the global Oil &amp; Gas sector actively seeks to create better cost-effectiveness and more sustainable production. What are some of the ways that Lukoil aims to drive efficiencies, reduce CapEx, and optimize assets across its operations?</h4><p>The company approved a ten-year strategic program in 2017. It is primarily targeted at the efficiency improvements and growth in financial results. In the Upstream sector, we focus on the assets with high profitability and high growth potential.  For existing assets, our main aims are to maintain production rates and improve operational efficiency. The main instruments here are: digitalization, reducing losses of any kind, increasing oil recovery, and saving drilling and completion costs etc.  </p><h4>The implementation of digitization, big data, automation, and the Internet of Things, is driving evolution and change across the Oil &amp; Gas sector in the Middle East and beyond. What innovative technologies are you currently exploring and deploying across your operations?</h4><p>LUKOIL is a recognized leader in Russia in integrated production modelling. In 2019, the company won the ComNews Award for the Best IT Project for its digital production system in Western Siberia. A key question that may be asked - what is the difference between LUKOIL's setup compared to our competitors? If we cast our mind back, it was not digitalization, but comprehensive modelling of the entire process in production operations, which was invented in the North Sea in 1990s. For Russian companies that operate onshore with significant well stock, it can be more challenging to establish a similar approach. We must follow each given well to ensure monitoring throughout development. We created a system for these processes; at present, this has been deployed in various regions in Russia. The approach, known as a Choke Model, is a standard that is followed by many organizations across diverse industries. We look for an opportunity to save in every aspect of the production chain. Energy efficiency is one such option. In this respect, I have to mention our latest innovative product - Permanent Magnet Motor for Electric Submersible Pumps. Comparing to asynchronous electric motors, PMM has a smaller size, higher efficiency factor (up to 92%) and lower energy consumption (25% saving in electricity costs).  It is made of heat resistant materials that allows it to be used for production during well thermal stimulation. LUKOIL is already offering this motor to the Middle East market.</p><h4>Looking ahead, in terms of scale and growth opportunity, what are your expectations for Abu Dhabi's' oil and gas sector in the coming years?</h4><p>It is difficult to predict the future; however, we are optimistic regarding the Ghasha concession's development and Abu Dhabi's energy sector as a whole. With a strategic geographic location, high energy potential and an innovative leadership, Abu Dhabi's oil &amp; gas industry has all the necessary components for future growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Medical School Has About 1,200 Students]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[khaled-saeed-tabbara-vice-president-arabian-gulf-university]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main milestones in the history of the university, and what is its academic offer?</h4>
<p>The Arabian Gulf University was established by the six GCC countries plus Iraq in 1980. Obviously, most of these countries had national universities but they felt that there was a need for a GCC university that would address topics other than the ones being offered in the national universities. Back then, the national universities were institutions that were a continuation of education following high school. They were created in this way as the demand for higher (university) education was required to fill jobs and to compete. Creating the Arabian Gulf University meant that we could address specialties and programs that are becoming strategically important for the region but were not offered individually by the countries. This is because the number of admissions into these programs is not large, meaning it was not possible to create a program like this in each country. So, AGU was to centralize it and make it available to all the countries. The medical school was created because the number of medical graduates required in the area is vast considering the size of the population. At the time, there were few colleges of medicine: one in Kuwait, four in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman. We did not have one in Bahrain and could not afford to start one on our own as Bahrain is small and medical schools are expensive. The establishment of the medical school allowed AGU to offer unique programs and methods of teaching so that this medical school follows a different educational strategy. The College of Medicine follows problem-based learning, a method that has become the trend in medical education, where students become active participants in their education. We have been following that since we started, and it was an innovation in the area. We graduated the first batch in 1989, so have now graduated 30 batches, more than 2,700 doctors and over 4,500 students from the university as a whole. When we started, the medical school was taking 78 students; now we take 200 every year and have six years, so we have about 1,200 medical students in total. We also created a special masters and PhD in special education, in addition to one in biotechnology, with four branches, Agricultural Biotechnology, where they create new varieties of plants that produce more and are resistant to disease, Medical Biotechnology, where they develop biological products for medical applications, Environmental Biotechnology, where work is being carried out in the in the field of petroleum industry. In the medical field we are the first to introduce a PhD in molecular medicine in the Arab world. We also have a master of Science degree in personalized medicine, where people's genes are analyzed. Based on that, you know which diseases you are susceptible to suffer and what medicines are more suitable for your body.</p>
<h4>How will King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Medical City help in the expansion of the university, and what will be the impact on the healthcare and education system in Bahrain?</h4>
<p>Many of the medical universities around the world have a teaching hospital both for service and teaching. We are located right next to the largest government hospital in Bahrain. Hospitals of medical schools are usually considered the best because the doctors who work there are the professors who created new knowledge in the field. They also have the advantage of being the most advanced and often have the best doctors. Throughout the years we have used the three government hospitals in Bahrain to teach our students. We appoint the doctors from these hospitals' faculty members and pay them salaries to teach our students. However, these hospitals are not ours; their primary objective is to look after patients and not to teach, so sometimes there is a conflict between what we want and what they think is their responsibility. Building our own hospital will give us full control over the teaching style and instructors; we will find the best doctors for it too. We will also have full control over the two clinical years. Though our hospital will not be large enough to accommodate all students, we are making a 300-bed hospital, so we will not be able to teach more than 50-60 students in that hospital at one time, meaning our students will also rotate through other hospitals and get exposed to different systems. The hospital will be the heart of the medical city which will later expand with a college of medicine and research centers. There will also be facilities such as a mall with groceries, cleaners, daycare, a small school, health center, conference center, and a research center.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[37th of 1,200 Arab Universities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[prof-ghassan-f-aouad-president-applied-science-university-asu]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main milestones ASU during the past 15 years, and can you tell us more about ASU's undergraduate and graduate programs?</h4>
<p>ASU was established in 2004 as a private university. ASU has three pillars: learning and teaching, research, and community engagement. Then, we have supportive pillars: quality, student support, internationalization through partnerships, and sustainable growth. ASU has grown over the years and in 2013, the university campus moved from Juffair to Sitra. The university is accredited by the Higher Education Council (HEC). We have achieved two types of ISO certifications: ISO 9001 2015, which is related to administrative processes, and the ISO 21001:2018, which is related to educational organizations' management systems and academic processes. We are amongst the first universities in Bahrain and among the few in the Arab region to acquire these certifications. In the QS World University Ranking for 2020, ASU is ranked 37th out of the 1,200 universities in the Arab region and we achieved four stars in the QS rating system. Under the Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, ASU is ranked 301+; this ranking measures how universities meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we are ranked 25 in the Arab region under the Green Metric World University Rankings, which look at universities regarding sustainability, green, and efficient practices, and use of resources. ASU is accredited with the Higher Education Academy (HEA) from the UK; we train our staff with UK certification and external assessment. 53 of our staff are associate, fellows, senior fellows, or principal fellows of the HEA in the UK. There are only 1,000 principal fellows in the world and we have one at our university. This is a major achievement for us. ASU has 18 programs in total, 13 undergraduate programs and five master's programs. We offer master's in human resource management, business administration, accounting and finance, law, and commercial law. We are the only university in Bahrain that offers political science courses in Arabic. A number of our graduates go on to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and embassies. Notably, we offer British Programs in association with London South Bank University (architectural design engineering, and civil and construction engineering) and Cardiff Met University. In addition, ASU offers programs in law, MIS, business administration, accounting, accounting and finance, interior design, graphic design, and computer science, among others. Our students also excel in sports. For example, in 2019, we won the Bahrain Collegiate Athletics Association universities' football tournament. In terms of our students' academic achievements, we won the Injaz Company of the Year competition. We also represented Bahrain in the Injaz competition for the Arab region, and were among the top three institutes. Our students won the Boeing Excellence Award and the award for producing the best product in the Arab region. They produced an application to help with vehicle breakdowns. We hosted an international conference on sustainable futures in 2017 with London South Bank University, and in association with the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) and we hosted another one on 2019 on innovation, technology, enterprise and entrepreneurship. In total, we have about 3,000 students. We are one of the largest private universities in Bahrain. We have four colleges: Administrative Sciences, Arts and Science, Law, and Engineering, set up with London South Bank University. Our students study here and get their degrees from the UK. We are creating a culture of excellence, innovation, and creativity. We are mixing western and eastern values and making sure we are progressing in the right direction.</p>
<h4>ASU is one of the leading private universities in Bahrain. How does ASU differentiate itself from the rest of universities?</h4>
<p>Bahrain is a small country and the education sector here is highly competitive. Having achieved institution accreditation from the HEC will open more markets for us. In November 2019, we were recognized by Jordan's Ministry of Education, so now we can recruit students from Jordan. Moreover, Jordanians living in Bahrain can study at ASU and obtain degrees that are recognized in Jordan. We are working on recognition now by other nations. Internationalization is one of our overarching pillars and enablers. We explore the international market and our aim is to go beyond the Gulf region. At present, 85% of ASU's students are Bahraini locals and 15% are international expatriates and people living in Saudi Arabia who commute here daily. What makes us unique is the diversity of our programs and the use of Arabic and English languages. Our quality driver has allowed us to achieve good rankings, ISO certifications, and accreditations. All this helps us in our goal of becoming one of the best universities for locals and expats in Bahrain.</p>
<h4>What are the plans and strategies for ASU in 2020 and beyond?</h4>
<p>We have completed our Strategic Plan 2015-2020 and are now in the process of developing our 2020-2025 Plan. We aspire for international professional accreditation for our programs and possibly some new educational programs. Everything we do is driven by our strategy and we have a yearly operational plan with budgeting and feedback. The higher education sector is maturing and doing well in Bahrain, and we have played a vital role in that. The Ministry of education, the HEC and the BQA and vision 2030 strategies are guiding our thinking and future directions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the factors for FCM Global to become one of the leading companies in Colombia?</h4><p>We are a multinational company. In the beginning, we started to set up companies in North America and Europe for the transfer of know-how and to understand how the industry is evolving worldwide. Most of our clients are in Europe, which is a more mature market and has regulations that are clearer; however, as the framework in Colombia evolves, no other jurisdiction in the world has the same comparative advantages, especially now that the regulators are bringing in a sophisticated framework. Colombia, with the completion and implementation of the regulatory framework, is becoming the catalyst for all the synergies of the global market, being the center of cultivation and production, both raw material and final products.</p><h4>Being one of the pioneers in Colombia, how has this helped to implement FCM Global's vision of its “cosourced“ model with almost 500ha at its disposal?</h4><p>The learning curve has been fairly significant, with changes and constant developments in regulation and advances in science and technology around the world. We focus on innovating and achieving efficiencies at all levels in the company, from the objectives of our customers, which is what our “co-sourced“ model is all about, thus, developing these areas in stages. In the two natural sub regions, Antioquia and Natagaima, where we have our licenses and registered cultivars, we cover approximately 60% of the climatic conditions in the country. Our best genetics micropropagate in-house for future growth, and a sample from this source is developed for final products using nanotechnology.</p><h4>What have been the most important technological advances in FCM?</h4><p>Innovation has been one of our pillars. We are extremely proud of the team we have. As a consequence, we are finalizing our processes of in-vitro propagation and production of nano-emulsions both in micelles with areas related to water and oil, which will allow us to standardize processes and quality while becoming more efficient and pioneering in terms of R&amp;D, which will mean great advantages to our clients. With new technologies, we can create customized material for specific metabolites to create new products.</p><h4>Where do you see the relationship between production in Colombia with distributors and end customers around the world?</h4><p>Two things are extremely important here: consistent quality and transparency. If we can demonstrate to our customers a clear discipline in genetics and consistency from seed and propagation to the oil and the final product, then we will truly have an instrument to work in the market. Without these, it will be difficult to get there. On the other hand, our partnership with local universities drives innovation and quality are key, as we are working on transferring know-how from universities like Israel, Canada, and Europe. With an R&amp;D base in the hands of local universities and acting as an association and not as independent companies, we can create an industry with high added value, starting with innovation—processes, products, and regulation—and creating clinical evidence, continuing with a supply of both extracts and finished products that are tied to the genetics we have in Colombia and distributing them around the world with credible players and long-term vision. Obviously, this must be accompanied by rigorous processes and traceability and transparency systems.</p><h4>What is your perspective on how the industry will continue to evolve in Colombia?</h4><p>We are positive about the direction the industry is moving in; Colombia is on the right path. It has been a long journey, but now Colombia will be positioned as a production hub for the world. Even as other Latin American countries open legal frameworks, it will mostly be for imports of final products. Colombia will set the standard and be a platform for Latin America to create a new market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short introduction to GAIA HEALTH?</h4><p>GAIA HEALTH is a Colombian company licensed to produce cannabis derivatives for medical purposes. It is dedicated to cultivating, extracting, and developing high-quality products at affordable prices. The company was created with 100% Colombian capital and with a strategy that includes the highest quality standards with the objective of being one of the most competitive companies in the world in its class. </p><h4>The medical cannabis industry is currently becoming quite competitive in the country and region. How does GAIA HEALTH differ its offerings to attract investment?</h4><p>Located in Colombia's tropical area, GAIA benefits from optimal temperature and natural light that substantially reduces operating and labor costs and has proximity to ports, both maritime and air. A special mention must be made of the approval of the Vallejo Plan, a free zone that translates into significant tax and tariff benefits in comparison to other territories. Additionally, it provides social benefits such as employment, decent remuneration, and environmental rights for the region and its inhabitants. From a technical and technological point of view, GAIA leads in the implementation of the fully automated continuous extraction and processing process from harvest to distillation and crystallization, in line with EU GMP standards. Cryogenesis guarantees the preservation of biomass quality attributes, which are affected by conventional drying and storage techniques. We also have a team composed of technicians, professionals, and scientists focused on research, innovation, and development at every stage.</p><h4>Could you explain cryogenesis a little more?</h4><p> Through a process with liquid nitrogen, the trichomes of the total biomass are cryo-preserved at a temperature between minus 130 to minus 180 degrees Celsius, which guarantees the stability of the composition and percentages of cannabinoids present in the plant from harvest until extraction. The cryogenic separation of the trichomes reduces the need to manipulate large volumes of total biomass, taking only the trichome concentrate to the extraction process and thereby decreasing proportionally expenses and costs. With this technology, there is no need to dry the biomass, thereby making investments in equipment, infrastructure, and personnel for the drying process unnecessary. This technology is cost-effective, and the plant material obtained after the separation of trichomes is clean and ready for use in cannabis fiber-based by-products.</p><h4>How are you contributing to the development of the communities where you have operations? How do you foresee the industry's impact on these regions and the country?</h4><p>The Palmito municipality, where we have operations, was one of the areas most affected by armed conflict; poverty, fear, unemployment, and the lack of basic necessities were part of the daily life of its inhabitants. Today, we are contributing to change this reality; more than 80% of our employees are natives of this community. On the other hand, GAIA will contribute significantly to the increase of the annual municipal budget through taxes, which should be used in public works and policies. Within its structure, GAIA prioritizes social and environmental responsibility; we forecast the execution of short- and medium-term projects that contribute to the solution of needs such as potable water, education, and food. The development of this new industry in our country will positively impact the creation of new jobs and national and foreign investment. A significant increase is expected with respect to the short- and medium-term exports of these products and imports in equipment and supplies that will undoubtedly boost the economy. New technical and professional jobs will be created for the industry, along with a recovery of confidence in the agricultural sector. The medical cannabis industry offers an alternative, by replacing illicit crops with legal crops and well-paid jobs that can guarantee the livelihoods of peasant families. One of the objectives of the company is to provide technical assistance, supplies, and technology to small producers so that they can develop their crops optimally and guarantee the purchase of the crop.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is coming for product development in Colombia?</h4><p>In 2019, our farm operations advanced in support of genetics registration and an initial commercial crop. Furthermore, we signed an agreement with Procaps, supporting our objective of producing high-quality goods to serve the regional market. Globally, we have been heavily focused on R&amp;D and education. One of our key pillars is quality, which starts with raw materials and standardized genetics. The second pillar is science; we are engaged in 15 clinical studies with people around the globe, as well as four clinical studies with animals. Our third pillar is experience; Canopy has been in the cannabis industry for five years, and it has over 100,000 patients.</p><h4>The company has invested USD100 million to meet the medical demand of countries in Latin America. What are your ambitions for 2020?</h4><p>A major part is completing construction at our facility, including for the greenhouses and construction plants. The extraction capacity will be significantly larger to ensure we can cover the supply for Latin America for the next five years. It starts with doctors, patients, and the community. We are going to conferences and congresses and helping develop specialized courses for doctors. In every Latin American country, we are working with universities such as the National University of Colombia, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Peru, the University of Concepción in Chile, the University of Buenos Aires, the University of Panama, and the University of Sío Paulo. In every country, we have sought to form partnerships with the largest possible university because this is the standard that we will bring. I look forward to a time when people can look back and consider Mexico and Colombia's success cases: countries that lived a sad and violent past and ended up becoming leaders in creating wellness and jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Clever Leaves has made extracts that supply the European and Latin American markets. What is the company's vision for the future development of the Colombian and Latin American markets?</h4><p>One can try to imagine what the market will be, but it's important to follow the pulse of the regulatory structure in those countries. We have been operating in Colombia since 2016. Chile has already legalized some cannabinoid-based products. Brazil was almost forgotten given how restrictive its original rules were, but we are excited by the recent regulatory announcements, which present a big opportunity for Clever Leaves. Brazil has indicated a ban on domestic production; distribution will likely occur at pharmacies, and all products will require GMP-certified producers. We are tracking the implementation of Brazil's announced regulatory structure and are cautiously optimistic about 2020. Because of Clever Leaves' roots in Colombia and its desire to help patients globally, we will try to participate, if not accelerate, the growth of the local market depending on how the regulations unfold. Clever Leaves has a production plant that complies with GMP according to Colombia's National Institute of Drug and Food Surveillance (INVIMA).</p><h4>What does this mean for Clever Leaves?</h4><p>GMP certification from INVIMA goes a long way in terms of providing an outside measure of the quality of a product. There are limited reliable benchmarks in the cannabis industry to date. Prospective customers or partners understand that GMP certification conveys both quality and consistency in our production. A second advantage of having GMP certification is that it allows us to enter certain downstream pharmaceutical markets. We are researching exactly how many countries may reciprocate GMP certification, but to sell a prescribed pharmaceutical product in Colombia, such as a heart medication or sleep aid, the product must contain ingredients produced under GMP procedures. When the Colombian market opens up, Clever Leaves will be uniquely positioned to capture it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the scale of your Colombian operations?</h4><p>Along with our own growing farm, we contract several local partners to grow product. We currently have 12.1ha under cultivation, yielding a half-million flowers, and have the capacity and connections to scale up to 139ha and 5.5 million flowers. We have more than 180 cultivars in our seed bank from which we have developed 30 proprietary strains licensed for commercial cultivation, one of the mandatory requirements of the Colombian regulatory structure. Having used a temporary extraction facility for the past three years, we are about to open the doors of a 2,300-sqm, GMP-certified processing and extraction center, where we will process oils at full scale. Once we become fully operational, we plan to produce 2,500kg of oil per month, or 30,000kg annually. </p><h4>How do you control the quality and mix of ingredients in your products?</h4><p>We have an excellent team of botanists breeding the strains, using natural irrigation and pest-control techniques. Our breeders have been able to develop cultivars with specific qualities and proportions of THC and CBD. Our local growers have deep expertise. These are people who grew up cultivating and they have it in their blood. They treat the soil like a living organism and use no chemical pesticides or contaminants, resulting in healthy and safe plants and oils. Most cannabis oils are yellow, but our superior growth conditions yield antioxidant-rich oils with a reddish tint. </p><h4>PharmaCielo has recently begun selling in the B2B market. Can you give us some details?</h4><p>4Q2019 is when we flipped the switch to sales mode and announced a medicinal CBD sales agreement with a US distributor that started with an initial shipment of 1,000kg, and plans for continued volume shipments.  In early 2020, we announced distribution within the EU and ongoing discussions with a variety of additional global markets that would complement both, including Mexico where we have an existing joint venture and will be able to act as soon as the government introduces new legislation. We have completed shipments to Switzerland and begun shipping introductory batches of product to various parts of the world, such as Argentina, Italy, and the Czech Republic, among others. </p><h4>How would you characterize PharmaCielo's business model?</h4><p>We are focused on the B2B market. We aim to produce the finest and most cost-effective cannabis ingredients—primarily CBD for now—and sell it to companies who will use our ingredients to make consumer-ready formulations. We see ourselves as the aloe vera of the cannabis industry. In other words, we supply a top-notch ingredient that other companies can put to a variety of creative and beneficial uses. A single kilo of our oil translates into 3,000 to 5,000 SKUs, making it an attractive proposition for companies that develop consumer-ready formulations, particularly when complemented by the PharmaCielo Inside branding that they can license as a statement of quality to their products.</p><h4>Why did you choose Canada as your headquarters?</h4><p>Canada has high standards of financial accountability and oversight. Canada's well-regulated banking system makes it easy to conduct business, and capital markets in Canada made it possible for PharmaCielo to go public. By blending Canada's strengths with our core competencies in Colombia, we've taken the best of both worlds. In all, we view PharmaCielo's “dual citizenship" as one of our strongest assets and differentiators.</p><h4>Where do you see the company going in 2020?</h4><p>2020 is our breakout year. We have devoted the past three years to fine-tuning cultivation and extraction and are ready to turn our attention to producing and selling our products. We will offer a range of oil products including a pure CBD oil, a broad-spectrum oil with THC removed, and a water-soluble CBD oil. Given our low costs, we anticipate a profit in our first year of commercialization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What does this milestone mean for your company?</h4><p>It means we are able to deliver on what we have promised to our investors, which is important at this point in our industry's development. Now, it is about building credibility with investors. Our focus is now on distribution, sales, channels, and investment, so we can grow our business in the US. Hopefully, our investors will look at the sales volumes of Kuida products and see if we can achieve the promise of a global brand. In other exciting news, the government is changing its hesitant stance on THC-based products. It is good to know that the government is finally moving ahead and realizing it needs to meet the milestones investors are waiting for. Getting the THC quota in order is positive and means we can start growing in 4Q2019. Though the government's approval for THC-based products was important, we now have to work on getting the quotas for 2020. </p><h4>You plan to build a clinic called Zerenia. Can you tell us about the model for the clinics you operate?</h4><p>Our company believes in improving people's quality of life with the applied use of cannabis. That translates into what we want to build for our clinics, and Zerenia in particular. Zerenia is an integrated care management clinic where we consider the trifecta of body, mind, and spirit. We are treating patients for conditions like chronic pain or epilepsy holistically. We believe that cannabis is part of that trifecta; it is not the solution to every problem, but in integrated care, cannabis could be a major component for improving lives. There is nothing like Zerenia in Colombia or Latin America. We plan to open it hopefully by the beginning of 2020. It will treat conditions like chronic pain, dermatology, epilepsy, abnormal movements, and sleep deprivation. We hope to do two things through the clinic: show that medical cannabis can be a good medication for certain conditions and demonstrate that integrated care can create a strong relationship between Khiron and its patients.</p><h4>What are your current expansion plans in Latin America?</h4><p>In 2020, we want to focus on countries where favorable regulations are in place. That means Colombia is our number-one priority since it is closest to legalizing cannabis and ensuring we can start prescribing. In Mexico, there are still many steps needed to be able to sell. Our focus is on delivering what we promised patients in Colombia and focus on our Kuida sales in the UK and the US. Finally, we want to continue our process of understanding which countries in Latin America are ready for the sale of medical cannabis. We will focus on execution until that time. It is good that we have created an image of Khiron that will stay for a long time due to our investments in getting our name out to doctors. Good execution across the board will have a big say in 2020. As for the industry in Colombia, it would be great to see more companies on the sales and export sides. That would show investors and the community that faith in Colombia was well-placed. Worldwide, one expectation is Canada and its “Cannabis 2.0.“ We are waiting to see what happens with edibles, vaporizers, and so on. At present, “Cannabis 1.0“ has not been what everyone expected. If Cannabis 2.0 goes ahead in January 2020, and consumers start buying beverages, vaporizers, and topical products, and companies start generating good revenues, it will boost the industry. Overall, market dynamics play a role in valuations. Investors are waiting to see those dynamics going well before they choose which companies to invest in. Regardless, Khiron has to execute its business plan in Colombia. That's the only thing we can control.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[6.3% Share of Total Banking Assets]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[osman-akyuz-secretary-general-participation-banks-association-turkey]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Participation banks in Turkey have ambitious goals to increase their share of total banking assets in the country. How is the TKBB working with different stakeholders to increase this asset base?</h4><p>We set a goal in 2015 to increase participation banks' share of total banking assets to 15% by 2025. By the end of 2019, this figure reached 6.3%. We are working hard to reach this strategic goal with the support of the government. Its support has helped create an environment where participation banking can succeed, with regulations that make it sustainable. Crucially, the government established three participation banks, bringing the total number of participation banks to six and the total number of branches to 1,180. All three private-sector participation banks were originally founded by investors from the GCC region. As the Association, we work with our member banks, government bodies, and the banking authority to establish different working committees that will tackle issues faced by the sector. We are also working with media groups and companies to raise public awareness about participation banking. While we are excited to expand, we want to increase our share in the banking sector gradually and at a healthy pace, so as to remain financially strong. We also established the Central Advisory Board under the TKBB in 2018, which is responsible for setting rules, standards and principles for participation banks and other Islamic financial institutions as well as setting a general framework on Islamic financial matters highlighted by financial authorities.  </p><h4>What was the investor interest in sukuk once it was listed?</h4><p>In Turkey, the public and private sectors issue <em>sukuk</em>, which is locally named as lease certificates. The first lease certificate issued by the government was in 2012 for participation banks to inject liquidity into the system. Now, the government regularly issues lease certificates in Turkey for participation banks, traditional banks, insurance companies, pension funds as well as retail investors. Also, in 2017 the government started to issue an innovative <em>sukuk</em> called “gold-indexed lease certificate" to deepen the domestic market. This new instrument, designed to appeal to the public, aimed to bring the idle gold into the financial system and raise low savings rate in the economy.  As of 2019, the lease certificates that participation banks issue in the local market for their customers can now be securitized and traded in Borsa Istanbul, the national stock exchange of Turkey, which will widen the investor base for the entire participation banking system.</p><h4>What collaboration has emerged from the MoU TKBB signed with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in 2018?</h4><p>The MoU signed between two institutions has paved the way for cooperation between IsDB and our member participation banks. Turkey is an important partner and founding member of the IsDB and continues to be one of the largest beneficiaries of IsDB financing. The Bank provides financing to Turkey and other Islamic countries for big development projects in which IsDB and participation banks collaborate to finance important infrastructure investments, such as highway and bridge projects within Turkey. For example, the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge is a jointly financed project with Kuveyt Türk of EUR200 million. Also, IsDB partners with some of our banks to finance big city hospitals. </p><h4>What role does TKBB hold in bringing together participation banks to jointly finance large-scale projects?</h4><p>The government owned participation banks entered the sector in 2015 and are currently not large enough to enter into infrastructure investments, but with increasing assets over time they are expected to play a role in these investments. As for private participation banks, they have been more active in infrastructure investments, such as energy, healthcare, road and motorway projects. In addition to participation banks, recently, development and investment banks in Turkey have been given the license to conduct Islamic finance operations. This is a critical development in the sector that will have a positive impact on utilizing Islamic finance for infrastructure investments. While jointly financed projects are often beneficial to the public, it can be difficult for individual banks to choose this route over projects on their own. There is much that can be accomplished through collaboration. When our member banks face difficulties, they bring them to our table where we discuss them and take action with the government, the public, or customers. We have the advantage of having only six members, which makes it easier to come together and take a decision to take action. </p><h4>What are your most important goals for 2020?</h4><p>In recent years, good performance of participation banks, increase in <em>sukuk</em> issuances and regulatory reforms have been positive developments for the sector.  We expect the positive developments to continue in 2020, as the participation finance industry continues to be one of the important strategies of the government to promote Istanbul as a financial center and hub for Islamic finance. Our goal is to increase our share in the banking sector and contribute more to the economy. Financing is extremely important for economic growth, which is why we need to support the creation of the participation finance ecosystem in Turkey and take increasing role in the contribution to the country's economy. We are improving and complementing our financial system with an alternative type of banking that we have to promote and keep strong.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Grupo Corporativo Visión evolve from being a business focused on fishing to expanding its presence to other sectors?</h4><p>Grupo Corporativo Visión is a family-owned conglomerate that for many years has focused on producing and exporting sea products, though in recent years it has been exploring the aquaculture and agricultural industries. Our investment portfolio in the industry is fairly diverse and includes companies focused on transforming raw material and exports, aquaculture and agricultural research, as well as other activities in the fields of real estate, technology, communications, and scientific research in molecular biotechnology. We have been exporting food products for over 30 years. We have a strong presence in the tuna segment with products from our territorial sea, shrimp harvested through aquaculture, soups and salads with local products, and, lastly, pet food. Our objective is to grow as a company in sync with the maturity of the food industry. We also want to expand into activities that the natural flow of international business demands.</p><h4>Grupo Corporativo Visión is embarking on a ground-breaking project called Ciudad de la Alimentación (Nourishment City). How was it conceived?</h4><p>Beyond creating more jobs, Ciudad de la Alimentación seeks to develop new sources of raw materials to support our economy in the future by including small aquaculture and agriculture producers and providing training based on scientific and technological research to achieve significant production in small areas. This initiative intends to identify family-owned sustainable production enterprises as the main suppliers of local and exporting food industries. This has earned a positive reputation in domestic and international markets, as it involves responsible practices toward small producers. Investing in research led us to launch pilot plans to grow prawn in greenhouses in an extremely efficient and sustainable manner. Scientific research in molecular biotechnology is the backbone of the project in order to find and apply improvements in every possible aspect of production. As a result of the application of these biotechnological tools, greater and better production is expected both in terms of quantity and quality. These seek to perfect the existent components of each element involved in the various production lines. So far, for instance, we have increased productivity by 32 times compared to extensive and traditional shrimp aquaculture. Also, by using the intensive bioengineered method, we ensure that neither the water used nor the water put back into the sea is polluted. We have invested in our labs to package a solution for small or medium-size producers to enable them to maximize their production and link their products to greater commercial value chains. More than a place, Ciudad de la Alimentación is a concept of evolution reengineering regarding the way the agroindustry sector should evolve through technology, added to an efficient logistic, industry, and market coordination.</p><h4>What products do you hope to add to the current list of exported Ecuadorian products through this project?</h4><p>We are currently exploring the market to find products of high unmet international demand that can be sustainably produced and delivered seasonally, fresh and of a high quality. For example, Fashion watermelons and Adora tomatoes are produced and sold in Europe. These are produced in a standardized manner to ensure they look, taste, and feel the same. We are reproducing this model, although this is a long-term, multigenerational project. There is already a roadmap developed in which we have defined the stages of the project. First, we need to identify the high-value products that would have a sustainable market even after accounting for logistical expenses. Then, we will start producing these existing and proven products and contribute to their global supply. Finally, we hope to create our own brand with vegetal and/or animal products under this trend. These products would also benefit from Ecuador's current push to establish more trade agreements to promote the country's products to international markets.</p><h4>What is the timeline for the construction of Ciudad de la Alimentación? </h4><p>Investment and development of the project has started in the form of the research facilities and work underway. We hope that over the course of 2020 we can launch the commercial production of shrimp. We already do it on a small scale, since we have 3,000sqm of sustainable and freshwater prawns. From there, we know there will be great interest from private groups, and we expect to grow to 500ha in the next four or five years under these production models.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Security Industry: 1.8% of GDP]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[daniel-espinosa-avila-general-director-serviseg]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perspective of the security market in Mexico?</h4><p>I predict the industry to grow significantly, although today it represents 1.8% of GDP. Prevailing insecurity in the nation gives us a great business opportunity. And while it is sad to think that this reality spells growth potential, such is the situation. In the face of uncertainty, we will continue working and investing in Mexico, and we have to bet on the country. This is also what I know how to do in my country. This is not an industry one can readily transplant elsewhere. Many foreign companies that wanted to invest in this industry in Mexico have failed. And conversely, if we do not know the business elsewhere, I see no sense in looking further afield for now. One of our goals is to internationalize, but we have to consolidate in Mexico first. We do not know what will happen, and without understanding the government strategy, it is difficult to continue selling to the state. We therefore continue working with the private sector.</p><h4>How has the change of administration impacted your business?</h4><p>For us, it has been difficult given the lack of clarity on how it will work now. We do not understand the government's perspective and have made the decision to shelve our business with the government until we have a clearer perspective. We are now focused more on the private sector as a result and are merely completing preexisting public sector contracts.</p><h4>In which sector have you seen the most demand?</h4><p>Our strong point is airports and airlines, which represents 80% of our portfolio. The mining industry has grown and has sought our assistance, as has the industrial sector. It operates on regulations different from those applying to airports, and the onus is more on attention on people and the prevention of accidents. In mid 2018, we also started working with certain mines in Ciudad Obregon with ArcelorMittal, where we began with a project to improve safety. We did a study of what we could improve and started what has become a very successful project in September.</p><h4>What are your international expansion plans?</h4><p>We have been looking to expand for four or five years, though we must first consolidate in Mexico. I personally began to explore potential expansion possibilities, visiting the US, but I came up against barriers to entry that were not easy to avoid. An American partner with experience in the sector is required, which can complicate matters. Then I started exploring South America. I liked the prospect of Panama, which is experiencing healthy growth. We started activities there with training and registered interest in airport issues. We subsequently established a joint venture. In 2019, we did nothing because we focused on celebrating 25 years in business. For 2020, we want to revisit the market and assess where the opportunities for us lie.</p><h4>Among the lessons learned in the security market, what are the most common mistakes that companies make?</h4><p>One of the most serious problems that I see happening is the lack of training. If companies do not train people who serve customers, they will look elsewhere as their needs are not being met. We train people based on customer needs. Airports have specific training because they operate according to international regulations, while the mining industry requires separate training altogether. One projects that is close to being realized is a training center where we will train not only Serviseg employees, but also external individuals.</p><h4>When do you plan to open the center?</h4><p>Today, we are operating with Serviseg people because we can only train our own employees, having yet to obtain certification to train others. In 2019, we received National Council of Standardization and Certification of Labor Skills (CONOCER) certification enabling us to become an evaluation center and are working to establish a laboratory. I anticipate its launch in February 2020 at Mexico City airport, where we have offices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you walk us through the evolution of the Future Institute of Higher Education and Training since it was founded?<br></strong>Since its foundation in 1991, this institute has constantly played a crucial role in empowering young Saudis, constantly expanding in terms of geographical presence, clients' profile, courses offering and accreditations. Our dual goal is to increase the employment rate among skilled Saudis and ensure a higher rate of competent and qualified Saudis enter the workforce. In order to achieve these objectives, the institute had to undergo a constant process of innovation to adapt to a dynamic, changing business environment, especially since the announcement of Vision 2030. The changes and progress within the organization are clear. From being a center, it became an institute offering recognized diplomas; from offering courses just in Jeddah, we are now present in other cities such as Riyadh and Medina; from training only women, it now trains both female and male workers; from being known for its training in creative development, it now offers courses in over 65 different areas; and from being mainly focused on B2C channels, it is establishing a more thorough B2B avenue that offers over 50 programs for companies within different sectors can benefit from. The institute never stopped advancing and improving to raise the standards of the broader education segment of the country.</p><p><strong>What helped the institute to remain active and adjust to the rapid changes in the education and work environment?<br></strong>Over its 28-year history, the Future Institute has become so much more than an education facility, developing into a vital tool for helping women enter a wide range of the country's workforce. We have pioneered courses for women in a range of areas, recognizing and forecasting areas in which women would soon be permitted to work. This foresight has enabled Future to grow into the market leader for educating women. </p><p><strong>What assessment methods does the institute provide?<br></strong>For our B2C segment, we have a benchmark that serves as a general standard, but we work with people in a hands-on way in order to ensure their personal development. At times, different candidates need different instructions based on what you are trying to teach and depending on their learning styles. Our main body of students are working professionals or entrepreneurs, but we do have some university students who come here to complement their knowledge, so clearly there has to be a specialized approach to each one of them. With regard to our B2B channel, we work closely with companies to understand what exactly their employees need to have learned at the end of the course. </p><p><strong>Looking at the medium term, what are your strategic priorities, and how do you seek to achieve them?<br></strong>Our strategy remains focused on expanding regardless of the status of the economy. The country will always need qualified workforce, and our duty is to maintain a constant supply of skilled candidates. As such, we are trying to break into the B2G training space, an area traditionally difficult to gain a foothold in. I have worked with the Ministry of Education in the past, but even if you have developed a relationship with various ministries, there is a tendency in the government to hire people from abroad. This is an pattern that we would like to change, since there is a great deal of potential in our local training firms. We need to see the government tap into these local resources more. On the industry side, hospitality is an area we are interested in, because of its size and growth projections. As such, we are planning to add professional hospitality training to our offerings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major highlights over the last year?<br></strong><span></span>The country is working hard on intangible assets, such as knowledge, education, and future skills that can help companies adapt to the future. As we enter the Industry 4.0 revolution, there is a need to impart different skills for tools such as the internet and even newer media in this complex environment. The educational sector has to play a major role in this transition, focusing on peer-to-peer learning, social interactions, and the exchange of information, as promoted by corporate workshops. The more one learns, the easier it becomes to adapt to the future.</p><p><strong>Which technologies will have a major impact on education and the corporate segment and why?<br></strong>Different technologies could play different roles, but the exchange of knowledge will help decision-makers understand the main obstacles they could face with AI. It will allow them to capture qualitative and quantitative data to help them measure trends. The main skill needed now is programming and adopting different languages. We need to teach children from an early age. Private schools have started working on this, though our focus should be on teaching such skills at the primary level. That will help students adjust to new languages.</p><p><strong>How can teachers stay one step ahead of their students?<br></strong>It is complicated, but teachers need to update their mindsets by learning new skills, such as analyzing and capturing data and improving communication and interaction with students. They need data and smart analysis tools to strike a balance with students who are born using these technologies. Teachers need to have the ability to incorporate these skills quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to use this data properly?<br></strong>We need to know what affects the education sector. New technologies such as AI will help companies and decision-makers analyze the information coming in from all these different sources. To help companies adopt AI, we have to remove some barriers and obstacles, such as the fear people have in adopting new technologies. You need to understand the implications of implementing AI in terms of security, for example. To manage this issue, take full advantage of AI, and understand its limits, there needs to be increased transparency, awareness, and literacy around AI technology. In this sense, private organizations need to know more about the threats of cyber attacks. They have to take it seriously.</p><p><strong>What role will people play in the new processes established by the advent of new technologies?<br></strong>People need to learn new skills and add more value to the output of machines. The human component will only become more important at the advanced stages. After we gain insights from new technologies, we need to know how to harness more output and create new ideas. These ideas could lead to further improvements. To get to that point, we have to focus on providing the tools to learn new skills, make use of the data, be more innovative, create more projects, and add value to the latest technologies.</p><p><strong>What are the priorities for Education E-solutions?<br></strong>In 2019, our main focus is to learn about the side skills that the students need to acquire to develop virtual/augmented reality content. Instead of relying on suppliers, we want to provide tools that can help people create content. This will help us integrate our own system, adopt, and shape it to fit specific needs. We want to focus on peer-to-peer communication, which will accelerate the adoption of new technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the major updates since we last met in early 2018?<br></strong>We are working toward to Vision 2030. We are trying to keep up with digital learning, computer-based exams, and virtual classrooms. We now have a master's program in clinical pharmacy, approved by the Ministry of Education. </p><p><strong>Looking at tertiary care, how can Saudi nationals be encouraged to undergo surgery and specialized medical services in Saudi Arabia rather than traveling abroad?</strong><br>Tertiary care is an expensive service. From the private sector point of view, you can provide the service only if there are paying customers, which means that developing tertiary care will not be an easy process by the private sector. The government sector has tertiary care, but it will be complex for the public and private sector to build both the required infrastructure and attract the customer base. </p><p><strong>Do you think medical insurance implementation would strike a balance between profitability and wider access to care? <br></strong>Insurance, which is still a new concept for Saudis, will make the patient suffer. Unfortunately, the patient will be looked at primarily as a customer rather than an individual who needs healthcare. Profit motive will override the sector's focus on care, as has happened in many countries. Cost will become the dominant consideration in medical care. There is the potential, too, for people to go bankrupt due to medical expenses that they cannot afford. For this reason, insurance privatization can have unintended negative consequences for people, as insurance companies want to make a profit with the bare minimum of services. Insurance companies will deny coverage whenever they can. The patient, at the end of the day, will be a number. The people who have money will get treatment and the people who do not will only get a minimum level of care. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you position your university in the academic landscape of the Kingdom in terms of faculty?<br></strong>PSU will emphasize its strengths and focus on graduate employability, the quality of its faculty, the degree programs we offer, recruitment of talented and diverse students, and focus on graduating young men and women who land good jobs. In brief, PSU is focused on graduating employable young professional for rewarding careers in their fields. They will also be informed citizens. These graduates and our programs play a vital role in the ongoing implementation of Vision 2030. As for the PSU faculty, the university is proud of the diversity and strengths of its national and international faculty. In the run up to laying down the themes and goals in 2016 for PSU's 2018-2023 strategic plan, faculty members knew they had to increase the quality and frequency of scholarly publications, as well as participate in more conferences. </p><p><strong>What is your vision for preparing students for the jobs of the future in the digital economy?<br></strong>The final course bachelor's students take is the cooperative program. It is a rigorous, seven-month-long, hands-on training program held at leading firms, local and international, in the Kingdom. It is meant to narrow the gap between what students learn in the classroom on their path to the workplace. It is difficult to see how things will play out because of digital technology. As for the digital economy, that will reduce or eliminate jobs in many traditional places of work, including shopping malls, banks, offices, and increase inequality. So what are the jobs of the future? Will those jobs pay living wages to cover the costs of owning a home and having a family in a future where healthcare, social security, and education are privatized? These are questions that going digital, on its own, does not address. </p><p><strong>What is your vision for the use of technology in academia?<br></strong>Big consulting firms say that remote learning will become a bigger trend, but we do not see it, and there are plenty of examples of failure. Student and faculty engagement, along with in-person conversations and projects, are what make a successful education. Huddling in a dark room with a headset on is not the way to go. The human touch and human interactions are the quintessential ingredients to a quality education. That being said, PSU has and will continue to explore, critique, and make decisions on how to best utilize blended learning or pass on certain types of tech. </p><p><strong>What is your agenda in terms of the internationalization of staff, students, and programs?<br></strong>PSU has a number of formal and informal agreements with distinguished schools. The university offers a range of study abroad opportunities for a year, a term, or as an intensive summer school course. On another front, each year there are two-week cultural-immersion summer programs, each in a different country. A week or longer is spent with one or more hosting universities with the balance spent exploring the countryside and metro areas, interacting and learning the culture from locals. PSU Model United Nations and Moot Court teams on both campuses go abroad to compete. PSU also runs a number of imported skills building programs such as the intensive soft skills Fullbridge boot camp program for graduating students, ABA ROLI legal training programs for students and the Law College faculty, and British Higher Education Academy training for PSU faculty.	<br>			<br><strong>What are your strategic priorities and primary ambitions for the years ahead?<br></strong>As the first private university in the country, the university rose to the challenge in 1999 and will continue to pioneer and champion private higher education. PSU has headed into its third decade in higher education with confidence. In April 2018, the university was awarded a seven-year NCAAA Institutional academic accreditation. This is the third time we have won this accreditation. Our strategic priorities and primary ambitions for the years ahead are to stand out as a model of excellence in private higher education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Where do you position IAU within the higher education landscape of Saudi Arabia?<br></strong>IAU was established as a separate university in 2009 and was previously a campus of KFU. IAU has four major clusters of interest: health sciences, engineering and technology, computer and business administration, and humanities. Health sciences and architecture are two of our main specializations. Under each of these clusters is a number of colleges, so the cluster of health sciences, for example, has eight colleges. Under each college are several programs, some of which are unique in the sense that no other university in Saudi Arabia offers them. Our college of applied medical sciences offers a specialization in cardiac technology, and ours is the only department that graduates Saudi female students specialized in this area. We are also the only Saudi university where female students specialize in neuroscience.</p><p><strong>What is your vision of the computer sciences cluster, and how are you preparing graduates for the jobs of the future?<br></strong>In general, transformation is a must for all higher education systems. In Saudi Arabia, universities are the primary need. This is not only because of globalization, but also because of the advancements in communication and technology, the big drivers of change. With Vision 2030, the current leadership aims to diversify the Saudi economy, and the completion of all the strategic objectives under Vision 2030 depend an intellectual human capital. This means changes have to take place across all domains of universities, such as academic, research, community service, and innovation and entrepreneurship. Equally important, changes have to be made across all components of the education system, such as admission, accessibility, teaching strategies, the curriculum, and assessment and evaluation. We are living in the digital revolution and are coming ever so close to the fourth industrial revolution. AI, IT, machine learning, and other changes will reshape the future of the workforce. Therefore, we need graduates capable of facing future challenges. One of the issues university graduates face is lifelong learning because in the future, a worker may change jobs three or four times throughout their career. We need to keep this in consideration moving forward.</p><p><strong>Do your enrolment figures reflect the trend of high female enrolment across the country?<br></strong>Our university is rather unique, as 70% of our students are female. In the past, female education was under a different unit but we took the decision to merge male and female higher education. Some universities looked at this as a burden, though we realized it was a positive push for us. Throughout our history, we have had many capable and committed Saudi female faculty members, and some of our achievements in terms of international accreditation are due to their hard work. Also, 70% of our faculty members are female, so women are well represented in our boards and administration. We have female deans and vice deans and a female vice rector. They share all decision-making and strategic planning duties; women are integral members of our community.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for the future?<br></strong>The total number of students in the university is currently around 35,000. Health sciences constitutes a large part of the structure of the university and we currently seek to complete a new hospital that we plan to operate soon. This will be a part of a biomedical valley in the future which will include the hospital, a research center, a family community center, and pharmaceutical and biomedical engineering companies. We have almost 850,000sqm of land where the new hospital is being built, and we will turn this land into a medical city in the future. Already, we have finished the hospital, research center, and building for community medicine, and at present, we are constructing the neuroscience building. Next, we will build a biomedical park where we can perform and apply research in collaboration with companies. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>KFUPM registered a total of 237 patents in 2018. Could you tell us more about your strategies in place to have this ecosystem where research leads to new ideas?<br></strong>After KFUPM completed development of its research infrastructure and processes, it embarked on developing an ecosystem for innovation that helps in translating research outcomes into economic impact. To achieve this, KFUPM planned to spread the culture of academic innovation at its campus. The plans included increasing awareness about intellectual property, providing training in patenting to faculty, researchers, and students, and stimulating them to innovate through recognition/reward system. Additionally, the university established a technology transfer system according to best practices of US universities, which included an effective invention/discovery disclosure system that linked every research activity with a patenting process. These are major factors behind positioning KFUPM among the top universities in the world in terms of number of annual issued patents. Research excellence and a focus on KSA's strategic technological challenges and needs, quality, and commercialization of research outcomes are other important aspects of KFUPM's research system. </p><p><strong>What kind of research does KFUPM do? <br></strong>With regard to research excellence, though KFUPM started by building its capacity locally through providing training to its faculty, it collaborated internationally on specific research programs with MIT, Stanford, Caltech, and Cambridge. We established Dhahran Techno-Valley (DTV) Science Park to bring in some of world's most advanced industrial expertise. DTV Science Park succeeded in attracting the R&amp;D centers of some of the world's largest multinational corporations in energy, petroleum upstream, and industrial instrumentation, automation, and control. This was a major approach toward strategically focusing KFUPM's research and creating a platform for collaboration with industries on topics of the utmost importance to KSA. Creating impact out of research outcomes is another area KFUPM gave special attention to in developing the innovation ecosystem. This is why the university invested in building a system and an environment for technology commercialization. </p><p><strong>Originally focused on the extraction and processing of natural resources, you have expanded your scope across a range of programs including renewables. Could you tell us more about those?</strong><br>The KFUPM research agenda includes programs for both conventional and unconventional energies. Though KFUPM established the College of Petroleum and Geosciences with the aim to position it among the top petroleum schools globally, no less attention is being given to renewables and sustainability. The university has a research excellence center for renewable energy, and there is a critical level of research activities in the renewables field. In the same direction, KFUPM signed a major agreement with King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) to collaborate mainly in the field of renewables. Additionally, the university has an advanced center for water and environment studies. The center caters to a significant part of the country's applied research needs and services, and Saudi Aramco is one of its major clients. As well, the university established a research center for water desalination, as KSA is one of the leading global consumers for desalination technologies. Among the technologies licensed by KFUPM is one to purify heavily contaminated water and another to detect water leaks. A large percentage of the portfolio of KFUPM research outcomes—in terms of either publications or patents—is in the fields of renewables, water, and environmental protection.</p><p><strong>What are the main goals for the coming years?<br></strong>Improving the quality of undergraduate education is a continuous goal for KFUPM. Making sure that university graduates have a good number of job opportunities and fulfilling current and future recruitment needs of strategic local industries and sectors is part of the plan. KFUPM had been a research-based university for several decades. However, recently the university started planning to become a research-intensive university. This will enable us to reach a critical level of research activities that is necessary for achieving the university's economic impact targets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does UBT regard technological advancements in its work?<br></strong>Technology in education is essential. It has created efficiency on a large scale. We introduced technology at all levels, from curriculum to operations, and our next international advisory board in November 2019 will discuss the so-called “technolution," or technology evolution. It is all about how technology will take the level of education from where we are today into the future. We have around 20 chairmen, chancellors, directors, and global experts coming to discuss the role of technology and how we can move beyond standard, classic, instructional-type education to a new model, and how that will look in 2030. This advisory board will address what we need to start now to be able to lead tomorrow. The international advisory board is dedicated to UBT, and at every session we have a different topic for which UBT seeks answers. The question on technology will be dealt with in November under the framework of technolution.</p><p><strong>UBT designed an activity-based costing module called Quswa Academics to measure its performance. How has that product influenced your work?</strong><br>The word Quswa means “maximization," and we maximize the output of the five following factors: the book, the classroom, students, teachers, and the curriculum. This process of internal standards is significantly more difficult than accreditation. Every program at UBT is reviewed every semester, and we track those five factors. We track the evaluations of students against the faculty and faculty against senior faculty. We also track the relevance of the curriculum against local needs. Projects that are related to Vision 2030, for example, are being introduced to provide greater relevance and bridge the gap between theory and the actual requirements in the job market. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has emphasized he wants to focus on local content and increase it, and we take that to mean local military manufacturing, local plastic manufacturing, and also not to exclude local case studies for the academic sector to use. In many universities, data like that which we have from Quswa is only compiled for accreditation purposes, not actually taken into consideration. They do not drive a strategy or create a vision. We are keen to develop that strategy. Because one cannot develop something without measuring it, we had to come up with Quswa Academics, Quswa Operations, and Quswa Manpower. Everything must be challenged, and the only qualification is data; it drives everything. We have followed market practices and intuition more than data in the past, though that has no longer been the case for UBT since 2015. </p><p><strong>How does Vision 2030 inform your viewpoint and approach in the sector?<br></strong>Vision 2030 shifts the weight from the public sector to the private, enabling the latter to become a giant by 2030, introducing many new industries including sports and entertainment for both men and women to boost the economy, and creating holdings that fund other projects where the private sector can contribute. Personally, I have never been more optimistic in my life. The solutions may not be there yet, though the decisions will be made quickly. The higher education sector needs drastic change, and we truly need the Crown Prince's intervention, especially when it comes to educational loans. We do not need open-ended scholarship programs for the majority of high school graduates. They help the business model but have a long-term negative impact on educational quality. </p><p><strong>Looking to the future, are there any challenges you want to highlight?<br></strong>Despite the efforts and attempts made by concerned ministries and government bodies to enhance the quality of private education and training institutions, private education still faces challenges and is burdened by outdated bureaucratic procedures, overlapping regulations, and duplications in authority from and between different regulation bodies related to private education and training. We need to resolve this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Amongst the primary objectives of Vision 2030 include having five Saudi universities in global top 200 rankings. What role do you see for ETEC to drive this agenda?<br></strong>ETEC has considered three strategic objectives to leverage the academic excellence and support these national efforts. These include enhancing learning outcomes by increasing the coverage, scope and quality of national assessments and tests; promoting excellence between education and training institutions and programs by development and expansion of evaluation and accreditation; and establishing a culture of quality, continuous improvement, and innovation in the education and training system. Each objective has been translated through KPIs, targets, and strategic initiatives. The strategic initiatives associated with each strategic objectives include developing and enforcing national assessments and tests for higher education learning outcomes and readiness of graduates; guiding and promoting excellence between higher education institutions and programs through evaluation and accreditation; improving education and training by monitoring and reporting the quality and status of education and training system; and engaging stakeholders to promote excellence and improve the education and training system.</p><p><strong>How do you help improve graduate employability, and how should critical thinking and other soft skills be instilled in students?<br></strong>Aligning graduate employability with Vision 2030 is essential to achieve the national masterplan. Our children entering schools today will become youths in 2030, and we will have to prepare them for jobs that have not yet been created, technologies that have not yet been invented, and problems that have not yet emerged. To address these challenges, ETEC has involved all stakeholders from the public, private, and third sectors to identify the skills and values that students need to develop and shape their future. We incorporated these skills and values into the K-12 curriculum framework and standards, which include, for example, critical thinking, problem-solving, and ICT skills, communication, self-learning, and collaboration. Also, schools' evaluation standards place more emphasis on the teaching and learning practices that equip students with 21st-century skills. For higher education, we stress the importance of employability skills through accreditation standards and processes for both institutional and program accreditations. </p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year?<br></strong>ETEC's strategic priorities and ambitions for the coming year are driven by its strategy developed in alignment with assigned goals, Vision 2030 objectives, and the Human Capital Development Program. The assigned goals for ETEC are to design, set up, and deploy the assigned initiatives within the development program; enhance standards and frameworks for assessment, evaluation, qualifications, and accreditations; develop capacity for assessment and evaluating of education and training programs and outcomes; support national efforts to promote and deploy licensing of education and training system professionals; and take forward the ongoing work of enhancing ETEC's efficiency as an integrated entity as decreed by the royal resolution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Kodiak's 23 years of experience translate into its added value offering to companies? How important is the Colombian market for your portfolio?</h4><p>For us, diversity in services and working with different cultures in many countries allows us to fit in with the culture. We train our people in a more effective way to complement our personalized services. We can respond to clients much faster than larger service companies. We make decisions quickly and do not have that massive bureaucracy. Our people come from the field, so they have the technical experience therefore anyone at any level can answer questions directly to get things moving. This is important in Colombia, which is a focal point for us. The market has turned around, and the potential is enticing. Colombia is number one on our radar for the next two to three years. Other countries are of interest, but it is too soon. We were present at the 2019 Oil and Gas Congress in Colombia, which seemed significantly more positive than previous ones. There was much more optimism. I found it interesting that key people from oil companies actually went out of their way to make inquiries into our services and proposition; the operators are really opening their doors more for other opportunities or ways to do business. There is real opportunity for growth with these companies.</p><h4>What is your client portfolio like in Colombia, and how do you plan to reach new customers?</h4><p>We work for pretty much everyone, and our portfolio is fairly decent. We have struggled to get in with Ecopetrol due to timing of contracts. In 2020, more contracts are coming up, and we will participate in those bid rounds. We will continue to focus on specialty services and optimization of procedures. Many times, in Colombia, things have been done the same way for a long period of time. There are new procedures now that can minimize costs and optimize the turnaround times on wells. That will increase profits and get wells back online faster. We also like to train local qualified people. When these projects are started, experts need to be brought in to oversee the processes. At some point, we will have a few expatriates overseeing operations, with everyone else being local.</p><h4>What key aspects allow you to offer solutions that optimize the success of exploration, completion, and production of oil and gas wells?</h4><p>Experience is certainly one, but certain specialty services are also important. We can plug abandonments without pulling tubing, for example. There are different ways in which we can provide solutions that are much more cost effective. We like to keep a good inventory of tools that people normally do not have locally and want to prevent downtime at the rigs. We have a special license for non-explosive cutting tools for pipe and do not need to wait for military approval to move explosives. We can move in five minutes!</p><h4>How easy has it been to work with the large players of Colombia, considering the complex geography?</h4><p>You need to approach every area a little differently. We have worked in every corner of Colombia in the last seven years. We have achieved some good experience. We have our operating bases in Aguachica, Villagarzón, Cota, and are adding another one in Yopal. We have worked on wells in all these areas, and each has been completely different. Different people are needed on each site. Moving equipment can be difficult at times, that is one of the reasons we do the satellite bases. We want to service clients and have decent response times. Colombia is a small country but traveling within the country takes a long time. That is why equipment needs to be strategically placed in the right areas to avoid downtime. It also helps with security and people. The potential within the regions depends on the clients and their focuses. We are fortunate to have enough clients that we can stay busy in most areas. Another advantage that we have is the presence of Canadian and US companies here. They trust our experience, and we speak the same language. We have a slight advantage with the Canadian oil companies for that reason. If they have a problem in a well, generally they only call us.</p><h4>There are many projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and the Colombian Caribbean with offshore exploration. How can that positively impact operations?</h4><p>We pretty much focus on land other than our fluids management division. That side already looked after the fluids engineering, solids control and waste management on the Anadarko offshore in Colombia a few years ago and we plan to get back out there. Generally, it takes 18-24 months to bring those wells online. The long-term issue could be if they had huge success, and there was a great deal of oil. We all know what that does, below USD50, Colombia is not the greatest place, which is true of most places. Ideally, USD70 oil is the best for everyone; let us hope that we get there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on your recent projects where you partnered with African Capital Alliance (ACA) to fill the housing gap in Nigeria?</h4><p>The project that we are working on with ACA is part of our middle management “affordable luxury"  development. We have nearly completed  phase one and plan to hand it over by mid-March. This project has been quite  successful despite the bad timing, bearing in mind that we started in the middle of an unprecedented recession; however, from an economical point of view, this project is not so profitable. The margins in the luxury sector are much higher. The difference in cost between the luxury and the middle income developments is mainly due the cost of land  and the cost finishing which combined represent about 50% to 60% of the total cost of development. The remaining 40% of one's costs remain the same which represent the cost of the structure. While the costs can vary by 30% to 40 %, the sale price can vary by up to 100%. So the price of high end luxury development can be up to twice the price of a middle income one.  </p><h4>Why did you venture into providing affordable housing targeted at the middle-class audience?</h4><p>Our decision was more of a strategic nature than anything else. The middle income market is by far the largest in terms of numbers. Our association with a private equity fund such as ACA is also strategic and aims at the long term.</p><h4>What projects have you been involved in your luxury segment since 2018, and where does your main clientele stem from?</h4><p>We just sold out the a top end high luxury development and still get inquiries coming in every day. We are starting another one of the same caliber so as to remain active in this sector. This luxury sector is what defines us, and this is where we have our competitive advantage. Today, we have clients who just want to buy in our developments despite the recession mainly because the value for money we provide. Our clients are mostly Nigerians with a few permanent expats or what I would call expat Nigerians, mainly Lebanese and Indians. We do not have any international buyers; most multi-nationals do not invest residential in real estate.</p><h4>How would you assess the current construction sector in Nigeria?</h4><h4></h4><p>The sector is on the rebound picking up gradually. We are quite busy in the residential, and industrial sectors. The industrial sector has actually been quite active despite the recession; in fact, it never really went into recession. All of the industrialists that we have been working with have been expanding throughout the recession.</p><h4>What is your view on PPPs?</h4><p>Currently it is the best way that projects can be done because the direct approach has not been quite so successful. I am a strong believer in public/private sector cooperation. Our project in Lekki is slightly delayed because we could not get our glazing in time due mainly to the port congestion. Logistics companies are buying plots with access to the lagoon to create their own terminals because they cannot get their goods through the port. The situation is really alarming. The best way to address these problems is via PPP. The same applies to the power sector, Currently unavailability of reliable power supply is the main inhibitor to the industrialization of the economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector and your key priorities in 2020?</h4><p>I believe in the Nigerian factor; no matter how bad it gets, Nigeria just keeps on going. Nigerians very resilient and creative. Entrepreneurship is the Nigerian DNA , they will always find a way to make things work. We have a formal economy that is sluggish according to kinds or reports, and there is an informal economy that is booming. We operate in that informal economy, so in our tiny microcosm, business is booming. Despite the gloomy national picture, we and everyone around us are expanding their capacities. The population is expanding, and we have a young, bright population that is hardworking. They are yearning for success and are ready to work hard for it, which is extremely important. So in summary our outlook for 2020 is very bullish.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[200,000 customers in 2019]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the origin and evolution of the company over six year ago and what are its chief activities?</h4><p>Aldro is a energy retailer and service provider that was born five years ago within the PITMA Group, led by Alfredo Pérez y Pedro Ortiz. PITMA was founded 25 years ago and today operates principally in five business areas: telecommunications, security, energy, commercial services, and a wide range of business services, ranging from the documentary custody to the management of urban mobility or insurance. Aldro was born to bring to life ideas within the group, such as assembling the technical part of a marketer to give continuity to what we had started. The first electricity sale was done in 2014, and in 2015, we started with retail gas. In 2016, the company stabilized, and we launched the energy efficiency line. In 2017, we had a plan to enter Portugal, so we started to process permits. The business in Portugal exploded in 2018, while the business in Spain is also doing well.</p><h4>In six years, the company has achieved almost 200,000 customers and billed EUR600 million in 2019. What is your winning strategy?</h4><p>We have a good price on the market, we are transparent, and we are close to our customers; in addition, we are also very adaptable. Adaptability is one of our strong points. Aldro is not a company assembled by electricians, economists, or engineers; it is a marketer assembled by sellers to sell. The DNA of PITMA is in Aldro, bringing us closer to the customer and making us attentive to building what the client needs at any time. We adapt to the needs of users.</p><h4>Aldro Energí­a focus on domestic clients but SMEs take a strong part of your portfolio. From which sectors do your clients come from?</h4><p>Half of our contracts are from households, and half are with SMEs. However, the more intensive load curves and greater powers are installed in SMEs and large companies, and they therefore represent a bigger part of our income. We cover the entire world of gas and electricity consumers, from the small consumer who has a domestic contract to public administrations or large companies that choose much more complex products.</p><h4>What are your expectations from the new government, and what does Aldro expect from the public sector?</h4><p>We wish the new government great success in its energy policies, because it will be the success of all. We would like these policies to be developed in an environment of total agreement to provide stability beyond legislature. The energy transition should be driven by a breakthrough in technology that makes it possible to reduce the cost of emission-free energies, give consumers an increasingly active role, and ensures competition in the market, which will result in more competitive prices for consumers. We would like to propose that the government establish a maximum period for consumer complaints to be resolved, forcing both marketers and distributors to create a centralized information platform that is not managed by traditional power companies, like other countries around us are doing; enable the orderly deployment of smart meters for SMEs and businesses so that such customers can also have more accurate information on their consumption; and promote self-consumption and distributed management by regulating the figure of the demand aggregator. In the case of gas, we would like to increase the liquidity of the organized market in order to introduce more competition.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of Aldro Zero, and what are its expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Aldro Zero is a firm commitment of the Group towards renewable energy. It is intended to be the future platform for all the final customer green energy developments including renewable energy retailing as well as self-production plants, energy efficiency and other services. 2020 will be the year of its implementation in the market and we have big expectations on how it is going to be.

		<title><![CDATA[Consumer Needs of Saudi Youth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tamer-mosalam-vp-bu-general-manager-pepsico]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the positive changes in Saudi Arabia regarding entertainment events affected the company's operations?</h4><p>Before the launch of the Saudi Vision 2030, the Kingdom's economy was facing a number of challenges, especially in the fast moving consumer goods sector.  Following the launch of Vision 2030 we saw increased appetite for both local and foreign investments to support the implementation and execution of this ambitious and bold reform agenda impacting all facets of like in the Kingdom. Changing consumer taste and needs triggered a change in strategy from companies including ours to address and deliver what consumers were looking for at the right value.  First, we adapted to different revenue management strategies and created affordable price points to keep up with consumer behavior. Second, we established initiatives on a store level that brought back lost previous consumers, including marketing campaigns to support our core brands. Of course, the Kingdom's entertainment calendar is a great enabler since entertainment led to consumers being on-the-go seeking new out-of-home experiences, which in turn drove consumer consumption.</p><h4>How is PepsiCo keeping up with the trends of consumer needs?</h4><p>We have introduced initiatives recently in order to evolve our product portfolio with better taste, lower calories and reduced or no added sugar. For example, in 2019 we launched Pepsi Black, a new bold taste aimed at consumers looking for a no-sugar soft drink. It is still in its early days, but we are encouraged by our consumers' reaction to the launch in the Kingdom and the wider MENA region. Our portfolio today offers consumers variety on both beverages and snacks. When it comes to snacks, we have Lay's Forno that has 60% less fat and our entry into the nuts &amp; seeds category through our brand Sunbites, and the oats categories through Quaker. PepsiCo is strongly supporting the the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) in its ambitious Healthy Food and Strategy and we are proud of our partnership with them to drive a healthier diet and lifestyle in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What are the key drivers that influence customer demand and how will this help PepsiCo align with Saudi Vision 2030?</h4><p>Younger generations are mandating new rules. When you have a population like Saudi Arabia, 36.7% of them between 15 and 341, it is the youth that will drive the market, since they are bolder and willing to try new things. They are also demanding and vocal about their needs, which means product innovation needs to be dynamic at all times. This also allows us to be working for Saudi Vision 2030 delivering on two levels. The first is female empowerment, since women in Saudi Arabia play a fundamental role in delivering not only the Vision but in a complete social transformation. The second is to deliver on that social transformation and sponsoring equity, and how that will synchronize with Saudi Arabia's new entertainment calendar. The calendar will hopefully bring about mass participation in activities and sports, and with it, out-of-home consumption opportunities.</p><h4>PepsiCo's Tamakani program was launched to empower female Saudi entrepreneurs. What will this entail for the women in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Tamakani was started through sponsoring the movie Rise, which speaks about the journey of women in Saudi Arabia. It is about the evolution of Saudi Arabia, and how it went from first excluding women to increasing their participation after many changes took place. Then, the idea evolved into two parts: how we could improve the labor skills of women to give them a better chance in the professional market, and how we could develop the entrepreneurship skills of young female graduates. To address this, we partnered with three major Universities in Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah. Our partner in this initiative is INJAZ Al-Arab, a non-profit organization preparing young, talented entrepreneurs in project management and entrepreneurship. We are secondly encouraging both females and males to be advocates for women's rights. The third part is about sustainability, setting that as a theme for professional endeavors, which is a great story for the country as well. With these instruments, the Tamakani program will deliver strong results.</p><h4>What are your major sustainability programs currently? </h4><p>Sustainability is key to the PepsiCo agenda. We continue to find innovative and new ways to grow PepsiCo business while using fewer natural resources. We have made considerable progress by embedding environmental sustainability into all facets of our operations. In Saudi Arabia - the hub for our snacks business - we produce the highest quality of potatoes, and export snacks to 10 markets in the Middle East, including the UAE. In 2019 PepsiCo increased the recycling rate by 25% resulting in almost 85% of our total waste from the plants being put to reuse. We have a powerful agriculture program, in which 100% of the potatoes used for products sold in Saudi Arabia are sourced in the Kingdom. Therefore, instead of importing all our production material, we are localizing 60-70% of the same and helped in creating 1200 jobs in the agricultural sector. We will also focus on how to participate in the water consumption initiatives. For example, PepsiCo's plants in Saudi Arabia saved 28 million liters of water used in snack operations just in 2018. Our plan over the next 5 years is to save 98 billion liters of water through advanced PepsiCo agricultural technology. We are delivering a promising initiatives that will allow us to reduce water consumption in our facilities as well as increase the recycling rates not only in PepsiCo facilities, but even in the whole world. As we strive to design 100% of our packaging to be recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025.</p><h4>What are your expectations going forward with sustainability and green initiatives such as the 'Free of Plastic Waste' event at Formula E 2019 and Dakar Rally 2020 in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Formula E 2019 and Dakar Rally 2020 were the start of many of these initiatives. We will collaborate closely with the Saudi government, our partners and NGOs to drive the sustainability agenda in the Kingdom. There is still some work to do, and one of the major topics being discussed is plastic waste and recycling. As PepsiCo, we are working tirelessly on plastic use reduction in India; we are acquiring their best practices and aiming to develop a business model together, which we will then apply to our operations. In addition, we are looking into the recycling of our snack packaging for a safer environment, and our plan is to use 25% recycled content in our plastic packaging and reduce virgin plastic use across our beverage portfolio by 35% by 2025. This will equate to the elimination of 2.5 million metric tons of cumulative virgin plastic when taking into account business growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>We are optimistic and making aggressive targets for ourselves. If we look into how Saudi Arabia performed in 2018 and the impeccable transition into 2019, we are extremely positive that this year will end well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hicham-safir-chief-executive-officer-asma-invest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There has been a major change in Asma Invest's business plan since its establishment in 1992, as it went from being a minority shareholder in various investments to a main operator in different sectors. Would you elaborate on changes since 2015?</h4><p>The major change since 2015 was an important capital increase of MAD1.2 billion (USD122.8 million) from its shareholders. We have almost tripled our capital. We are proud that our shareholders, the governments of Morocco and Saudi Arabia, still see us as an investment tool and a means to better connect the two countries. We are continuing our strategy of being a majority holder, if not a 100% owner, of our businesses. We are still in the process of exiting our minority shareholdings. The idea is to completely move to projects that we operate and to diversify the sectors we operate in. Today, real estate accounts for around 50% of our portfolio and agriculture is 15-20%. We want to continue growing in real estate and agriculture including agri-business, but also open up to other sectors to achieve a mixed portfolio, ideally with real estate investments of 30%-35% and agriculture/agri-business around 25%. We are trying to move into the education and health sectors where we are screening some opportunities. We are also trying to move further into the industrial sector and industrial zones where we already have a presence. We are currently shareholders in two industrial companies well-known in Morocco: Sapino, which prepares industrial zones, and Tanger Med Zones (TMZ), a subsidiary of the Port of Tangier.</p><h4>What is the real added value that Asma Invest brings as an investor-operator, and what makes you stand out from other operators in the real estate sector in particular?</h4><p>We have a talented pool of people here and we are trying to raise them up to the best team in Morocco. We do not plan to become the largest real estate operator, but one of the best in terms of quality and targeting the middle-income segment in Morocco. Our real estate expertise is already great. We might also offer this opportunity to third-party investors either inside or outside of Morocco. We have been approached by some investors because we have excellent projects in Casablanca Finance City, where we are the biggest real estate operator so far. We also serve as a co-investment vehicle: we create projects, package them, and try to find investors to join us for these projects. This means we can do two or three projects with the same amount of money we would need to do one project on our own. And it is good for those investors, because Asma Invest knows the market, from investing to operating. The biggest project we are currently working on is a MAD1 billion (c.USD100 million) project in Casablanca. For this, we opened up 40% of the capital to investors from outside Morocco.</p><h4>Demand from middle-income real estate customers in Morocco is changing. Have you noticed these customers becoming more discerning?</h4><p>Definitely. I would not say there is a crisis, but there has been a change in focus. Our vision at Asma Invest is to adapt and listen to the market. The middle-income population has not been well-served to date, in terms of housing, which is why we want to bring value to them. There have been mistakes made by real estate operators in the past. But as with any sector, especially real estate, there are economic cycles. There was a bullish cycle in the early 2000s, when there was huge demand, pushing many people into the sector. Those operators provided too much real estate in the end, and it was a big mess. What is happening today is a correction, not a crisis. The major players are still there adapting to the market, but all those players who came into the market just to speculate are being evicted now.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges today for international real estate management firms in Morocco?</h4><p>A major challenge we face today is the price of land which skyrocketed because of speculation over the past 10-12 years. Everyone knows, even at the government level, that the target today is the middle-income population because they have been overlooked for the past few years in terms of housing, health, and education. The focus of today is to go back to this middle-income segment and to focus on SMEs because this is where consumption is happening. This is how all countries work. The challenge now is to provide properties for this middle-income population commensurate with their earnings. The previous property speculation makes this equation difficult to solve. This is where the government must intervene to find a solution.</p><h4>Would you tell us about Asma Invest's approach to sustainability?</h4><p>I just received a certificate from MIT on strategies for sustainable business. Sustainability is dear to Asma Invest and I wanted to know how to put it in practice, especially in real estate. Building sustainable housing can cost the same as normal housing. This is one of the key lessons I learned. We are having serious discussions internally about how to operate in a more sustainable way. Something we already do is build properties that are energy-saving in terms of heating and cooling. For example, we use thermal and acoustic insulation, which is more energy efficient and reduces utility bills. We are thinking about solar energy use and many other environmentally sound practices we can adopt. The way you position a building, its doors, and its windows to capture and best use solar energy is interesting and scientifically proven.</p><h4>What are key areas Asma Invest will be focusing on in 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, we are putting more effort into agriculture and agri-business where we want to grow more. In the real estate sector, we are diversifying into other cities, rather than just operating in Casablanca. We have been successful in Casablanca, so the idea is to replicate this business model in other Moroccan cities. Co-investment is also something we are continuing to encourage. We are trying to leverage our know-how while finding financial leverage from outside, such as from banks and investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[One Za’abeel Due in 2021]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[issam-galadari-ceo-ithra-dubai]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest updates for the projects currently under development?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the fastest-growing cities, and we are trying to create communities in which people feel good about living and working. This is especially true for the One Za'abeel project, an iconic addition to our portfolio and to the city that will be completed by end of 2021. It's a mixed-use project built on a 230,000sqm gross floor area consisting of two towers, A and B standing at 300 and 235 meters respectively, and a panoramic sky concourse dubbed “The Link" suspended perpendicularly to both towers. The Link, which is being constructed in six different stages will house the largest cantilever in the world and will be a must-visit destination. Tower B is purely residential while Tower A is a mix of luxury serviced residential and grade A office space and will include One &amp; Only One Zaabeel,  Dubai's only urban resort, in a vertical and unique concept. One Za'abeel embraces cutting-edge development and new technologies. People might perceive this project as an island, but it is connected by two bridges offering excellent connectivity to the nearby World Trade Center and Zaabeel Park. It is an excellent community for people to live and work in. We will offer extensive amenities including restaurants with Michelin-quality chefs. We are also working on an experience in the Link that will prompt people from all around the country and the world to visit it.</p><h4>What makes One Za'abeel and Ithra's approach unique in Dubai's real estate development space?</h4><p>One Za'abeel represents the future of mixed-use developments. Today, businesspeople want to work and live in the city; they want to walk to their jobs and then walk to the park to meet their families. Families want to have a good lifestyle while not being disconnected from the city. We promote sustainably by integrating work and leisure together. This is what this project embodies. Ithra in Arabic means “to enrich," and this is what we are doing with this project. We are enriching Dubai's resident and visitor communities. We are working to create something simple and timeless. Our architectural aesthetic is simple in terms of design, but highly complex from an architectural standpoint. I have been involved in many projects in Dubai, but this is the most complicated engineering project I have been engaged in. While designing this project, we spent a great deal of time studying the impact of the structure. We studied the environmental and shading effects of the building. We are also working on acquiring LEED Gold certification.</p><h4>How do projects like Za'abeel and Deira contribute to Dubai and enrich the community and economy of the Emirate?</h4><p>When we initiate a new project, we make sure we bring something that will improve the lives of people who live in the area, ensuring that our developments positively augment existing communities. We focus on sustainability as evidenced by our Deira Enrichment Project where we prioritized green spaces over cement blocks, identified missing elements and expanded the fabric of the community while respecting the culture and history of Deira. By implementing this project, we were able to pay homage to the place. To create natural air flow, we considered the direction of the wind. We decided against car parking on the roof of car parks, for instance, in order to use that space for greenery and leisure. We are planting across the roofs of the buildings to maximize sustainability. Property developers typically jump at the opportunity to start laying brick after brick without thinking of the impact on the community, but here we spend years thinking and planning before we lay the first brick.</p><h4>What was the thinking behind the Deira Enrichment Project, and how was the planning process?</h4><p>We traveled, visited and learned about beautiful cities across the world to bring new ideas and incorporate them into Dubai. Then, we looked at Deira very closely as well, because we understood that the structure of the location had to be accounted for in every step. We compared everything we had experienced in cities across the world, assessed the gaps in the community infrastructure in Deira, and weaved in the history and context of Deira to make sure the project addresses every area. We listened to all stakeholders in Deira before breaking ground, and this is one of the reasons why this project is so successful. This is only the first phase of the project, and we expect to have even more robust and substantive discussions moving forward. Similar to One Za'abeel's proximity to public transport, the Deira project already includes two metro stations and we are now building the first integrated transportation hub with buses, taxis and metro stations in one single location. The government allocated a large capital to the metro system, and our role is to ensure that the top-side development will maintain the viability of that investment. Phase 1 of the project will serve 8,000 residents and an additional 4,000 staff. The first delivery will be towards early 2020 and we are hoping to finish the project by the end of 2023.</p><h4>Do you see other developers adopting a similar approach to Ithra?</h4><p>We have been mandated by the Investment Corporation of Dubai to look at both the bottom line and our added value to the Emirate, and others are starting to think along the lines of this formula that ensures a win-win to all. The positive impact is easily assessed in the context of Deira Enrichment Project for instance through the growth of economic activity. Deira accounts for around 10% of Dubai's GDP with its proximity to education, business, and healthcare facilities and its “Waterfront Market', and our project aims to expand the economic activity in this area. The Waterfront market, a unique food market and one of the largest in Dubai accommodates an average daily footfall of over 30,000 people. We are also planning to build two more schools in phase 2 of the project. We want everyone in Deira to benefit from the Deira Enrichment project.</p><h4>Moving forward, what is your vision for Dubai's real estate and property development?</h4><p>The government has taken many initiatives to reduce the cost of living, and we want to make sure that our developments advance the economy and our communities as well as benefit the environment. We will maintain our growth trajectory as we mature while espousing the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, with a focus on attracting new investments, encouraging small businesses and on creating an enriching community that connects people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Jordan’s Monetary Policy]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-ziad-fariz-governor-central-bank-jordan-cbj]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Last year, the Central Bank of Jordan cut interest rates on all monetary policy instruments by 25 basis points, the first decrease in four years. What is the intended impact of this move? </h4><p>The CBJ effectively maintained exchange rate stability, a key factor as a nominal anchor of monetary policy, while sustaining a comfortable level of foreign reserves. Empirical studies show the current exchange rate is broadly in line with its medium and long-term macroeconomic fundamentals, and there are no significant misalignments with its long-term equilibrium exchange rate. In 2019, most central banks around the world switched to monetary policy easing, following years of leaning toward tightened monetary policy. The key drivers for the policy reversal were softening the domestic economic outlook, falling growth rates and lower than expected inflation, in addition to weakening business and consumer confidence. The CBJ's policy was in sync with global patterns, whereby it cut interest rates on key monetary policy tools three times in 2019 by 25 basis points each time, aiming to boost credit growth and to stimulate domestic demand for consumption and investment. The decision was also prompted by projected receding of inflationary pressure, a declining current account deficit, and noticeable recovery in JD deposits and foreign currency reserves.</p><h4>What is the expected effect of the rate cut on the retail banking market?</h4><p>The three consecutive cuts in CBJ policy rates in 2019 by 75 bps, resulted in a decrease in the interbank rate by 85 bps, and is expected to be followed by reductions in lending rates during 2020. The interest rate margin, measured by the difference between the weighted average interest rates on loans advances and time deposits, decreased from 396 bps at the end of 2018 to 332 bps in 2019. The lower interest rate margin in 2019 reflects 12 bps higher deposit rates, and 52 bps lower lending rates compared to 2018. Although the decline in interest rate margin may negatively affect banks' profitability in the short-run, it is deemed an important indicator of improvement in the banking business environment, and hence of efficiency and competitiveness among banks.</p><h4>How is the Central Bank of Jordan working to stimulate credit flows and financing options to companies and support the private sector?</h4><p>Credit facilities extended to corporates rose by JOD294.2 million (1.9%) to JOD15.5 billion at the end of 2019, compared to 2018. This constitutes 57.3% of total credit extended by banks.
</p><h4>
	What CBJ initiatives support industrial and exporting companies in Jordan?
</h4><p>
	The CBJ launched a number of initiatives to provide adequate financing for nine vital economic sectors, including SMEs. In addition, the CBJ strengthened the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC), through multi initiatives, including: Launching a program to support national exports, through a JOD100 million loan from the CBJ to the JLGC to enhance the export credit program and, subsequently, to boost exports, especially in newly-opened markets. The CBJ granted a JOD100 million facility to support the export of construction companies beyond the Kingdom through the JLGC. Beyond that, in Jordan, about 98% of all businesses are classified as SMEs, accounting for 70% of jobs in the private sector and contributing around 40% to GDP. Thus, banks in Jordan play a vital role in financing SMEs and industrial companies. The outstanding balance of credit facilities extended to SMEs is around JOD2.0 billion (8% of total credit granted by banks). Credit provided to the industrial sector is at JOD3.5 billion (including that provided to SMEs in the industrial sector).
</p><h4>With a majority of Jordanian companies being SMEs, how has the CBJ endorsed them? </h4><p>
	The CBJ is aware of the importance of SMEs in creating jobs and bolstering economic growth and improving standards of living. Therefore, we launched a number of initiatives to guarantee the availability of appropriate financing for SMEs sector, where: First, the CBJ provides a "Long Term Financing for Licensed Banks" program with competitive interest rates, oriented towards industry, tourism, agriculture, renewable energy, information technology, engineering consulting services, health, education and transportation sectors. The funds available under this program account for around 5% of credit facilities granted by the banks, currently at around JOD1.2 billion. The total amount of funding granted to targeted sectors to date has reached about JOD782.4 million, benefiting around 1,185 projects and creating 11,663 job opportunities. The total amount of funding granted to the industrial sector has reached about JOD401.5million (33.5% of total funding) under this program. <br>
	Second, the CBJ also continues to provide a bundle of incentives for licensed banks to strengthen SME lending through signing several agreements with international institutions, amounting to USD440 million. The total amount lent was around USD292 million benefiting over 16,000 projects. Third, the CBJ established the Innovative Startups and SMEs Fund (ISSF) with capital of USD98 million in cooperation with the World Bank. The ISSF will promote entrepreneurship and contribute to job creation in Jordan by increasing private, early stage equity finance for SMEs. Fourth, the CBJ has decided to expand its regulatory umbrella to include Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs), having taken practical steps and set the regulatory framework to supervise MFIs. Finally, banks have established two investment funds in Jordan: a “Trade Banks Fund for Investment" with capital of JOD100 million and the “Islamic Investment Fund", with capital of JOD25 million. The two funds will be investing in medium-sized companies to trigger growth that reflects positively on their job-generation capacities.
</p><h4>How do you evaluate Jordan's credit improvements in the World Bank's Doing Business report?</h4><p>
	Jordan has achieved a spot among the world's top 20 most-improved economies, as well as a place among the world's top-ten improvers in implementing business-climate-improving measures in the World Bank's 2020 business rankings. The report shows a significant improvement in Jordan's overall ranking by 29 places to 75th out of 190 countries, compared to 104th in the 2019 report. According to the report, Jordan has strengthened access to credit, as well as made paying taxes and resolving insolvency easier. Indicators related to the Central Bank's work in the report are limited to the 'Access to Credit' index, which has witnessed a significant improvement in its performance by 130 places to rank 4th compared to 134th in 2019. Jordan expanded access to credit after the credit bureau began offering credit scores to banks and other financial institutions, in addition to introducing a new law on secure transactions, which regulates functional equivalents to loans secured with movable property, such as financial leases and fiduciary transfer of title.
</p><h4>What are the CJB's short-term strategic objectives?</h4><p>
	In line with CBJ Law, we will continue maintaining our primary objective of monetary and financial stability and thereby contributing to economic growth in the kingdom. The CBJ will continue its efforts in maintaining an investment environment that is attractive for economic and social development through providing a convenient interest rate structure and implementing macro and micro prudential supervision policies that maintain financial and banking stability. Efforts to promote financial inclusion and improve the business environment will help support investment and productivity and enhance inclusive growth. Within this context, we developed the National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2018-2020 to increase financial inclusion from 33.1% to 41.5% by 2020, covering youth, women, low income segments, SMEs, and refugees. This represents a high level of commitment of state institutions and the government to create a legislative and technical environment that enables individuals and institutions to save, invest and obtain necessary funds. As the CBJ aims to financial stability, it has expanded its supervision umbrella to include insurance companies besides banks, exchange companies, and MFIs. This will be implemented in the near future.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claremont Corporate Service provides a range of corporate support services for companies active on the Saudi market. What are your primary services, and what do you consider to be Claremont's distinct strengths?</h4><p>Claremont's presence and operational capacity in Saudi Arabia, and the wider Middle East region, has been engineered to work as a corporate consultancy that primarily conducts reviews and analysis on corporate financial structures and processes. The analysis process is designed to highlight the costs and inefficiencies in a company's foreign exchange mechanism and international payments. We provide the analysis to our regulated partner entities that work in foreign exchange and merchant payments, they in turn evaluate where costs can be reduced and operational efficiency improved. This is our core service. Claremont's ultimate strength is the professional network of partner institutions, that we have constructed over the past 10 years, even before Claremont was incorporated. Being totally independent allows us to utilize the entire market place and not simply provide 'off the shelf' solutions. Our service across all divisions is tailored and personalized.</p><h4>Claremont Arabia provides educational seminars on the changing landscape of financial planning and especially its effects on expats. What have been some of your recent themes, and what can we expect next to develop?</h4><p>Claremont has two distinct divisions: Corporate Services and Private Client. In some areas, these divisions share common ground. Our private client division has worked closely with the British Embassy to provide information on crucial areas affecting expats while they assume an overseas position. We are currently in discussions with the Irish and Australian embassies to provide the same service. The vast majority of expat-employing companies provide little information when it comes to personal affairs. With the help of the embassy, we have provided clients with information on a number of issues; international mortgages, many expats struggle finding mortgages when earning overseas. Claremont works with hundreds of international mortgage companies to fill this gap in the market. We have held events on the effects of Brexit on EU and UK expats, and how that effects property purchases, exchange rates, residence and domicile issues, etc. We hosted a successful event about simply how expats send their money home, salary remittance, and the best way to save money on foreign exchange costs. Ultimately we believe, if you provide all of the relevant information, people generally make prudent decisions.</p><h4>As a consultant with vast experience in Saudi Arabia, what are your key recommendations for companies that are interested in setting up operations here?</h4><p>Time is a commodity that must not be underestimated in Saudi Arabia. The country is currently moving extremely fast, and businesses trying to board the Saudi freight train will either be carried on the locomotive of enthusiasm, investment and progress or simply bounce straight back off. Preparation for market entry is fundamental and, ultimately, aligning with a suitable and influential partner, well-versed in the market you wish to approach, is the core to success here in Saudi Arabia. Trust must be earned through knowledge, awareness, and results. Patience is key. Inshallah is much more than just a word.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>Our priority in the corporate division is to simply provide our analysis service to as many companies as possible. From coffee importers to construction companies, we hope to work with companies of all types and sizes. Our service is heavily required by “company incubators" and agencies that are bringing international companies into Saudi Arabia. We see a huge need for these companies to have a cost-effective method of moving their funds into Saudi Arabia. Another priority is to set up our event schedule for the private client business for the year ahead. We are excited and optimistic about 2020 and look forward to growing the team with our new local partner, we are very excited about working closely with her to grow our client base in the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Core Activities]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alaa-alghadban-managing-director-sana-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your core activities in Nigeria, and what strategies allowed you to claim your position in the market today?</h4><p>Sana Group is special because we keep raising the standard in all construction sectors we serve. Our activities in Nigeria's construction industry are in four distinct sectors. Currently, the first and main business focus is in the construction of factories, ranging from light industries and warehouses, to heavy industrial plants. Our turn-key activities include design and execution for the food industry leading to Sana Global Construction Ltd.'s recognition as the leader in this particularly specialized and demanding sector. Sana Global Construction Ltd (Sana Global) recently completed an expansion to the Kellogg factory located here in Lagos, which was also built by Sana Global. Both projects are good examples of our exceptional capability and performance. The client remarked that the execution and finishes exceed the brand's global standard. Through our work, we raised hygiene and operational standards. We are proud to have improved the standard of construction in the food industry sector. Sana Group's record for site health &amp; safety and our reputation for excellence in project execution is recognised as world class. We strive to ensure that every factory we build, every project we execute is better than the previous one. Our second business focus as a group is in the manufacturing and trading of construction chemicals. Sana Group's third business focus is in the manufacturing of high-quality cement blocks. We, and the construction sector as a whole, have experienced poor construction resulting in buildings collapsing due to the failure of low-quality cement blocks. So, we introduced Sana Blocks, providing a much better- quality cement block product. The market already recognizes Sana Block for its superior block and services. The fourth sector Sana Group participates in is structural steel fabrication. Recognizing an unmet demand for high quality steel fabrication, we established Sana Building System (SBS), arguably the most important part of our business. SBS is a state-of-the-art pre-engineered building (PEB) and hot rolled steel structures (HRSS) design and fabrication company. With a highly professional staff strength, the company utilizes the latest technology. It is currently the only operation of its type in Nigeria.</p><h4>How does the PEB system work?</h4><p>Here are two basic types of steel structures. One is called hot rolled, HRSS, which involves buying mill-produced beams, cutting them, drilling them, and welding them. The other type is pre-engineered buildings, PEB. PEB is the efficient approach Sana Global uses for most factories here in Nigeria. Utilizing a “systems“ approach, Sana Building System's PEB engineering programs analyse each component in a structure to identify levels of high stress and then produce custom designs optimizing steel content to absorb those forces. PEB design is an efficient inter-dependency between a building's steel frames, steel secondary components, and cladding. This results in an extremely competitive building solution compared to other construction options. Until the establishment of SBS, such structures were imported, mainly from the UAE, because this high efficiency product was not produced domestically. SBS imports only the needed raw material: high grade plates, sheets, and coils and fabricates them into engineered beams in our factory here in Nigeria. All engineering and design are performed in-house by Sana Building Systems' professional engineers. Because PEB is an engineered product, we employ the latest engineering software capable of designing buildings to the most demanding international standards. Engineers input the proposed building's dimensions and building loading, select the applicable building code, and a fully code-compliant design is generated. Skilled structural draftsmen produce detailed shop fabrication drawings, which SBS's experienced fabrication shop workforce follow to precisely cut plates and assemble the welded beams. This process is very efficient. It invariably results in a savings of at least 20-30%. This cost savings in fit-for-purpose PEB fabricated steel vs traditional hot rolled approach is a huge advantage. When compared to concrete construction, the PEB cost advantage is even greater. We are the first company providing this turnkey solution in Nigeria. This innovative product will be available when the Sana Buildings System's factory is commissioned in May 2020. SBS will virtually eliminate the need for expensive imported steel structures; thus, conserving Nigeria's hard currency. It is a high-tech product that also adds value to the general community. SBS invests in the latest technology and conducts continuous training to provide its well-educated technical staff the right skills to perform their demanding tasks.</p><h4>What are the advantages of steel buildings when compared to concrete building? </h4><p>Steel buildings are in high demand. Due to the 8 long months of rain, Nigeria requires structures to be built and finished quickly. Since you cannot construct a concrete building in the rain, weather interference disrupts project timelines resulting in expensive delays. The steel building solution ensures a much shorter construction cycle, saving time. In addition, by supplying the steel building locally, SBS saves the client money, especially through phased delivery/phased payment and compressed timelines which reduce interest payments to banks. Reduced construction lead times shortening the time needed to put clients' products on the market, enabling them to generate revenue earlier. Steel construction is always going to be a faster and less expensive option compared to traditional concrete construction. It is important to note that because steel framed buildings will always be lighter than concrete structures, there is additional savings on building foundations. Another clear advantage of steel construction is that you can build higher and wider with steel compared to concrete. In some applications, steel is the only solution, for structures such as aircraft hangars or other structures that need a clear-span roof measuring 50-60 meters or more. In terms of quality, steel provides greater security and peace of mind vs concrete. Concrete is usually mixed at site as opposed to the quality-controlled environment of a factory. You can also expand or move a steel building more easily than you can a concrete one; you can add a plate, replace a plate, or build a new addition much more easily. Occasionally critics raise concerns about fire safety; some people claim steel cannot match concrete as a fireproof structure. But modern techniques can be used to provide adequate fireproofing for steel structures, as required by their end-use. All in all, there is rarely a true advantage in choosing concrete over steel. But I can assure you there are plenty of advantages in choosing the steel solution.</p><h4>Considering your vast experience, what would you recommend other indigenous companies to do to position themselves at a competitive level in the industry?</h4><p>There are several factors to consider. Firstly, products need to be of high quality. This goes for all goods, not just construction products, across all segments of the economy. We find that companies producing high quality goods here in Nigeria are thriving. Similarly, services need to be high quality. There are construction companies here that claim to do what we do at cheaper cost, but clients still choose us. They see that Sana Group companies consistently perform to the highest standards and demonstrate staying power in the market. The second recommendation is to grow with an R&amp;D program focused on innovation. This is often missing in Nigeria. A sincere focus on continuous improvement and quality should be the next step for indigenous companies. My initial thoughts were to conduct R&amp;D in a different country, but after a meeting with a civil engineer in Nigeria, I changed my mind. The way he communicated and explained what he knew, and the fact that he used technology sourced from abroad because it was not available in Nigeria, inspired me to build an R&amp;D infrastructure here. We have intelligent people here. Sana Group uses in-country resources to develop our R&amp;D capabilities which only occasionally need to be supplemented with overseas resources. The lack of commitment to promote R&amp;D facilities and employ the right people to staff them is one of the reasons why innovation in this country is slow.</p><h4>What are Sana Group's key priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>First, we want both Sana Building Systems and Sana Blocks to be considered the preferred choices within their target markets. We expect that they will set quality benchmarks here in Nigeria. SBS will be heavily promoted to be preferred building solution for virtually every project. This is our aim in 2020. Nigeria has an existing and growing demand for our products. SBS's capacity and pricing will stop, or greatly reduce, the importation of steel buildings. Customers will be able to source the same high quality associated with imported steel locally from Sana Building Systems. The market needs to know and be educated about the many advantages of our products. Still today, many people do not know that premium, factory produced quality-controlled blocks, are available in Nigeria or even that a building can be made of steel. Another priority for Sana Group is to expand our market share in the road-works construction sector. We recently completed high-profile road-work projects in a mixed-use free zone. Nigeria has needs for new roadway construction and an ongoing need for the replacement or restoration of existing road infrastructure. Sana Group is positioning itself to actively participate in this sector with the same commitment to quality and reliability that has brought us to market leadership in our other market sectors. We also have additional investments planned. Following the launch of Sana Building Systems, we intend to enter the low cost, affordable housing market. Currently in this sector, many homes are constructed using wood as the traditional framing material. Wood deteriorates quickly, after five or six years, particularly in the tropical climate we have here and throughout West Africa. We will be presenting a steel solution for these homes in 2020. These homes will be affordable and will help to raise the standard of living in our communities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the change of administration impacted your operations? </h4><p>2019 was a good year for our Group, but hard for Mexico, one of the major causes being the amendments being applied to Mexican legislation. For us, this has led to an increase in clients needing our help, especially when it comes to compliance with the new legal requirements. Unfortunately, this situation has only slowed down economic growth. Aside from a few sectors such as construction and FMCG, the economy is not having an easy time for the moment.</p><h4>What kind of new legal requirements for taxes should companies be aware of?</h4><p>Most companies have to follow a new legal process under the new law. Mexican tax authorities believe that companies that use the services of tax advisors do not follow the full processes properly. For example, there are new legal requirements, for individuals as for companies, that compel you to verify the processes of their tax advisors, which is a huge thing to require of companies. The OECD also has regulations that companies must comply with. An example of the above is deductions, because with these changes Tax Authorities now have the right to check and examine if they are based on authentic reasons or done with the sole purpose of making profit for the pockets of the shareholders. Obviously, when you are talking about the private sector, most owners develop business models to increase their earnings, but the model in the public sector involves increasing tax collection and forcing companies to check their accounting and financial reports more carefully. But instead of seeing this as an disadvantage, we prefer to see it as a business opportunity, exploring ways to maximize the wealth of our clients and at the same time comply with tax rules adequately.</p><h4>Is the outsourcing segment of your business set to shrink with these new changes?</h4><p>Outsourcing firms are currently going through a challenging phase. First of all, Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMC), which notes that salaries in Mexico are inferior to those in Canada and the US. If you take a look at salaries under the framework of social security, you will realize that most companies are not paying people properly. Another aspect is social services in Mexico, which are not ready for the challenge of facing the demands of the Mexican citizens, which is why most employees prefer private insurance and pensions. It is compulsory for companies to pay social security contributions, but the issue is that the social healthcare system fails to adequately address the prevailing health deficiencies in the country and most employers find ways to not pay full social security contributions. Thus far the government has amended laws to fulfill this gap in the system. If a company gets caught while cheating with social security contributions, they would face huge penalties or even worst, end up in with a prison punishment.</p><h4>How are these stricter rules affecting investor confidence in Mexico? </h4><p>Domestic and foreign investors are not sure about investing in Mexico. Many of them are heading to Europe, and specifically Spain. A huge proportion of the capital investment in Spain is coming from Mexicans. Tax regulation in Mexico is getting so complicated and uncertain that investing in the country could be described as a high stakes gamble.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of doing business in Mexico?</h4><p>If you have the know-how about the process, Mexico can be a great place to do business. People who have high acquisitive power have a high propensity to invest in construction. However, real estate sector, nowadays is declining and prices are decreasing. Inflation and unemployment are increasing. I believe that in order to lift people out of poverty we need to invest more in education and create more jobs. When there is too much risk, people are afraid of making investments. Mexico is a great model for the rest of Latin America. If Mexico can change with these reforms, the rest of the countries in this region can change, too. We have the opportunity to do things differently working together with all the stakeholders. We have a great chance to change the country's model and build a better future.</p><h4>What are your plans for internationalization?</h4><p>We are an active member of LEA, the second-largest international association and which only eight firms of Mexico are part. Also We have plans to open a subsidiary in Spain with the purpose to provide European investors, who are interested investing in Mexico, all the facilities to achieve their financial goals. Regarding South America, actually, we are in advanced negotiations with a Chilean group for closing an investment deal in our country. We have an advantage, the vast majority of accountants and tax advisors, in Mexico City, at Grupo Asesores en Negocios, we have a global vision and a broader perspective. We see things that nobody else can, our colleagues understand world business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Orange Economy was not well known until this government made it one of its main focuses. What were your greatest achievements in this first year of work?</h4><p>We have a seven-pronged approach to develop the Orange Economy. The first is information, meaning we need to get a better understanding of the sector and its numbers both financially and non-financially. For that, we have been improving the scope of the culture satellite account and the Orange Economy. We expanded the number of activities we follow and have been improving the methodologies so they can produce information more often. We are improving our ability to produce numbers in a prompter way with greater priority. For that, we work with the National Department of Statistics (DANE) and are also working and better understanding the ecosystems at a local level. We have started city mapping the Orange Economy in a joint venture with Findeter. We have already completed two mappings and are undertaking another 12. By mid-2020, we will have a relatively accurate picture of the cultural scene and potential creative industries of the most important cities in the country together with an improved understanding of the macroeconomic numbers. The Orange Economy currently contributes at least 3.2% of GDP, equivalent to about COP28.4 trillion (USD9 billion) from 2018. There are close to 540,000 workers directly related to these activities, and our expectation for the tenure of President Duque is to have a real growth of 35% to about COP38.1 trillion (USD11.24 billion). We expect to grow around 6% in 2019, 7% in 2020, and 9% in 2022. We are basing that on our observations from the sector's better performance in 2018 compared to the rest of the economy as well as on the numbers reported by Confecámaras. The first semester reported almost 10% growth in the number of companies registered in the chambers of commerce. We are confident that given the positive trajectory of public spending on the creative industries, the positive behavior of financial credit to the sector, and this growth in the number of companies that 6% is a conservative approach; however, we are going conservative with our numbers. We expect to grow much faster than the rest of the economy, and that that be reflected in the employment numbers. Typically, GDP growth tends to have a strong correlation with employment creation, so I would not be surprised if we saw another 160K new creative jobs by the end of the Duque government.</p><h4>What about the other approaches?</h4><p>The second approach is institutions. The Vice Ministry of Orange Economy was created in October 2018, and we also created the National Council of Orange Economy that month. That council is presided over by the Ministry of Culture and includes the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Education, Ministry of ICT, and Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Tourism together with SENA, Findeter, the National Direction of Copyright, the National Planning Department, and DANE. There are another 15 agencies and councillorships of the President that also support the council. Together, we run about 70 programs that are either new programs or enhancements of existing programs. This is a Sustainable Development Goal number 17, and we are using it significantly on the Orange Economy. When talking about investing in culture as a lever for development, it is not just an issue to be taken care by the Ministry of Culture. That coordination has also sent a signal to the markets. Bancoldex found that in the first 12 months of the government of President Duque, more than COP1 trillion in credit was allocated to creative industries compared to the 36 previous months, when the average was only COP680 billion. There has been 60-70% growth in the allocation of credit to this sector. That is what happens when there is institutional development and coordination, and this is even before the incentives kick in. Just this coordination alone has created an environment where people feel activated. The next element is infrastructure, which is usually the mid-point for non-core areas and is related to the next dimension: industry. There is a figure we created, first in the Bogotá Development Plan, which is called the Orange Development Areas and consists of creative clusters or districts where we, as a central government, can provide tax incentives. The municipalities define the limits of these areas, and from the government we will allocate a fiscal space for people to do either cultural infrastructure development or public goods' development in these areas. We can provide tax exemptions in exchange for those investments in order to concentrate private attention, so companies enter this creative areas and provide faster internet access, better walkways, better parks, or theaters for artists to work and play. We want these areas to become magnets for talent. Then, we have integration, which is not looking to ourselves but understanding the world is wide, as we are strongly linking creativity with tourism to try to help rebrand our country around our culture. Then, there is inclusion. We work hard to use culture to reduce gaps. It is also a good element to reassure the rights of ethnic communities. There is also growing demand from former combatants to become a part of society. Finally, we have inspiration, which is about education, and in that we are working hard with the Ministry of Education. Some schools, in their expansion from half day to full day schooling, are starting to include music education, art education, and sports as part of a full curriculum.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key factors have contributed to your recent profit growth, and how does diversification feature in this?</h4><p>We can attribute our success to a culture of teamwork and a commitment to developing, mentoring, guiding and empowering our people. Through comprehensive training we have also provided a platform for our employees to up-skill, and we were proud to recently host the globally renowned motivational speaker Ron Kaufman. Another contributing factor to our success is the continuous improvement of our processes. As a leading multi-line insurer with a wide range of General, Health and Life products, business diversification does play a role in ADNIC's success, however we do not pursue breadth at the expense of profitability or service quality. ADNIC is a company that adds value by caring for and meeting the expectations of its customers. It is an ongoing task to keep abreast of the evolving expectations and needs of our existing and potential customers.</p><h4>What is the significance of your recent partnership with Al Etihad Credit Bureau regarding the controlling and managing of risk across your operations?</h4><p>A major challenge in the insurance market is receivables, and signing the agreement with Al Etihad Credit Bureau is in line with ADNIC's mission to adopt innovative solutions in the insurance industry and implement international best practices. The move helps to further strengthen our ability to control and manage credit risk exposure in our operations, and in turn proactively select clients on the basis of appropriate credit and financial screening.</p><h4>What is your view on the Insurance Authority, and its contribution to market development? </h4><p>The regulator always adds value to the sector and ensures best practices are implemented. Additionally, they ensure that companies can continue to operate and honour the obligations to meet minimum solvency margins. The Insurance Authority sets clear financial guidelines and is also a strong advocate of clear, regular financial reporting, which is currently at a level of extensive electronic reporting. Among the most important financial guidelines issued by the regulator are investment allocations for different asset classes, like real estate and equities. The solvency margin and capital adequacy are important in safeguarding the interests of policy holders and shareholders alike. Another notable exercise is the price review, which requires half- yearly reports from companies on the performance of each business line. This gives the Insurance Authority accurate data on the state of the industry, both individually and overall, including CEO-level input on prospective developments.</p><h4>What would be the role of technology when it comes to streamlining processes?</h4><p>Investment in technology is a major focus for ADNIC, we are aware that adoption of automation and digitization will be necessary to meet the expectations of our clients. Furthermore, we appreciate that our clients and retail customers are keen to access insurance processes via their smart phone. Mobile apps, which allows individual customers to buy insurance, to launch and to follow up on their claims through their devices, and enabling call centers to respond immediately to simple transactions for basic products are activities that require deep technology adoption.  </p><h4>How can the insurance industry continue to evolve and what are your expectations looking ahead?</h4><p>Regarding the contribution of the insurance industry in the overall economy the penetration rate in the UAE today is below 2.5%, or one- third of the European average. Therefore, the contribution of insurance to GDP is thin, however, the penetration rate in the UAE is still higher than most of the countries in the region. The positive side of this is growth potential. Apart from the penetration rate and share of the insurance industry in the overall economy, insurance is the backbone of commercial businesses as no enterprise can operate without it. With more than 60 players in the market, the sector is clearly highly competitive, and therefore M &amp; A activities may happen but this could take some time. We are optimistic and project growth both at the top and bottom line, and see signs of growth in the market and the wider economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key initiatives you would like to highlight as examples of DP World's disruptive innovation to stay ahead of the curve as we move into the era of smart trade?</h4><p>As a progressive end-to-end logistics solutions provider, we continue to invest in new technologies and disruptive innovation, always seeking the edge that will help us lead the future of world trade through innovative trade solutions. We enable trade around the world, creating and embracing the latest technologies and innovations. And for ports and logistics operators like us, the key now is to further maximize efficiency, making sure innovations coming on stream can lower costs, increase productivity and move goods arriving in vast quantities from enormous ocean carriers quicker and more cost-effectively than before. We believe that to stay ahead of the curve, we should constantly upgrade our systems, as the Internet and technology have revolutionized the way we do business. Our vision at DP World is global; foreseeing change, thinking about future opportunities, enhancing efficiencies and adopting innovative and creative trade solutions. In an age of unparalleled change, transforming the way goods are transported is being explored across the world. Moving containers in different ways both by sea and across land has exciting potential. One of our innovations is the world's first high bay storage system, BOXBAY, which we have developed with industrial engineering specialist SMS Group. The first BOXBAY facility is being built at Jebel Ali Terminal 4 in time for the Dubai Expo 2020. The patented design and rack structure of the BOXBAY system creates unique advantages. Containers can be stored eleven stories high, dramatically increasing capacity, and the fully automated system can move every single container individually without having to touch any other. This has the potential to revolutionise cargo handling operations because the current system of stacking containers on top of each other means containers must be moved to access containers at the bottom of the stack. We are excited by the prospects for BOXBAY as handling speed and efficiencies are key aspects of the ports and terminals business, and the system is a major development for the sector around the world. We also have a multi-million-dollar investment in US-based Hyperloop One to provide funds for the continued research and development of Hyperloop technology. DP World is now a significant investor in Hyperloop One. The Hyperloop system moves magnetically levitating pods through low air pressure tubes. It has the potential to move cargo at the speed of a plane but the cost of a truck. As part of the investment, Hyperloop One will benefit from DP World's expertise in complex cargo handling operations and the experience DP World has accumulated across its global portfolio of more than 150 operations in over 50 countries across six continents. Disruptive innovation is a continuous process, and we continue to unveil new technologies and innovations that facilitate trade and make trading smarter.</p><h4>What is the significance of DP World's disruption-drive mission for the future of trade, and how will these innovations impact supply chains and trade?</h4><p>These innovations are shaping the future of trade. For example, the rapidly evolving e-commerce and the need to invest in new technologies are just some of the issues businesses face that will impact supply chains. Over the last few years, DP World has undertaken a diversification strategy that has transformed us into a Global Trade Enabler by extending our core business of port operations to play a wider role in the supply chain. We have acquired differentiated assets, such as trains, warehousing and inland logistics in India, feeder shipping operations in Europe and Asia, as well as joint ventures with logistics software and distribution companies in Australia. Our goal is to transform the efficiency of supply chains to benefit cargo owners and consolidators of demand. Key to the DP World's strategy is digital transformation as we look to provide and develop technology to remove inefficiencies.</p><h4>DP World is the official premier partner global EXPO 2020. With more than 25 million visitors expected to attend the world's greatest show, how will DP World's EXPO 2020 pavilion convey to the world the seemingly obscure links between the world of cargo and our daily life?</h4><p>DP World being the Premier Global Trade Partner of Expo 2020 means everything related to Expo is flowing into Dubai through our globe-spanning logistics network. This includes the utilisation of all our ports and terminals, free zones and maritime services. The Al Wasl dome, which will be the centrepiece of the Expo 2020 site, is a good example of the role we are playing in making Expo happen. Weighing 2,265 tonnes with an enclosed space of 724,000 cubic metres, the sections of the Dome entered Dubai thanks to Jebel Ali Port's outstanding cargo handling capabilities. The biggest piece—the dome's steel crown—alone weighs 550 tonnes. Expo 2020 is a unique experience for us. We are often at major events, but the key difference here is one of scale. The Expo site will be the size of a small city, and the event will last for six months. The objective of DP World's EXPO 2020 pavilion is to open the eyes of visitors to the world of logistics and supply chains. Most people rarely consider what it takes to bring to them from far off places everything which is around them in their daily lives. How this process works is as complex as it is interesting. Through the use of cutting-edge technologies including augmented and virtual reality, visitors to our pavilion will be able to see the real-time movement of cargo across the world and learn how global trade happens and its impact on every aspect of everyone's life every day. Trade is an area that, despite its importance, is not understood very well by the general public and we hope to change that.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and vision for DP World as we look beyond 2020 and into the next decade?</h4><p>Our vision is the shape the future of global trade, for the better. Our priority is to continue to enhance our capability to offer supply chain logistics to cargo owners, from the point of origin to the point of consumption. We believe there are many opportunities to increase the efficiency of supply chains. Key to our success is the services we offer are backed up by our global-spanning network of ports and other assets. We will continue to work to create trade corridors around the world. In Africa, for example, we are connecting landlocked countries to the global trading network. In India we are further enhancing our inland logistics operations. In the next decade DP World will continue to be at the forefront of technological development in our industry. The potential of innovations like BOXBAY and Hyperloop is huge. The digital solutions we are developing will transform supply chains, giving more visibility, transparency and flexibility to cargo owners such as manufacturers, enabling them to run their businesses more efficiently. Logistics needs to innovate to keep up with the demands and expectations of a world that has become used to the convenience of e-commerce. Global trade has lifted large parts of the world out of poverty; it has brought prosperity to many developing economies and given hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people access to jobs, better education and healthcare. Countless children who once would have been born into a life of poverty are now growing up in the knowledge that they have a future. At DP World in the next decade, we will continue to work to make trade smarter for a better future for all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Shift to Large-scale Mining]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[enrique-gallegos-anda-cobo-vice-minister-mines-ministry-energy-non-renewable-natural-resources]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given your recent appointment, what is your vision for the Vice Ministry of Mines of Ecuador?</h4><p>The Vice Ministry's objective is to manage the development of the mining sector so that it can play a bigger role in the country's development. Ecuador has the opportunity to showcase the quantity and the quality of its minerals to the world. The sector can have a huge impact on the Ecuadorian economy; therefore, we need to build a long-term vision for the mining sector and continue attracting investment. This is an opportunity to ensure that future governments can benefit from the development of the sector and its capacity to generate revenue for the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact arising from the shift of going from small-scale mining to large-scale mining?</h4><p>The change is dramatic. I personally worked on one of the projects that marked this change: the Mirador mine. I worked for its licensee, Ecuacorriente. Notably, when the project started, it took about 12 hours to get to the mine, but we worked on the infrastructure and reduced it to a threehour drive. This mine and other projects are having positive spillover effects in terms of infrastructure, employment, services, and so on. Projects are improving environmental standards to guarantee that positive effects are much higher than the environmental mark. We will be working to support more projects to move into production phase, including Rí­o Blanco and Loma Larga, while ensuring that small-scale mining projects also get their operations started.</p><h4>What timeline could we expect for the reopening of the mining cadastre?</h4><p>With the support of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the government is implementing a project that concerns the “evaluation and design of the system for granting mining concessions“. The first phase, “depuration of the mining cadaster“ was concluded in 2019. The work on the project is expected to continue with other activities such as the acquisition of a digital system for the management of the cadaster, strengthening of the cadaster itself, and institutional capacity-building. We expect the cadastre to be reopen over the course of 2020.</p><h4>What is your message to investors?</h4><p>Ecuador is a diverse country with extraordinary resources. The objective of the government is clear: developing mining activity that meets international standards. The current mining policy can open new fields and new options, while generating trust to invest in Ecuador. Already, a number of mines being operated by world-class companies have entered the production phase. Then there are others with concessions whose exploration activities are at different phases. We want to avoid giving concessions to companies that will not invest in the long run. The government is brave to develop the sector, given anti-extractive movements, not only in Ecuador, but everywhere. We also want to see commitment from companies to face all the challenges in a responsible way. The entire country wants the mining sector to grow, and the Ministry is trying to ensure favorable conditions to develop mining activity now and in the future. Ecuador's mining sector shines, and the mines that are currently operating across Ecuador are a message to any potential investor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Extracting Value]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-augusto-briones-minister-energy-non-renewable-natural-resources]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The development of the extractive sector depends on agreements with social groups. How can the announced Social Energy agreement achieve this goal?</h4><p>The Social Energy Agreement (Pacto Social Energético) seeks to implement a number of actions that go hand-in-hand with the national government's policies to strengthen the sector, endorse positive changes, respect established principles, gain transparency, prioritize national interests, and open more spaces to attract new investment. By doing all this, companies will positively see Ecuador as a investment destination, incentivize institutional efficiency, and show the human face of the sector with activities that are completely sustainable and inclusive, while benefiting the most vulnerable areas of Ecuador. The actions will be implemented across the board through spaces for dialog that we are creating in order to generate consensus among all the related sectors.</p><h4>Ecuador has left OPEC as of January 1, 2020. What effect will this decision have on the sector?</h4><p>The decision of the Ecuadorian government to leave OPEC is related to internal matters and challenges that the country must overcome, particularly in connection with fiscal sustainability. The measure taken also allows us to generate new investments in the hydrocarbon sector for exploration and production to increase domestic production, which is one of the axes of the policies that we want to implement. This will be achieved through the oil rounds Intracampos II and Suroriente, in addition to the development of the Ishpingo field, which is part of the bloc 43 — I, in the province of Orellana. Ecuador's production level is low as compared to other OPEC countries; however, we have fulfilled the agreed measures and have achieved better results in terms of cost, without halting the main projects that are being developed with the environment and social responsibility in mind.</p><h4>How would you asses the future of the refinery industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>As a country, we have to cover the fuel market, which are currently produced locally as well as imported to meet domestic demand. This is the reason why we want to launch a bidding process to build, through private investment, a new refinery that will process 300,000bpd, according to Executive Decree 861, which authorizes the ministry to develop a refinery on the Ecuadorian coast. In the first stage, we obtained expressions of interest from five companies and a consortium that is interested in the process, which are currently being evaluated according to their technical capacities as well as their proven experience in the sector. We want to conclude the bidding process in May 2020. We also plan to launch a bidding process to administer and operate the Esmeraldas refinery. The goal is to improve environmental conditions and efficiency, and produce fuel according to the international regulation Euro 5.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to create clarity and legal certainty in the mining sector?</h4><p>We have conducted a number of policies. First, we launched a national plan for the mining sector that establishes a forecast for 2030 and is aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This tool will have plans, programs, and projects that have to meet the axis of the public mining policy. One of the goals is to improve the investment climate and the legal certainty of the mining companies. We expect to have the plan ready in 1Q2020. Second, we have a new regulation to hold public consultations. This new regulation will ensure a participative process for consultations and provide information on the activities of extractive industries in the territories of the ancestral people. Third, we are updating the mining regulation in line with the current needs of the industry and prioritize areas like obtaining the authorization for plants. Also, this regulation envisions the approval of the design, construction, and operations of deposits of trails. These regulations will regulate mining operations and will provide more clarity about the administrative process and the control of operations.</p><h4>Can we expect a mining round in 2020?</h4><p>In January 2018, the government closed the mining cadastre. The government, with the support of multilaterals, has worked to strengthen the administration of the mining cadastre. The objective of this project is to identify eventual situations, administer solutions, and suggest processes to award the mining concessions based on good international practices. The process will conclude in 2020, and once we have the conclusions and recommendations for the project, we will make the decisions on whether to open the cadastre and approve new auctions.</p><h4>How can the ministry optimize its cooperation with other government entities to boost the mining sector?</h4><p>The government works with different institutions (Minister of Environment, Secretariat of Water or ARCOM, Agency of Regulation and Monitoring of Mining) to attend the needs of the industry, particularly in relation with the environmental regulation of water required to develop the mining project. This work has provided good results. As an example, we were able to regulate the drilling and exploration periods that companies require to speed up their investments. We have also created a new regulation on the process to obtain a certification regarding a project's possible effect on water reserves. However, the largest concern that the industry has in terms of hydric resources is the time that it currently takes to obtain the certificate, which eventually delays the palming of the project, reduces investment and employment, and generates uncertainty.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2020?</h4><p>We have outlined four axes of management. First, we seek a steady increase in production of natural resources, institutional efficiency, and the energy social agreement with the goal of improving the work that we are carrying out in the electric, hydrocarbon, and mining sectors. With these goals, we will continue developing the natural resources of the country in a responsible and sustainable way. We want to optimize the resources and be open to new investments with technical and economical solvency according to the constitution. As part of the master plan for the energy sector, we have a portfolio of 49 projects, of which 21 are of renewable. We have launched two important projects so far: the solar power project in El Aromo and wind projects Villonaco II and III in Loja. These projects will reduce CO2 emissions and will be 100% financed with private capital.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdeslam-ababou-chairman-red-med-finance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you please introduce the company?</h4><p>Red Med Group is an independent investment bank specializing in corporate finance and asset management established in Morocco in 2004. Red Med Finance (RMF) provides a wide range of advisory and financial services to governments, major international and local companies as well as SMEs. RMF's core business includes: mergers and acquisitions transactions, financing through conventional products and capital markets, privatizations, and strategy consulting. <br>In that context, Red Med Finance has developed expertise in key industries such as education, health, telecommunications, renewable energies, natural resources, agribusiness, retail, pharmaceutical, banking, insurance, and others. Red Med Asset Management (RMAM), approved by AMMC (“Autorité Marocaine du Marché des Capitaux") has more than USD600 million under management through a range of eight UCITS funds (such as monetary, bonds, equity, diversified, and dedicated funds).</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your clients?</h4><p>Regarding asset management activity, we are working with major institutional Moroccan investors including private and public pension funds, insurance companies, banks, SMEs and individuals. In 2019, RMAM has been selected through a tender offer launched by a one of the largest pension funds in Morocco to manage a dedicated UCITS aligned with its risk/return profile. With respect to the corporate finance activity, RMF and its employees have contributed to the realization of some of the most important transactions in Morocco catering for both international and national companies. RMF has also advised SMEs to successfully move up to new levels in terms of size and governance. RMF's services are based on tailored and innovative solutions to capture sustainable value for its clients, regardless of the size of the transaction.</p><h4>Do you have any partnerships to assist with SME financing?</h4><p>SMEs, which are keystones of the development of the Moroccan economy, are involved in different activities pertaining to health, education, trade, agriculture, crafts, and tourism. However, they face difficulties in accessing adequate financing due to the constraints of the banking system, the limited availability of alternative financing (private equity, crowd funding, capital markets) and also to the lack of resources available to them. The various public and private actors are fully aware of the economic and social importance of a strong and sustainable development for SMEs. In this context and in consultation with various public and private partners, RMF's main priority for the coming years is to strongly contribute to this project by providing effective support to SMEs in order to get competitive access to sources of financing combined with the adequate governance.</p><h4>Would FDI be a solution?</h4><p>Growth in Morocco is now mainly supported by public investment and consumption. Public investment has enabled Morocco to acquire quality infrastructure and to successfully address environmental issues through the implementation of major renewable energy projects. These investments have also helped to reduce the impact of the 2008 economic and financial crisis on Morocco. Nevertheless, public investment has a limit in terms of volume and impact for an inclusive and sustainable growth. Also, the increase in private investment, both international and national, is necessary for Morocco to reach the minimum growth level needed of 7/8% per annum to address the crucial economic and social challenges ahead. In this context, FDI is part of the solution, especially driven from Morocco's historical and natural partners. In fact, recent investments have shown that they can help strengthen the competitiveness of companies in their national markets for the benefit of both countries. This is not only the case for major high-profile investments such as Renault or Peugeot but also others. Finally, the vast majority of investments in Morocco have generated high returns, which is appreciable in this environment of very low growth. Indeed, the Moroccan economy is undercapitalized and reacts positively to the injection of capital combined with good governance.</p><h4>What is your opinion on human resources development in Morocco?</h4><p>As far as our business is concerned, we are fortunate to have access to very talented young people who have the best training/experience, both professional and academic. As far as Morocco is generally concerned, education has begun to take priority over recent years, but the results remain well below expectations. Also, the education, vocational, and civic training of young Moroccans requires the mobilization of all the forces of the country, both public and private. This mobilization must use all available materials and tools (school, university, vocational training, etc.) and draw inspiration from the best international benchmarks with optimal use of modern tools (digital, e-learning).</p><h4>What will happen in the finance sector in the coming years regarding digitalization?</h4><p>In the last few years, digital technologies have created disruption in the financial sector all over the world. Technology innovation is enabling the digital deployment of traditional financial services and second-wave services. Digital technologies regarding the financial sector in Morocco are still at an early stage of development but growing fast. Digitalization is particularly important to promote financial inclusion, improve economic productivity, and related development objectives. In fact, according to Bank Al-Maghrib, more than one-third of Moroccans do not have access to a bank account. A lack of access to such basic financial services hampers entrepreneurship and holds back economic growth. In the coming years, we will probably see the emergence of Moroccan fintechs that will unleash the potential of Moroccan digital start-ups, promote financial inclusion, and help the country reach its development objectives.</p><h4>What is your wish and vision for 2020?</h4><p>Morocco is a kingdom with great potential but also with great challenges. Efforts must be made to develop the country not only through its natural resources and economy but also through its people. My ambition is to contribute to an environment that will give young people every opportunity to develop their projects for their own good and for the good of the society. We need to attract all those talented young people and give them the tools to develop their skills. My goal for Red Med is to play a role in this direction. We will heavily focus on financing, which we have highlighted as an objective for 2020, and will assist SMEs and young people to gain access to competitive financing. This is something that we are working on, and I would like Red Med to become one of the key players in this field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our chemicals company provides oil field and industrial products and services, as well as additives for the lubricant market, while our oil and gas services' company provides engineering solutions. We help marginal oil fields achieve first oil and early cash flow sooner, by providing production facilities and experienced personnel. Our personal care business is focused on providing solutions to hair and beauty challenges faced by women in Africa. Natures Gentle Touch, our West African brand, is the market leader and behind the fast-growing trend of women wearing their natural hair to reveal their unique, cultural and personal style. Eunisell is Bureau Veritas ISO 9001:2015 certified. The international rating ensures that our Group's Quality Management System and processes function at the highest possible standards throughout the enterprise, with the benefits accruing to our customers.</p><h4>What are your main products? Do you have the capacity to service the Nigerian market?</h4><p>We provide state-of-the-art technology and experienced personnel to enable the Group to develop leading product solutions. Our customers span major industry sectors, so in turn, we produce a wide array of chemicals in our manufacturing facility in Lagos and import others. We have the capacity and currently are expanding our operations to meet the growing market demand. We have made significant investments, funded internally, to grow the business and we reinvest profits. Structuring joint ventures has allowed us to fund operations and to better manage and minimize risk. Interest rates are high in Nigeria, so depending on short-term bank loans for growth is limiting.</p><h4>What high-potential areas do you see for the company's expansion?</h4><p>We will consider perhaps chemicals derived from agricultural products to supply large manufacturers, as well as feedstock, with products sourced from starch or palm. On the lubricant side, we help to grow local companies by providing technical support and ensuring raw materials are available. Nigeria still imports over 80% of its raw materials. We produce 40% of all our products in Nigeria and contribute 11% to what is being consumed in the country. There are over 20,000 chemicals supplied to the oil and gas, food, beverage and industrial cleaning industries. If the new petrochemical plant comes on-stream as planned, we will assess the raw materials demand and manufacture additional products locally.</p><h4>What are the challenges and peculiarities of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>The main issues are infrastructure and a good business environment. Furthermore, there is an issue with human resources; the standard of education and training must improve. We hope that the government addresses these issues, people lack skills and capabilities. We do not feel the impact of sub-standard, imported chemicals because we have clear and compelling value propositions. In terms of personal care, we do not see the imports as competition. We address and provide unique solutions to specific problems faced by Nigerian women.  Imported brands do not really address the challenges, or realities of the continent. We have a significant and growing presence in the FMCG retail market. We are looking to expand our personal care into skincare products and will look into cosmetics in the future. We already are in South Africa and we will continue with our geographical expansion. Notwithstanding the challenges, I am confident about Nigeria, our country can become a major industrial hub in the future.</p><h4>What message would you send to the local and international investor community?</h4><p>Recognize that there are opportunities with significant returns behind the current challenges and business environment complexities. There is significant migration to urban hubs, with a rapidly growing middle class as a result, and it is this segment that will contribute to economic growth in the future. That we are a net importer nation, translates again into opportunities for local production and employment. The improvement in our primary and secondary education is critical to increase skills. We are providing vocational education for women through our Natures Gentle Touch Institute, as it is a way to scale them out of poverty. When primary and secondary education are taken care of, there will be a strong workforce to overcome the basic level of development.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>2020 will be a watershed for the Group; we will expand and thus hire more people to create more job opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes have you seen in this segment of medicine in Nigeria over the last few years?</h4><p>The competition has increased. Many people believe wrongly that assisted conception is where you make money. Yes, you can make money, but the most important thing is that you must also be able to deliver. Of course, that is the revolution that happens in every country and is not particular to us. We exploded from about 10-12 clinics to over a hundred in the space of four years. This has made it difficult for consumers to be able to differentiate the various services. However, I am sure this will sort itself out. Everybody thinks we do IVF, but we know that not everybody knows IVF.</p><h4>Do you think your prices cater to the higher income end of the population?</h4><p>Maybe not the highest incomes because those high-income people can go anywhere in the world. Confidentiality is one of the things in this business, all over the world. People do not want to announce that they are doing IVF. If they can afford it, they go abroad. This money should stay in the economy in Nigeria. Therefore, you will see that most of the people that can go anywhere in the world will still go. After we did that devaluation, some people that used to belong to that class that can go abroad for medical procedures no longer belong to that class. So they have to use the services in Nigeria.</p><h4>What is your core service today?</h4><p>Endometriosis has been around for about 12 years now, so it still on but there are other things now like egg freezing. We are about to launch the association for fertility preservation which we are in the forefront for and egg freezing is a major part of that. We are also looking at ovarian tissue cryo-preservation. Usually, to create eggs you need to use drugs; however, now it is possible to do it without the use of drugs, but to do a laparoscopy and take a part of the ovary and store it. Then, when you need it, it is then transposed on the ovary and will continue to grow again. Then, you can have eggs.</p><h4>What services have you seen a greater demand in the last few years?</h4><p>All over the world now there is a resuscitation of IVF and we are paying more attention to men because we have seen that men have been neglected over the years. Most of the new things have been centered on women because how IVF started was the woman had two tubes tied because she had an ectopic pregnancy. But men are having fertility issues too, all over the world. Sperm counts are going down at an alarming rate.</p><h4>What do you think is the cause of this?</h4><p>Unfortunately, that is the million-dollar question. Nobody knows because there are so many factors involved. Climate change is definitely part of this, and of course lifestyle factors. We tend to sit longer and we live unhealthy lives. We drink more alcohol and engage in smoking. It is impacting fertility and that is one major aspect now all over the world. We need to catch up in solving male fertility problems. We are now trying to focus more on it. Everything is simple; the embryo you get comes from the quality of the egg and the sperm. Hence, the worse the quality of the sperm, the worse the quality of the embryo. Now we are seeing that we could get better results from IVF if we could fix the male problem as well. We thought initially we could bypass that problem because we thought that once the egg is fertilized by the sperm all our problems are over, but now because of genetics we are beginning to see that once the genes are already destroyed, the embryo cannot implant. So you cannot have a pregnancy. We are seeing that once the DNA is destroyed in the sperm, the chance of fertilization and pregnancy decreases.</p><h4>Can you tell us how the plan is progressing for the new hospital and how do you plan to make it a reality?</h4><p>The plan is progressing. It is an eye opener for me on a daily basis, because raising healthcare funds, especially in this part of the world, is a different ballgame. Healthcare here is not developed. If you want to have a world-class hospital it is tough. Every day you learn how complicated and complex it can be to really build a good hospital in this part of the world. I think today is better than yesterday and you just keep moving forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[15 Years in Operation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marvin-abe-managing-director-apapa-bulk-terminal-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your operations? </h4><p>A great deal has changed since our establishment in 2005. The port itself was extremely old and poorly maintained pre-privatization. Our parent company, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, saw the need to take advantage of the port privatization process in order to enhance our value add to the Nigerian economy. Our terminal handles imports of both liquid and dry bulk shipments for Apapa, so you can expect us to handle tankers vessels for liquids and dry bulk carriers for wheat, Sugar, fertilizer and similar products. We currently handle bulk liquid products such as vegetable oil. Ethanol, Base oil, and other low-volatility petroleum products. We also handle export of bulk products such as wheat offal. I joined the organization in 2017 with the goal to improve on its processes and systems, in 2018, we won the Best Terminal Operator Award while in 2019 we also won Africa's leading Premium Port Terminal Management Services Company of the year award. We have made significant gains in the way we manage our activities and that has influenced us to be more efficient and customer-centric. We are therefore not just here to make money, but to do so the right way thus ensuring we keep the customer's interest foremost on our mind. We revised our vision to now include all the stakeholders in the business, and that is reflected in our behavior.</p><h4>What challenges does the port face with stranded empty containers? </h4><p>As we are mainly focused on bulk products, it does not apply to us at the terminal per se; however, as we share common roads, this impacts our movements and productivity. The congestion, about half of which is caused by the empty containers, affects us in that way. Because we are largely an import dependent economy, we have a challenge of dealing with large volumes of empty containers. If we had commensurate exports, then the containers would have found other uses and be widely spread out that way. In that scenario, we would have proper infrastructure from the factory gate to the port as an enabler for the export of goods. The port is currently upgrading its rail system, I expect that it will play a significant role in addressing some of the congestion presently being experienced. The dynamics of the port is expected to change upon completion of the rail upgrade in early 2020. Cargo movements will be quicker, and we will have more direct movement out of Lagos.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the overall impact of the reform of the port?</h4><p>Everything positive comes at a price. Before the port concession, waiting times at the port was long; ships remained at berth for several days up to a month. The port was inefficient, and little was working. Size of ships that could be accommodated was severely limited constrained by available depth. So only relatively smaller vessels could call. This meant low revenue and low growth. After the Port business was privatized, many of the inefficiencies disappeared, and the port became more commercially driven, channel and berth depths were improved, berths and cargo handling equipment were upgraded. We now have larger ships coming in, and dwell times are shorter. Unfortunately, the government overlooked the need to expand the infrastructure to be at par with the expected outcomes post privation. The port access via rail, inland waterways and land was not upgraded. The port access road needs to be expanded and repaired, the inland waterways that have not been utilized effectively, unlike in countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. The use of the waterways needs to be better regulated and navigable channels defined and marked to enable safe transit. In above mentioned countries, a large portion of cargo movement is done through their network of canals, taking advantage of their waterways, we have not exploited that resource in this part of the world, thus putting great pressure on the few access roads available. In 2019, we started seeing a shift from that with many private companies participating in barge operations. Hopefully, this will grow further, and regulation will be more robust to enable organizations and other third-party service providers participate. As a terminal, it is highly unlikely that we will own or operate barges, we will however support such companies, if these other modes of transport are fully exploited, the issue of road gridlock will most likely be completely resolved.</p><h4>What do you expect for 2020?</h4><p>I see growth first, although the port business in Nigeria is tricky; a great deal depends on the Federal government's policy pronouncements. If the economy grows, then the port business grows and vice versa. Although we are still predominantly an import nation, Apapa Bulk Terminal will be able to take advantage of the new businesses around and exploring export potentials, particularly with the African Free Trade Agreement. ABTL has increased its market share in the wet bulk and unitized cargo category without compromising its share in the dry bulk category, a little diversification to boost our positioning, we are also open to exploiting investments in other areas outside of Apapa. We have our ears to the ground on discussions regarding other opportunities to grow our land area, if possible. There is a deep-water port being considered in Ondo, Lagos, and Cross Rivers State. The Lekki seaport is also being developed, but for it to effectively compete with Apapa Port, a great deal of work will need to be done so that Lekki doesn't end up congested with the same problem of poor road access. A robust access infrastructure with adjoining arteries as well as power, will have to be developed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[AI in Home Security]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[umar-abdullahi-ceo-cosgrove]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges are inherent in the sector?</h4><p>One of the major challenges we are face in Nigeria is the dearth of skilled labor. I think we should go back to vocational training otherwise there will a lack of skilled people with requisite required skills; and as a result, every sector will suffer. Often, fresh graduates lack practical experience, so companies have to spend a lot to train them. In addition, risk in the real estate industry is global. Whenever there is a recession or economic downturn, the first sector that gets hit is real estate. Moreover, there are unavoidable external factors, therefore, we need a strategy to help us navigate out of a crisis. 2016 was a bad year for the Nigerian real estate sector; we got out of the recession at the beginning of 2017 and this is when we established Cosgrove to take advantage of the booming economy.</p><h4>How did you manage to build a solid reputation in the market in only two years?</h4><p>We are doing something different because we are leveraging on technology to enhance the quality of homeowners' life and protect the environment. Our methodology integrates technology into the real estate value chain, making Cosgrove pioneer in real estate automation and energy management, which is why I think we are making the headlines.</p><h4>What technologies and projects are your key differentiators?</h4><p>In order to better understand our target market, we conducted surveys of housing needs and found that the biggest priorities are security, power, location, quality, aesthetics, in that order. Therefore, our main priority is providing secure homesteads for all Cosgrove homeowners. Security in Nigeria is predominately human-based and our idea is to make it technology-based through advanced AI platforms. On the energy side, we are conscious about the environment and know the impact of hydrocarbons on the atmosphere. We won't be competitive if we invest 100% in renewable energy because the government and other private companies are offering cheaper gas-based alternatives. We are looking at this situation from two angles. First, we are going to make sure all our estates are sustained by renewable energies. To that end, we are planning to generate up to 1,500KVA of hydro energy. Also, we are in talks with the government to get permission to install solar panels; under our model we can generate around 2,500KVA of solar energy per hectare. We will be then able to sell the excess energy. We are trying to conserve the environment and ensure that we are operating on clean hydro and wind energy. Using our design, we can cut down energy consumption by half. For example, we can internally design the street lights and the elevators of all the apartments to be solar powered. We have one of the most advanced electricity inverters in the industry today. We are working with the second-largest security company in the world on AI-based services as well.<br></p><h4>What is your target market?</h4><p>Our clients are HNIs and upper-middle income individuals. Cosgrove has first movers' advantage and are committed to standardize smart tech integration with real estate, we envisage regulation as new entrants come into the market. We are trying to expand into affordable housing but the level of energy solutions and automation will not be as sophisticated.</p><h4>What is your view on the affordable housing gap?</h4><p>There is a bigger gap in affordable housing because of the kind of mortgage system in place. In Nigeria its quite hard to get long-term funding. This is where the mismatch occurs and I believe if the government can create an enabling environment for investors to bring in long-term funding, it will close the gap. The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria gives working class people access to low-interest loans for housing but the government should either float an international bond and make it private and expand their capital base. This will enable them to cater for a larger percentage of people who require affordable housing. The mismatch between the financial sector and the real estate sector is what is creating the housing deficit. This is not only the case in Nigeria but in most African countries where traditionally most people buy houses with their savings.</p><h4>How do you plan enter the affordable housing market and why do you want to expand into this sector?</h4><p>It is about bringing development to our country; it is not always about making profit. We believe the federal government is doing its best to create an enabling environment. The affordable housing market will be very attractive in the near future with what government is putting in place in terms of the framework and structure. Within the Federal Capital Territory, a company entering the affordable housing market can apply for the land but it is expected to provide the infrastructure to build. On the other hand, the cost of land in free which brings down the cost of the houses significantly.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2020? </h4><p>We are working with the World Bank through the IFC to certify our projects as green projects. That will give us the credibility and clout in the international market. We are using our 33-ha project in Katampe by Ministers' Hill Maitama to achieve that; our plan is to build over 1,000 houses and establish a mini smart city within the city. This is our vision for 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Rungas is involved across all areas in gas management. What are your main areas of expertise within LPG and CNG?</h4><p>In order to do this question justice there is need to identify the various areas that we have involvement in across the entire value chain of gas in Nigeria. Quite simply we have categorised our activities into gas trading, cylinder manufacturing, and storage. As a business, we understand that to grow the LPG market in Nigeria (and Africa as a whole), we need to ensure that the right infrastructures are available for the gas to be used. This is why our focus from the onset has been cylinders — we have worked at ensuring that safe and compliant cylinders that are being produced in and for Nigeria meet all safety standards and are made accessible and available to all. Our cylinders are unique: they do not explode in fire, they have a shelf life of 30 years, they are 40% lighter than conventional steel cylinder (thereby easier to carry and handle) but most importantly they have a gauge that tells users how much gas is left. These features are what have led to the success of our cylinders in the Nigerian market. We supply oil companies like MRS and Forte Oil one of our biggest clients is OVH Energy (formerly Oando). We currently also supply ENYO Retail and Supply, Sublime Oil and Gas, Ultimate Gas, MOB Integrated Services and a few Government Bodies across Nigeria. We started to import cylinders with our Portuguese partner (Amtrol Alfa), who is currently the largest in the world after its merger with Worthington Industries of the USA. The starting point for importing was to ensure that we had all the regulatory licenses for Nigeria; the next hurdle was importing the cylinders and raising awareness by collaborating with 10 gas plants owners across Nigeria — to distribute our cylinders with their own gas. Our next steps was to ensure that would be able to access affordable gas for the masses — we achieved this by aligning with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to procure gas in bulk at a cheaper price and this was how we commenced our trading activities within the Rungas group. We approached NNPC about revamping two of its strategically located facilities, and we now repair those facilities and supply gas there. That will help the country tremendously because there will be fewer trucks going to Apapa in Lagos for gas (as this area is congested). We continued to build our capacity in terms of volume so we are big on trading. We trade both domestic and export, and we do storage (both box storage and cylinder storage). Our engagement in gas will not only have financial and socio-cultural benefits for Nigeria, we also going to create a range of jobs across our manufacturing and support services from facilities all over Nigeria. In our support of the Local Content Act of Nigeria we will also be training 15 engineers in Europe to learn all elements of the technology involved in making our cylinders; they will in turn be responsible for training and all local staffs in our countries of operation.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on your collaboration with the United Group of Egypt and your other projects in the pipeline?</h4><p>Our first international exposure was as an exporter of natural gas liquids for NNPC. Going back to Egypt, Egypt has three manufacturing companies, all controlled by the National Organization for Military Production. It has been operating since the 1960s, but now imports CNG cylinders because many cars in Egypt use CNG. Thus, the government was interested in manufacturing these cylinders domestically. Because we had demonstrated we had the technology and explained our Nigerian experience in LPG, it joined us in a partnership to build a CNG plant. Rungas funded the partnership, while the government gave us the land and the regulatory backing we required to set up in Egypt. The company will be called Rungas Egypt. The Egypt market has opened up for us the Eastern African, North African, and Middle Eastern markets. We are already approved in Ghana, so we will supply cylinders in Ghana as soon as we start domestically producing in Nigeria. We are also going through the approval process in Cameroon and the Ivory Coast at the moment. Our agenda basically is to make this a project for the continent. In addition to the contracts that we have in place to supply cylinders to FORTE Oil and MRS Oil Nigeria; we were also given a separate contract to deploy skid tanks in all their stations across the country. We found a company in France that produces vending machines that allows individuals or customers to automatically exchange an empty cylinder for a filled cylinder—which would stop filling on site and unsafe practices that ensue at this locations. However, we had to go through a five-year process to get it approved, and by then, we discovered it was too costly for some people. Now, as part of our emerging strategy, we are looking at a different alternative which will be showcased across Nigeria in the very near future having been approved by government.</p><h4>What is the private and public sector doing to contribute to making LPG more accessible in Nigerian homes?</h4><p>In Nigeria in the LPG Industry we have associations, government agencies and private investors. All the bodies are working to deepen the saturation and use of LPG because of the numerous benefits associated with it. However more collaborations are needed to accelerate the uptake of LPG across Nigeria. Noteworthy Associations pushing for the use of LPG and adoption as the fuel of choice in Nigeria are the Nigeria Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (NLPGA), the Lagos Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (LPG Group) Women in LPG — Nigeria Chapter (WINLPG), the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB). As a company Rungas Group has been dealing with state governments who seek to implement programs but not everyone knows them. NTMBD has a clear focus to drive the LPG market by providing funding for local cylinder manufacturing. There is the Federal Executive Council, with a dedicated project management office headed by the vice-president, also set in place to deploy 5 million cylinders. People are definitely using gas, and we cannot drive the market without cylinders. Hence as a company our contribution to the growth of the LPG industry will be significant.</p><h4>How do you envision the sector in the next five years? </h4><p>As someone who has been involved in trading crude and gas, gas is the future, not just for cooking, but for power. It can be traded on international markets, and the finished product can be used for multiple purposes. Gasoline was the fuel that powered America; coal powered Europe, especially the UK; and crude oil powered China. I see gas as the fuel that will power Africa.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for your company in 2020?</h4><p>My key priorities are to use our Egypt project as a stepping point to import CNG cylinders to other parts of Africa. Once we have the local manufacturing in place and fully operational, the next step is making it affordable and spreading the use of composite cylinders as a way of encouraging the use of cleaner fuels. People are afraid that these traditional steel cylinders will explode. Once you provide packaging that is cleaner and safer, it will give people more confidence in the product. As a business, we also have the Rungas Foundation, which puts 1% of our profits into funds for projects connected to food banks in three regions of Nigeria. We started with three key areas where we can provide basics—like soup, bread, indomie and water. We are also linked to and support organizations such as the Gas to Health initiative, which gives out free cylinders for rural people cooking on roadsides. As a company—we believe in gas and are doing all we can to make it the fuel of choice in Nigeria and Africa as a whole.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[berry-ademola-managing-director-cns-marine]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CNS Marine is involved in various segments of the offshore space. Which are the most important revenue-wise?</h4><p>Subsea solutions are the most important in terms of revenue. We support international companies that are currently producing or exploring in Nigeria's offshore waters. We do not have many local clients. However, there are some indigenous companies that participate in offshore, like Amni, Oriental and Lekoil. Periodically we have requirements to support their offshore operations. There is a shortage of indigenous companies working offshore or on the service side, therefore, we have been successful in this space by focusing on finding the best partners that provide us with technical support and the capacity to participate in these spaces. We are constantly looking for ways to develop and bring in new technologies that will support our clients. We have become a trusted partner for quite a number of companies. We work together with them to deliver services offshore. As for why IOCs would choose an indigenous company such as CNS Marine, the reason lies in our ability to deliver the service with the proven track record of success. Going through the technical process and being evaluated properly is how we get to participate. This is a capital-intensive industry, which makes it a challenge to retain access to opportunities. Interest rates right now are high, sometimes at greater than 20% so to fund an offshore operation, access to capital becomes a priority. We deal with this by running a lean organization. We bootstrap and reinvest revenues to ensure we can support our projects. We have developed relationships with finance houses as well but in a oerfect world, access to international capital with close to zero interest rate is why multinational services companies will always stay ahead of Nigerian service. This is still an area where the whole sector needs help. We have been able to survive and run lean operations while delivering the services needed. We are constantly looking for new opportunities in asset acquisition can capacity building. Our current model is to find partners of like-mind to share assets and maximize asset utilization. Coming out of the market downturn, there is still a lot of assets out there that are underutilized.</p><h4>What is your financial engineering strategy?</h4><p>It really depends on what is the opportunity and what are the terms of the project we are entering. To be more specific, we are currently looking at long-term opportunities for more offshore works. We must decide what type of investment is needed to be able to participate. We found a partner locally that has the assets we need. Those types of strategies come on an individual basis. We make decisions based on the terms, client requirements, and types of investments that will be needed. Traditionally we fund growth from internally generated revenue and through local banks that show keen interest in growing with us. During the drop off in oil prices a couple of years back, we had to adapt. We were lucky because we are a lean organization. On the service side of the business, we have a lot of contracted staff; therefore, when we go offshore, we ramp up our personnel to meet the requirements. When the downturn came, what we had left were administrative and operational staff on some specific projects. There was no room for expansion during that period. What we could do was to use the time and find new solutions coming out of the downturn that we could then offer our clients. As the oil prices dropped, that affected the Oil companies' ability to fund projects greatly so there was a major pull back in offshore work. That directly impacted us, so we had to wait out the downturn. We have seen a turnaround in the last 12 or 18 months. We anticipate that this will continue. In the energy market, the trend is usually a five to seven-year cycle. On managing cashflow, the payment split between Naira and US dollars helps us to maintain our local infrastructure. We keep our resources and revenues here, as opposed to international competitors that are keen to move their money overseas. This allows us to reinvest.</p><h4>What benefits has the Local Content Act brought to the organization?</h4><p>It has forced local companies to invest and provide better services. If you are going to use local content completely, then you need to ensure you provide the same standards as a multinational competitor. For example, in our sector, your company needs to be certified to ensure you have the proper management systems and qualified delivery of services. In the past, maybe five years ago, there was no such requirement. Now there is. It puts you on the same level playing field, so that an IOC cannot say an indigenous company is missing certifications that an international company has. We are currently in the process of acquiring all those certifications to ensure that our clients get the comfort needed that we meet international standards.</p><h4>As new oil and gas markets in Africa emerge, how competitive is still Nigeria compared to its fellow African countries and what should be done to attract more investment?</h4><p>Nigeria has been forced to look at other industries to generate revenue. The attention to the oil and gas sector has declined. Overall, we need to increase exploration. If we do that, then we can develop those large infrastructure projects like other up an coming emerging markets. We are part of OPEC, so there is only so much that we can produce. At least on the exploration side you can you're your reserves so its imperative that this remains a priority in Nigeria's Oil and Gas sector. That will keep people like us busy, since we provide some of the services needed in the exploratory stage before production. That is the only thing that can really bring back the activity. We have only explored 10% of the Gulf of Guinea. There are still huge opportunities. The global markets also control the exploration. As demand goes up, then you have to find new supplies. Nigeria is not a huge gas consumption country, so we export most of the gas we have but as our domestic consumption rises and the thirst for clean energy grows, Nigeria will get its share of the pie. The government's commitment to increase our output is evident in the recent green light for a large scale project like NLNG's Train 7.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>We hope and expect that 2020 will be a better year than 2019. There are several projects in the pipeline. We anticipate that oil prices, which are going up today, will drive the industry. A stable and high price for oil will keep everyone happy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Azuri Peninsula: Fastest Construction]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ramzi-chidiac-managing-director-itb-nigeria-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are ITB Construction's milestone projects in recent years?</h4><p>Since 2015, we have built some iconic projects, namely Kuramo Beach Residence, which was completed quickly. It is 60,000sqm of 22-storey residential blocks, each done in less than two years. We also did Heritage Place, an office building in Ikoyi. It is the first LEED-certified building in Nigeria. We built Kingsway Towers, which are office blocks opposite Heritage. It is an excellent building designed by SAOTA from South Africa. We then built Azuri Peninsula, a project farther inside the Eko Atlantic city. People may not see and appreciate the progress being made. Azuri is a three 32-storey towers. It was the fastest construction in Nigeria. In Nigeria, you usually construct 10 to 20 storeys in 10 months. Here we did 96 storeys.</p><h4>Are you mainly targeting international investors for your buildings?</h4><p>Yes, as well as oil and gas companies. We recently got awarded two projects; one is on Ozumba Mbadiwe road, where Ecobank will relocate their headquarters. The other one is a project for a cooperative of an oil company. We are building three residential towers in Eko Atlantic. We are also busy at the refinery of Dangote.</p><h4>How has ITB raised the bar and contributed to Nigeria's construction sector? </h4><p>We are maybe the only construction company in Nigeria that is ISO certified for our Quality management system (ISO 9001:2015), Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ISO 45001:2018), and Environmental Management System (ISO 14001:2015). We have raised the bar in quality not only in what you see, but in the processes. That means we are careful before, during, and after construction in the measures that we have on site and in our various departments and divisions. Our health and safety records for the past 10 years show a steady decline in lost time injuries. So far, thankfully we have had no fatalities, which is amazing. We are very proud of that. Our safety records are impressive, especially with the enormous buildings we are constructing.</p><h4>What are the challenges of Nigeria's construction industry?</h4><p>We have all the latest technologies in construction and ITB is possibly the only company in Nigeria who does pre-cast slabs and beams in our factories at Ibadan and Abuja. Though, buildings require a lot of competence from Nigerian engineers to follow up with the level of construction we are doing. But this competence is not yet academically available in Nigeria. The Engineering education system in Nigeria does not yet graduate engineers who can follow up with today's technology and level of construction that is being done in Nigeria. The level of construction is a lot better than it was 10 to 15 years ago and it is developing at a faster pace. There is a lot of competition, and everybody is raising the bar, which we did with ISO certification, health, and safety measures, as well as quality.</p><h4>How have you overcome this challenge?</h4><p>We always must have international expertise among local and experienced staff. Of course, we cannot have it everywhere. Our ratio is about 3.5% of expatriates compared to locals. Our senior staff is about 8% of the entire population of ITB. Our junior staff are experienced tradesmen, most of them have been with us for more than eight years. Also, we have many of them who have been with us for more than 15 years. They know all our technologies and procedures. They have been with the company for a long time that they understand the system and how we operate. We rely on them more than the expatriates to teach new engineers or workers whom we recruit.</p><h4>How would you assess the attractiveness of the Nigerian construction industry and what are its peculiarities?</h4><p>In Lagos, we do not face many challenges. However, in the South the major obstacles we find are community issues. On a weekly basis, the contractor has a lot of problems with the local communities. There are politics that must be played. You put a lot of time and effort into settling community issues, which you need to do in order to employ people. Another important issue is the lack of high-quality construction materials in Nigeria. About 40% to 50% of the cost of these projects goes into importation. We need to import everything to enable us deliver luxurious projects.</p><h4>Would you consider localizing that part of the construction process?</h4><p>ITB is maybe one of the only construction companies that has all the trades in-house. We do the design and engineering, the approval of the construction, and building permits before moving to site. We also have a piling division, then we do the construction of the main project. ITB gets its mechanical and electrical services within the company with our ITB MEP affiliate. We have a joinery factory for all the furniture needs including doors, and an aluminium factory that does all the glass and windows. The only activity that we do not possess in house is the vertical transportation.</p><h4>Now the economy has stabilized, how will the construction industry perform?</h4><p>The economic recession and devaluation that occurred in 2015 impacted the private sector and in particular the construction industry. Many developers were, and are still reluctant to develop projects in the big cities like Lagos or Abuja. Today, there are a lot of vacancies in offices, flats, hotel rooms, and malls. This means that all new developers coming to build such development must do a feasibility study and when they did, they are faced with a report showing 400,000sqm of empty office spaces in Lagos, 1,000 empty hotel rooms and thousands of empty flats. Why would they come in when they know that they cannot get a return on their investment?</p><h4>Is the sector now recovering?</h4><p>If the developer is sure that he has his own clientele, then he is proceeding with development. These developers are shrinking in numbers. For anyone who wants to develop a mall, if they do not secure 60% off takers before starting construction, they will not proceed.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>The year 2020 looks better than the last two years for ITB, especially with the two contracts we got awarded. ITB are looking forward to another two huge development at Eko Atlantic city. With these projects, ITB will be in good shape for the next two years at least.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi has been ranked the safest city in the world for four years in a row by Numbeo. What policing measures have had the most immediate impact in reducing Abu Dhabi's crime index? </h4><p>Abu Dhabi being named as one of the safest cities in the world for the fourth year running by Numbeo is confirmation that the citizens and residents who live here and visitors that travel to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi are blessed to have a high level of personal security and safety. This accomplishment can be credited to the unlimited support and care that is extended by our visionary leaders, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. It is not by chance that Abu Dhabi, and the UAE in general, has become an oasis of stability and safety.  Our leadership prioritizes the promotion of peace and safety as two fundamental pillars in society and provides all the necessary resources to achieve these goals. As a result, our community is exceptionally safe and this has been increasingly acknowledged internationally, for example by Numbeo that ranks Abu Dhabi as the city with the highest safety index of 88.67 and the lowest crime index of just 11.33. To maintain safety, Abu Dhabi Police continues to implement a comprehensive strategy and embrace initiatives that represent important achievements in the field of policing. These gains are important for community safety and contribute to the on-going story of the country as it continues to provide an attractive environment for citizens, residents and visitors to enjoy peace, well-being and an excellent quality of living. Central to our approach is the community-oriented policing and outreach initiatives that positively enhance our interaction with the community and helps to reinforce the public's sense of safety.</p><h4>What are some of the best current global policing practices, and how is the Abu Dhabi police incorporating these into local policing? </h4><p>Abu Dhabi Police constantly benchmarks itself against other police agencies and units across the world. Knowledge-sharing with global police and security bodies is also a key component of our development that enhances our ability to maintain, and improve on, best international practices in policing and crime prevention. The on-going evolution of our security systems across the various sectors of the Police, for example, is a reflection of the desire to benefit from our international interaction in order to enhance performance.</p><h4>Cyber-crime is a significant threat across the globe. What are some of the strategies the Abu Dhabi Police are deploying to combat this?</h4><p>Highly trained and equipped staff that are well educated on the legal procedures surrounding cyber-crime are a key layer in our ability to confront this challenge. The need to raise awareness on the dangers of cyber-crime is also met by Abu Dhabi Police through the undertaking of campaigns, programs, forums, and participation in seminars on the best ways to fight this menace.</p><h4>What is the perspective of Abu Dhabi's law enforcement on the best ways to leverage innovative technologies, and what are some technological initiatives the force is currently exploring and deploying?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Police aims to promote employee creativity in all areas, which has led to the implementation of many innovations.  For instance, during the UAE Month of Innovation 2019, Abu Dhabi Police introduced a smart quad bike to its range of patrol vehicles. The specially adapted quad bike enhances our ability to patrol over rough terrain and access remote areas. It is equipped with a smart camera installed to capture, update and store information. The bike efficiently performs all the functions of a traditional patrol vehicle but carries out the multiple tasks in a one-step process. Officers are specially trained to operate the smart bikes while the high-tech system enables the officers to respond to all types of emergencies and security situations across all terrain and locations.</p><h4>As Abu Dhabi grows its presence as an international transshipment port there is increased vulnerability to the smuggling of inbound precursor chemicals, illegal drugs, and counterfeit goods. What are some of the steps the Abu Dhabi police along with the UAE customs are taking to tackle these issues?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Police has recently signed a MoU with Abu Dhabi Customs to share information and develop training methods on the early detection of banned substances. The custom officers and drug enforcement personnel receive specialized courses including training on body language, drug detection procedures, among others. There is a law in place that governs the import and export of precursor chemicals. Moreover, companies allowed to trade in precursor chemicals are subject to routine monitoring and inspections. Drug enforcement teams at the border points are highly experienced in all types of precursor chemicals and are fully prepared to prevent any smuggling attempts in coordination with customs officers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess, thus far, the impacts of GBF Africa 2019, and what are the takeaways from the event that you are most excited about as Dubai Chamber enters a next phase of collaboration the Continent?</h4><p>Held in Dubai, Global Business Forum Africa (GBF Africa) is the first event of its kind that was launched under our flagship GBF event series in 2013. Since then, it has become one of our largest and most successful forums that has seen growing interest and participation from heads of state, policymakers, business leaders, entrepreneurs and industry experts from across Africa and the UAE. Over 2,500 delegates from 76 countries attended the fifth edition of forum GBF Africa in 2019, marking a 67 percent increase in participation compared to the previous edition of the forum. We also recorded a 75 percent increase in the number of bilateral business meetings that were held during GBF Africa 2019, compared to the previous edition in 2017, which tells us that the forum has truly become an important platform for African and UAE companies to discuss concrete business prospects and explore partnership opportunities. Among the key takeaways from GBF Africa 2019 was the launch of the “Be Part of Dubai“ initiative that will grant long-term UAE Golden Residency Visas to prominent investors. We see this initiative as a mechanism to attract prospective investors from Africa to Dubai and position the emirate as a preferred hub for African companies that are keen to enter the market or expand their reach in the Middle East and Asia. During GBF Africa 2019, Dubai Chamber announced its role as an Official Partner to Expo 2020 Dubai. In its capacity as a business facilitator, Dubai Chamber is preparing to host the largest and most comprehensive GBF Africa to date at the mega event, in addition to more than 30 other business forums. We expect that the Expo 2020 Dubai platform will only add to significance of GBF Africa and elevate Dubai's position as a global business hub. We look forward to welcoming African nations and the world to Dubai in 2020. Another major highlight for GBF Africa 2019 was the GBF Mentorship Programme. Following the launch of the programme in early 2019, several UAE and African startups went through an intensive mentorship and training program — the results of which came to fruition at GBF Africa 2019. During the forum, the selected startups used to platform to pitch their businesses to prospective investors, while participated mentors shared their insights on existing potential within startups communities in the UAE and Africa. We were very encouraged by the overwhelming response and successful results of the first cycle this year — which is why we are delighted to announce our plans to launch the second cycle of the program in 2020.</p><h4>The focus on startups that we saw at the GBF Africa 2019 forum extends across Dubai Chamber's work. How is Dubai Chamber taking a leading position in building the start-up ecosystem in Dubai?</h4><p>Supporting entrepreneurship is a key focus of Dubai Chamber's strategy and the Chamber offers a wide range of programs, initiatives and services to Dubai's startup community through its Dubai Startup Hub platform. More than 3,000 start-ups have joined Dubai Startup Hub since its inception in 2016, with more than 7,000 start-ups benefitting from its various programs and initiatives such as Co-Founder Dubai, the Dubai Smartpreneur Competition, and Market Access. In addition, we have launched various series that provide an opportunity for the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Dubai to network, learn about best practices and address key challenges. Such efforts are designed to meet the changing needs of Dubai's diverse and growing startup community and guide entrepreneurs throughout their journey. We have also stepped up efforts to attract promising startups to Dubai, by promoting the emirate at various international roadshows and opening our programs and competitions to startup communities outside of the UAE. More than 25 startup ecosystems, including Moscow and India, were covered by Dubai Startup Hub in 2019 to highlight the competitive advantages that Dubai offers startups. In addition, including 16 of our startup members were given an opportunity to exhibit at GITEX Future Stars 2019, the largest event of its kind in the region, and meet with several international business delegations. Going forward, we will continue to work with our partners in the public and private sectors to ensure that our efforts support the emirate's ambitions as it pushes ahead with its development plans for the next 50 years. We believe that Dubai has everything it needs to cement its position as a top entrepreneurial hub and launch pad for the region's next unicorn startups.</p><h4>Dubai Chamber continues to rapidly expand its presence in various regions of the world. Are there specific markets where you anticipate higher contribution to growth rates and more growth potential?</h4><p>International expansion and outreach remain key areas of focus for Dubai Chamber as our members increasingly look abroad for new growth opportunities. In 2019, the Chamber opened representative offices in Shenzhen, China, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, two markets where we see tremendous potential — while plans were announced to open an additional office in Mexico in the near future. The Chamber participated in 109 outbound missions to promote Dubai as a global business hub, and received a record number of visiting delegations. Our 11 representative offices around the world are actively exploring business potential in promising markets and attracting companies to Dubai. At the moment, we are looking at several markets in Latin America, Africa and Eurasia that offer trade and investment potential for UAE companies. These regions are in the midst of change as they push ahead with reforms, shift towards regional economic integration, expand trade links and attract foreign investment. In an effort to more effectively promote and position Dubai as a global business hub, we took the Global Business Forum series abroad for the very first time in 2019. We hosted the third edition of GBF Latin America in Panama and the response was overwhelmingly positive —which signals a growing awareness and confidence in Dubai as a global gateway for Latin American companies.</p><h4>With all eyes on Dubai, how do you foresee Expo 2020 impacting trade and Dubai's economy? </h4><p>There is no denying the significance of the business opportunity presented by Expo 2020. Dubai's skyline and infrastructure have completely transformed in preparation for the event. Major projects and initiatives linked to Expo are creating far-reaching economic and social benefits, many of which will build on Expo 2020's legacy and remain long after the mega event is over. Take District 2020, for example, which will comprise of around 80 percent of the Expo site. The district, designed as a community that fosters innovation and collaboration between different stakeholders, is expected to support the UAE's long-term growth and development. Various sectors within the UAE's economy have already begun witnessing the Expo effect, including trade, logistics, tourism, construction, finance, retail and real estate, with the economic boost expected to be recorded during the six month event. E&amp;Y recently estimated that Expo 2020 Dubai will contribute USD33.3 billion to the UAE's economy by 2031. As the first-ever World Expo to be held in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia region, Expo 2020 Dubai offers tremendous trade potential for many countries in the region that are leveraging the event platform to showcase their economic potential,  boost their global profile and expand their trade links with other nations. Dubai's foreign trade will likely get a significant boost during the six-month event, while the millions of tourists from around the world visiting Dubai for the Expo are expected to fuel momentum behind key economic sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and retail.</p><h4>As an official partner of Expo, what specific impacts is Dubai Chamber looking to achieve through Expo 2020? What is the significance of your collaboration with Expo 2020 for Dubai Chamber?</h4><p>We see Expo 2020 Dubai as an ideal opportunity for the UAE to expand its trade links with other countries around the world and build new bridges of cooperation between different business communities. Dubai Chamber is capitalizing on that opportunity in its role as an Official Expo 2020 Dubai Partner that will provide the right platforms for UAE companies to connect with their global counterparts during the event and explore business partnerships. Dubai Chamber will bring together government and business leaders from around the world as it hosts 33 business forums and seminars and runs on-site Expo 2020 Dubai Business Connect Centre during the event. High-level events organized by Dubai Chamber include the largest-ever Global Business Forum Africa (GBF Africa), GBF Latin America, the inaugural GBF ASEAN, the World Chambers Congress 2021, 30 country focus briefings, while the Chamber is extending its support to other premier conferences such as The Retail Summit 2020 and the Global Islamic Economy Summit.</p><h4>How does Expo 2020 align with your strategic priorities for Dubai Chamber as we look beyond 2020 and into the next decade?</h4><p>Expo 2020 Dubai's theme of “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future“ and strong focus on building partnerships are very much aligned with Dubai Chamber's mission, vision and strategy. As a business facilitator, Dubai Chamber plays an active role in fostering cross border collaboration and expanding Dubai's trade links with other markets. Dubai Chamber is among the most active organizations promoting Dubai on a global level through its vast networking of representative offices, Global Business Forums and the various trade missions organized every year. These efforts are a testament to the importance we attached to building bridges of cooperation between business communities around the world. Beyond trade facilitation and international outreach, the Chamber is also stepping up efforts to foster a culture of innovation within Dubai's business community. Given that the World Expo is among the most important global platforms for showcasing the latest innovations and technologies, we are looking to leverage this opportunity to share our experiences with the world and learn from other countries that are harnessing mobility, sustainability and opportunity to drive economic progress and create a brighter future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[high-impact-projects-for-2020]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main driver behind founding Viathan?</h4><p>We started Viathan to implement solutions to solve the power challenges in Nigeria. The Lagos State Government was spending a significant amount of resources to fuel and maintain diesel generators to power street lights, government buildings and other public facilities. We understood the problem and proposed to solve it by generating electricity in a more reliable, cleaner and efficient manner. We undertook market research and feasibility studies to dimension the scope of the power deficit in Lagos and the rest of Nigeria. We presented our ideas to the Lagos State Electricity Board (“LSEB“) which reviewed our proposal and developed a project concept document which was presented to the Public Private Partnership Office. The process included a presentation to the State Executive Council and a Committee chaired by the PPP Office. Within 15-months of the State signing off on the power purchase agreement, we commissioned Viathan's PIPP LVI Genco. The Project was a success as we met our initial objectives of providing reliable power for the Lagos State Governments facilities. We provide power for over 160km of public lighting in Lagos alone, the Lekki-Epe Expressway toll booths, Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge tolls, Alexander Water Works, Hakeem Dickson Water Works and several health facilities to name a few. We continue to grow our business by developing and acquiring additional power plants. Viathan, through its subsidiary companies currently owns, and/or operates a combined installed capacity of approximately 52MW and 150km of distribution assets across six power plants in Lagos and Ogun State combined.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your business model?</h4><p>Viathan focuses on localising existing business models to suit prevailing market conditions. While undertaking our feasibility study for Viathan we carried out an extensive study of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (“NESI“) with a clear objective of identifying and eliminating the inhibitors. In Nigeria today, more than half of the installed generation capacity is stranded. Of the capacity that is generated, a significant proportion—25%-30% of the power—is lost. We designed a viable distributed generation model to effectively deliver power to end users. This simply means the design, build, operations and maintenance of power assets where needed and close to off-take points and power evacuation apparatus that serve consumers. Our business model complements the DisCos. We are currently partnering with some of them to improve power delivery to strategic economic clusters.</p><h4>Why would DisCos want to partner with Viathan?</h4><p>The goal of the DisCos is to sell more power to improve its power reliability and increase its bottom line. Certain constraints and bottlenecks restrain the DisCos from achieving this goal. DisCos who form strategic partnerships can reduce these constraints. Partnership with DisCos would allow us to scale quickly, and increase power supply. It is unfair to blame all the problems on DisCos, as a sizeable proportion of these issues is due to the dissonance in the entire value chain, thus the industry needs policy consistency. For instance, today, different players buy gas at different prices for rendering the same service and beyond this also lies the issue of cost reflective tariffs. Gas contracts are typically take or pay, whereas the consumer now understands the need for competitiveness and for getting power when they need it. This take-or-pay models are fast evolving to a hybrid, which blends the latter with take and pay models. There needs to be better optimized investments in infrastructure along that value chain. Transmission is improving; however, more coordination and cooperation is required between transmission companies and the DisCos, and between DisCos and providers like us.</p><h4>Viathan was the pioneer in Nigeria in utilizing infrastructure bonds to finance power projects. What made Viathan choose this funding method?</h4><p>Viathan issued a N10 billion, ten (10) year 16% coupon, corporate infrastructure bond in Nigeria in 2018. This was the first tranche of a N50 Billion bond programme financed by Nigerian Pension Fund Administrators and guaranteed by Infrastructure Credit Company Limited (“InfraCredit“). This Bond was the first of its kind in Nigeria and has benefited Viathan by imbuing strong governance structures, access to capital, increased market share and lower cost of capital. Bond financing is cheaper and affords us a longer tenor. We are a great candidate for infrastructure bonds, as we have assets that are already generating cash flow. Moreover, the Bond structure was flexible enough to allow us to scale up.</p><h4>Do infrastructure bonds reduce risks for the project Sponsor?</h4><p>Anything that reduces pricing reduces default risk. The proceeds of the Bond went into refinancing current obligations, which were in the 23-24% range, whereas these bonds were issued at 16%. The process of obtaining the Bond imposed a high level of governance structures on the business which better positioned us for sustainable growth. It is known globally that there is strong correlation between governance and profitability. Given that multiple stakeholders are beneficiaries of the Bond it gives some semblance of protection from political exigencies. Beyond the reduced pricing which reduces the default risk, the 10-year Bond enables us to match funding source with similar tenored PPAs which ensures that debt obligations will be met.</p><h4>What is your take on how Nigeria will progress to take advantage of its gas resources and move toward cleaner energy?</h4><p>Gas is the fuel of the future in Africa. Its advantages over competing fuels are clear. Gas is one of Africa's most abundant energy resources, it is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than diesel. At Viathan we believe gas could form the basis for the sustainable industrialisation of Africa. In line with this belief, we have committed and will continue to commit substantial resources to developing the gas market for the industrialisation of Nigeria. Our subsidiary company, Gasco Marine Limited built a 144,000SCM/Day capacity compressed natural gas (“CNG“) plant which provides gas to industrial customers in the power and manufacturing sectors. We are investing in developing the Natural Gas Vehicles (“NGV“) market to implement transport solutions which utilizes natural gas as the fuel of choice. Viathan's effort in accelerating the adoption of gas in commerce and industry will help displace diesel which in turn will reduce carbon emissions and result in savings to bus operators. This will go a long way in supporting Nigeria in meeting its commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>In 2020 we will be embarking on a number of high impact projects. We will be expanding our geographical reach to the northern, central and south-southern areas of Nigeria. We will deepen our partnership with the DisCos to foster collaboration in solving the power challenges. We will take giant strides in 2020 toward our 2023 goal of selling 200MW in this market. We will also be diversifying our energy mix by piloting Africa's first floating solar PV-farm. We expect 2020 to be a pivotal period in the story of Viathan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ricardo-lecompte-general-director-pasa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current perception of the construction industry in Mexico and how does this impact your business at the moment?</h4><p>The construction and infrastructure industry are going through an abnormal phase. In PASA, we have great business with the government through our contractors. We specialize in waterproofing and construction chemicals, to any type of building. The issue is that the government policies, about construction, have not been clear, until now. In Mexico City, our main market, doesn`t exist new licenses to build, on the other hand, in Monterrey, it is completely different. They made (government of Monterrey) great policies to stimulate construction. We need more infrastructure for piers, airports, roads, highways, aqueducts, energy, etc. Because we`re a country with122 million people and every day, every year, we grow in different businesses. It is also necessary to establish better infrastructure to promote education, health and food, for us. We are waiting for new policies to develop and stimulate our business. At the moment, it is not clear what the next steps will be in our country. With regard to international investment, we have our most important partner in the US, especially given our great industrial parks in all the country.</p><h4>What kind of products do you manufacture?</h4><p>We have two facilities. This one is called Cuautitlan, and another located about 30km from here in Tepeji del Rio, Hidalgo. We are producing waterproofing products, admixtures for concrete, caulks, sealants, concrete mortars, paints. We also make solutions for architectural finishing in any building. We are interested in expanding our participation in other countries. Currently, we export to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama, and are working with people interested in Colombia and Peru. We are thinking of expanding into the Caribbean, but it is not easy to do so because they greatly protect their local industry.</p><h4>What is the main objective behind the release of your new product, PURIFI-K?</h4><p>We are launching a new products line in 2019, PURIFI-K, a brand for new products from PASA with a technology called 'photocatalysis,' a more sustainable product. When PURIFI-K gets in contact with UV rays and the air, especially pollution (COx, NOx and SOx), they catalyze the polluted air, separate these compounds, and free oxygen, carbon and other elements, in inert form. The solution can be mixed with anything, including paint, waterproofers, or any of the products that benefit from this technology. It cleans the air. In other words, it will do similar as photosynthesis. We have presented a patent request since this is the only product in the market that can do this. This was a product developed in Mexico with the support of the most important universities here, especially from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional and their Laboratory for Innovation, 'CIITEC.' So we are rightfully excited. We invested in machines, marketing, sales, strategies, and packaging to make a different product from our competitors. </p><h4>What needs of the market drove Pasa to develop this?</h4><p>Generally, much more is needed to maintain or fix the environment. Everybody attacks the plastic industry, but this is completely wrong. Thanks to plastic, life is not how it used to be a hundred years ago. Pipelines are made of plastic, water bottles, artificial hearts, cell phones, computers, cars, etc. The plastic industry is very important for life in every country. Waterproofing is plastic. Thanks to this industry, life is much cheaper today. Perhaps in some countries, sustainability educational programs will be run. In PASA, we identified a major problem with the air. Mexico is on the top 10 countries with the most polluted air in the world. Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toluca, Silao, Leon, Salamanca, Mexico City, and Puebla are our most polluted cities. In my office, we breathe pollution. Outside is even more dangerous. Approximately 21,000 people die in Mexico per year due to pollution. This is data from the UN. Our focus is to think differently as we have done during our 34 years. It is rebranding.</p><h4>What strategies are you using to increase your coverage in the country? </h4><p>In waterproofing, we are among the leaders of this industry. When you need waterproofing in Mexico, you think about PASA. With paint, however, we have far less market share, but we have a great product. Our slogan is "waterproof technology." We are a construction chemical company, and our portfolio includes products for concrete, concrete repair, and producing concrete, like admixtures and mortars. We also have covering products like epoxy floors and paint for highways.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[100,000 Miners in Unions]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[carlos-pavon-campos-director-general-national-union-miners-metallurgists-frente]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general perspective on the mining sector considering the amount of misinformation in the country?</h4><p>While there are risks in mining, companies are investing in creating safe workplaces that are as sustainable as possible. Unfortunately, there is considerable misinformation about the sector, which has caused many people to see mining negatively. As leaders of a mining union, we support mining because we support about 17,000 colleagues who are miners. We support responsible mining that cares for the ecology and safety of workers. When the union was created, we accepted responsibility for the safety of workers because the life of our colleagues are at risk. Nine years ago, companies gave us the power to ban union members from working in unsafe places. Many mining companies are putting effort into this aspect. Companies now provide us with personal protective equipment. There are about 300,000 miners in the country, with about one-third unionized.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the recently approved labor reform in Mexico on the union and its structure with companies?</h4><p>We have collective agreements with Peñoles, Frisco, and Oro Gold, among others. Now, we are informing people about the current situation and possible changes. More than anything, we are guiding people to decide what should be done. It will not affect our relationship with companies because we have excellent existing relationships. The labor reform is opposed to freedom of association, which is upheld by ILO conventions that are considered constitutional. The new labor reform in Mexico allows the government to regulate an independent body, putting these bodies' autonomy at risk. It will use these situations to create conflicts in mines through the creation of more unions, which makes it difficult to conduct contract review negotiations. There is an established rule stating that the change of union is a syndical liberty. There is a secret vote, supervised by the authority, and people choose the union. This new law does not consider us miners; it was created without considering mining, as it is different from other industries. Union autonomy is being broken because the only ones responsible for creating and modifying the statutes are the workers themselves; now, the government will interfere more. It never consulted the workers about this reform. In fact, 80% of the workers in this country do not know it is labor reform.</p><h4>What strategies is the union using to increase the visibility of the mining industry?</h4><p>We have spoken to companies and had journalists visit mines to learn about our work. We are working on improving gender equality and making the job safer and more visible. In the union we represent, there are no differences between men and women, rights-wise. We want to take care of women so they are not harassed by workers and employees. We want security not only for the company but also for the people who work there. We all work out of necessity, not for fun. We have to give job stability to our colleagues. We seek safety, job stability, and benefits for workers. For example, in Fresnillo, the company Los Jales built a forest with artificial rivers; that is the only place where people can have fun. The company was not forced to create this. Responsible mining exists. People talk about pollution, but no miner gets sick from pollution. A few years ago, we had tuberculosis problems, but it was eradicated by using personal protective equipment. In some mines, we make relatives go down into the mine, so they know their relatives are working in safe places.</p><h4>For a company that is looking to establish an agreement with a union, what added value do you offer compared to other unions in the country?</h4><p>Our added value is job stability. We can solve everything by talking. In all our nine years, we have not had a conflict of unemployment or strikes because we have had the ability to solve problems by talking. I care about people and have to watch over my colleagues. There are many people who do not want to go on strike, and we as leaders cannot force them; it has to be their own free will and according to what they decide. Now that we have to register contracts, we have no problems because we have always negotiated contracts. A commission of the unit or the corresponding section comes, we accompany them through the revision, and a contract is not signed if the assembly does not accept it. We do not have problems because these are not new things for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[USD15 Million for 500 Centers]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jose-luis-elizondo-lopez-founder-chief-membership-officer-wellmedic]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in the health sector that motivated you to create a co-working center for the health industry in the country?</h4><p>Wellmedic Health Centers is the first specialized co-working space in the health sector in the world. I have almost 15 years in the world of real estate, which led me to become an investor in real estate and get acquainted with different business models. This concept was conceived in the US 30 years ago and evolved into the co-working space model it is today. This model of intelligent workspaces is an ideal solution to promote business entrepreneurship and facilitate the operations of small and medium-sized businesses. It allows small entrepreneurs to focus on their business and forget about working space management. When I realized there was nothing in the specialized sector worldwide, I decided to invest my assets and invite investment partners to create the first health center in the city of Monterrey. There we established ourselves and in December completed four years of operations. We started the first unit with 30 offices in a 1,000sqm center with fully equipped offices. We currently have seven units in operation, and the model has been strengthening. Today we serve a little more than 200 specialists, mainly doctors from more than 35 different disciplines, from pediatricians to geriatricians who are specialists in older adults. And everything you can imagine.</p><h4>What is the advantage of having a Wellmedic office compared to having one in a private hospital?</h4><p>What we do is offer our spaces to psychologists, nutritionists, dentists and doctors of all specialties. We have all kinds of health professionals, which is something that does not happen in hospitals. While you also find medical surgeons in hospitals, it is difficult to find a clinical doctor and rare to find a dermatologist or even a dentist. Wellmedic's concept is to empower the health professional as an institution created for doctors with the intention of helping connect them with the best in the health market. As a platform for doctors, and main focus is rather than renting doctors an office, we provide them with all the tools a health professional needs to exponentially grow. That is why we are disruptive in this industry. The doctor is a professional who, unlike the rest of us, has to spend more time than average for his professional preparation and never really finishes studying. A general practitioner finishes his training and has to invest another 5 or 10 years to study a specialty. Our focus on helping them become entrepreneurs and health entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What kind of investment model do you use to open centers in such a short time?</h4><p>When I created the Wellmedic Health Centers brand, I knew it was a model that would grow in scale. These infrastructure units called Health Centers are buildings that are becoming the home of high-specialty doctors. We intend to have one center in each state of the country, which calls for at least 32, though states like Mexico City, Nuevo León, or Jalisco justify opening more than one. This means at least 35 in the country. In terms of health, Mexico has the penultimate place of the 35 countries that belong to the OECD. In infrastructure, we have the equivalent of 1.5 hospital beds for every 10,000 inhabitants. While in the leading countries of the OECD, they have between 18-20 beds. That is the gap we have to cover. Infrastructure coverage is a very important issue. There need to be more buildings for healthcare.</p><h4>How many centers do you plan to open in 2020?</h4><p>The Wellmedic Connect model gathers general practitioners. The high-end infrastructure aims to offer the doctor a decent workspace and give the patient a suitable environment, a format intended for first contact medicine. In five years, we want to have at least 500 centers, not only with pharmaceutical groups. This is actually a model we intend to have in high traffic areas and housing complexes and will replicate. They will be close to pharmaceutical points so the medicine can be obtained conveniently. These units may also be in a supermarket because supermarkets also sell medications, superfoods, and other things the doctor recommends.</p><h4>How much capital will the construction of 500 centers require?</h4><p>We will need USD15 million to build 500 centers. The Wellmedic model is a real estate fractional investment model to which invite patrimonial partners. Several individual investment partners become owners of a piece of property, and Wellmedic as a brand becomes the long-term tenant for these equity investors. This investment partner becomes our lessor, and Wellmedic acquires a simultaneous commitment where he sells a property or real estate that is growing in surplus value. We usually buy the land and develop it. We are a health and real estate company. Now we are in Playa del Carmen. Wellmedic has three formats in infrastructure: health centers are the second level, while the first is Wellmedic Connect, which are small units of 50-100sqm. The health centers have around 100sqm. The third consists of clusters, which are macro real estate projects. As we are doing now in Playa del Carmen, we are building 15,000sqm. It will be our first medical building with operating rooms, a hotel for patients, a shopping plaza, and health market with pharmacies, laboratories, a gym, and spa. These projects are being done with this equity investment model.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Morocco: 50% Renewables by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[driss-el-rhazi-ceo-sogea-maroc]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been part of some of the most important infrastructural projects in the country such as the Renault plant in Tangier, and Tangier and Kenitra's high-speed railway stations. How did your operations start in Morocco and how have your processes evolved since then?</h4><p>Since its creation in 1931, SOGEA MAROC has contributed to the economic development of Morocco through the construction of several infrastructure projects. With almost a century-old history, our company has not only been able to enforce its position as a leader in its core business of hydraulics but has also diversified and extended its expertise in the fields of industrial civil engineering, structures, and building construction. After starting the business by manufacturing and laying pre-stressed concrete pipes for water supply, we extended the hydraulic business in 1988 to water and wastewater treatment plants. Today, we have about 40 stations built across all Moroccan cities. In 1997, our development grew through engineering structures with major projects for various Moroccan contractors, such as Autoroute du Maroc, the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, Bouregreg Valley Renewal Agency, and the Moroccan National Railways Office. Since 2001, we have continued with industrial civil engineering, realizing 90% of Morocco's cement plants and OCP Group's industrial projects.<br>In 2009, we extended our offers to the building construction field. We have managed operations such as the Renault plant in Tangier, the high-speed railway stations of Tangier and Kenitra, and the renovation of the historical building of Société Générale Maroc in Casablanca. Now, we continue our construction development line with large projects, such as the Palais Tazi Hotel in Tangier, the Royal Mansour in Casablanca, the Mohammed VI University of Benguerir, and Le Carrousel in Rabat. This multi-business strategy has enabled us to achieve an average growth of 10% per year over the last five years, to reach a turnover of approximately MAD1 billion (USD102.7 million) with more than 2,100 employees.</p><h4>The construction sector has suffered a considerable slowdown since 2010; what is your opinion on the sector itself and how has this impacted your operations and revenue stream?</h4><p>For about five years, the business climate in our sector has been tense, with an imbalance between supply and demand and the systematic awarding of bids to the lowest price. The global context of the sector and its tough competition have been an opportunity for SOGEA MAROC to showcase its know-how and expertise. Innovation is a fundamental axis on which SOGEA MAROC relies to maintain its position in the market. Our employees represent another competitive advantage. The mixing of cultures and professions has always been a source of pride for our company. That is why we are committed to supporting our employees and helping them to develop their skills throughout their professional career. Synergy with VINCI Group subsidiaries is also a major asset that allows us to differentiate ourselves by offering global and innovative solutions. Despite this tense environment, our strategy and organization have enabled us to achieve our objectives by continuing to perform and maintain our profitability.</p><h4>Morocco is making huge efforts to become a more sustainable country, with the goal of supplying 50% of its energy with renewables by 2030; What are SOGEA MAROC's efforts in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>Our vision of success has always been global and not limited to financial results. Our objective is to design and build structures for Morocco and Africa that are respectful of people and the planet. Because our projects are in the public interest, we have always favored involving all stakeholders —including partners, customers, suppliers, elected officials, local residents and civil society— in our projects as early as possible. Our objective is to ensure total transparency in our own practices and in those of our subcontractors. For SOGEA MAROC, civic engagement is a core value, as the development of our country is everyone's responsibility. We are committed to civic action at all levels, and our engagement was awarded by the CSR label of the Confédération Générale des Entreprises Du Maroc (CGEM). Our environmental policy is based on adopting eco-responsible behavior through the implementation of environmental analysis for each site in order to better control our environmental impact. We have implemented actions to improve our environmental footprint by calculating our carbon footprint, monitoring our consumption, increasing waste-sorting and recovery on construction sites, and managing hazardous waste in compliance with Moroccan regulations. Our objective is to reduce our carbon footprint by 15% by 2022.</p><h4>What is in store for SOGEA MAROC in 2020? </h4><p>Our objective is not only to continue our growth in all our businesses in Morocco but also to support our group and Moroccan investors in Africa, particularly through construction and hydraulic business on water treatment plants. In line with the Vinci Group, our strategy is oriented toward "global performance." We aim to develop several strategic levers focused on several points. We will promote our values and deepen them in our employees, while strengthening our robustness by improving our management from project design to execution. Operational excellence is another pillar of our strategy. We aim to be ahead of the new technologies such as BIM. Strengthening our position as a leader requires us to accelerate our development by seizing new opportunities where we can provide strong added value. Our expertise particularly in the construction of water treatment plants and in building construction can support our group in its future projects in Africa. We are looking at the future with great optimism. The evolution of the sector at the national and continental level are positives. Today, SOGEA MAROC is part of the dynamic of development of our country with a desire to support it in the major structural projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of Valeura's operations in the Thrace Basin, and how the basin's distinct geology impacts exploration?</h4><p>There has been oil and gas production from the Thrace Basin for a number of decades now. It has been heavily explored and developed, so there is a long history there. Valeura came in with a partnership with Transatlantic when we purchased Thrace Basin Natural Gas in 2011. At the time, we recognized that the reservoirs there were quite tight with low permeability, and we thought that by drilling horizontal wells and stimulating them we could increase production in the existing fields. For the first three or four years, there was a lot of activity to work our way toward gas production in the area. While we were doing drilling and research on these reservoirs, we found the potential for a deep unconventional gas play. In 2017, we brought in Statoil, which is now known as Equinor, as a partner to help the company fund and explore for that deeper unconventional gas play. Once we drilled the discovery well, Yamalik-1, in 2017 we then brought in our reserves auditor DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton, which conducted an evaluation and came up with a prospective resource estimate ranging between 3 and 20 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. It really speaks to a potential world-class gas opportunity, though we still have work to prove this and demonstrate that we can flow this gas commercially.</p><h4>Beyond funding, what role does Equinor play in the operations at Trace Basin?</h4><p>It is a funding partnership, though Equinor also puts in a great deal of technical work. We recognized the potential for this play but also understood that we needed large amounts of capital to drill these deep wells and stimulate and test them, which is when we looked to bring in a partner. There were several companies who put offers on the table, but Equinor was the best at the time. Once it has fully earned its interest, Equinor has the right to request Valeura to transfer the operatorship of the deep unconventional play to it. If it does so, Valeura will retain a working relationship with approximately a 50-50 split with Equinor and maintain operatorship of all the shallower sections and production facilities, while Equinor would have operatorship of the wells that are drilling deep into the unconventional play.</p><h4>What pricing risks do you face here due to the volatility of the Turkish lira?</h4><p>Pricing is extremely important. Currently, the prices are set by BOTAÅž and are in lira. For foreign investors in different sectors this might create uncertainty given the volatility around the lira, but when converted to dollars, the BOTAÅž price has historically closely tracked the euro gas price in the region. One positive step in 2018 was a new monthly review and update of the price by the government. We have been pleased with the new Minister of Energy and Mining and how he has communicated with the entire oil and gas industry. He sat down and listened to the issues the industry is facing and the list of things we need to support it.</p><h4>Does Valeura have plans to export?</h4><p>If we look at upscaling this project and its potential to be extremely large, exporting is an option. Having a pipeline like TANAP that will run into Europe creates that opportunity. However, we tend to run all our economic and development scenarios assuming the gas is going into the Turkish market, which is a captive market with great fiscal terms where 98% of gas is currently imported.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reasons behind Turkcell's success over the past year?</h4><p>2018 was a remarkable year for Turkcell, during which we exceeded all the targets we had set for ourselves and communicated to the market. These results are not just about one year, but are the result of the combination of hard work over the last four years and of our journey from being a traditional network-oriented telco to a telco that is experience oriented — what we call a digital operator. A traditional telco-customer relationship is around 32 minutes a day. If we look at the trillions of dollars generated by the digital economy in the last 10 years, very little of that trickled down to telcos, which is a missed opportunity. That is why four years ago, we made a bold move in our strategy and said we will not be satisfied with the 32-minute relationship and want to take that to all 1,440 minutes in a day. To do that, we had to focus on the things that customers loved consuming—music, TV, instant messaging, search engines, and all types of magazines and newspapers. As we built our capabilities on those digital services, our relationship with customers expanded and got deeper, and this allowed us to create more value. All those efforts to date translated to Turkcell being the fastest-growing telco in the world. In 2018, we grew 20.8% and reached TL 21.3 billion, while the 24-month growth rate was 49%. What we see is not only a high-performing telco but one that has adapted a new business model. Our vision in Turkcell is simple and is represented by two letters: DO or “digital operator." Our strategy is also simple and is represented by the number of minutes in a day: 1440. DO 1440 will be something that customers will hear more from us, as we explain how we created this high-performing operation.</p><h4>How has today's globalized economy shaped the way Turkcell invests internationally?</h4><p>Today's global dynamics do not necessitate a telco growing globally by acquiring or starting other telcos internationally. Belarus, Cyprus, and Ukraine are examples of Turkcell's old strategy. They are all investments that we made in the past that we are pleased with, though in the future our global growth story will come not from owning telco assets outside of Turkey but digital services. BiP, our communications application, has been downloaded in more than 190 countries and is growing quickly. Our products and everything we do is done at world-class standards, which is why many people outside of Turkey where we have no operations also choose us. We have close to 10,000 BIP customers in Oman, close to 150,000 in the UAE, 250,000 in Saudi Arabia, and 110,000 in Morocco. We do not have telcos there though we have customers, and we provide a service to those people. This expansion model requires us to work in partnership with other telcos. Our business model is completely different from the OTT players around the world; data—the most important natural asset in every country—has to be processed locally and turned into services locally. The telcos in every country have a responsibility do to that. That is why we develop partnerships with telcos in other countries to convert them into digital operators and is the reason why we intend to build an international franchise not to be just one company that provides services from Turkey to everywhere, but to offer the technology know-how to be operated in the countries creating jobs, tax dollars, and investment locally in every country that we partner with.</p><h4>How do your international operations act as a hedge against volatility in your Turkish operations?</h4><p>We do not rely just on our international operations as a means of hedging our risks in Turkey; we have a complete business hedging strategy. For every infrastructure investment we make, the average payback time is around four to five years. We also make sure we match our loans with the same maturity, which allows us to be less exposed to liquidity risk, a problem for Turkey. We continuously hedge against maturity risks, foreign currency risks, and interest rate risks and have created a company whose growth plans are always fully funded.</p><h4>From an investment and technology standpoint, how important is your partnership with Huawei?</h4><p>Huawei is one of our infrastructure technology providers. We work around 50% with Ericsson and 50% with Huawei in Turkey in terms of deploying our mobile infrastructure and fixed infrastructure. Based on our experience with Huawei, it has been a trustworthy and reliable business partner and has helped us significantly during the four years of Turkcell's transformation. We are aware of the warnings surrounding Huawei; however, on the other side, we are responsible for securing our networks, and we have the ability to ensure that our networks are secure and protected. We have a responsibility to keep our networks secure, and Huawei has been a reliable and resilient business partner.</p><h4>What responsibilities do telcos have as network technologies continue to expand?</h4><p>We should stop defining network technologies as simply 5G or any generation of network, because these are not the right terms for what we should expect in the future. We are coming to a world of democratization of information and AI, which has created not only a digital economy but also all sorts of ills for society. In Turkey, we have a saying that bad news travels fast, and in the digital age it is exactly the same; misinformation and other ways to manipulate the way people think travel quickly. As we move in this direction, we also need to prepare for the era of AI, where digital operators like Turkcell will have a major role in making sure that a country's infrastructure is ready. Every industry will experience a different impact from AI. Many people ask, what is today's killer app? The killer app depends on what one looks for, though to start with it is AI, because AI will come with completely different ways of doing business.</p><h4>To what extent should Turkish companies collaborate to improve the country's telecommunications experience?</h4><p>Turkey has a deficiency in terms of fiber infrastructure—the country has 10% of the infrastructure it needs and a limited number of home passes. Today, Turkcell has about 5 million home passes, Vodafone has around 1 million, and Turksat has another 4-5 million. To optimize our resources, we decided to have access to each other's home passes in order to bundle our services and increase value. However, with everything pooled together, we perhaps reach around 5.5 million home passes, and Turkey needs 20. It is a great step in the right direction; however, in addition to sharing existing infrastructure, we should open the doors to jointly investing in new infrastructure, which would benefit the country. None of the companies in the telecoms space are wealthy enough or in a position to alone make the major investments we need. Companies need to be allowed to combine their resources on certain infrastructure investments of national interest.</p><h4>What plans are in place for the next 12 months, and what are your objectives to maintain the growth seen in 2018?</h4><p>There are two kinds of information: headlines and trend lines. As investors, we need to look to trend lines in order to block out some of the panicky nature of news that pops up as headlines. The trend lines say Turkey is a young, growing economy that has proven its resilience time and again despite different challenges. Our domestic market is extremely strong, and we will continue to invest in digital infrastructure and digital services. However, what makes me extremely excited about in the coming years is exporting the digital know-how we have created. We are excited about our DO 1440 strategy and expanding what we export to other telcos that have been late to the game or are not blessed with the type of resources we have. Customers will be seeing many announcements from us in different parts of the world, Turkcell partnering with other telcos, and exporting BiP, Fizy, TV+, Yaani, and Lifebox. We will help them transform themselves into digital operators and will take this industry back on a growth track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What infrastructure investments have facilitated Türk Telekom's broadband and mobile success?</h4><p>In 2018, with an increase of 27% in comparison to the previous year, we actualized TL4.1 billion worth of investments. Of these investments, 68% was allocated to fiber and other fixed network developing structures and the remaining went towards the mobile infrastructure. We delivered our fiber services to a total of 18.6 million households and workplaces. In 2018 alone, we raised the internet penetration within our country to 55% by increasing fiber home pass by 2.4 million and we aim to continue and increase that momentum. With the arrival of more advanced and developed technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and smart cities that are gaining popularity with the fast approaching arrival of 5G, the way we as operators deliver services to our subscribers must also be advanced and developed. The high cost and construction of necessary infrastructure that next generation communication technologies such as 5G require for fast data transfer is the largest obstacle facing operators. The most effective solution for this situation lies in inter-sector collaborations and models that will be developed in the construction and utilisation of the fixed and mobile infrastructure.</p><h4>How will 5G factor into your mobile growth strategy over the next several years?</h4><p>During the development stage of 5G and once it has been put into practice, this technology will create a global platform encompassing the next generation and digital society. Instead of remaining on a single step of the value chain, operators will spread to each and every step with 5G and will be given the option to widen their range of services and grow; they will become network developers, service providers and even OTT creators which will in turn generate an extra revenue flow. As Türk Telekom, in order to contribute to this development, we are preparing our industry for advanced technologies by providing digital transformation and consulting services to industrial corporations in Turkey with our solution partners. However, in order for the 5G networks to be able to deliver the speeds it promises, all its cells must be connected to a fiber backbone. As Türk Telekom, with our 282 thousand kilometres of fiber network infrastructure, which covers the country end to end, we have already created Turkey's 5G communication backbone. Additionally, due to the 5G network's different architecture, operators must adopt collaborations and sharing models in infrastructure if they want to meet the high data speed and capacity 5G provides and increase return by decreasing capital expenditure. As Türk Telekom, the fixed and mobile infrastructure sharing models we developed in line with sector and country benefits will not only provide operators and our country with a significant profit in the long term, but at the same time will become successful exemplary models for many regions around the world that want to transition over to 5G. With our 282,000km fiber infrastructure, we as Türk Telekom have already reached a fiber household access of 18.6 million and have fiberized approximately 80% of our country. What we need now isn't to take fiber to households, much more than that, we need to ensure more people use the internet; basically, we need to increase the internet penetration.</p><h4>How does Türk Telekom work with its subsidiary Argela in developing 5G capabilities?</h4><p>In order to actualize Turkey's goal of becoming one of the first countries to transition over to 5G, our works in 5G technologies and infrastructures are continuing at full speed through Argela, our subsidiary that generates value in information technologies. At our R&amp;D centers such as Türk Telekom Innovation Centre and Argela 5G Centre of Excellence, we develop local products and technologies that create added value for the national economy and accelerate national development as well as maintain our leadership for Turkey to reach a position where it not only produces but also exports new technologies. With the network slicing smart software ProgRAN, which was developed by Argela and its Silicon Valley affiliate Netsia, we have raised our productivity to the highest level through our use of artificial intelligence in the optimisation of fixed and mobile networks. Most importantly, we have reached a position where we are now exporting patented 5G products to leading global operators such as Telefonica, Verizon, and Orange and thus are furthering our contribution towards the national economy. Through Argela and Netsia, we have obtained 6 new patents in 5G on an international scale in 2018. Hence, we have proudly raised our 5G patents to 17 and our total patents to 26 by the end of the year.</p><h4>Within the health, education, and energy sectors what investments have been made through Türk Telekom's venture capital initiative?</h4><p>We support the entrepreneurial ecosystem in order for Turkey to become stronger and more economically independent. As Türk Telekom, we define this support as being able to present value-added services to our customers through collaborations with innovative technological start-ups and being able to create economic benefits for our country and sector by accelerating these start-ups. In this context, we set up the sector's first corporate venture capital company; TT VENTURES in early 2018 in order to support growing start-ups. Our first investment was in the healthcare sector to Doctor Turkey; an innovative service that provides online health consultant services. TT VENTURES' second investment was in education and one of our previous initiative accelerating programme PILOT's graduates actualised MentalUP; Turkey's first gamified education platform for children that develops their thinking and learning skills. We are also investing in the energy sector through our collaborations with Turkey's leading energy companies. As a company that prides itself on the importance it places on customer satisfaction, one of our aims is to make the lives of consumers easier by combining electricity services with internet and voice services at a single point of contact. Moreover, one of the results of our investments and work across the vast area of smart cities and IoT are significant savings in the energy area. With the smart solutions we brought to areas such as electricity, lighting, recycling, fuel and irrigation, we generate a large amount of savings for our country and government; up to TL3 billion each year. We will continue to invest in smart cities and solutions that contribute towards Turkey's digital transformation and bring significant savings to our local councils, government, the citizens of Turkey and for Turkey itself.</p><h4>What investments has Türk Telekom made in cyber security?</h4><p>As Türk Telekom, we had an aim of becoming the region's data center base and ensuring the safety of our customers, the people of Turkey and the entire country. With the Cyber Security Centre that we opened, which is the country's largest, we have successfully increased the diversity of traditional and innovative cyber security services we provide and have become Turkey's largest cyber-security operator. Ensuring that Turkey's data remains in Turkey and is stored at the highest security is one of our most valued responsibilities we have taken upon ourselves. In addition to providing cyber-security to all 500 of Turkey's largest companies as well as many private and public institutions, we are systematically preparing them for the future with our corporate products, services and digital solutions during their digitalization process. By equipping these companies with the correct moves we are ensuring their adaptation to Industry 4.0.</p><h4>How will Türk Telekom be impacted by its corporate structure change, involving a majority takeover by a SPV owned by Akbank, Garanti Bankası, and İşbank?</h4><p>The majority takeover of the company by an SPV owned by said banks has eliminated uncertainties pertaining to the partnership structure and has ensured Türk Telekom maintains its activities and investments more strongly, take the necessary steps towards the future and continue its successful operations and service delivery.</p><h4>What are Türk Telekom's most exciting plans and primary objectives over the next 12 months?</h4><p>In order for Turkey to actualize the development leap it is aiming for and be able to take its place amongst the top ten global economies, digitalisation and thus the proliferation of internet usage is of vital importance to our country. Therefore, our main priority for 2019 will once again be to increase the internet penetration. On the fixed internet side, we are aiming to ensure the 5G-ready infrastructure in mobile along with fiber investments. We will increase our project-based collaborations on subjects regarded as concrete indicators of digitalisation such as internet of things, smart cities, and smart health campuses, and we will proliferate our works in these next generation areas across the country. In addition, we will continue to grow our Digital Products and Services, for both the consumer market and the 'new enterprise,' through digital transformation services we provide through our three main subsidiaries Innova, Argela, and Sebit. I am particularly excited about our digital keyboard, TAMBU, which we as Türk Telekom believe will become an important new platform in the upcoming period. With our digital solutions such as our self-service point of contact we have with our customers, ONLINE SERVICES; our loyalty program where we offer awards to our customers, SİL SÜPÜR; our application that allows customers to solve their internet connectivity problems on their own, PRACTICAL SOLUTION; ELEQ, our live mobile gameshow program that presents a brand new gaming experience, Turkey's favorite digital music platform MUUD, Turkey's technologic and rich content OTT TV platform TIVIBU GO, the country's leading digital gaming platform PLAYSTORE, Turkey's rich content digital magazine and newspaper reading platform E-MAGAZINE and EYESENSE, Turkey's first photography application for the blind are providing users novel experiences. It goes without saying that we will continue to develop while we grow and connect Turkey to the future in the period ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives in Turkey has ICBC Turkey funded, and looking forward, what are the bank's goals in Turkey in relation to Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects?</h4><p>BRI upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. To build the “Belt and Road," ICBC Turkey provided funds to key projects and companies especially in port management such as Kumport (shares are held by Chinese companies), Arkas, and Ceynak. Our bank also provided funds to Turkish Airlines for its operations at the new Istanbul Airport. Moreover, China has become Turkey's third-largest trade partner and second-largest importing country. Turkey is an important market for foreign investments of Chinese public contracting companies. According to the long-term commercial target between the two countries, total trade volume is targeted to exceed USD100 billion in 2020. The integration of the systemic infrastructure between China and Turkey will accelerate trade. The use of cash management products commonly used in ICBC China will also be realized in Turkey.</p><h4>Can you break down the bank's lending strategy by sector?</h4><p>As of 3Q2019, ICBC Turkey has TRY9.3 billion cash and non-cash loans in total. Financial institutions—mainly banks but also leasing, factoring, and consumer finance institutions—have the biggest share. They are followed by the energy and real estate sectors. Outside of domestically disbursed loans, ICBC Turkey also became the arranger of about USD2.3 billion in loans from other ICBC subsidiaries to Turkish financial institutions and corporates operating in different sectors such as real estate, construction, aviation, and port management. Moving forward, ICBC Turkey will continue to contribute the development of the Turkish economy by supporting long-term domestic investments through project finance. ICBC Turkey's main strategy is to provide a wide range of services mainly in energy, infrastructure and transportation, real estate, public-private partnership projects, and acquisition financing in order to contribute to the Turkish economy whilst becoming the premier business partner for our customers.</p><h4>Why is ICBC Turkey's NPL ratio—around 1.5%—considerably lower than the sector average, and how will this benefit ICBC Turkey moving forward?</h4><p>ICBC is the largest bank in the world and has been operating in Turkey since May 2015 under the name of ICBC Turkey Bank A.Åž. Since its entry to the market, a prudent approach to lending and achieving high asset quality has been ICBC Turkey's priority. In newly established loans, this approach has been instrumental in decision-making. Our teams constantly provide analysis on a macro, sector, and company level. This detailed approach enables us to channel funding into projects and companies that will create the highest value addition.</p><h4>Over the next 12 months, what are ICBC Turkey's most important strategic plans?</h4><p>Under BRI, China is committed to promoting open, inclusive, pragmatic, and effective cooperation in third-party markets, so as to help Chinese and foreign enterprises utilize their complementary strengths and achieve a “1+1+1&gt;3" all-win results in which the benefits of three-party cooperation are greater than what the parties can produce separately. Based on consolidating the Turkish market, we will also focus on other credit areas such as Greece, Israel, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Macedonia, focusing on the BRI project, local major financial institutions clients, and Chinese and Turkish companies operating locally. We welcome other Turkish enterprises to develop those markets jointly with us. On the financial side, our bank will employ the following development plan: steady development and continuous improvement of assets, continuous enhancement of profitability and profit structure optimization, and continue to improve asset quality and increase the risk resilience.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are CFA Society's main mandate and programs in the Kingdom?</h4><p>CFA Society Saudi Arabia is a nonprofit organization, and we aim to promote the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence in the investment industry. We also work on building an active community of investment professionals through engaging the intellect and insights of our shared membership to achieve our mission. To do this, we start by providing our member base access to continued professional learning opportunities through workshops and seminars, networking events and conferences. As well as to access up to date industry research and informative reports. In addition, we work closely with the support of regulators to bridge the gap between objectives and implantation.</p><h4>How does CFA contribute to the development of the young talent that is rising in the sector today?</h4><p>The demand of local talent is casting light on the Importance of professional education and certificates that give practical knowledge and needed skills to the job market that go beyond formal higher education. What differentiates these certifications from university degrees, is that candidates' interest is usually ignited by practical experience rather than theorizing only. We support candidates in Saudi with access to discounted study martials, study groups and mentorship programs. One of our flagship programs is The CFA Institute Research Challenge, which is an annual global competition that provides university students with hands-on mentoring and intensive training in financial analysis and professional ethics. Participating students are tested on their analytic, valuation, report writing, and presentation skills. They gain real-world experience as they assume the role of a research analyst. Local competitions are hosted by CFA Society Saudi Arabia. The winning university team from the local competition advances to middle east regional competitions then advance to the Global Final, where one team emerges as the global champion.</p><h4>What will be the key factors in driving Saudi Arabia towards sustainable economic growth, lower unemployment rates, and fiscal sustainability in the short term?</h4><p>I would say that theollaboration of stakeholders is key to the development of any ecosystem. Great initiatives and efforts are being deployed in the mission of developing the Financial sector in Saudi Arabia as part of the main pillars of Vision 2030. It is paramount that different stakeholders are communicating to avoid duplication of efforts. We are not reinventing the wheel; we are simply enhancing its efficiency. This leads to accelerated progress and innovation.</p><h4>What will be the major trends driving the evolution of the Kingdom's fiscal sector in the medium term?</h4><p>In today's dynamic and ever-changing economic climate, innovation is less of a choice and more of business imperative. Similar to entrepreneurship, innovation requires a context of engagement and interconnection between people, stakeholders, and ecosystems in order to flourish — in other words an innovation ecosystem. A life example of this would be the agreement between CFA Society Saudi Arabia and TAQEEM, which grants CFA Charterholders a waiver for the TAQEEM examinations.</p><h4>What are CFA Society's next strategic steps for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a stakeholder of the investment industry, while being a nonprofit gives us a unique vantage point and position us to achieve our vision of an elevated financial industry. We look forward to continuing our efforts with the support of all industry stakeholders from regulators, employers and universities to actively contribute to the ultimate benefit of society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Upon completion in late 2018, SOCAR's STAR Refinery—Turkey's single largest FDI—underwent a testing phase and has now reached full development. What did the testing phase involve, and what are the refinery's production targets for 2019?</h4><p>The STAR Refinery is one of the newest names in the refining industry. We held the opening ceremony in October 2018, which was followed by a period of pre-commissioning and commissioning activities. These take six to eight months and involve clarifying conditions and looking into the typical challenges faced by large facilities during the start-up stage. During this and the performance testing period, the EPC contractor is responsible for ensuring all units are working as per the design. We are currently close to the end of testing, and the refinery will soon be fully handed over to us. The refinery is currently operating at 100% capacity and is producing all its intended products. It is designed to process 10 million tons of crude oil per annum. Until the end of 2019, we will operate at the maximum capacity and process 7.5 million tons of crude oil.</p><h4>How is the STAR Refinery reducing Turkey's energy import requirements?</h4><p>STAR Refinery will reduce Turkey's annual current account deficit by around USD1.5 billion. Petkim, SOCAR's petrochemical facility adjacent to the STAR Refinery, will receive a large share of the refinery's production, much of which was formerly supplied by imports. Besides raw materials produced for the petrochemical industry, the refinery produces a number of products that Turkey currently imports, such as diesel fuel, jet fuel, LPG, sulfur, and petroleum coke. Some 60% of the annual 24 million tons of diesel fuel consumption is currently supplied by imports, so STAR Refinery's 5 million-ton annual diesel fuel production will reduce that figure to below 40%. The refinery will also produce 300,000 tons of LPG on an annual basis, reducing the import rate of LPG in Turkey from 80% to 70%. Turkey also imports 3-3.5 million tons of petro-coke on an annual basis, and the refinery's annual production of 700,000 tons will substantially reduce those import figures as well. STAR Refinery will also annually produce 200,000 tons of sulfur—another imported product in Turkey. Finally, and notably, STAR Refinery will produce approximately 1.5 million tons of jet fuel on an annual basis, providing a substantial contribution to the ever-increasing need for jet fuel in parallel with development of the aviation industry. In recent months, SOCAR Aviation won the tender to provide 700,000 tons of jet fuel for the aircraft at Istanbul Airport on an annual basis for a period of five years. A substantial portion of the jet fuel produced at STAR Refinery will be supplied to Istanbul Airport, as well as many other airports around the country.</p><h4>What percentage of the refinery's petrochemical production will be off-taken by Petkim, and what percentage will be sold in the domestic market or exported?</h4><p>Our refinery will annually produce 1.6 million tons of naphtha, which will go toward meeting Petkim's entire naphtha demand. In addition to naphtha, Petkim will offtake approximately 200,000 tons of the refinery's 1 million-ton production capacity of reformate and xylene. The remaining 800 million tons will be exported in the short term. This will change once SOCAR's planned investment in a pure terephthalic acid facility in Aliağa is completed in 2023. Upon completion of this, the entire combination of reformate-xylene produced at STAR will be used as raw material domestically.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell me about the evolution of Alvimedica since its founding a decade ago?</h4><p>Alvimedica began as a start-up based on my father's idea to improve the quality of life. From a business standpoint, he looked at Turkey and saw that the country was importing 95% of medical devices. We acquired a small company and started to operate and manufacture catheters and balloons before moving into more sophisticated products. Around 2014, we decided that we needed to have a unique selling point, so we went out and acquired a company called CID, a spinoff of the Sorin Group in Italy, and started investing more in R&amp;D. From there, we built our second factory in Çatalca. At present, that factory produces 900,000 drug-eluting stents per year. The annual demand in Turkey is around 350,000, allowing us to export the rest. At present, we export to more than 70 countries.</p><h4>Why did Alvimedica acquire CID?</h4><p>Within CID's portfolio is a unique drug-eluting stent called Cre8. The stent has a special selling point for diabetic patients, which is growing at a very fast rate. Our latest product off of the Cre8 line is the Cre8EVO. Its good market perception paired with our low production costs and high capacity indicate it will be a success.</p><h4>What new products will you introduce in the near future?</h4><p>Our R&amp;D department is highly active. An exciting area we are entering is peripheral products. We will launch Nitides, a below-the-knee stent that works with the Sirolimus drug, by the end of 2019. We will also launch it in Europe before expanding globally. I am also excited about Cre8EVO, which is developing quickly, especially in East Asia.</p><h4>Broadly, is your export strategy to first succeed in Europe before you go global?</h4><p>Yes, we aim to succeed in our own region before expanding further. This strategy also helps from a regulatory standpoint. Regulations for drugs and medical devices across Europe are strict. There are ongoing checks, which helps us improve our standards. There are similar systems in place in the US, but the approval process there makes life hard for all foreign companies. As a normal-sized European company, we want to focus first on Europe and then on the rest of the world.</p><h4>What is Alvimedica's growth strategy?<br></h4><p>At present, our revenue is around USD50 million per year, and we expect to reach USD80 million by 2020. Our main objective is to help Turkey become a hub for the global medical device market. The government is aware of the potential and has decided to give incentives to the medical devices industry. So far, Alvimedica is the only company that is on the list to receive incentives, which will include incentives for funding and skilled workforce, such as specialized engineers, and support for R&amp;D projects. We have already partnered with the University of Ankara to do research on the mitral valve we are producing, a project that falls under the R&amp;D incentive program. From an investment standpoint, we also hope to go forward with our IPO in two years.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges you face in the area of R&amp;D and workforce development?</h4><p>R&amp;D is not a big problem because we have been heavily investing in the area since the beginning. Finding the correct workforce has been a challenge in Turkey, which is why we are currently building a new vocational school near our factory in Çatalca to educate the workforce on biotechnology.</p><h4>What are your primary objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p>The primary goal is to launch our Nitides product. Big companies that would like to distribute it have approached us, and this will bring even better news for Alvimedica. Another objective is to continue producing Cre8 in Turkey at a different level using automation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do Medtronic's products and services help tackle the cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes?</h4><p>Medtronic is the best-positioned company to help treat chronic diseases on a global scale. Cardiac-related deaths are the leading causes of death around the world. Medtronic has an innovative portfolio of solutions to treat cardiac-related diseases, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. The smart algorithms in our devices manage a patient's condition to sustain life without suffering severe heart failure conditions. Medtronic has invested heavily in several technologies in the cardiovascular field. Our external heart pump is an example of this, as is the first lead-less pacemaker, Micra, which is implanted directly into the patient's heart via a minimal invasive technique without leads, removing the risk of misplacing or moving leads and reducing medical complications. On the surgical side, Medtronic has the most innovative portfolio of treatments for diseases ranging from obesity to cancer, colorectal, and thoracic. For diabetes, our insulin pump and continuous glucose-monitoring technologies are important tools to manage a diabetic patient's condition effectively to avoid associated medical complications from escalating. The future of this technology is artificial pancreas. In Turkey, around approximately 20% of the entire healthcare budget is spent on diabetes and related complications. Healthcare systems and governments can save money by paying for the value that we add with our technologies. Those savings can then be reinvested in other areas.</p><h4>How has Medtronic introduced connectivity to its devices?</h4><p>Technology is in our DNA; our technologies help hospitals and healthcare systems treat patients in a more efficient way with better outcomes. This in turn prevents patient complications and additional costs arising from low clinical outcomes. The company's CareLink network links its devices, enabling them to monitor remotely, gather data, and reach out to the patient for early prevention or diagnosis. We use CareLink technology for implanted cardiac devices like pacemakers and for insulin pumps, and we are adding more devices to the network to gather massive amounts of data.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges of overseeing such a large region?</h4><p>The majority of countries under my management are emerging markets. In Turkey's case, if we compare the population size and prevalence of disease with the number of surgeries performed, the ratio is low compared to developed countries. Increasing access to better healthcare is one of the main challenges in the region. At the same time, we have to keep in mind the differences between every healthcare system. In some countries, there is an advanced healthcare infrastructure. In Turkey, advanced PPP hospitals are being built, and there is universal healthcare coverage. Challenges in healthcare are too complex and require collaboration between industry, policymakers, and government bodies. The Turkish healthcare system is more mature than those of its neighbors. Other countries can learn and benefit from Turkey.</p><h4>What role is training and research playing in Medtronic's future strategy?</h4><p>Training and education are our primary means of increasing access to healthcare, helping physicians become more skilled, and consequently improving outcomes. Medtronic Innovation Center (MIC) in Istanbul, one of our seven training centers around the world, plays a critical role in training physicians. It has the capacity to train a few thousand physicians a year and hosts physicians from 35-40 countries.</p><h4>What are Medtronic's goals for 2019?</h4><p>First, through our training and education, we want to help the region treat more patients with better outcomes. Second, we would like to engage with our customers in a more meaningful way so they can better realize the value we provide with our technologies and solutions. Medtronic recently established its operations in Pakistan. In that context, we want to train Pakistani physicians and ensure the market has access to high-quality medical devices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How suitable was 2019's annual pharmaceutical price increase for Abdi İbrahim's operations?</h4><p>Pricing in the pharmaceutical industry is controlled by the government, and this control mechanism has been developing against the pharmaceutical industry since 2009. The most recent price adjustment from 46% to 47% was needed. However, if we consider that almost all our costs are related to foreign currency, this figure still does not meet our costs. In recent years, pharmaceuticals production and import costs have increased more than prices, and 2019 is no different.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are necessary to promote and advance the Turkish pharmaceutical sector?</h4><p>Without the margins necessary for investments in R&amp;D, we cannot become a regional or global player. We need resources to make these investments, and we can only create them through higher sales. However, unfortunately, the sector is unable to make the investments needed to be competitive as a result of the changes in pharmaceutical prices. Several laws and plans were introduced; however, they didn't make the sector more competitive. We work with the government on amending these laws, both as a company and as part of a union. One plan is to review the mechanisms of incentives and, if necessary, contribute through grants. Some countries have become significant players in the pharmaceutical industry over the last 10 years largely because they have invested heavily in R&amp;D. In order to become a big player, we need to move away from the regulations seen in Europe and the US and tailor regulations to Turkey's needs. Finally, the sector needs more qualified human resources, and we have experienced and sufficient human resources in the production and development of conventional chemical products. However, the same cannot be said about biotechnology or other latest technologies. There is a need for government-funded incentives, doctoral programs, and overseas collaborations to further uplift the entire industry.</p><h4>What does the opening of your biotechnology facility represent for your future direction?</h4><p>We have divided our biotechnology investments into several stages. The first stage is called fill and finish, where we acquire the active substance from abroad and complete the formulation and filling processes in Turkey. The second stage is the production of biosimilars, which are devised in other countries from the cell through technology transfer. The third stage is producing our own biosimilars and biological products, which is the most difficult for a number of reasons: it requires a great deal of investment; there is a lack of related human resources; and the biosimilars field is new. Healthcare professionals and the related public authorities around the world are still skeptical of biosimilars. At Abdi İbrahim, we have invested USD100 million in this area in order to make Turkey a major player in this field and to prepare our company for the future. This number will continue to increase because one has to continue to invest when they start to work in this field. By doing so, we are now focused more on biological products.</p><h4>Why did you choose to invest in production facilities in Algeria and Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We studied both markets in terms of their market potential, access, and ROI, among other factors. Kazakhstan and Algeria are both big countries and big markets. Moreover, both countries enable us to access more markets. From Algeria, we can access Maghreb countries, and from Kazakhstan we can access Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Russia. Another factor that works in our favor is Turkey's reputation in these countries. Both countries offer different advantages to investors.</p><h4>Which export markets are you focused on growing?</h4><p>Currently, the share of international markets in our total turnover is around 17-18%, and our goal is to increase that figure to 50%. To that end, we are working with more than 10 countries excluding Algeria and Kazakhstan, such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Bosnia, Iraq, and Gulf countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the economic slowdown impacted the banking sector?</h4><p>Due to the slowdown in the economy, the banking sector saw slow growth in 2019. Total assets annually grew by 15% in nominal terms as of June 2019 and reached TRY4.2 trillion; however, in dollar terms, total assets fell by 9%. The ratio of loans to GDP was around 64% in mid-2019, while the loan-to-deposits ratio was 57%. TRY loan stock remained almost the same compared to June 2018, while FX loan stock increased by 23%—a 3% decline in USD terms. Commercial loans grew by 11% and individual loans by 1%. Commercial loans accounted for 78% of total loans, while loans to consumers took 22% of the total. SMEs' share of total loans was 25%.</p><h4>Why has inflation fallen, and what stabilizing effects has this had on the economy?</h4><p>Inflation started to decline in 2H2019 and is expected to level off around 12% in December, below the target. A slowdown in domestic demand and a rather stable trend in lira value pulled inflation down and had a positive impact on expectations. The government is targeting 8.5% inflation in 2020 and 6% in 2021. Demand for the lira increased in 2Q2019 mainly due to the reverse currency substitution of residents. This allowed the TRY rate against a USD/EUR basket to at about 5.8 in nominal terms, a considerable appreciation of the TRY from 6.6 in April.</p><h4>How will the central bank's decision to reduce interest rates impact lending activity in the banking sector?</h4><p>Better (lower) inflationary expectations allowed the central bank to lower policy rates below 20%, and the downward trend in inflation will support the decline in interest rates. Thus, it will contribute to a fall in loan interest rates along with a fall in the funding costs of the banking sector. With the falling interest rates, the contribution of banks to the real sector and economic growth will increase.</p><h4>How well suited are banks to deal with increasing ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs)?</h4><p>NPLs before special provisions to loans ratio is around 4.4%. The ratio was around 4.5% for corporate loans and 3.8% for consumer loans. The ratio of restructured loans to total loans is close to 6%. The banking sector is well suited to deal with these NPLs, as the capital adequacy ratio is 17.8%, well above the regulatory ratio. Annual profitability ratios declined to 11.8% in mid-2019, from 13.7% at the end of 2018, due mainly to slow growth in loans, a squeezed interest margin, and higher special and general provision for loans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TCMB recently underwent a management change, most notably with your appointment as governor. Moving forward, how does the refreshed bank plan to maximize communication and enhance the effectiveness of its operations?</h4><p>The way central banks all over the world communicate has constantly evolved over the last few decades. In line with this evolution, TCMB also built strong corporate communication channels and invested a great deal of attention in this area, particularly after the amendment to its law in 2001. But there is still a lot of room for improvement. So, in the upcoming period, we will try to further these endeavors together with my colleagues. Establishing effective, transparent, and inclusive communication with the public on various platforms will strongly contribute to the effectiveness of our operations and achieve our objectives. In this context, our first steps will be to increase our corporate transparency and strengthen our monetary policy communication. A few practices may come up at the top of the agenda. First, we should share more information on the monetary policy decision-making process and the reasons underlying our decisions. This is crucial for the public to understand the arguments behind the decisions of the central bank. Second, we can fill some of the missing aspects in the process of sharing data on the bank's market operations. Moreover, sharing information of higher credibility regarding our monetary policy strategy more frequently will be beneficial. Moreover, thematic speeches that express our stance on some key monetary policy issues will be useful to clarify TCMB's overall approach to the public. In addition, we continue to work on enhancing the communication of the bank with its stakeholders. Accordingly, investors, financial institutions, and corporate sector representatives, and, above all, the financial press will continue to be our main stakeholders. Explaining the importance of price stability as well as the central bank's role to all segments of society has a significant role in achieving price stability. Moreover, the consistency of policies is also extremely important, and in this context, we will work in tandem with all parties that will provide input to the processes to enhance effectiveness of the monetary policy.</p><h4>Citing reduced inflation and data indicating a moderate recovery in economic activity, TCMB reduced its policy rate from 24% to 14%. Can you outline the specific goals of the rate cuts, as well as its potential risks?</h4><p>Economic activity, which contracted in the second half of 2018, started to recover at a modest pace in 2019. Both domestic and external demand contributed to the recovery in the first two quarters of the year. The main driver of domestic demand was private consumption, while investment demand remained weak due to tight financial conditions and elevated levels of financial volatility. On the external demand front, despite recent signs of global slowdown, competitiveness gains and market diversification led to a solid performance in exports of goods and services, while import demand remained subdued. As a result, the contribution of net exports remained positive, also with the help of buoyant tourism demand. Recent data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth, although to a lesser extent, and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and improvement in financial conditions. The current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement due to the composition of growth, is expected to maintain a moderate course. Inflation has displayed a persistent downtrend since October 2018. Tight monetary policy stance has been instrumental in controlling inflation and inflation expectations. In order to steer inflation expectations in the right direction and contain risks to pricing behavior, we have strengthened the emphasis on the role of published inflation forecasts as intermediate targets. Accordingly, we have made an explicit commitment to keep the underlying trend of inflation close to the published projections for the next three years. Accordingly, actual inflation has mostly remained close to, or even below, the lower bound of TCMB's published projections since October 2018, which has improved forecast credibility. The inflation outlook continues to improve. Over the course of the year, the relative stability of the lira and the negative output gap played a major role in disinflation, while falling import prices and food prices also contributed to the decline. We project inflation to converge to the underlying trend as the base effect fades away in the coming months. According to the October inflation report, forecast inflation will materialize around 12% by the end of 2019. The ongoing improvement in inflation dynamics and pricing behavior created room to reduce the monetary policy tightness. We delivered three rate cuts in July, September, and October, bringing the policy rate to 14% from 24%. The current monetary policy stance is largely consistent with the projected disinflation path that envisages a fall to 8.2% by the end of 2020. The easing in financial conditions supports the moderate recovery trend in economic activity by strengthening confidence and credit channels. We predict the economy will gradually return to its potential growth rate, hence the output gap will remain supportive of disinflation also in 2020. The sustained disinflation process is the key to achieve lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Monetary stance should remain cautious to keep the disinflation process on track with the targeted path. We will determine the tightness of monetary policy based on the indicators of the underlying trend of inflation to ensure the disinflation process and will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of price and financial stability.</p><h4>From both a domestic and global standpoint, what are the biggest challenges facing the Turkish economy, and what are TCMB's most effective tools to solve them?</h4><p>On the domestic front, steering the economy toward a sustainable growth path and ensuring financial stability are of key importance. This in turn depends on sustaining the disinflation process and achieving price stability. Given the persistently elevated levels of medium-term inflation expectations and associated risks regarding the pricing behavior, it is crucial to keep the disinflation process consistent with the target. This requires maintaining a tight monetary stance and enhanced policy coordination that prioritizes the decline in inflation. Anchoring inflation expectations around the projected disinflation path, and ultimately around the target of 5%, will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and reduce possible tradeoffs associated with disinflation. The re-balancing process that the economy has undergone is smoothly evolving into a healthier growth outlook over the next year. A macro-policy mix that prioritizes the decline in inflation through strong policy coordination will improve the external financing opportunities and long-term interest rates by reducing the risk premium, which will gradually strengthen domestic demand. By preserving monetary and fiscal discipline, reducing macro-financial risks and increasing predictability in the economy, economic growth will be steered toward a balanced and sustainable path over the medium term.</p><h4>Under TCMB's new leadership, what are the goals of the bank over the next 12 months?</h4><p>Our main goal is to sustain the disinflation process and bring inflation down to 8.2% by end-2020. Maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key to achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. On the back of mildly supportive global financial conditions, we expect the level of monetary tightness and the ongoing improvement in country risk premium to contribute to the stability of the exchange rate. The improvement in the current account is also expected to support the lira. As the fall in inflation becomes more apparent and exchange rate volatility is contained, inflation expectations are expected to converge to our 2020 forecast of 8.2% in 2H 2020. Our decision-making processes will continue to be data-driven. In addition to all macroeconomic indicators, primarily inflation and economic activity, we are closely monitoring micro dynamics and field data. To enhance effectiveness of the monetary policy, we are working in tandem with all parties involved. Also, we will continue to pay effort to enhance the communication of the monetary policy, which will provide major contributions to achieving our targets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the role of your institution in transitioning to eco-friendly legislation?<br></strong>Since its establishment, one of QGBC's main objectives has been working with the government to develop regulations and systems related to green buildings. We did works for ministries and governmental organizations. In 2019, we announced a new efficiency excellence evaluation system for buildings with KAHRAMAA, which started with hotels and the hospitality sector. We still have things to develop, especially with energy certification systems and materials. Starting 2018, we have been working with the Green Key certification system, which mainly targets the hospitality sector. Seven five-star hotels were awarded the Green Key certification after more than a year of work to achieve it. We are also developing the system for events and temporary venues, such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><p><strong>What is the relevance of education when it comes to promoting green habits?<br></strong>With the Green Key, we have a scheme called Eco-Schools, an international program involving more than 20 million students from around the world. The aim is to encourage and engage students to do initiatives. We are starting with 30 schools and have already awarded some the green flag. We are taking this initiative to push campuses and universities to go greener. We are also working with the Qatar Foundation to make the whole campus eco-friendlier. This mainly relates to water, energy, and waste. It is a development program within the school, so students feel loyal to it and develop the project themselves. Our target is to reach 30 schools by the end of 2019. We have trained approximately 300 teachers in the program.</p><p><strong>How can increasing the health of the buildings directly impact society?<br></strong>We also work with healthy cities, a program with the Ministry of Health, which is about healthy life practices, especially in diet and lifestyle. It also addresses how healthy our buildings are, for example, their air quality, ventilation, and lighting. Almost 80% of operational expenses for any company goes to human resources. Therefore, having a healthy building will affect the performance of employees. Better performance and production mean higher efficiency. Even controlling the air conditioning temperature and thermal comfort has an impact. To promote and raise awareness about healthy lifestyles, we launched Qatar Sustainable Week in 2016, which is not only about cleaning beaches or school competitions. Many gyms were opened for free during the week, and we had many campaigns and saw a great deal of participation from nutrition centers and food companies. It is about the people who occupy the buildings, not just the buildings themselves. We cannot succeed in this endeavor without contributions from the private sector. We developed an online directory three years ago called Qatar Green Directory that provides all the green services and products available in Qatar. And this list has grown and expanded significantly in those three years. We want this platform to connect people, consultants, and clients with the green products suppliers and manufacturers.<br>How has the blockade stimulated the ingenuity of Qataris to recycle more?<br>The blockade has in fact had a positive economic impact and created so many business opportunities for companies. The food sector has really developed over the past several years. Recycled pallets used to be imported and are now produced here, creating a new export opportunity. A plastics recycling factory has also been established, and there are new recycling centers for metal, electronic waste, paper, and wood. The government has supported this growth and assigned an area only for the recycling industry. It is good that we now have a hub for this industry. There has been a strong push in the market toward that, and we even have an annual conference to discuss these issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the status of district cooling in Qatar?<br></strong>The district cooling sector in Qatar is quite substantial: there are around 23 systems in operation producing over 660,000 tons of refrigeration (TR) at present. Several hotels, malls, medical, and educational establishments use cooling systems through their onsite plants, along with some of the larger developments like Katara and Msheireb. Aside from individual developments there are major districts in Doha equipped with district cooling, such as the Pearl Qatar and West Bay, of which Qatar Cool serves along with several of the Qatar Rail stations. An additional 42 systems are expected to be operational by 2030, adding around 879,000TR, which, combined with the existing operational cooling systems, will provide significant savings to the economy and environment. Yet while this is inspiring, it is not enough. The range and volume of industries using district cooling in Doha depicts the versatility of the system given the correct density and demand, but district cooling remains distorted, saturated, and uncorroborated. It is still perceived as a luxury service and not a necessity. If the environment is to be taken seriously, district cooling needs to be a priority. </p><p><strong>What are the roadblocks for district cooling, and what steps can the government take to overcome these?<br></strong>District cooing has saved the country around QAR2.1 billion to date, a figure that is estimated to rise to QAR15 billion by 2030, according to a study conducted by Kahramaa's District Cooing Department. Yet it still has an adverse reputation despite the considerable financial savings it generates, not to mention the environmental savings. The public cannot see the benefits of district cooling whilst there are no subsidies from the government for the provision of the service, which would be positively cascaded to end users. It is the norm to tax undesirable behaviors to disincentivize the public from over-consumption, in most cases to protect health, the environment, or the economy. District cooling is being put under the same umbrella as undesirable policies, dissuading growth and implementation by unsubsidized charges put upon the providers. But district cooling has the reverse effect on economy, health, and the environment and should be characterized as such. Conventional cooling consumes 1.5-1.8kW per TR whereas district cooling consumes 0.8kW per TR, a figure that may seem unimportant to the public, particularly because energy is subsidized in Doha. However, should the subsidies be removed from the energy prices, the same inflation would be visible, thus evening out the keel between district cooling and other utility fees. The government requires good sustainable economic conduct to grow whilst lessening the bad conduct, but district cooling remains unsubsidized in the outskirts. Should the government inject a fraction of the savings generated by district cooling back into the industry with such policies such as zoning, distribution, and mandate strategies, society and industry alike would reap the benefits. </p><p><strong>What drives your efficiency, and how are you increasing it?<br></strong>There are many influences that contribute to the efficiency of a district cooling system. One of the major factors is load diversity, which entails the distribution of cooling energy. District cooling has the exceptional advantage of distributing a consistent cooling load dependent on customer needs. Where a conventional cooling system is either on or off and the cooling energy remains stagnant and unused, a district cooling system can redistribute the unused stagnant cooling energy to another customer with higher demand during certain times of the day. This diversity of delivery allows district cooling providers to utilize the full cooling load and provides customers with uninterrupted, consistent, and efficient cooling services at any given time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is QBIC relevant to achieving the goals of QNV 2030?<br></strong>QBIC was founded by one of the main players supporting SMEs in Qatar. It is fully owned by Qatar Development Bank, and in 2019 we celebrated our fifth anniversary. Last year, we were proudly awarded “the best business incubator in the Middle East." Our mission is to develop Qatar's next QAR100-million companies. Five years ago, we embarked on a journey to instill an entrepreneurial mindset amongst locals, and we are well on our way. We used to want Qataris to start their own business and consider entrepreneurship as a viable career option instead of only preferring public-sector jobs. Now, all they talk about is starting a business and investing in something, which is evidently bolstering Qatar's private sector. Now, we need to guide them toward the field of entrepreneurship and continue to help them grow and scale. </p><p><strong>What are the main programs you offer to Qatari entrepreneurs?<br></strong>We offer numerous programs for start-ups at all stages of growth. Our main program is the Lean Start Up program, which is basically a 10-week program that leverages the “lean" methodology and emphasizes the importance of customer validation as opposed to unactionable business plans. Aspiring entrepreneurs simply apply with an idea or prototype, and over 10 weeks we transform their thinking and empower them to build an actual startup. We receive hundreds of applications for each wave, only 50 of which are carefully selected. What's more, only 20% of these complete the program because it involves extensive field work and dedication. A major component focuses on interactions with potential customers; for example, we send future entrepreneurs to shopping malls and Souq Waqif to scout and engage with potential customers and collect insights and gauge purchasing intent. With the lean methodology, they learn to adopt a trial and error approach until they get it right. Not all of them can last 10 weeks, which means we end up with the real cream of the crop (roughly 10 start-ups). Eventually, six or seven win incubation at QBIC, which earns them a grant of QAR100,000, rent-free office space, and coaching for two years, in addition to numerous exposure opportunities. Then there is the Lean Acceleration Program, which is designed for start-ups that are looking to scale and experiencing consistent growth. In 2019, we also launched the manufacturing vertical with 48 factories branded under Jahiz. Jahiz 1 is basically different sectors such as plastics, chemicals, and wood, whereas Jahiz 2 is for food and beverage. These factories cover about 3,000sqm. For smaller start-ups, QBIC's workshops range between 90sqm and 250sqm. Within the vertical we have developed a program called the Lean Manufacturing Program to assist people on how to manage their factories and production lines. I have realized that although there aren't that many factories in Qatar, the facilities operating are technologically advanced and automated. </p><p><strong>Why is Qatar the right spot to create an innovation hub?<br></strong>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is right around the corner, and it's been said more than once that if you don't bank on the opportunities now, you'll miss the boat. A long list of projects must be completed before the event so now is the time to come and do something in Qatar. At present, anything that one starts here has a bigger chance of succeeding because of the huge impact the event generates. Let's also not forget the fact that Qatar is ranked first in the region according to the Entrepreneurship Index, which speaks volumes about the local entrepreneurial infrastructure and incubators. Now is the time to start a business and invest in Qatar and Qatari start-ups because these ventures will mature by 2022, which means it will be easier to scale those investments and businesses up, where huge rewards await. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is QFBA's current scope and offering in the market with its various programs, initiatives, and activities? <br></strong>Since its establishment a decade ago, QFBA's mission has been to raise the bar for the financial services industry under Qatar National Vision 2030 and build robust human capital in the sector for a knowledge-based economy. Its scope today centers on capacity building and the continuous professional development of students and financial professionals through higher education and specialized training, as well as on the support of regulatory bodies in the design and implementation of certification systems. We currently offer over 79 open and custom programs, as well as specialized degrees, naturally focusing on the financial services sector. Building on our success in the last decade, we are looking at replicating this educational and development model across other sectors, and at expanding our scope to new areas of training and education. We have been forging a robust network of partnerships with international providers in this direction. Our ambitions are stretching far and wide, and we have only just begun. </p><p><strong>Can you describe some of QFBA's major milestones over the last year?<br></strong>2018 marked many milestones for QFBA, particularly toward its Qatarization vision, national partnership ambitions, and higher education accreditations. In July, our partnership with Northumbria University, which we signed in March 2018, culminated in the graduation of our first BA cohort in international banking and finance. Out of the total number of students admitted into the program—representing 15 nationalities—60% were Qatari nationals. Another partnership we successfully signed in 2018 is with the MoI, in collaboration with Cisco, a global leader in cybersecurity solutions. This is unchartered territory for QFBA and an exciting one at that. As the banking and finance landscape grows ever more complex and interconnected, cybersecurity awareness, education, and expertise are all the more paramount. And as our nation gears up for a cashless, fintech-powered FIFA World Cup 2022 experience, capacity building and knowledge development will be crucial to ensuring that Qatar's smart payment infrastructure for this global tournament, and far beyond it, abides by world-class safety and security standards. In line with the Qatar National Development Strategy 2018-2022, our tie-ups with ministries across Qatar bore fruit with a strategic and large-scale remit for QFBA, entailing the management and delivery of nationwide professional development initiatives. To this end, our focus has also been on high-quality Qatarization of the financial landscape.</p><p><strong>How has QFBA grown and expanded its scope of activities and programs since its inception?<br></strong>Much of our expansion and addition of new activities and business lines in the financial services sector were concentrated in 2018, particularly in professional training. In 2019, we joined hands with the Central Bank and National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Committee to launch a landmark, large-scale training program targeting all professionals in the public and private sector.  We also extended the reach and scope of our degree offering to a much larger cohort of banking and finance students and professionals. We maintained the same number of programs, but admitted more students into our finance, investment, and banking programs. This academic year, we have admitted 193 students so far. Under our ambitious expansion is also our move to new, bigger, and better facilities that can accommodate our future plans and growing student base. By 1Q2020, we will be moving our facilities from the Qatar Financial Center Tower 2 to our own dedicated building in Msheireb. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the Qatar Foundation's recent accomplishments in terms of its RDI efforts?<br></strong>The first element in developing the Qatar Foundation was to build the infrastructure. We had to create research institutes, universities, and the Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP) with all the physical elements needed for excellent research labs and facilities and the capacity to attract people. After that, we attracted world leaders and local individuals to develop cutting-edge research teams. These individuals have brought the level of research here to world-class levels in sectors such as medicine, cybersecurity, IT, energy, environment, and biomedical research. We have also been empowering women. For example, the percentage of female engineers at Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar is about 42%, which is far above the university's female ratio in the US. </p><p><strong>What is the main focus area of your R&amp;D?<br></strong>One of the areas we are looking at is personalized healthcare, or precision medicine. The concept is to develop a health service capacity where every person has the right form of individualized treatment. The first part of that is to understand the genome of every individual. Her Highness Sheikha Moza's vision is to determine the genome of every individual in the national and ultimately the wider population. By the end of 2019, we will have determined 18,000 genomes, with a further 100,000 over the next few years. As a percentage of the population, that is much higher than anywhere else in the world. We work closely with a variety of international organizations on this. Once we have this information, we are in a strong position to tailor medical treatment to the individual. In the long term, this will ensure everyone lives happier and healthier lives. This also involves capacity building in all the relevant technologies, as you also need diagnostics and treatment. Then, we can have companies that help to develop new diagnostics that are required, such as those utilizing bio-markers in the blood for the detection of certain diseases, since understanding diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and autism has global value. </p><p><strong>What is the Qatar Foundation pursuing through investment in R&amp;D?<br></strong>All the new infrastructure here is geared toward the World Cup, but what is left after that will give Qatar a world-class infrastructure that will ease the creation of new industries. Where the Qatar Foundation comes in is in the important role of mobilizing human capital. To do that, first we have to educate from the most junior level right up through secondary level and across universities. Then, we have to ensure these people attain the right qualifications and develop expertise. They could then pursue their PhDs either here or abroad and hopefully over time develop excellent research and ideas. </p><p><strong>Can you give us some numbers regarding institutions and patents already established by the Qatar Foundation?<br></strong>We have built QSTP, which covers the size of about 125 football pitches. There, we are home to about 50 companies, including world leaders like General Electric and Microsoft, along with smaller companies and a whole range of start-ups. We currently have about 1,500 researchers involved in various activities across the universities and research entities. We also have partner universities, such as Texas A&amp;M and Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), which is a home-grown university that focuses on postgraduate education and research. We hope HBKU will grow to be ranked among the top universities of the world, such as MIT. In addition, we have research institutes here, such as the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), which is considered a global leader in certain fields and works in collaboration with MIT in certain areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been PSA's main area of focus and milestones during the last year?<br></strong>Concerning the strategic planning and strategic management area, PSA has been heavily involved in the last year in measuring the progress of the implementation of projects and objectives of the Second National Development Strategy (NDS-2) 2018-2022. PSA continues to unfold different levels of national strategic alignment amongst various national stakeholders by unifying the methods used in NDS-2 and providing the necessary autonomy of ownership of national priorities and projects.</p><p><strong>What are some of the most revealing statistics that have been obtained this year?<br></strong>Aside from demographic, social, economic and environmental stats, PSA recently published Qatar's Second Report on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As per the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the report is intended to assess the progress made in achieving the 17 SDG in the state of Qatar, as well as identifying the challenges facing the state in this path. Achieving the 2030 SDGs is a responsibility of solidarity and partnership between the government, private sector, and civil society. The report reveals that the state of Qatar is progressing well toward achieving most of its sustainable development targets, especially those related to eradicating poverty and hunger, ensuring good health and education, providing affordable water, clean energy, decent working opportunities, reducing inequality, achieving justice and peace, and building sustainable, inclusive, and crime-free cities and societies. Furthermore, the report points out that Qatar is making progress in reducing the impact of climate change, reducing unsustainable production and consumption patterns, protecting ecosystems, and revitalizing global development partnerships.</p><p><strong>PSA has announced the start of the first phase of the general census. What are its main objectives?<br></strong>The main aim of the census is to create a high-quality central registry of population, housing, and business data. Some of the many uses of this will be better decision-making at all levels of government; attracting new businesses; forecasting future transportation needs for every segment of the population; planning for hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and the location of other health services; forecasting future housing needs; monitoring the implementation of the National Development Strategy; designing public safety strategies; designing facilities for people with disabilities, the elderly, and children; planning health and educational facilities for people with disabilities; planning educational facilities, including adult education, at the municipality level; planning budgets for every level of government; understanding the labor supply; locating the sites for business centers; and designed household surveys during the intercensal period.</p><p><strong>What are PSA's efforts to transition toward greater digital operations?<br></strong>Qatar has made use of the latest technologies effectively in 2010 and 2015 Census of Population, Housing, and Establishments, and more enhanced use of modern techniques in the 2020 census. A multi-modal approach to data collection that involves face-to-face interviewing and making greater use of internet, telephone, and administrative data sources was used for the 2020 census. PSA has developed an Android-based application that integrates administrative records preloaded in the device with the census data collected from the field through geographic information. The survey will be conducted using handheld devices. Based on the 2020 census, a comprehensive database for buildings, housing units, and establishments in the country will be developed and regularly updated in collaboration with the concerned government departments and ministries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Turkish Airlines is a highly valued company that strives on quality. What are your main milestones of 2019?<br></strong>Turkish Airlines currently operates 316 destinations in 126 countries. Some destinations inaugurated in 2019 include Sharjah, Bali, Rovaniemi, Marrakesh, Port Sudan, Luxor, and New Mexico. One of the most important achievements was the move of Turkish Airlines' operations to its new hub, Istanbul Airport. We also celebrated the 30th anniversary of our customer loyalty program, Miles&amp;Smiles, in Qatar. </p><p><strong>Turkish Airlines prides itself on its highly valued customer service and customer satisfaction. What are your next steps in regards to innovating customer service?</strong><br>Passengers' requirements have evolved throughout the years, but their satisfaction and comfort have been at the heart of our operations since 1933. With the world moving digital, and customers' demand for facilitation at every step, our mobile app enables passengers to manage all their trip requirements in a safe, secure, and timely manner. The application is user-friendly and tailored to our passenger's preference based on search engine history; additionally, it enables passengers to access their Miles&amp;Smiles and redeem privileges. Another critical solution we have implemented is extended RFID baggage tracking, which informs customers when their baggage is dropped on the carousel. It was introduced to allow passengers to enjoy other airport facilities, such as duty-free shops and cafes, instead of waiting at baggage claim.<br>What are Turkish Airlines' main areas of focus?<br>Innovation is key to increasing standards. We are actively conducting over 500 R&amp;D studies in our information technology center. In terms of flight network, Turkish Airlines has been expanding its network by launching flights to new destinations in Japan and China, as well as the US. Moreover, Turkish Airlines has been developing its fleet. It received six B-787 jets in 2019, and five A350 jets will be delivered in 2020. For the summer season, we will upgrade our first flight from Doha to A330 and will operate a second flight with our new A321 NEO.</p><p><strong>How is Turkish Airlines working to attract a bigger share of passengers to visit Qatar?<br></strong>Qatar and Turkey enjoy unique bilateral relations, which has helped Turkish companies and entrepreneurs to choose Qatar as their go-to destination for business. Qatar National Vision 2030 is a strategic vision, with one of its focuses on the tourism sector. The country has a rich calendar full of business, networking, and festive events. Additionally, Qatar's international presence has played a vital role in promoting the country as a destination for business and investments. Within this framework, our wide network throughout the world and high-end services offered all through the journey is an asset for promoting the country as a destination. The number of visitors to Qatar is rising year by year, and Turkish Airlines operations have played a role in this. </p><p><strong>How would you assess the health of the aviation sector in Qatar, and what are your expectations for the sector in the next coming years?</strong><br>The aviation and transport sector in Qatar has had great development and growth over the past couple of years, under the direction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The competition is relatively high in this market; thus, our hospitality, connectivity, and high-end services has allowed us to achieve customer satisfaction. The market looks prominent in the years to come, with major international forums and events queued up.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the upcoming year?<br></strong>Turkish Airlines aims to continue growing, not only in terms of number of destinations, but also in frequencies and connectivity. Our 2023 targets are 120 million passengers and 500 aircraft in the fleet. We will also continue to grow in cargo. The new airport will allow us to move 2 million tons by 2023, as one of our strategic goals is to be one of top five air cargo companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What market opportunity did you identify in Qatar that favored the launching of Buono?<br></strong>The idea comes from a strong Qatari-European ownership. We saw an opportunity in the market for high-quality chocolate products, sweets, flowers, and designer items, with a European-inspired flair and presentation and a competitive price point. We put as much effort into our chocolate as we do into its design. We started in 2010 with chocolate and flowers, and have been in the market for nine years. We have four operating branches and a fifth opening in 2019. </p><p><strong>How has the retail landscape been evolving, and where do you forecast the industry going in the future?<br></strong>When we opened the business, there was not much competition in the market and spending power was high. The country's continued development created a huge advantage in the retail sector. Now, the market has evolved. Consumers have become savvier in their expenses, looking for value and becoming more demanding in terms of quality. There are around 20 malls, and those malls need to be full, so there is much more competition. People are now significantly more realistic about their expectations and standards of living. For the consumer, it is positive. When I first came, people complained there was only one supermarket chain. We have to embrace new ideas, technologies, and ways to increase revenue.</p><p><strong>Did you see a shift of preference toward Qatari products after the blockade?<br></strong>People now choose to support local companies. Malls are increasing spaces for local brands and companies. This has been a huge advantage for us. Now, it is all about the local market and specifically hotels. We specifically changed our brand from Buono to Buono Qatar for this reason; hotels like to feature our name so guests can see where the chocolate company comes from. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>DHFC is Qatar's one and only world-class destination for entertainment,  shopping, and dining. Where did the idea for DHFC come from?</strong><br>DHFC opened its doors on April 2017. The owner of the mall is Bawabat Al-Shamal Real Estate Company W.L.L. (BASREC), with four shareholders. We now have over 425 shops in operation, 100-plus F&amp;B businesses, and 100 kiosks. DHFC welcomes almost 50,000 visitors per day on average. In terms of gross leasable area, we are the biggest shopping mall in Doha, at 265,000sqm.</p><p><strong>What entertainment offerings best match Qatari preferences?<br></strong>DHFC provides the biggest entertainment offering in Qatar, with indoor and outdoor attractions. This includes Angry Birds World indoor and outdoor parks, Virtuocity, and Snow Dunes. Angry Birds World features over 20 unique rides and suitable for all family members, a large array of F&amp;B outlets, retail shops, and edutainment activities. Virtuocity is dedicated digital gaming hub that merges the virtual world with the real world. Equipped with full motion racing simulators, escape rooms, and a multipurpose eSports arena, the park offers an immersive digital experience for teens and adults. Snow Dunes is Qatar's first indoor snow park featuring a fantastical Arabian-style castle set in the distant past. The park utilizes the world's most advanced snow-production technology to create snow that is identical to the one in nature at minus 4 degrees Celsius. Defying logic and guaranteeing delight, the park encompasses a variety of rides and attractions suitable for the whole family such as super fun slides, slopes, and carousel. The park features various F&amp;B outlets, retail stores, and party rooms that will deliver an exclusive fun and exciting experience for the entire family. Our mall also has Qatar's first VOX 4DX cinema complex with 18 digital screens, Theatre by Rhodes, and green spaces for outdoor exercise and an outdoor leisure trail cycling.</p><p><strong>How do you see the evolution of the local retail market?<br></strong>DHFC works closely with Qatari business owners to diversify the local retailers. We also reach out to top Kuwaiti and Turkish brands to ensure we are catering to all demographics.</p><p><strong>In term of entertainment options, how did DHFC decide to start with Angry Birds, and how is DHFC's entertainment offering evolving?</strong><br>During the conceptualization phase, we wanted to create an entertainment destination like no other—something unique and inspired by the local culture. Rather than outsourcing something from outside, we teamed up with Qatari company Leisure, which manages and operates the entire entertainment side of the business. Leisure conducted market studies and analysis to determine what best to introduce to the market. And this was how Angry Birds, Virtuocity, and Snow Dunes came to life. Now there is a new component under consideration that we will hopefully decide on by the end of 2019.</p><p><strong>What opportunities will FIFA World Cup 2022 and local demographics bring to the country?<br></strong>The FIFA event will certainly increase the number of visitors and tourists, not only during the World Cup itself, but also in the two years leading up to the event. Many people will come to Doha for related preparations, and such a huge international event requires considerable organization. Our marketing team is working hand in hand with the Qatar National Tourism Council to prepare different activities to increase the footfall involvement of DHFC. The decision to waive visa requirements for certain visitors to Qatar have had an impact on the diversity of nationalities visiting our mall. The government is taking strategic decisions to enhance the tourism sector and environment in Qatar, and this will definitely have a positive impact on us. Meanwhile, we will prepare a special set of events to go with the FIFA tournament.</p><p><strong>What is the relevance of technology and innovations for making DHFC a smart mall?<br></strong>As a smart mall, DHFC offers innovative digital options including free Wi-Fi and digital wayfinding to enhance consumer experience and is easily accessible, offering 8,000 smart parking spaces and VIP valet services. We are currently working to introduce an application that customers can use to see what initiatives and promotions we are offering. We are looking at the latest technologies and choosing those best for our mall and customers. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shop-til-you-drop]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the idea behind the Al Hazm project?<br></strong>The inspiration behind the development came from Italy's architectural heritage. All of Europe has classical architecture, but Italy has something special. I love the architecture, marble, food, cafes, and the atmosphere of its piazzas. I wanted to do something like that in Doha, which was impossible at the time. My friends thought I was crazy to try and recreate the craftsmanship and architecture of another era, but my idea grew from that inspiration. I wanted to use that beautiful Italian style of architecture, including its carvings and stonework. I decided to go ahead despite the challenges. I looked for contractors to do the stone and marble work, but no one wanted to do it. So, I established my own marble and stone factory just for the project. I traveled to India and sourced specialist carvers. In total, we had 700 people working on the carvings for seven years. </p><p><strong>What clientele is Al Emadi Enterprises targeting in Qatar, and what brands is it focusing on?<br></strong>We are targeting Qatari people and expatriates with high incomes. We do not have a food court at Al Hazm; we have fine dining restaurants. We do not have coffee shops and the other, well-known chains in malls; our offering is different. In terms of brands, we are targeting niche, elegant brands, not only famous ones. Famous brands are available everywhere and people want something new that is not widely available in the market. </p><p><strong>How did Qatari society react to Al Hazm? <br></strong>They are proud, happy, and satisfied with our project. We are not a mall; that is the difference between Al Hazm and other commercial developments. Al Hazm is a destination. It provides an outdoor experience with terraces, olive trees, and cafes. When you buy something, you have to be able to enjoy the whole experience of going to that destination. It is not about need; it is about savoring the experience. And, we have not reached the end of the project. There are still unused areas as well as ideas that are not off the ground yet.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges you face with Al Hazm's future development?<br></strong>The next challenge for us is how to keep the standards as high as they are now. Reaching a certain level is easy but maintaining it and moving to the next step is the challenge. Everyone will visit a new development because it is new and novel, but, over time, this interest calms down. I do not want to lose that level of interest.</p><p><strong>The Qatari population is growing, and upcoming events like the 2022 FIFA World Cup will attract many visitors. How do you see the future of the Al Hazm project and the country?<br></strong>Qatar's future is bright; business will continue to grow even after the World Cup. The World Cup is not the only thing Qatar has to offer, as there are many projects that will start after the event. Those projects will be even better in quality because we have more time to work on them. The economic future of Qatar may even exceed our expectations.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for 2020 and the Al Hazm project, and what tangible steps do you intend to take over the next couple of years?</strong><br>Between 2019 and 2020, we will reach the Al Hazm project's peak and complete the fit-out of our concept. When many mall projects open, they believe they are finished. But we can still do so much more. We will be completely ready by the time of the World Cup to welcome guests from across the world. We must be ready to provide good hospitality and restaurants for these visitors. We want them to enjoy the full experience of Doha and Qatar. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the composition of Lulu, and what are its main areas of focus?<br></strong>Lulu Group International is a 70-year-old Indian family-owned company. In Qatar, we have been operating for 19 years, where we have had eight hypermarkets. We mainly deal with food, non-food, and daily essential items. The average area of our stores is 20,000sqm. Our concept is well-accepted here, because we have been able to maintain prices and provide quality. Lulu also has a great deal of backward integration. We source products from around the world.  We have export distribution centers in 24 countries including the UK, the US, and Spain to make sure that food security is maintained all times. We are now trying to add another 10 outlets in the next year, a massive expansion. It is all pent-up demand, and we will meet it. There are many changes in the Qatar market. Concepts like ours, which are more than retail, have potential here. The economy and activities are expanding, and new cities are being built, as are retail properties. We will cover practically every location in Qatar. We are building a warehouse now that should be operational in 3Q2020, where we will have strategic six-month reserves for all basic commodities.</p><p><strong>Do you also produce locally?<br></strong>We will start producing our own label of food products. We have already started this process by commissioning about 15 items from local producers who matched our quality and standards. These will be products such as processed meat, nuts, and canned foods. Our next stage will be to export them to other countries. We are ensuring we have an excellent export ecosystem here and a favorable tax structure. Qatar also has great trade treaties with other countries. We will look for potential markets in the GCC like Oman and Kuwait, and perhaps Iraq, India, and Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the potential of local farms to ensure food security?<br></strong>Food security started three or four years before the blockade. We are doing a pioneer farm-to-store program. We partner closely with farmers. We work with their production planning and share our seasonality and store traffic. We harvest more on certain days and make sure everything they harvest reaches our store in less than two hours. We also have buyback programs and algorithms that can predict demand, so farmers can plan accordingly. Farms have been increasingly significantly. Local capacities have improved considerably. </p><p><strong>How are you adapting new technologies in order to enhance efficiency?<br></strong>Our delivery chain is fully under our control. Because we are dealing with sensitive products, we do not rely on typical third-party deliveries. We have specially designed trucks that are highly controlled, with three chambers with different temperature controls, as well as tracking devices. We do not only deliver products to people but we deliver them safely. We have around six trucks now and may double that number in six months, as we will cover more areas. We are also in the process of developing a black store, or a store that is not open to customers. It is like a supermarket that will have customers' real-time numbers, logistics, and data. They can shop naturally, we pick it up, and we deliver it to them. We will also incorporate predictive analytics, like telling customers they forgot to buy milk.</p><p><strong>Where do you identify the potentials in upcoming years?<br></strong>Hospitality is also in our group, but we do not have it in Qatar. We will stick to retail, though we will have multiple formats and increase our channels. The biggest priority now is to open the logistics center in 2020. The other priority is to open all our pending stores, including in Lusail and the Pearl, by 1Q2020. We will also look at the demographics of people coming to the World Cup and make sure they are taken care of. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your sense of the retail sector in Qatar?<br></strong>The retail sector is going through some difficult times. First, there are too many malls. Many retailers have committed themselves to malls when they had a much rosier picture of the future. Now, they have too many stores and not enough customers. Inevitably, there will be consolidation. Another important thing to keep in mind: not all malls are created equal. Our classification is a super-regional mall; there are only three others in Qatar. A retailer is much more interested in locations in these spots because they are operated by larger regional retail operators. We are doing everything needed in order to prosper, and retailers need to make sure they are doing the same. They need to be focused on enhancing customer experience. The other issue is retailers have opened stores that are too large. Larger stores translate into larger needs to operate the store. There is a spectrum of prices that we charge, but we are always trying to offer real value and returns.</p><p><strong>What is the scale and magnitude of the project?<br></strong>We have built just over 1 million sqm. In terms of leasable space, we have 230,000sqm. There are a lot of common areas, including parking and other space. We have 250 rooms in the hotel, 150 serviced departments, and another 250 rooms at the luxury collection hotel, Palais Vendí´me. Overall, we have 650 hotel rooms. We have a 6,000-sqm cinema with 1,900 seats and 18 screens. Our family entertainment center alone is 18,000sqm, including nine chalets. We expect this to become a venue for kids' parties. We will offer catering from our restaurants for the chalet parties. We have six slides, three toboggan runs, an ice river, caves, and igloos. As a landmark in Qatar, we anticipate it becoming a destination for the increasing tourist traffic into the country. We are currently on track to open in September 2020, and the project is 95% complete. </p><p><strong>What potential will Qatar's upcoming international events, such as the World Cup, have for Place Vendí´me?<br></strong>We want to be part of the tourism infrastructure of our country. When tourists come, we want them to realize their retail therapy experience should be with us. Our location is excellent, and we can automatically be part of the tourism infrastructure. With a stadium only 3km away, we are working with all the stakeholders to make sure we are a prominent part of the event. Government authorities have told us they will need 50,000 nights between the end of October-December 2022. This is only for FIFA organizers, teams, sponsors, and associated individuals. One of our owners has given us the strategy of building momentum, which is exactly what we are doing. The hard infrastructure, like roads, bridges, tunnels, metros, and so on, are amazing. The soft infrastructure is excellent as well. It is well-connected for pedestrians, and it is by the sea and beautiful. The infrastructure is there; we just need to create the atmosphere. Our project will become a catalyst for this area. Once people fully understand that we are open and operating, more people will come. This will create a sea change, and people will understand what we can offer.</p><p><strong>What are the upcoming steps for the project?<br></strong>The next thing is the civil defense inspection, which we are putting all of our energy into. It will likely start at the end of December 2019 and take four or five months. Once we have gone through the passive inspection, we will move through the active inspection. If there is any feedback, we will need to make adjustments. We have the greatest respect for this process, because at the end of the day it is all about safety. Planning for the pre-opening will start in early 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you tell us about APM Terminals in Spain, how it started and how it has evolved?</h4><p>APM Terminals currently operates a global network of 76 port terminals and 117 land services in 58 countries worldwide. The company facilitates port and operational management for 60 shipping companies providing import and export services for containers, bulk, general cargo and other goods. APM Terminals is part of A.P. Moller—Maersk, a leader in maritime services present in 130 countries with a workforce of 76,000. APM Terminals is one of the main terminals and logistics companies here in Spain, where we have six maritime facilities and several other inland services, although our core business is maritime. We have Algeciras, one of the biggest terminal hubs in the world, handling more than four million TEUs of cargo per year which is mainly transshipment cargo. We also have other facilities such as our gateway terminals in Barcelona, Valencia, Castellón, and Gijon. Valencia and Barcelona are the biggest gateway terminals in Spain for APM Terminals. Our terminal at the Port of Barcelona handles one million TEUs per year on average, making it a large facility. The terminal was built in 1992,and was the result of a merger between Maritima Laietana and Tersaco . In 2016, it was acquired by APM Terminals, which is part of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group.</p><h4>In 2018, APM Terminals experienced growth in facilities and revenue, standing at 4.1 billion USD globally. What is the strategy to continue this growth in 2019?</h4><p>Our very high growth rate depends to a large extent on the current increase in export and import activity. Our growth will continue to mirror the economic expansion of the industry. Spain is a mature market, therefore we are not expecting exponential growth, although we do hope to continue to improve and to maintain our pole position within the sector.</p><h4>How significant is Barcelona for APM Terminals on a global scale?</h4><p>Globally speaking, Barcelona is key for APM Terminals. Ever since the start of our concession in Barcelona, we have always focused on technology and efficiency in our processes to create value for our customers. This is one of our main drivers. We are improving the efficiency of each process performed at the terminal. We recently invested heavily in new equipment in the Barcelona terminal to further raise the level of service to offer our customers the very best productivity in the Mediterranean terminals.</p><h4>Does regulatory change pose a big challenge in your field?</h4><p>It is taking longer than we would prefer to adapt the laws and regulations to current industrial activities. That is because we are living and working in a constantly evolving market and it is difficult to adapt the legal framework to this changing landscape.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges and opportunities you face in the industry today?</h4><p>The greatest challenge we are facing is how to adapt to market needs. This is simultaneously a great challenge and a great achievement which sometimes requires considerable investment. We have invested USD47 million in equipment here, which represents 30% of our entire fleet. These efforts allow us to maintain our role as a benchmark in the sector.</p><h4>Are you looking to incorporate renewable energy into APM Terminals?</h4><p>We have started to adapt our car fleet to incorporate electric models. These cars are powered entirely by solar-generated electricity. We also have a contract with our power supply company that stipulates that all the power they provide us must come from renewable energy sources. In the future, our yard equipment will use hybrid engines rather than diesel power.</p><h4>Are recent geopolitical events having an impact on your industry generally or on APM Terminals' operations at Barcelona Terminal?</h4><p>Logistically, in terms of containers, the impact of factors such as Brexit will be relatively minor. Of course there will be a certain impact, but the port of Barcelona is not widely connected directly with the UK. As a handling company, we expect the impact of Brexit to be minimal. We are more worried about the commercial disputes between USA vs China and Europe that could impact in the world s handling throughput and consequently to our terminal.</p><h4>What are APM Terminals' main objectives for 2020?</h4><p>We have several main objectives. Firstly, we want to adapt our facilities to market needs. This involves upgrading part of our facility, which has been in operation for 27 years now, during which time both the market and ship size have changed considerably. It is worth pointing out that, 28 years ago, the capacity of the largest vessels working in the port was 4,000 TEU. Today we have 18,000 TEU capacity vessels calling here. We need to invest in equipment and in upgrading the facility to provide services to our customers, and the port community. Another objective for 2020 is to increase the volumes handled by the terminal. Our current volume is close to one million TEUs annually at Barcelona Terminal. We are also looking to diversify our business somewhat, handling not only ships, trains and trucks, but working with our customers to find new, added-value services with which add value in cost and time saving for the customer. The market is changing continuously. We need to adapt, not only to the market, but also to changing needs. We are part of the logistics chain, so we do think that we and our customers are one company and have common objective requiring an active and continue dialog with them. I would say that the approach has changed radically compared to the situation 20 years ago, when information was unavailable to customers due to the technology. Now, communication is wide open, with real data available through our website, so we can find synergies and help each other. The outcome is always better when you are transparent with your customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pere-navarro-state-delegate-el-consorci-zona-franca-barcelona-czfb]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The free zone consortium was the first consortium in Spain. Can you tell us a little about its evolution?</h4><p>The consortium was born over a hundred years ago. At the end of the 18th century, Spain lost the colonies of Cuba and the Philippines, and a problem related to international trade arose. In addition, after World War I, trade opportunities appeared, and the Catalan society wanted to take advantage of them. There was intense pressure to rent a free port in Barcelona, a claim that was demanded in the meeting of 499 municipalities in the city of Barcelona. In the end, a consortium was created in 1916, which included the city council of Barcelona, the Chamber of Commerce and Navigation, the Chamber of Industry, and the Association of San Isidro (an association of farmers). From that moment, the consortium was created to manage this free port and has evolved ever since. Besides having this free port, there was also an interest in having a public physical space, and it focused its attention on part of the Delta del Llobregat. The state, through a concession free of charge for the exploitation of the sands of the coast, granted the exploitation for 50 years, and the consortium obtained the necessary resources to expropriate this part of Delta del Llobregat. It was no longer only a free port. In the 1950s, the first installation of SEAT marked an important step for the consolidation of the industrial estate.</p><h4>This consortium is a good example of the power of collaborations between the public and private sectors. What is the role of this alliance on the philosophy and expansion of the free zone?</h4><p>Its origin comes from the public and private sectors. We have the economic world of the city of Barcelona, and the town hall, and the Spanish state. The performance of the consortium since its inception has gone hand in hand with this relationship between the public and private sectors. In fact, current projects are sustained on that type of relationship. Our current flagship group is the 3D printing business incubator, which is the result of the relationship between the Consortium and the Chambers of Commerce of Spain through the INCYDE Foundation; we have received aid from ERDF funds, the EU, and the private technology center, Leitat. These three public and private entities have come together to create something new in an innovative field. In June, we held seven international events at the same time, including the world congress of the World Free Zone, the Mediterranean Summit, and the meeting of the free zones of Latin America ATSFA.</p><h4>A priority for the consortium is the establishment of DFactory, a 3D printing project. What is the strategic plan for its implementation?</h4><p>The project was inaugurated in April. The idea is to incubate 100 companies there over the next five years. The project was inaugurated by the Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities, Pedro Duque, as well as the mayor of Barcelona. We are currently incubating 26 companies, surpassing this year's objective of 20. It is extremely useful because in the incubator the companies can interact with each other. 3D printing works with different materials: plastics, resins, ceramics, and so on. There is one company manufacturing glasses and another that manufactures motorcycle parts. Other companies also manufacture aeronautical or automotive parts, as it is possible to manufacture more resistant pieces with less weight, which is key. We have all that here. In the next five years, we will incubate all these companies, though we are also building DFactory, a factory in line with Industry 4.0. In that factory, there will be 3D printing, AI, robotics, and aspects related to cybersecurity. Architecturally, it is different and more expensive. What we are building in this first phase will be ready in June, and the first companies will begin to occupy it after the holidays. It is around 17,000sqm with an investment of EUR17 million.</p><h4>You do a wide range of international collaborations. What is the strategic plan to continue making new international relations, and what are some examples of this?</h4><p>We have developed a general strategic plan for the consortium that focuses on three axes. One of them is to maintain our heritage. We do not live on the public budget but from the management of public heritage, namely the industrial estate and other buildings we have. The axis is about the long-term economic sustainability of the consortium, which is all about maintaining equity. My idea is that when I leave here, I should have left more public heritage than when I started. The second axis is about the economic and social development of the territory, namely developing the economy to be the technological hub of Industry 4.0 in southern Europe, an engine for generating talent demand, and more. The third axis is urban integration and environmental sustainability. We are making an implementation plan for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. My favorite goal is the 17th, on alliances. Therefore, we are establishing alliances not only with the private sector but also with our neighbors such as the port, the airport, the city of Barcelona, and other industrial estates such as Pedrosa Polygon, which has created an association called Area 8. There is another aspect to consider, which is internationalization and implies creating international networks of Industry 4.0 and networks related to the issue of logistics. Third, we have an important weight in the World Free Zone organization.</p><h4>Our publication is called Barcelona 2020 and will be in circulation throughout the year. What are your main objectives for the following year?</h4><p>The main objectives for 2020 are those that I have already mentioned; continue with the incubator, build and launch the 3DFactory.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80% of Revenue from Outside Spain]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[angel-ramirez-president-gtd]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within your sector, GTD is an established company. How has it evolved since it started?</h4><p>My business partner and I set up this company together with others who have since retired. The takeoff was fast: we did not have to seek financing or capital increase, nor did we have to let in partners. From the beginning, we were hired for projects in the robotics industry—it was our specialty at that time and still is, though now we are also in other sectors—and the automobile sector. We quickly started working in other sectors, and two years after our foundation, we started our first contracts with the European Space Agency. Although the core of the engineering work has not changed, it has changed in terms of quality control, work regulations, and project organization. The space world is much more demanding than the automotive world. In 2004, we separated from the automotive sector, as we could not continue working with a sector as demanding as the automotive industry at the same time as the space sector. Since 2004, we have five sectors with which we develop our engineering: aeronautical; logistics and transports; science, infrastructure, and robotics; and defense and security. More than 80% of our billing is with customers outside Spain. We have offices in France, Germany, the UK, and Morocco as well as partners in Latin America where we do projects. Currently, the balance is between services and projects, which took us a long time to achieve. Our services are selling standard software, licenses, user licenses, and adaptations of previous software.</p><h4>Since the company's beginning, so much technology has been developed, and the use of big data has exploded. What change has been the most significant in this industry?</h4><p>The most significant change is the way we buy information that is generated from space to determine the exact position of all aircraft on the planet. The Malaysia Airlines incident, for example, will never happen again. A Canadian initiative, alongside the US, took advantage of a constellation of 66 satellites by putting a small radar on board every spacecraft. This little radar saves us because, as an integrator of this data, we can know exactly where a plane is at every minute for the benefit of the airlines that are our clients. I can see if the plane is following its flight plan. Depending on the meteorological data and the position of the plane, we can recalculate the flight plan to save fuel and arrive on time. There are many things to do through the data that space provides you. Space started as GPS, but it goes much further. There are many more military applications but the applications of space to the civil field are fundamental. The new space will allow the launch of small satellites with a shorter life cycle but at a lower cost. I could do things that a large satellite is not intended to do, like visually track of cargoes or containers on a ship, or manage traffic. Logistics will change thanks to space, although we still lack satellites. The problem is how to put these small satellites into orbit at a decent price. Another great challenge is what will happen to all these satellites that are in orbit simultaneously. In space, everything is being piled up on top of each other; we have to be careful so that the satellites do not collide with one other.</p><h4>What are some of your most innovative projects in the space sector?</h4><p>Currently, we have a positive evolution. For us, space is mostly space transportation. Since 1990, we have worked on the European Space Agency's launchers program, and we are now with Ariane 6, a spectacular new rocket that will be launched for the first time in 2020. We are already working with Ariane Next Gen (the new generation after Ariane 6). There will be two pitchers of this project: one is large and one is smaller and both will be recoverable. We have to make everything recoverable because it is profitable.</p><h4>What do you want to see happening to your company in 2020?</h4><p>With regard to growth, our aeronautical business is the one growing the most at the moment. Every year, we double its size. The market is aimed at airlines, air traffic controllers, airports, and airport management. The aeronautical sector is complex and very 'tech-demanding.' It's about billions of dollars and airlines have to deal with many parameters to be profitable and that's not easy. We provide solutions that can help them save up to 3% per year, and that's a big deal. There is much work to do, especially because the sector is growing exponentially and present many opportunities for attentive engineers like us. There will be a meeting of ministers in Seville in 2019 with all the member countries of the space agency, where they will approve the budget for the next three years (20-22). However, you cannot do wonderful things beyond the budget ceiling. In the new space sector, there is private money; we do not depend on state budgets, but it is still a small business. Finally, we are also growing significantly in the maritime market with shipping companies and autonomous ports. The continent is growing exponentially, giving us a great deal of work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2019 a year of change]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[lyman-daniels-president-of-cbre-mexico-colombia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did CBRE react to the tumultuous time in Mexico in 2019?</h4><p>2019 was a year of changes and modifications. And the changes were not just governmental; they were also social, economic, and commercial. CBRE's great advantage is its ability to react to those changes quickly and proactively and being able to respond to its clients with solutions in times of uncertainty. Our ability to lead our clients through such a changing environment was our forte in 2019. I have been in Mexico for 25 years, and 2019 saw more changes in one year than I have seen in 25 years. Whether one agrees or not, the ecosystem is changing, and if they cannot react, they cannot survive. CBRE has been able to react; more importantly, we are enabling our clients to react to this change. As a third-party provider, our job is to help our clients with their large portfolios. We do everything from brokerage to project management. We do the administration of property management, facilities management, and valuations. We are bringing in several other business lines soon that will continue adding to our whole suite of client services.</p><h4>The amount of investment in construction has dropped in Mexico. How is CBRE adapting to this new context?</h4><p>Investment has only dropped in some types of construction. Looking at Mexico's industrial sector, which is a large part of our business, there are two sides: logistics and manufacturing. Both of those are growing tremendously. Firstly, it is growing in the third-party logistics segment, which is the people who ensure goods, parts, and supplies are getting from A to B so manufacturers can produce. More importantly, we have seen growth in e-commerce. All large stores have tremendously increased their e-commerce, and Mexico is catching up quickly with the US and Europe in terms of e-commerce. All that e-commerce requires logistical space because e-commerce is not as easy as normal retail. It is a logistical challenge because millennials want things delivered correctly and quickly. That is not an easy task, particularly for a country without that distribution infrastructure for its retail sector. Meanwhile, the industrial side is strong and constantly improving. Some sectors have come down and others up, but we are not entering into a dark cloud of no activity. This is the most competitive industrial market I have seen in 25 years.</p><h4>What factors are behind the current competitiveness in the Mexican industrial market?</h4><p>E-commerce is one reason. The auto manufacturing sector in Mexico is larger and stronger than it has ever been. A number of plants have opened up in the country over the last five years, creating a huge amount of demand and growth for the industrial sector. There is steady growth countrywide, not just in certain cities, industries, or markets. When I came to Mexico 25 years ago as a developer, there was a steep learning curve in the country. There were some great buildings being built, though not all of them were super high-quality buildings. Today, the overall average quality of the buildings being constructed in Mexico is competitive with anywhere in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.</p><h4>What kind of additional services is CBRE planning to offer in the medium term to further diversify the company?</h4><p>Institutionalization of the market is inevitable. More publicly traded funds and companies are coming onto the market, such as developers, third-party funds, and banks. These institutions are demanding the institutional-level services they find worldwide with CBRE. Part of that includes the ability to finance those projects by using debt, not just equity. In these cases, CBRE's role is to be their eyes and ears and take care of their administrative needs. These banks and funds need a partner to be able to grow. We will be bringing these same services to Mexico soon.</p><h4>What are the biggest issues facing CBRE's clients in Mexico's changing market?</h4><p>Many of our clients have to make decisions without enough information. A client will need to grow or change the way they work, and, sometimes, they have no experts to tell them what is going on. CBRE's priority in 2020 is to help remove that lack of information. If I were a business owner, I would want a partner who can show me the options and the risk and reward curve. Owners want to know where the market is moving, what to expect, and what the important market drivers are, which CBRE can educate our clients about.</p><h4>How did the number of deals you were able to close in 2019 compare to 2018?</h4><p>They were similar in number, but different in types of deals. We saw many larger deals in 2019, including record-breaking ones. Our international investors and tenants are extremely bullish in Mexico. They have embraced the country, knowing that, regardless of politics, one looks for countries that have rule of law and allow their investments, production, and operations to grow. We have seen global players come back to Mexico for all the right reasons, like location and demographics, all of which have given a huge uplift on the outlook in Mexico. CBRE's Mexican operation has historically been one of the fastest-growing CBRE operations worldwide for the last 10 years, and I fully expect to continue that growth. It will come through vertical penetration throughout the market, growth through our operations in various sub-markets throughout the country, and amplification of our service lines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the strategy behind the broad spectrum of academic disciplines offered at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar?<br></strong>It seems like an unusual selection, but the programs are actually quite complementary. We added the information systems program more than 10 years ago because it is, in fact, a different discipline than computer science. We find that having both programs allows students to find the exact area in technology that interests them. Our business administration program takes a quantitative approach and is technology-oriented. In fact, the CMU business administration program is STEM-designated in Pittsburgh. Our biological sciences program is an alternative for students at Weill Cornell University-Qatar who decided to pursue science instead of medicine. Students take computer programming and mathematics, just as they do in our other programs. Students can also combine biological sciences and computer science for a computational biology degree.</p><p><strong>Why was Carnegie Mellon approached to come to Education City Qatar?<br></strong>Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's vision for Education City was not to find one university to cover everything, but to find the best in every field. We have arguably the world's best computer science program, along with a top-10 undergraduate business program. Initially, it was these strengths that led Qatar Foundation to extend an invitation to Carnegie Mellon.</p><p><strong>Is Education City attracting international students?<br></strong>We try to have around 80% of our students from Qatar, which typically means that about 45% are Qatari citizens and 35% are long-term residents who grew up here. Usually, about 20% of our student population comes from outside the country, and most of them end up staying and working here. We often hear from our international alumni that they feel deep gratitude toward Qatar and Qatar Foundation, because otherwise they could not have received the education they did. Our fundamental goal is to have an impact on Qatar, and we are certainly doing that.</p><p><strong>What has your contribution to Qatar been so far?<br></strong>Our programs impact many areas. We have many alumni who have pursued entrepreneurial ventures, for example. We have a large number of alumni who are working in healthcare in a variety of different scientific and technological roles. We have a robust community engagement initiative that includes reaching out to pre-college students, particularly in the area of computer science. The next generation will need strong computational skills, no matter what field they pursue, and we are helping to spread awareness and use our expertise to bring those skills to students in Qatar.</p><p><strong>Qatar's National Vision aims to create a diversified economy, and one of its pillars is social development. What is education's contribution to achieving this?</strong><br>It is difficult to create a diversified economy overnight; one needs entrepreneurial activities, a strong private sector, and government support. All these things require a strong, quality educational infrastructure. By bringing in the partner universities, along with Qatar University, which is an outstanding school, Qatar can now offer multiple opportunities for young people to develop the skills and knowledge to help diversify the economy. Economic diversification is a generational change, and Qatar is on the right track to achieve its vision.</p><p><strong>What steps do you plan to implement over the next few years?<br></strong>We will continue to provide a quality education for our students, and this means constantly reviewing and improving upon the full student experience. We will put more emphasis on AI and entrepreneurship. We are expanding our outreach to the kindergarten to Grade 12 education system. We want to promote an exchange of ideas so we can become an even more integral part of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What lead to the creation of the Qatar National Library?<br></strong>While Education City has been truly revolutionary in Qatar's educational landscape, with international universities opening campuses, they were isolated in resources. Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's vision evolved from a university library to a national library also serving the public. Qatar's population is young: 40% is below 18, and a significant number of these children and young adults have not been raised with access to a public library. Thus, there is a specific focus on attracting children and young adults, along with their parents. In 2019, we had more than 900 different programs, from science lectures to free, monthly Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra concerts. It is a social center for the entire community.</p><p><strong>What has been the reaction of Qataris to the library?<br></strong>Over 1.7 million books have been borrowed, so clearly there is enthusiasm. We cannot say exactly how we have impacted peoples' lives after such a short time; the changes we are bringing about are too big to happen right away. But on any afternoon, you can see how many people take advantage of the space. People come here after work and school to read, study, or attend an event. Recently, we had 3,000 people in the building and not a single empty seat. </p><p><strong>What challenges did you face the first year?<br></strong>The challenge is to continuously offer new programs that keep people interested and coming back. We are constantly analyzing which events, resources, and subjects are the most popular, so we can ensure we have the latest materials and can serve all our members. For example, diet and healthy living are popular subjects now, so we have increased our selection of healthy cookbooks and held a workshop on healthy recipes. We are here to offer what society needs and seeks to learn. We have made the library a friendly place and will continue to work on being a learning place for everyone. We are trying to build bridges, not just between Qatar and the world, but within Qatar, between our diverse populations. We strive to be a place where people from all backgrounds can learn from one another in a respectful, welcoming environment. </p><p><strong>What new technological innovations would you like to implement?<br></strong>The library has technology baked into every corner. Users can access all types of databases, download e-books, and stream music from anywhere around the world. It is not just about the technology we have, but how we use it. We have digitized 7 million pages of materials, the majority of which are Arabic books. Arabic content is still limited on the web, and much of what there is not searchable. We not only digitize a page, but perform optical character recognition so that every word of the text becomes searchable. Not only are we increasing the amount of content, but we are also increasing people's ability to find content they couldn't find before. We have been digitizing books from our Heritage Library collection, as well as items from New York University's Arabic collection.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the library in the upcoming year?<br></strong>I anticipate more usage and a better understanding of the library's value to society by Qataris. Qatar has opened several cultural organizations, such as the library and the National Museum of Qatar, to serve as institutions that preserve the past and help us learn about it. We also have the Qatar Digital Library, which holds digitized materials about Qatar and the Gulf from other international institutions. This is another way we are providing information to our members about the country and its place in the world, as well as supporting researchers from all over. This helps the community's ability to learn about its past and present and build a future with education as its foundation. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main milestones that the institution has achieved in recent years?<br></strong>QU is a national university that plans to be a catalyst for the country's economic development. Over 20,000 students are enrolled in QU, with the largest number of Qataris enrolled in any of Qatar's higher education institutions. We are investing heavily in expanding our operations and are working with the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the organizing body for FIFA World Cup 2022, in building sporting grounds inside the campus. We aim to improve students' academic success by supporting students throughout their academic lifecycle, from the pre-university stage to beyond graduation.</p><p><strong>How would you summarize QU's model for higher education? <br></strong>Over the past decade or so, QU has gone through different phases. We are calling the current phase, the 'transformation' phase, part of the new strategy from 2018-2022. In 2013, the university went through a major reformation process in terms of our programs, which took about six years. Now, we are facing a huge challenge that affects all higher education institutions at a global level, and the question is how to meet the needs of the workforce in the future. This is a big challenge that does not specifically apply to QU, but all higher education institutions. The challenge is how to meet the needs of the world, with advancements such as blockchain, AI, and fintech. </p><p><strong>What is QU's answer to that challenge?<br></strong>There are three ways: qualifications framework, education excellence framework, and finally a focus on student experience. As part of our main ambition to transform, we have several main strategies. Our main item is to grow alongside other higher education institutions, while having them grow with us. Secondly, we are aiming for excellence in education, which can help to ensure that students are competing to get a quality education that it is no less than any international education. Another important factor is finding ways to help our students continue learning once they complete their studies through graduate or PhD programs. Furthermore, we want to have a smart campus so that there is a strong connectivity to make a unique experience, which we call the digital transformation strategy. Another enabling strategy for innovation is to ensure that our university's graduating class has entrepreneurial skills, which we are building so that it gradually becomes natural for students.</p><p><strong>What areas in research are you most focused on?<br></strong>QU receives 60% of the Qatar National Research Fund's grants. The College of Engineering at QU, which is one of the most active engineering colleges in the Middle East, gets 20% of that fund. QU College of Pharmacy is one of the leaders in the MENA region and has been growing for the last eight years. Now, we want to focus on areas related to cybersecurity, wireless telecommunication, and health.</p><p><strong>What are you doing to internationalize the university?<br></strong>QU is ranked in the top-500 universities in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings. In addition, QU continues to be ranked first in the THE International Outlook Indicator category, an honor it has held since 2015, which is due partly to the ratio of foreign students in QU; around 30% of our students are foreigners. The majority come to study at the undergraduate level from the region, such as Africa and the Middle East, but we have students from all over the world. Another variable is the diversification of the university, as we have teachers from all over the world. And a third factor is collaboration with foreign institutions, where we have more than 400 collaborative projects in over 130 countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the institution's journey?<br></strong>During the 10 years since our inception, QNRF has emerged as a catalyst for Qatar's social and economic advancement. All our operations and activities are driven by the mission to create and nurture a research culture, build local human capacity, and establish Qatar as a regional hub for scientific innovation and technological development. To achieve this, we have developed a diverse portfolio of research funding and capacity building programs, which have helped realize our vision of becoming an enabler for R&amp;D and help Qatar develop a sustainable and diversified economy. Whether you are a student or a well-established researcher, QNRF will support you in pursuing your research, ranging across topics as diverse as astrophysics or the architectural history of Qatar.</p><p><strong>How did you structure QNRF?<br></strong>We have three primary suites of funding programs: research programs, capacity building and development programs, and special programs, all of which are strictly run on a competitive basis to ensure quality and equal opportunity. Under research programs, we have our flagship program, the National Priorities Research Program, and the Thematic and Grand Challenges Research Program (TGRP), which address the challenges faced by Qatar in collaboration with local and international partners. Through our capacity-building and development programs, we ensure that researchers at all levels and across all disciplines can rely on QNRF to learn more about research and build their skills and profile. Our programs offer support to students as early as primary school right up to postdoctoral. Moreover, we also have a dedicated program that helps young researchers establish their careers during the early stages. Our special programs aim to increase the technology-readiness levels (TRL) of locally produced research and encourage our researchers to gain international experience and exposure by attending international conferences and participating in research exchange opportunities inside and outside Qatar. These programs are developing the future of Qatar's research leadership and help our researchers keep up to date with the latest developments and innovations internationally.</p><p><strong>What is the size of the participation in your funding programs?<br></strong>QNRF has launched more than 100 calls under the banner of more than 18 funding programs. These calls received more than 14,000 proposals, with more than 3,500 receiving funding. Through these programs and initiatives, we have funded around 2,600 investigators, both in Qatar and abroad, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and build networks with research centers worldwide. Our funding programs focus on quality rather than quantity. An example of our success includes the steady improvement in the international ranking of Qatari and Qatar-based institutions. Moreover, in terms of scholarly output, there has been an impressive upward trend, both in the quantity and quality of publications where the Mean Subject Citation Score (MSCS) for our publications has reached 1.40, surpassing the world average of 1.</p><p><strong>How is your institution taking Qatar closer to the objectives dictated in the Qatar National Vision 2030?<br></strong>Our primary goal is to help the country's economy transition from a hydrocarbon-dependent to a sustainable and diversified economy, and our programs reflect the aims set forth in the Qatar National Vision 2030 by focusing on three key elements: research, development, and innovation (RDI). Along with our partners and stakeholders, we are helping the ongoing research process to move across the full value chain of RDI to the stage where we will see the establishment of SME companies and industries. With the establishment of the Qatar Research Development and Innovation (QRDI) Council, the time is now ripe to improve the entire value chain and take the outcomes of the research compartment to higher TRLs, then to development and innovation compartments, culminating in the establishment of knowledge-based companies. QNRF is actively working with QRDI and various government and industry stakeholders to meet these objectives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[al-hayat-medical-center]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us a history of the Al Hayat Medical Center?<br></strong>In 2003, Al Hayat Medical Center was a private practice working out of a small villa. In 2008, we turned the practice into a polyclinic with three or four specialties. In 2010, we moved to our current building, which is a purpose-built medical center. We have since been increasing the number of our clinics; every two or three months, we add another specialty. Now, we have two branches with seven gynecology clinics, two pediatrics, two internal medicine, one cardiology, one neurology, one physical therapy unit, one dermatology, one ENT, one urology, and two dental clinics. We also have a laboratory, an X-ray department, and two pharmacies. We are considering becoming Al Hayat Hospital in the near future, because Qatar is booming and the country's infrastructure is impressive. We now have around 130 employees.</p><p><strong>Where does Al Hayat Medical Center's proposed hospital project currently stand?<br></strong>We are currently arranging finances for the project. However, we must wait on the government's decision about whether permanent residents can own land here. I have already applied, and we will see if we get that approval. The planning stage has already started, and we expect to start the project within the next year. Also, we aim to receive Joint Commission International accreditation (JCI) in the coming months. This will give us greater leverage over other medical centers in Qatar.</p><p><strong>Do you expect other healthcare institutions in Qatar to seek accreditation?<br></strong>The Ministry of Health requires hospitals to have accreditation, but not clinics. We are thinking ahead by doing this. Currently, there is only one laboratory and three hospitals that are accredited, and hopefully we will be next. Many other healthcare institutions will definitely follow suit.</p><p><strong>How do you assess cooperation between the public and private healthcare systems in Qatar?<br></strong>There is a great relationship between the public and private healthcare sectors. We look forward to the day when both sectors will be able to share information electronically, especially regarding medical laboratory test results, which we should be able to access. We always follow developments at Hamad Hospital and the Ministry of Health to ensure Al Hayat Medical Center's digital technology is compatible with the public sector's systems. We adjust our IT system and programming to fit theirs because we look forward to the day when we will share the same system. Obviously, this will require patient confidentiality agreements to be put in place, though we will definitely line up to do this. Information sharing will help patients' diagnoses and treatment and save them and the healthcare system money. There will be no need for us to repeat tests that have already been done under the public healthcare system.</p><p><strong>What are the main targets for Al Hayat Medical Center over the next year?<br></strong>We want to concentrate on quality. There are too many private medical centers opening in Qatar now; there is a boom. When we started, there were perhaps five or six medical centers, and now there are more than 200; however, only the clinics offering higher quality services will succeed.  Because of the high competition, clinics offer many free treatments, though this is not good business. Good business is providing high-quality patient services, which is what people seek. We are an affluent country, and people seek quality over quantity; hence, our strategy is to provide quality care, using the best and most advanced equipment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aspetar is the first specialized orthopedic and sports medicine hospital in the Gulf.  What have been the main milestones of Aspetar?<br></strong>One milestone is being part of Aspire Zone Foundation, which is comprised of three organizations (Aspire Academy, Aspetar, and Aspire Logistics). 2009 was special as we became the region's first FIFA Medical Center of Excellence. We also partnered with different organizations locally, regionally, and globally to establish ASPREV, the Sports Groin Pain Center. In 2013, Aspetar received the distinction of being a reference medical center for GCC Health Ministers Council and in 2015, Aspetar was designated as an 'IOC Research Centre for Prevention of Injury and Protection of Athlete Health.' We have received recognitions and achieved ACI Diamond Level Accreditation. We have enjoyed our partnerships that we have built and nurtured, like with the Aspetar Sports Surgery Training Center. We owe our success to visionary leadership and our staff who has worked tirelessly to shape Aspetar. </p><p><strong>What are the main services that you offer and their quality?<br></strong>As a multidisciplinary sport medicine hospital, our services go far beyond surgical treatment for injured athletes. We incorporate preventive programs, physical coaches, physical therapists, nutritionists, and sports psychologists. We cater to professional and recreational athletes. We have services for injured athletes and those targeting performance enhancement using our considerable expertise and facilities that include heat chamber and altitude dorms. Our rehabilitation services are consistently ranked highly by all patients. We learn from our patients and do patient surveys.  We strive hard to foster an open culture for discussing incidents and complaints, and we look at root causes to understand the underlying problem and identify areas that need improvement. Aspetar has become the treatment and rehabilitation destination of choice for elite athletes from around the world including Neymar, Didier Drogba, yay Toure, and Moussa Demble. Aspetar has also become a destination for elite training camps that come to benefit from Aspetar's altitude acclimatization facility. </p><p><strong>How is the role of your institution aligned with the objectives dictated by the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030 to diversify the economy?</strong><br>Every organization's journey towards QNV 2030 is unique. Aspetar's contribution touches upon different pillars of the QNV 2030. For example, we contribute toward development of human resources in the niche areas of healthcare through a partnership with Weil Cornell Medical College and Qatar University providing their graduates work experience in our hospitals. A recent MoU was signed between Carnegie Mellon University Branch Campus for research collaboration and knowledge sharing. We continue to support Qatar national teams and our federation as an exclusive medical partner. With our cutting-edge practices, we are on a pathway to promote health tourism in the state of Qatar. We are building an agile revenue cycle to fuel business growth and allow contributions toward the local economy.</p><p><strong>What is the outlook of your institution for the year ahead?<br></strong>2019 is the last leg in our journey to our vision to be global leader in sports medicine and exercise science by 2020. As this is a year of reflection, we need to review of our journey and acknowledge the shift we must make in how we run our operations. Another significant aspect will be our increased focused on employee-centered activities and development plans. On the clinical front, we are in the process of creating a unique football medicine program that will serve the football athlete, to reduce the amount of athletes seeking medical services internationally, in the lead up to the FIFA 2022 World Cup. We are looking to expand the visiting surgeon program to attract high-level athletes locally, regionally, and internationally to Aspetar's surgical and rehabilitation care. We intend to grow our business for the athlete and serve the physically active population of Qatar to promote health and wellbeing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the focus of PHCC regarding the increased health level of the country?<br></strong>Evidence shows that health systems oriented toward primary care achieve better health outcomes for lower overall costs. This is an important phase of PHCC's development, as we continue to tackle several national health challenges. Qatari life expectancy has been constantly improving, and in the coming decades, the quality of life for Qataris is at risk due to their changing lifestyles. Although there is already a high prevalence of chronic conditions and associated risk factors, the best way to a healthy population is to focus on wellness and prevention, and having comprehensive primary healthcare service. PHCC has placed significant emphasis on developing safe, high-quality health services across all our centers. In 2018, we received the International Diamond Accreditation by Accreditation Canada. As an organization, PHCC is encouraged by its achievements under the national primary healthcare strategy. We have upgraded and opened new primary care facilities, enhanced and delivered eight transformative models of care to meet the greatest health needs of our communities, and strengthened the capacity and capability of our workforce through additional investment, staff development and training. We have also participated in sector-wide discussions and planning forums, placing primary care as the first and continuous point of care in the health system. Our vision is ambitious, detailed, and achievable. We have already increased our focus on prevention and wellness by creating a new preventative healthcare directorate as part of an improved organizational structure. We have strengthened our clinical leadership and created a new AMD Directorate for quality and workforce development. The new National Health Strategy calls for a future family medicine model of care based on better system collaboration across the whole sector and improved access to more comprehensive services in the community.</p><p><strong>What are the areas set for improvement for the upcoming year?<br></strong>Prevention is the main pillar of our strategy. There are five focus groups: children, mothers, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases. Our programs are aligned with the needs of these groups using preventative measures. Patients have easy access to care at our facilities as well as at home. Doctors are supported by multi-disciplinary teams to accomplish this goal, focusing on providing patient-centered care, as the relationships between doctors, their teams, and patients is key to the success of any healthcare system. We are also introducing technology and innovation to ensure ease of access, with plans to launch a PHCC mobile app. Currently, patients can get information on the patient portal about their health status. To further enhance partnership with patients, our patient engagement team hosts discussions that empower the patient and allow them to take greater responsibility for their health.</p><p><strong>What is the relevance of preventive care to avoid future diseases?<br></strong>The 30 targets set in the National Health Strategy are our reference points over the next five years to minimize emergency room visits. We will do this by having strong family medicine and primary healthcare services established in the country. We offer patients access to healthcare before they are sick, with facilities closer to their homes. We want to provide easy access to appointments and follow-ups, bringing more diagnostic services to the community. Ideally, the hospital should only be used for critical cases and acute illnesses.</p><p><strong>What are the next practical steps for PHCC?<br></strong>Our vision is to be the leader in transforming the wellbeing of people in Qatar by changing the way healthcare is provided. To enable this, we will strengthen our engagement with key partners across the health system to shift the balance of care from curative, hospital-based treatment to enhanced preventative health and wellness services in the community. This will better align healthcare and resources toward an approach of integrated care, with a focus on empowering people to make informed decisions for their health. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Qatar has been ranked fifth best for health in the world by the UK's Legatum Institute. How has the quality of Qatar's health system contributed to this ranking and how does the system compare to international standards?</strong><br>Improved life expectancy, better health outcomes, and investment in health infrastructure led to Qatar being ranked fifth in the world for health by the Legatum Institute, a London-based think tank, at the start of 2019. In compiling the health ranking in the annual prosperity index, Qatar's performance in areas including basic health outcomes, health infrastructure, preventative care, and physical and mental health were all evaluated, with the recent growth and development of Qatar's healthcare system playing a leading role in improvements across all these areas. Qatar has the highest life expectancy rate in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and its crude death rate per 100,000 population has reduced significantly throughout this decade. Additionally, Qatar is ranked in the top quartile in the Universal Health Coverage Index by the WHO and World Bank's 2017 Global Monitoring Report. In terms of healthcare access and quality, Qatar is ranked in the top 25% of the world and highest in the Gulf according to the WHO Global Burden of Disease 2018 report. The improvements of the healthcare system in recent years mean that we now measure our performance against the highest international standards. For example, for heart attack patients, the average time from arrival at hospital to acute coronary intervention is 68 minutes, compared to the international benchmark of 90 minutes, while 68% of stroke patients are treated with acute intervention within 60 minutes of arrival at hospital, exceeding the international benchmark of 50-60%.</p><p><strong>The number of hospital beds has increased across the healthcare system in recent years. What are the plans to further increase the number of beds in both the public and private sectors?</strong><br>Qatar's increasing population has meant the healthcare system has had to expand its infrastructure at a remarkable rate. Since 2016, we have opened seven new hospitals in the public sector, increasing the number of hospital beds in the public sector by around 40%. Qatar's private sector has also undergone significant expansion, with three new private hospitals and four diagnostic and treatment centers opened since 2016, as well as 95 general health centers and 89 company clinics. This expansion has led to a 36% in private sector hospitals beds in the country. This expansion in recent years has boosted the total bed capacity across the system significantly, and we are committed to continuing the growth of the healthcare system in Qatar in the coming years. From 2020 and beyond, there are plans for more than 20 new facilities, including specialist facilities for pediatrics, geriatrics, and mental health.</p><p><strong>What are the plans and expectations of the Ministry of Public Health in the coming years in order to continue advancing the quality of care provided across the healthcare system?</strong><br>Qatar's National Health Strategy 2018-2022 provides the framework and direction for the development of the healthcare system in the coming years. The strategy aims to further advance the quality of healthcare services we provide by focusing on seven priority population groups and five system-wide priority areas. The strategy's priority populations reflect an investment in both the current and future generations and include children, mothers, older people, and those with special needs. The system-wide priorities enable us to deliver a genuinely integrated model of care that strives to maintain well-being, while making sure that people receive well-coordinated care, delivered in a professional and safe environment at the appropriate level. Our efforts are guided by three overall goals: better health, better care, and better value. These help to ensure we focus on improving health and healthcare in a sustainable way. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why was Al Shaqab originally created?<br></strong>Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani established Al Shaqab in 1992 to honor the war horses ridden by Qatari warriors of the past, and to ensure Arabian horse would continue to play a leading role in the cultural heritage of Qataris. His vision was to increase the number of superior Arabian horses in Qatar, improve the quality of Arabian show horses, and preserve and perpetuate the finest Arabian horse breeds. Since its inception, Al Shaqab has bred seven world champion stallions. What is unique is that we bred three generations of champions, a feat no other breeding farm has achieved.</p><p><strong>What races has the Al Shaqab Endurance Team participated in? <br></strong>Al Shaqab's Endurance Team competes annually in Qatar, the Netherlands, and France. The team participates in endurance races for distances from 80km-160km. In the 2018 FEI World Endurance Championship for Young Horses in Samorin, Slovakia, our riders took second and third place. Endurance racing is one of the fastest-growing FEI international equestrian events and consists of varied terrain through a course in the desert and cross-country. There are mandatory health checks during these races, in which horses must pass a veterinary inspection to continue on to the next checkpoint, including a final inspection at the end of the race to clock an official time. Any horse that does not pass a test in the checkpoint or is considered lame is eliminated from the race.</p><p><strong>What are your main events through the year? <br></strong>We have two major international equestrian competitions that take place every year: CHI AL SHAQAB and Longines Global Champions Tour (LGCT). CHI stands for “Concours Hippique International" or Equestrian International Competition; we only invite FEI's top ranked riders to compete in this world-class competition. LGCT is the world's premiere five-star show jumping event, which spans three continents and takes place in some of the world's great cities including Paris, Monaco, Madrid, New York, Shanghai, and Rome. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the Qatar Equestrian Federation, we are organizing a series of 12 competitions named Hathab, a Qatar equestrian tour to provide opportunities for Qatari youths to develop their horse-riding skills and hone their competitive spirit. Hathab is an initiative of Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani, president of the Qatar Olympic Committee that aims to improve the standard of horse riding among Qatari youths while encouraging the involvement of private stables and individual horse owners to grow awareness of horsemanship as part of Qatar's history and tradition. </p><p><strong>What is the role of Al Shaqab in preserving and promoting the Arabian breed? <br></strong>We have a local breeder program that provides studs from our champion stock with the aim of improving the country's quality of the horses, thus allowing local breeding farms to remain productive and relevant in the years to come. This program has been in existence for several years and had over 800 coverings during 2018.</p><p><strong>How does Al Shaqab ensure the highest standards in horse welfare? <br></strong>We are home to a state-of-the art equine hospital, a clinic, and a laboratory, providing unparalleled veterinary care to horses from Qatar and beyond. There is a separate breeding unit comprising 142 air-conditioned stables, ancillary service units, and paddocks for stallions, brood mares, young stock, and foals. Additionally, there are separate stable blocks for the dressage, show jumping, and endurance horses. Al Shaqab also boasts an equine hydrotherapy and exercise unit. Horses are exercised on a horse walker with an integral lunging unit in the center. A swimming pool, equine Jacuzzi, and treadmill also feature in the complex. Our horses are given five-star treatment.</p><p><strong>What are the next steps of Al Shaqab in 2020? <br></strong>Al Shaqab's continued success is a testament to the key role it plays in Qatar, connecting history, culture, sport, business, and the community. We continually build on our achievements over the past 27 years and will continue to nurture equestrian sport while upholding Qatar's equine heritage and tradition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main responsibilities of the QSL?<br></strong>QSL was founded by the Qatar Football Association (QFA) in 2008 to become the domestic professional league with the highest international standards. Our purpose is to promote, develop, and support a professional football platform in order to bring all people together through a passion for game. In alignment with Qatar's National Vision 2030 and with the country's continuous efforts to promote a healthy lifestyle, passion, peace, discipline, and other values of sport, QSL delivers a professional league with over 450 professional players in 12 sports clubs. Our professional league is now called the QNB Stars League and was named Asia's second-best league in 2018 by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).</p><p><strong>How are you supporting and helping Qatari clubs to keep thriving? <br></strong>We are one of the first pioneers in football innovation. We invested a lot in performance and technical analysis to support coaches to develop our players and teams in the best way possible. We support coaches with analysts to help them interpret data and really bring the best out of our players. We are the first league in Asia and the second in the world to implement live analysis. These tools give coaches the possibility to read and to make instant decisions to strengthen our players, to work on their weaknesses, and to prevent injuries. Live analysis is a new tool that allows the assistant coach to watch the match on his tablet 20 seconds delayed, while simultaneously receiving specific short videos from the analyst. If the analyst detects anything significant, they can send that video to the bench instantly while the match is running in order for the coach to make instant decisions. We are also investing in training analysis, which is the next step. Training analysis is especially used for tactical training. Another area where we are pioneers in football innovation video assistant referee (VAR), which we have implemented fully since before 2017.</p><p><strong>How are you contributing to the creation of a carbon neutral championship?<br></strong>One of our commitments is to run a carbon-neutral professional league and to promote environmental sustainability, making QSL the first carbon-neutral professional league in the world by the end of 2020. We want to spread awareness on the environmental situation, take action, and send a message to the world that is now is the time to do something. Through sport we can mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change and global warming, and all together we can make positive change and a difference. We will work on recycling, waste management, and water usage and try to increase our renewable energies. </p><p><strong>What does the FIFA World Cup represent for your country and the QSL?<br></strong>Exciting times are coming. Football is beautiful, but it is also exciting to have the possibility and opportunity to work for your country to host the most amazing World Cup in history for the first time in the Middle East. It is an honor, as well as a responsibility. We have no doubt we will deliver, and it is an absolute honor for each and every one of us to be part of these exciting times. We believe everyone in the country and the region, in or out of football, will be part of making this happen. QSL is a major driver of the country's professional football. We set the bar high in terms of professionalism and what is really important is the legacy left behind it. We believe that QSL will be one of the main winners thanks to the event, especially in the infrastructure of the stadiums and the gained expertise of human resources, which are major benefits for the league beyond 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hat-tricks-galore]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the main purpose for the creation of Aspire Academy?<br></strong>The academy is one of the business units of Aspire Zone Foundation together with Aspire Logistics and Aspetar. Our core business is to identify talented athletes. We provide them with all training, studying, nutrition, and anything that they may need. We also provide accommodation through our on-campus dormitory. We have the Talent Identification Program that lets us survey all the schools, clubs, and sports institutions in Qatar. Children chosen go through three stages of testing and those who pass are selected for full-time positions at Aspire Academy. We contact parents, bring them to the school, and share the programs and the curriculum with them. Today, we have approximately 250 athletes enrolled at Aspire, starting from age 12. We have scouts as well who go around the clubs. As for our staff, our coaches come from 52 different nationalities. Our students are residents and citizens. If they are residents, they are eligible to participate for the national team. We used to give scholarships to internationals. There was some tourism in that. We do sometimes offer scholarships still to bring in competition for our athletes to practice against, but scholarships are now extremely limited. </p><p><strong>What is the objective of Aspire? <br></strong>We want to be a facilitator. Our vision is to be the leading sports institute in the world. We can achieve this by having the right people and putting them in the right position. We can provide the right support, especially with our facilities and in-house expertise. Around 70% of the national team comes from Aspire. Aspire also focuses on the development of personal skills. Beyond professional skills and education, we provide skills for their personal lives as well. They represent the country, playing as ambassadors for Qatar. We make sure they know how to deal with the media and be good public speakers, for example. </p><p><strong>How can a small country like Qatar produce one of the best football teams in Asia? <br></strong>First is having the best coaches from around the world. You also need players who are good examples and role models. Third is the use of the latest technology. We built a football performance center. We use technology there to improve performance, recovery, stress control, and other metrics for players. We can use the findings to improve a player's performance. We are using the best technology available. Injuries are one of the biggest problems athletes face. If they do not have a good recovery or access to professional medical staff, performances will not improve. We want to protect the players and make sure that they are playing their best, while improving their performance and skills every day. In the future, we have plans to offer places for girls here at another school. </p><p><strong>What is the relevance of hosting such an event as the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar for an institution such as Aspire?<br></strong>It is a blessing. It is the best tournament one could host, and it will be special for Qatar and Qataris. It will create a change for the country in terms of hosting events. So much development and change has come as a result. We are working closely with the football federations for 2022 and are trying to see what our role will be during the World Cup. We will play our part as much as we can with our facilities and expertise. We will provide extensive support from services, facilities, and medical services/care for injuries, surgeries, rehabilitation, and so on. Then there is the team, which is the product of Aspire. Some additional teams are following now, like for the Olympics and the U-18. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main areas of focus of beIN MEDIA GROUP over the last few years, and what are some of your main milestones as a company? </strong><br>Since launching our first beIN SPORTS channel in France in 2012, we have grown at an astonishing pace and across an incredibly diverse range of territories. It is amazing to look at our global footprint and influence—we now have major sports offerings in Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, and MENA, our home. As a group, we hold the single-largest portfolio of sports rights out of any broadcaster in the world. In recent years, we have also focused on providing our subscribers with the best entertainment content as well—be that through the acquisition of MIRAMAX in 2016; signing partnerships with leading studios such as Warner Bros. or the BBC; or commissioning our own original content drama series in Turkey. Our overall focus is to offer subscribers the best viewing experience in sports and entertainment. We are also the first broadcaster in MENA to offer 4K and are constantly enhancing our OTT platform, beIN CONNECT. In short, we are a hugely ambitious company, always looking to push the boundaries of technology and to lead the industry's evolution. I'm proud to say that we lead and not follow—not many companies can truly say that.  </p><p><strong>What does beIN MEDIA GROUP, as one of the main international symbols of Qatar, represent to the country, the Qatari population, and the Arab world in general?</strong><br>We are thrilled and honored to be a part of Qatar's success. We are a global media company operating in 43 countries across five continents, but Doha is the heartbeat of our company. Our absolutely world-class studios in Doha produce a significant amount of the content seen by our viewers across the globe, and Doha is home to our state-of-the-art facilities and expertise. We, therefore, represent and reflect some of Qatar's positive qualities: modernity, innovation, collaboration, and an overall mission to connect the world. </p><p><strong>We have seen a major threat coming from beoutQ, a pirate operation from Saudi Arabia broadcasting sports events. How has beoutQ impacted beIN MEDIA GROUP so far? </strong><br>As has been well-documented, in June 2017, overnight a variety of measures were unlawfully imposed against beIN in our biggest market following the blockade of Qatar, including an illegal ban on the distribution of beIN. These measures are being challenged in international courts. beoutQ was subsequently launched from Saudi Arabia and developed into the world's most prolific direct-to-home pirate broadcaster: Ten live HD sports channels distributed over satellite combined with an IPTV function; best-in-class set-top boxes with their own branding and marketing, tailored advertising, a sophisticated subscription model, and customer care services on social media. Further still, beoutQ pays for neither the rights nor production. As a rights holder, it is your worst nightmare. However, beIN has not given in or let the situation change our ambitions—far from it. We have led the global industry fightback. We have deployed every technical measure possible to stop beoutQ, including hiring the best anti-piracy experts in the world and bringing legal action wherever we possibly can. We have also been continuously working with the UK government, the US government, and the European Commission to ensure all legal broadcasters and entities in MENA and the world are protected. Piracy is the single-biggest threat to the global sports and entertainment industry. If rights-holders are not able to protect their intellectual property, the value of their sport or competition will be zero. Without a shadow of doubt, beIN is leading the way on this industry-defining issue, and we will continue to do so. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the FIFA World Cup 2022 impacting Qatar and its economy?<br></strong>Qatar recognized the potential of sporting events decades ago to not only diversify the country's oil and gas-driven economy, but also encourage human and social development, healthier lifestyles, and connections between the 90-plus communities and cultures that reside here. Sporting events in Qatar bring in thousands of fans, athletes, officials, and event and sports marketing professionals, who have a direct impact on local businesses and the aviation and tourism sectors. We have seen a steady rise in sports tourism since at least 2009, as well as new businesses opening their doors to service the developing industry. Qatar is not merely looking to 2022; it is investing for the future. We are building world-class sporting infrastructure: eight venues will be built for the World Cup, in addition to the Aspire Zone. More importantly, we are building capacity in the local skills market and developing a new generation of sports marketing and events professionals who will bid for, develop, and deliver Qatar's future sporting events.</p><p><strong>What are the plans for the World Cup stadiums after the event?<br></strong>Sustainability and legacy are at the core of our plans. A number of stadiums will have reduced seating after the World Cup, with over 200,000 seats being donated to developing nations after the tournament. In addition, the precincts around our stadiums will boast amenities that will benefit local communities after 2022. For instance, Al Thumama Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium will each host a branch of Aspetar Sports Clinic. The precincts will also feature boutique hotels, cafes, shopping centers, and commercial and communal spaces. </p><p><strong>All stadiums will be completed two years before the event. How will these stadiums be different, incorporate technology, and reflect Qatari traditions?</strong><br>Dreamt up by some of the world's leading architects, these are some of the most ambitious, visually exciting venues ever conceived. Each stadium takes strong inspiration from Arab culture. While some draw from the essence of Arab clothing, others absorb heritage, nature, and historic Arab architecture. For instance, Al Thumama Stadium takes its inspiration from the gahfiya, a traditional woven cap worn for centuries by men and boys across the Arab world. The “modular" aspects and cooling technology are the most thrilling and innovative elements of our stadiums. Seven of the venues have modular features, meaning they will have demountable seating tiers. The 40,000-seat Al Janoub Stadium, Al Rayyan Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, and Education City Stadium will reduce their seating to around 20,000 after the event. Ras Abu Aboud Stadium is completely demountable and will be repurposed into smaller sporting and non-sporting venues post-tournament. In addition to state-of-the-art connectivity and security technology, we are also installing cooling technology in stadiums to ensure their use year-round. Many venues also incorporate sustainable energy sources as part of our legacy commitment to deliver a carbon-neutral tournament. </p><p><strong>What would you say to any football fan coming to Qatar for the FIFA World Cup?<br></strong>Come to Qatar in 2022 and enjoy a new experience. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to explore a diverse and exciting region. The FIFA World Cup will be a family-friendly tournament, combining traditional Qatari and Arab hospitality with innovative fan and player solutions to ensure a unique experience for all. For sports fans eager to experience a vibrant new culture while enjoying a seamless tournament experience, Qatar will offer everything they could wish for. And the diehard football fan who loves nothing more than watching the games live will be able to watch two or more live games in one day, thanks to the tournament's compact nature. Our venues are no further than 55km apart, meaning you can soak up as much football as possible during the tournament's 28 days. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Dandy is one of the main dairy product producers in Qatar. What have been the main areas of focus, milestones, and products established by your company, and what is the current status of the retail sector in Qatar?<br></strong>Since 1973, our focus has always been our commitment to serving the nation with quality products. At Dandy, we have been working hard to gain the trust of every household in this region to supply high-quality and great value products conveniently available at an affordable price point. As a brand, we aspire to be an effective catalyst in helping people come together over the sharing of food. Our latest investments in state-of-the-art production and distribution facilities, as well as a large fleet of delivery trucks, has helped us to further diversify our product range across the dairy, ice cream, and beverages category while gaining large market shares in each category. Meanwhile, Qatar's retail sector is growing in terms of space but many consumers are in the low-income expatriate workforce and are price sensitive. It has been a great challenge for us to keep up with the price war by competition, while continuously improving the quality of our products.</p><p><strong>Since the blockade, Dandy has released new products such as Fresh Laban, launched a complete range of juices, and strengthened their ice cream portfolio. How did the blockade shape the strategy of your company?</strong><br>The blockade provided us with an opportunity to support the nation when it needed it the most. We took it as a national responsibility to ensure that Qataris did not panic or despair because of lack of basic grocery supplies in the early days after blockade. Immediately, the cost of importing the raw material and packaging material escalated, but we kept our prices the same and ensured our high-quality products were affordable for everyone. Our teams worked hard around the clock to meet the demand. Tasks, like setting up new machinery lines, were completed in a record number of days rather than months. We had been working towards revamping our brand with new packaging and launches since the start of 2017, but, due to the blockade, everything became fast-tracked, and we launched every possible product needed in the market in a short time. At the same time, we also introduced an innovative new product called Bon Bon, which immediately became a market sensation that provided the people of Qatar with joy and pride. In short, the blockade taught us the importance of leadership, self-sustainability, and planning ahead.</p><p><strong>Dandy has been exhibiting at the local Made in Qatar exhibition. How do you evaluate the potential of the initiative, its brands, and consequent products?</strong><br>The Made in Qatar exhibition has provided local businesses with a platform to showcase the capabilities Qatar has and shown the world that Qatar can become a major international exporter of products and services. It has enabled many businesses to start exporting, as well as importing, better-quality raw material and packaging material at better prices. </p><p><strong>What are some of the challenges for the company's international strategy?<br></strong>Logistical costs to faraway countries have increased due to our land borders still being closed. Most of our products are of perishable nature, and, therefore, exporting dairy and juice products are a big challenge for us. Still, ice cream is our main focus in terms of expanding our international footprint.</p><p><strong>What are your plans and expectations for 2020?<br></strong>We plan to further expand our product range and maintain our high quality, in order to gain more market share and become the single most-recognized household name in Qatar. This is possible only by satisfying the quality and affordability expectations of our consumers, the Qatari citizens who have been a pillar of our success and the expat residents who have made Dandy a part of their daily lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the main areas of focus where Hassad Food has been working on during these last years, and what have been your main milestones?<br></strong>Hassad is Qatar's premier investor in the food sector; in the last few years, we have been focusing on investing in key strategic investments both locally and internationally, to support the country's food security efforts.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the evolution of the food sector in Qatar over the last year?<br></strong>The local food sector has been growing even before the blockade, but it accelerated over the last few years, which resulted in achieving great progress in our self-sufficiency levels. Moreover, we have seen great improvements in the quality of local produce as well.</p><p><strong>What will be the exact role of Hassad in the new markets? Moreover, how does the establishment of these markets contribute to food security?</strong><br>Hassad established Aswaq, a subsidiary of Hassad, to be the main operator of the new markets, in coordination with the relevant government entities. By funding the development of the new central markets and managing it through Aswaq, we aim to create an efficient platform to support in sourcing the local produce and international imports to fulfill the needs of the producer, trader, and consumer. These three state-of-the-art markets will accommodate the current and future needs of the country, as they cover different regions of the country. Moreover, we have allocated a main activity for each market: fishery, livestock, or vegetables and fruits. We also included multiple sub-activities in each market to meet the needs of the consumer. It is worth mentioning that all three markets will be air conditioned to allow consumers to shop conveniently at any time of the year.</p><p><strong>What new technologies are you incorporating and how will consumers and the country benefit from these new developments?<br></strong>In coordination with our partners, we have launched Qatar's first pilot water-saving greenhouse at one of Hassad's greenhouses in Al Shahaniya to contribute to food production in Qatar using innovative technologies that will help produce high-quality and sustainable products. Once we implement the innovative water saving system and apply the tailored fertilizer recipes in the pilot greenhouse, we will be able to increase production by around 20 times of the average farm in Qatar and reduce the water consumption by 90%, which will certainly contribute to the local agricultural development.</p><p><strong>What will be the contribution of Mahaseel to the Qatari agriculture sector?<br></strong>Hassad constantly aims to support the private agricultural sector and not compete with it; thus, Mahaseel, a subsidiary of Hassad specialized in providing marketing and agricultural services to local farmers, was established at the end of 2018. This was done following deep market analysis to identify an effective mechanism to provide the needed support to the private agriculture sector. Mahaseel will provide marketing services for local farmers, as well as provide several other agriculture-related services, with the aim of easing the burden on local farmers, so they can focus on enhancing the quality of their food, increasing the quantity of their produce, and supporting Qatar in achieving self-sufficiency.</p><p><strong>What are the main goals and steps for Hassad for 2020?<br></strong>We managed to establish a great foundation over the past couple of years with our investments locally and internationally. Now, we are looking to grow and secure other investments in line with our investment strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the most recent projects completed by Nakheel?<br></strong>One of the major projects completed recently is the training pitches for the FIFA World Cup 2022. We provided 30 pitches in various locations around Qatar. The project was completed in May 2019, and many teams have been practicing on the pitches already. We have also completed four projects with Lusail as a main contractor. Moreover, we completed three projects as sub-contractors for The Public Works Authority (Ashghal), namely the East Corridor, Lusail Expressway, and Al Wakrah Bypass.</p><p><strong>What is your view on the opportunities for landscaping and beautification projects in Qatar?<br></strong>The government has allocated QAR5 billion (USD1.36 billion) for landscaping and beautification projects, and Nakheel Landscapes is one of the five companies selected by Ashghal as part of the framework agreement. We were awarded several jobs in 2019, and we expect more to come in 2020-2021. A huge amount of attention is being given by the government to greenery and landscaping jobs over the next three years.</p><p><strong>How do you expect this beautification work to change Qatar?<br></strong>Some QAR750 million (USD204 million) out of the QAR5 billion budget announced by the government has already been released into the market to various contractors. Ashghal has also announced it will plant 1 million trees and create 10 million sqm of green space and landscaping, other than trees. These are exciting and challenging numbers, but doable. It will take coordination between many parties and stakeholders, and Nakheel Landscapes is just one of the players who will be helping to deliver on these promises.</p><p><strong>What does Nakheel Landscapes have in mind for its growth over the next year?<br></strong>We are not expanding because we already have sufficient scale. We have completed QAR2 billion (USD544 million) worth of projects over the past three years alone. There was a bit of a slow period between when the major construction work finished and the landscaping projects were kick-started, but momentum is slowly increasing again. I expect us to start recruiting again somewhere in 2H2021-2022. We have been through this before at various times, like for the 2006 Asian Games. There will come a time when we need to expand our current team of almost 4,000 people, but that will probably be more towards 2H2021. We employ expert landscape laborers and hire from the local market on a when- and where-needed basis.</p><p><strong>What is Nakheel Landscapes' market position?<br></strong>We are ranked first by far. But there are many of players coming up fast. We are involved in hard and soft landscaping and infrastructure and have a team of considerable technical ability. These skills and services are not available among the majority of the typical landscaping competition, which puts us in a unique position in the market. Our business model sometimes works against us because we sit somewhere in the middle—Nakheel Landscapes is not a construction company, nor is it a straightforward landscaping company. Our particular business model with our capacity does not really exist anywhere else in the world. Landscape companies in this region are global leaders because here we are having to go against nature to create this environment.</p><p><strong>What environmental initiatives has Nakheel Landscapes introduced?<br></strong>Nakheel Landscapes uses the latest irrigation technology to save water and use water efficiently. We are active in planting indigenous plants that are native to the Qatari desert. We have 70-plus native plants that are all good for landscaping. We try to encourage people to use locally appropriate planting schemes. We are active in our social responsibility programs. We give away free plants from our nurseries. There are many projects being done now because when Qatar submitted its FIFA bid in 2010, the country promised major improvements in carbon emission percentages and standards. Many jobs are going toward that aim, and numerous environmental measures are being put into place. Indeed, numerous areas have been turned green over the past few months alone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Would you provide a recap of RC — Almana's past 12 months?<br></strong>The projects we have completed over 2019 include the Marriott Executive Apartments (Le Mirage City Walk) and the Dusit D2 Hotel. The Doha Oasis project is in its final stages and will be completed by early 2020. Meanwhile, the seven-star Banyan Tree Hotel is underway. The Doha Oasis owner has signed with Vox Cinema and Paramount as the theme park operator, in what will be the largest indoor theme park and highest indoor roller coaster in the world. We are currently building the Corniche Park Towers, which consists of three towers combining a hotel, residential apartments, and offices. We also have the Sofitel and Novotel projects and on DohaLive, a hotel and retail development complex awaiting the final stage design. We also began construction of the Lusail Commercial Boulevard project, a 1.3-km road with 18 buildings. This will be the 2022 FIFA World Cup Fan Zone for Lusail Stadium, so we have to finish it within 24 months. In terms of prospective projects, we are currently pricing around 20 tenders in the market and are focusing on getting more projects annually.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the current health of Qatar's construction and real estate sector?<br></strong>As contractors, we bid for all types of projects, including hotels, schools, hospitals, malls, and so on. Yet, many people approach us with hotel projects because we have done several known hotels before and have good experience in the area. Indeed, we built the Crowne Plaza Hotel and the Intercontinental Doha The City, among others. I am interested in hospital projects, and we have already done a small project for that sector. Additionally, I am keen on military contracts; we have just won a Defense Ministry tender. We are not affected by the challenges of the real estate sector because our business is different from that segment, as exclusively contractors. For contractors, there are less projects being tendered than before, but larger companies can still compete for the major projects. However, there are currently few mid-sized projects in the market, because there is a surplus of office and apartment space. Office space prices have fallen by 40-45% and residential prices by 25-30%.</p><p><strong>What is RC — Almana's role in the Qatar Green Building Council program? What environmental sustainability trends are you seeing in the market?</strong><br>We are actually one of the founders of Qatar Green Building Council and involved in the Lean Construction Institute - Qatar. RC — Almana is also working on educating and making programs such as LEED and LEAN more accessible for our staff, so they can obtain qualifications. However, we will need more time for green standards to become part of every development project in Qatar. But for the Lusail and Qatari Diar projects, it is a definite requirement. The Public Works Authority (Ashghal) is taking over most of the governmental projects; as such, it has started making sustainability standards mandatory in most of its new projects. As a contractor, the price implications of green standards should come as a requirement from the client. Certain environmental standards are already common practices, such as water usage, reduction of waste, and the recommending and using of alternative materials that are eco-friendlier and sustainable. But if there are specific green requirements on a project, it is a cost that the client should specify in their tenders.</p><p><strong>What are the next practical steps that RC — Almana wants to implement over 2020-2021?<br></strong>As contractors, our main focus is to finish and deliver quality projects, and to find new ones. Although many projects will be slated for completion in 2022, other projects do not need to be completed until thereafter. From 2022-2030, there will be ongoing projects to ensure job availability and that activity does not come to a halt after the FIFA World Cup 2022. RC — Almana is confident that projects will continue to flow in Qatar after 2022. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What factors led you to realize the potential of the construction sector in Qatar?<br></strong>Our passion for the real estate development and expertise in engineering and construction field led us to establish Ramaco. Ramaco is specialized in delivering complete construction solutions: design, engineering, construction, facility management and maintenance, in line with international standards. In the past few decades, the state of Qatar was a virgin land with potential for major development, making it one of the pioneer countries in the Middle East as well as globally. In addition, the development led Qatar to be one of the centers for business and tourism. The company's current focus is in Lusail Marina and The Pearl-Qatar. </p><p><strong>What is attractive about Lusail Marina?<br></strong>The city is a physical manifestation of Qatari future vision of sustainability and will be home to over 200,000 people. The Marina District promises to be the lively hub of Lusail, overlooking the marina and providing waterfront residential, mixed-use, commercial, and hotel spaces with large, open areas leading to the waterfront. </p><p><strong>What trends are catching up in the market?<br></strong>The market is currently tough, and the global economy is sort of going through recession. Nevertheless, our quality and prices are stable. The properties that Ramaco built and managed are at 85% occupancy rate, which is high considering the current economic situation. Eco-friendly and smart high-tech buildings are trending in the Qatari real estate market. Our towers in Lusail are built in compliance with all the latest requirements adopting modern technologies, software, and equipment such as BIM, home automation systems, and pneumatic waste management system. Our projects are among the few projects to be accredited the 5-Star Sustainability Certification. In addition, our towers offer high quality and luxurious facilities and amenities to the tenants, thus providing them value for the money they invested. Another significant trend and challenge in the market is clients' requirement to execute projects in a short duration without compromising on quality. This is in compliance with the country's commitment to be ready for the 2022 FIFA World cup. Ramaco is keeping up the pace and delivering on time to clients' satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Are you looking to continue partnering with other real estate developers?<br></strong>We already have partners and are providing real estate services to them; we have been working with Yacoub Jaidah &amp; Sons for more than 18 years. Meanwhile, we have worked with Danat Qatar for almost 10 years and have developed several projects for them. We are now developing and designing three compounds for the United Development Company. Initially, we were highly engaged in the private sector, and in the near future, we will be offering our services to government projects and other customers. Our doors are always open to people who appreciate our products. </p><p><strong>What is your vision for Qatar, the real estate sector, and your company?<br></strong>Thanks to the FIFA World Cup, 2022 is a great challenge, not only for Qatar but for the entire Middle East. It will be an enriching experience for the country and an opportunity to show how Qatar is evolving. The government has invested heavily in buildings and infrastructure, which is reaping benefits for the entire country. Qatar has a solid plan for the post-2022 period, and we are confident the economy will keep expanding under this plan. We are as optimistic as we were when we started from scratch in 2001. Under Vision 2030, the market will become more competitive and will open up more opportunities to foreign investors from across the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the effects of low oil prices for the construction industry and Medgulf Construction?<br></strong>Since January 2016, the construction industry has really suffered because of oil prices. For three years now, this has been a tough market, with few opportunities and many competitors. Everyone is working with low margins. The blockade also affected the market slightly. However, things seem to be improving. One of the toughest years was 2018. However, in 2019, Medgulf Construction landed large and mid-sized jobs. By May 2019, we had already met 60% of our annual business plan target. Most projects are in civil and infrastructure. The oil and gas sector is still slow, though it is expected to pick up in late 2019. Qatargas will build four LNG trains, which will open up many opportunities. In addition, there are other projects being tendered now for Qatar Petroleum (QP), Qatar Fertiliser Co. (QAFCO), and other big oil and gas clients. Those projects are forecast to come online in late 2019-early 2020. The outlook is bright, and we are upbeat and excited compared to 2017-2018. Many companies sank, though fortunately Medgulf stayed afloat. We did well amidst the market conditions.</p><p><strong>What particular opportunities do you see because of the World Cup and Vision 2030?<br></strong>The government is giving its assurance that there wii be growth after 2022. Most of that focus will be on tourism and manufacturing, which are sectors that the government is promoting. With the blockade, we looked at what we could do to be more self-sufficient instead of relying on our neighbors. Now, we are establishing a coating plant because we used to send our pipes to be coated in Saudi Arabia. Tawteen is the Qatarization program driven by QP, and, in 2018, it signed four MoUs, one of them with Medgulf Construction and our partner Wasco, the pipe coating experts. We are establishing a pipe coating yard here, and that shows there is a future beyond the World Cup. The government is also opening a free zone in Qatar, which has encouraged foreign investors to invest. There is a drive by the government to sustain this momentum and ensure there will be other opportunities, not just in oil and gas, but also free zone manufacturing opportunities. Qatargas' LNG project will take four or five years, so it goes beyond 2022. These projects bring many other opportunities with them.</p><p><strong>What is Medgulf Construction's growth forecast?<br></strong>Our business used to be 70% oil and gas, and 30% civil projects; in 2019, it is the opposite, with more civil and infrastructure jobs. However, in 2020 it will feature more oil and gas-related business because of the huge projects in the pipeline. We will tap into these, as we cannot do a full train but want to take packages. The only problem is foreign companies are bidding low due to their lack of knowledge about the Qatari Market.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you identify in coating and offshore?<br></strong>Our plan is to establish a pipe coating facility because there are plenty of pipeline projects coming up in 2020 both off and onshore. Those pipes will require either a concrete or epoxy coating. We will do the coating work at our new local plant. The plant's capacity will be around 150 pipes per day, with room for expansion if needed. Pipe coating was one of the opportunities QP offered under its Tawteen initiative to help make Qatar more self-sufficient. We have been trying to get involved in offshore work for the last three years, and Qatargas has just approved us for offshore tenders. Offshore work is not that different from our usual work; it is just the logistical challenge of getting our people and materials on site. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about your main milestones and achievements in the last 30 years?<br></strong>We deliver projects of various scales and typologies and have diversified teams of experts within their respective departments. We provide architecture and engineering design and consultancy services encompassing mechanical, electrical, structural, civil, infrastructure, and sustainability engineering services and architectural, interior, and landscape design services.  Our services cover the entire spectrum of building construction consultancy for the government and private clients regardless of the project's type or size. There have been certain major milestones in my career. When I acquired the firm, there were seven people employed at AEB and slowly, we built it up, reaching 600 employees now. We started small but with each tender won, we grew the team, and that lead to another job and more tenders.</p><p><strong>What has been the role of AEB in the construction of the Al Thumama stadium?<br></strong>The design proposal for the Al Thumama stadium was a design tender won in 2016. Since then, we have worked on the design and engineering of the stadium with firms from all over the world. We are the main design architects but have brought in international specialists for FIFA compliance and security. We worked with 15 consultants from around the world. Al Thumama is only one of the eight stadium planned for the 2022 World Cup, and it is currently under construction. We have a team of about 50 people managing the construction, controlling the quality and the time of the build. At the same time, we are busy with other projects.  We are doing hotel projects because hospitality is a booming sector now. As the city is growing, schools and cultural projects are also important, so we are involved in several cultural projects, whether it is restoring older buildings and rehabilitating them or creating museums. In addition to hospitality, education, and cultural sectors, retail projects are also major part of our current project portfolio. </p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the future needs of architecture and construction, and how it will change the panorama in Doha in the coming years?</strong><br>Things are changing rapidly, and the train is already running. With such a massive, state-of-the-art infrastructure, the potential to continue growing will remain, because with the best rail system and the best highway systems, the city can grow. It is easier to grow with such an infrastructure.</p><p><strong>What is your relationship with universities and young Qataris who dream of becoming architects?<br></strong>We participate with universities such as VCUQ and have an award of excellence that we sponsor. We have been doing this for the last 13 years. We like to participate in the community and give back. We train many students. Every year, we have internships, and this summer we have 20 people in different departments. Qatar University has a great school of architecture, and it graduates many young architects, so demand is growing because the country needs more architects.  </p><p><strong>What is your perspective on how architecture will evolve as a concept in Qatar?<br></strong>In the coming years, before the World Cup, I am expecting many things to change. There is an ambitious plan in the next few years to enhance the entire pedestrian and cycling walkways for all streets. Landscaping is becoming a focus for the years leading up to the 2022 World Cup, and big budgets are being allocated for such projects. The city will evolve to become a world champion, and that is extremely important. Designing and building sustainably has already become a law, so all government buildings have to meet certain criteria to be green buildings. The city will evolve in the next few years with all this infrastructure and smart technologies. The main stadium will also be state of the art. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the idea behind Just Real Estate?<br></strong>The company was established with a focus on brokerage services. We were then asked by a number of developers to promote and sell their properties. At the same time, others gave us their residential or commercial properties to lease. In light of these developments, we started focusing more on other activities to diversify our revenue stream. Other than leasing and selling, we are developing. We offer services as an advisor to develop land for landlords. If you have a piece of land, we can help through all the stages, from planning and approvals to hiring the right consultants and advisors, providing a marketing assistant and a sales strategy, and packaging it for clients. We offer a full chain of services. We also have a service where landlords give us their existing property to lease or sell, and we create a marketing strategy. We also develop sales strategies. We advise on how many units should be released, to which markets, and at what prices.</p><p><strong>What would be your advice to businesspeople in Qatar?<br></strong>People should also consider hiring, developing, and training the right talent if they are interested in real estate. One thing we are doing at Just Real Estate is mentoring and teaching the youth to become even better at their jobs. We want to be distinguished. In Qatar, spending time and money on training the right talent and rewarding it is the recipe for success.</p><p><strong>How are you adapting your products to fit your clients' needs?<br></strong>We can advise on where a better area is for our clients. We are not just brokers. I can pick out 10 properties for every client. The services you provide have to be unique. Moreover, it is crucial to invest in employees and develop innovative products. Many people believe that engineering consultants and architects are developers. That is not the case. For real estate, you have to understand what the market needs. Do people want bigger closets or living rooms? Are they looking for a bath or a standing shower? You have to study all of these things and become familiar with them. This will help assess the return on every investment.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the current opportunities in the real estate sector?<br></strong>The best villas in Qatar have high occupancy rates. One of the compounds we have is 95% occupied. We have 500 villas, of which we recently rented 140. Clients are looking for good financial offers; therefore, we have to act accordingly and present special offers. In recent years, rates climbed high and caused inflation, which affected the overall living standards. However, at present, rates are coming down. We will be looking at the office segment over the next few years. The residential market is currently meeting 100% of the company's needs. In line with our forecast, we expect real estate prices to decline in the near future. At Just Real Estate, we are focused on investing in well-designed apartments.</p><p><strong>How is Just Real Estate attracting international investors to Qatar?<br></strong>Since the new law on foreign ownership, expatriates are reacting, and foreigners are coming. Many people think demand will skyrocket after the World Cup, similar to what happened in Moscow. What's good about Qatar is that people adapt to change while maintaining their culture and heritage. They enjoy it without being forced into it. Moreover, the Qatari leadership and the Amir have done a tremendous job dealing with the blockade.</p><p><strong>Do you have plans to expand into any new markets?<br></strong>We are currently focusing on Turkey and the UK. We manage a property in London as a brokerage provider. We have seen huge interest from local customers who want to buy properties in London and Istanbul. We did well in London so far in 2019, and we hope to do the same in the future. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of your project in downtown Doha?<br></strong>As one of the foremost real estate developers in Qatar, Msheireb Properties is leading the 35-ha, QAR20-billion Msheireb Downtown Doha project. The objective is to transform it into an area that is rich with mixed-use developments. Ours is the first pure mixed-use development in downtown Doha. Moreover, we are developing the old city and introducing a new architectural language that is based on Qatar's history. Notably, the tents and batons we are using utilize our natural climate, where the wind from the north ensures a constant breeze between the narrow streets.</p><p><strong>What innovations are you incorporating in your downtown project?<br></strong>We have a focus on sustainability, and our project is in line with the government's goals and our country's Vision 2030. Soon, we will acquire 100 LEED certification from USGBC. We have incorporated solar panels to heat the water and generate energy. We want to make our city different from any other city in Qatar or the region. We are focused on smart solutions and are investing heavily in building the infrastructure of the future. We offer smart homes where you can control most of the features in your house through a mobile phone. Other than that, as a part of the smart solution, we provide daily, weekly, and monthly power consumption reports. We also focus on education and culture. We are converting four old houses into museums.</p><p><strong>What do you plan to open in 2019?<br></strong>We consider 2019 as the activation year for Msheireb Downtown Doha. Given the scale of the project, we divided it into six phases, and at present we are in Phase 1C. We opened our school, Qatar Academy Msheireb, three years ago and recently, in February 2019, we inaugurated the first Mandarin Oriental Hotel in the Middle East, as well as the Alwadi Hotel MGallery. The next phase will focus on the development of retail spaces; a number of shops have already been allocated and leased. We kept each space as an empty box so that every retailer can design the area according to their own identity. Equally important, we have completed our first residential tower, named Wadi 1, and have already leased 45 of its 72 units. The first residents will start moving in August 2019.</p><p><strong>Can you highlight the logistic connections of the development?<br></strong>We have the largest railway station in Msheireb Downtown Doha, which connects all three main rain lines. Our own tram system is also up and running. One of the most important features is the location of our development. Once the rail line is extended, Msheireb will be only six to seven minutes away from Qatar Foundation, making it extremely convenient for business people. Once entities from the Qatar Financial Center move to Msheireb Downtown Doha, we will try to bring back the financial hub, like it was in the old days. In terms of parking, we have space for over 10,000 cars. We are also building a service tunnel, dedicated to the loading and unloading of trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p><strong>How will the application of the free zones regulation attract foreign companies?<br></strong>We are attracting smart companies, especially incubators and entrepreneurs. We recently signed an MoU with Huawei to open an experience store in Msheireb, and we are offering a similar proposal to Samsung. We have been in talks with Apple and Tesla and are working on incorporating a Microsoft Experience Store to show how their products are helping communities. Under the Qatar National Vision 2030, Msheireb will become a part of the free zone map. We are focusing on IT companies, creative companies, and companies focusing on innovation and high tech. We have had great success so far: Monoprix is opening its first smart store, and HSBC is opening its first digital branch in Msherieb Downtown Doha. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>UDC is one of the leading public shareholding companies in Qatar. What are its main areas of activity?<br></strong>Since its inception 20 years ago, UDC has sought to play a key role in the development of a variety of industries. Our activities span numerous fields, including real estate development, property management, infrastructure, and utilities, as well as maritime and hospitality-related businesses. Across these various industries, we have focused on investing in long-term projects that contribute to Qatar's growth and provide positive shareholder value, such as The Pearl — Qatar. In recent years, the island has been the focus of numerous development projects that feature residential units, office spaces, retail outlets, entertainment facilities, award-winning marinas, and beaches. More than 350 retail brands are currently operating on the island, occupying more than 115,000sqm of leased retail space. By the end of 2021, we expect to accommodate close to 50,000 residents. UDC has recently completed numerous milestones in the ongoing development of the island. These include the construction of Al Mutahidah Towers and the delivery of 10 villas in Giardino Village, among others. These developments help serve a fast-growing population and an influx of tourists, all while initiating the development of our latest venture, Gewan Island, which will span 400,000sqm. Once completed, this new island will accommodate 3,500 residents and 3,000 daily visitors. The island includes a golf course, an air-conditioned outdoor Crystal Walkway, which acts like the island's spine, retail areas, entertainment facilities, a sports club, and a mosque.</p><p><strong>What are the most appealing sectors to continue diversifying your business portfolio, and how does UDC plan to penetrate them? </strong><br>UDC owns a number of subsidiaries that form synergies between a number of sectors, particularly the real estate market. These companies have expanded their operations in recent years to offer our clients top-quality services. These subsidiaries are Madinainova, which serves the needs of property owners and residents of The Pearl — Qatar. Then there is The Pearl Owners Corporation (TPOC), which acts as the manager of the co-owners associations. Our hospitality development company grows, owns, and operates world-class hospitality businesses on the island. Finally, Ronautica Middle East operates Porto Arabia Marina, the largest marina facility in the Middle East, with a capacity of up to 891 berths.</p><p><strong>Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which will require strong investments in real estate. How is UDC contributing to this?<br></strong>We believe that Qatar represents an attractive investment destination, particularly when it comes to the real estate sector. Qatar's attractive business environment, emerging tourism sector, and growing expat communities are fueling demand in the property market. All of these preparations are driven by a diversified economy and USD200 billion worth of investments in infrastructure projects. Qatar will host a large number of visitors, so it is important to build more hotels and units. We need to work with the committee to hammer out the details, but we are ready to host, and we have enough facilities to do that. UDC is also contributing to the promotion of Qatar as a leading regional tourism destination. </p><p><strong>What has been the international recognition of the project?<br></strong>In 2018, The Pearl — Qatar was named the best mixed-use development by the prestigious Arabian Property Awards. Moreover, the London-based International Finance Magazine named UDC as the best real estate development company in Qatar in 2018. In 2019, we added two prestigious accolades to our list of honors at The International Property Awards. These are the Best Mixed-Use Development Award for The Pearl — Qatar and the Commercial High-Rise Development Award for UDC Tower.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the year ahead?<br></strong>In 2019, we will pursue our development projects across The Pearl — Qatar to further enhance the ambiance of the island and attract new investors, residents, retailers, and visitors. We are also going forward with the development of Floresta Gardens precinct, Giardino Mall, and Gewan Island. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been Ashghal's role in developing Qatari infrastructure?<br></strong>Over the last 15 years, Ashghal has continued to enhance the development of efficient and sustainable infrastructure for Qatar. Ashghal's undertakings include a wide range of infrastructure programs being implemented across the country, which will deliver some of the largest expressways and integrated infrastructure projects providing new, free-flowing roads linking ports and logistical locations. The infrastructural benefits are already becoming visible through the completion and opening of some major expressway projects in recent years. These projects include Al Majd Road, a major contributor to the country's land transport and the current boom in internal and external trade, Lusail Expressway, with its iconic, award-winning arches 5/6, and Sabah Al Ahmad Corridor, which was launched earlier in 2019 and is currently underway. Our local areas infrastructure program continues to maintain the road and drainage network across Qatar through the development of infrastructure to serve residential areas. Thus far in 2019, Ashghal has completed over 125km of roads and awarded projects in several areas in Qatar, at a total value of QAR3.2 billion (USD878 million), to serve 3,090 land plots. In addition to upgrading and developing drainage network in various areas, Ashghal is focusing on the operation and maintenance of the country's road and drainage network, while ensuring the delivery of quality services in managing these assets. Furthermore, we are working with the relevant authorities to deliver essential public building projects within the healthcare and education sectors. </p><p><strong>What opportunities do you offer to the private sector? <br></strong>Ashghal is continuously tendering new projects for local and international companies to participate in. In 2019, Ashghal plans 55 new projects worth QAR18.8 billion (USD5.16 billion), which represents an opportunity for local and international investors and companies. In addition, Ashghal participates annually in exhibitions and conferences aiming to highlight its current and future projects and attract foreign companies to participate in them. In addition, we organize roadshows to brief interested and experienced local and international companies on related projects and their components. To encourage participation of local firms, in collaboration with Qatar Development Bank, we launched the Ta'heel initiative to rehabilitate and accredit existing national factories, allow Qatari manufacturers to help implement Ashghal's engineering and construction programs, and include national companies in our approved supply chain. Ashghal had successfully qualified 107 Qatari suppliers and approved 152 items to be used in infrastructure projects in various sectors by March 2019. </p><p><strong>What is the relevance of new technologies and innovation in terms of developing state-of-the-art infrastructure in the country?<br></strong>Through all our programs, projects, and services, Ashghal aims to promote best practices, encourage innovation, and adopt new technologies, focus on environment and sustainability, with utmost emphasis on health and safety performance to improve the sector and create a knowledge legacy that can be utilized and developed over the long term. Among ongoing initiatives, Ashghal is implementing building information modelling (BIM), a collaborative method for the design, construction, and operation of assets using 3D models and tools. Ashghal is pioneering the lean construction initiative at a large scale in Qatar, which brings more value for the customer and contractors. It also improves our project delivery performance. For sustainability, we promote crumb rubber recycling, using it as a modifier into asphalt concrete mixes for use in road construction projects. Recycled construction materials, such as asphalt waste, demolition waste, and iron slag, are also used for road projects to reduce the import rates of gravel and bitumen and the cost of projects. Ashghal uses approximately 60 million tons of demolition waste in its road projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the areas of focus for the Ministry of Municipality and the Environment and its notable initiatives during the past year?<br></strong>The past year has seen a concerted effort to advance agricultural production to achieve the desired food security which contributed to the success of the Qatari agricultural sector. Over the past year, the Ministry of Municipality and the Environment has launched several initiatives for private investors, including 10 projects for the production of vegetables in greenhouses with a total production capacity of 21,000 tons annually; four projects for the production of green fodder with treated wastewater with a total production capacity of about 17,000 tons annually; two projects to produce organic fertilizers with a total production capacity of about 12,000 tons annually; two projects to produce concentrated fodder with a total production capacity of about 50,000 tons annually; one project for fish farming in floating cages with a total production capacity of about 2,000 tons annually; and one shrimp farming project with a production capacity of about 1,000 tons annually. In the field of urban planning, the ministry adopted three main areas in 2019 in the framework of activating a comprehensive urban plan for Qatar and achieving its most important principles, by preparing a number of studies, the most important of which are: preparing the preliminary draft of the Urban Planning Law with the goal of completing the creation of an integrated urban system for Qatar; a national guidelines for urban design to improve the level of the urban environment, which aims to activate sustainable building practices by formulating national guidelines for urban design; and preparing and adopting the National Housing Strategy in Qatar project, with the aim of promoting access to adequate housing at the right time and place for all layers of society and defining the real needs of the present and future, while protecting and enhancing the natural and historical environment. In the field of environmental affairs, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment has made many efforts, most notably: implementing the requirements of the international agreements signed by Qatar, the most important of which is the Paris Agreement on Climate Change; the participation of the ministry and many government and private agencies in implementing an initiative to plant 1 million trees; the implementation of the ministry's sustainable initiatives to increase the level of monitoring networks for the quality of air and sea water, as well as warning networks for radioactive pollution and oil pollution and the development of various emergency plans; protecting and conserving biological diversity in the national environment through projects to conserve endangered wild plants; and the continuation of projects to conserve globally endangered marine animals in the territorial waters of the country, including hawksbill turtles, whales, sharks, and manatees. The State of Qatar has also implemented the Karaana Lake project to rehabilitate and restore the area to its natural condition. Among the most important components of the project are three artificial lakes with a storage capacity of about 2.4 million cbm. Their function is to store treated wastewater coming from the Karaana treatment plant. With its clean water and greenery, these lakes constitute a new healthy habitat for wild and water life.</p><p><strong>Through the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, how do you assess the impact of the green vision on the economy and lifestyle in Qatar?</strong><br>As is well known, the green economy aims to convert to a low carbon economy and enhance the efficient use of resources by all economic groups and society. Ensuring sustainable economic and social growth is not possible without a comprehensive environmental vision that will lead to sustainable economic growth for future generations. The State of Qatar is also a founding member of the International Institute for Green Growth, and the ministry is currently working on a work program that includes preparing a national strategy for green growth in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major milestones of your company in Qatar? <br></strong>GAC Qatar was established 40 years ago and has worked closely with local partners since then. In the 1990s, we were a team of just 50 people, but the company experienced significant growth after it set up an oil and gas department and the oilfield base in Al Khor in 2007. We set up a depot in 2008 to store empty containers in response to the congestion at Doha Port and opened our main warehouse in Salwa Industrial Area in 2012. We operate six warehouses in the country and offer 26,500sqm of covered, temperature-controlled space, including 11,000 pallet positions. In 2017, we established our presence in Ras Laffan, the world's largest LNG export port. We were one of the few companies to offer full agency services at the port because we realized the potential of the Qatari market. This gave us first-mover advantage, and we saw a 70% increase in the number of calls we handled in 2018, much of which was directly related to Ras Laffan. We have continued to respond to growing demand for our services with the support of the authorities, for which we are grateful. GAC Qatar continues to invest in the country and support the national vision and the aspirations embodied by the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We have been active in sports logistics for many years now and have set up a dedicated team to gear up for this high-profile global event. We were the official logistics provider for the 15th Doha Asian Games and the 2011 Arab Games. Moreover, we have worked with the local organizing committee for the World Athletics Championship and World Beach Games.</p><p><strong>What do you identify as the biggest opportunity for GAC?<br></strong>The oil and gas sector in Ras Laffan continues to be a key focus area for GAC Qatar. As the world's largest LNG exporter, Qatar is increasing its export capacity by 43% and developing its North Field expansion project, adding about 32 million tons per annum of liquefied gas to the market from 2024. We have been developing the team and infrastructure since 2017 to support that growth. We also foresee a growth in the sports and events sector in the lead up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This is another priority for us—and a niche that we can fill. We have been involved in global and regional sporting events since the early 2000s and have strong experience in this field. The planned free zones will be a key enabler for both the country and GAC Qatar, giving us a unique selling point. These are positive developments for the country, especially for the logistics sector, and will attract foreign investments. </p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the quality of infrastructure in Qatar, especially related to the logistics sector?<br></strong>Qatar has undergone massive infrastructure investments in recent years, including the new city of Lusail, the Doha Metro, Hamad Port, the expansion of the international airport, and facilities for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Hamad Port is one of the largest ports in the Middle East and, once fully operational, will boast an annual capacity of 7.5 million TEUs. This will be supported by transshipment links by rail, sea, and road. Hamad Port will also play an important role in Qatar's diversification plan, as the multi-billion-dollar development offers not just expanded capacity, but also new, sector-specific capabilities. Alongside general cargo traffic, the port will handle a variety of special imports including livestock, automobiles, and bulk grain. It will also host a base for offshore and marine support vessels. We are confident the infrastructure sector will continue to improve and bring about more opportunities for the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been Hertz's major developments in Qatar? <br></strong>Hertz is a renowned name in the global car rental industry, and since Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we decided to tap another market related to sports management, tourism, and business consultancy. Right away, we were able to start building networks, referrals, and contacts. In fact, we have generated new sources of revenue since the beginning of 2019. Like every other market, we had to adapt to the market situation and cater to local demands. We participate in numerous events to express our strength and capability to transport and transfer staff, participants, guests, and clients. We want to display our expertise in this area and acquire referrals in the sports management field. To name a few developments, firstly, we managed the logistics and transportation requirements of the event catering to the exhibitors, management, staff, and press of Qatar International Boat Show (QIBS). We received an award from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry because of this effort. Secondly, we fulfilled the logistical needs of the Qatar Golf Masters European Tournament 2019. We celebrated the end of 2018 as the ground transportation provider of the first Qatar Balloon Festival. Our tagline “we're here to get you there" perfectly resembled our capabilities of handling such an event.</p><p><strong>What are the main trends impacting the car rental market in Qatar?<br></strong>Construction is the biggest sector in Qatar, followed by sports management and tourism. Demand for vehicle transfer is rampant these days. For example, we started to provide chauffeur services for tourists, even those who are on a transit. We are in the process of adding premium saloon vehicles to our fleet for business travelers. Moreover, we are planning to offer seven-seater vans for group tours, big buses for cruise visitors, and pick-ups for desert safaris.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the opportunities that the Qatari market presents to Hertz? <br></strong>Tourism is one of the areas we have started to tap. Qatar is slowly building its reputation as an attractive destination for leisure, entertainment, and retail. Doha Port will be one of the most important winter cruising ports with a number of opportunities for destination management companies to handle cruise visitors. Hertz Qatar will come in this picture as the first point of contact. Hertz drivers will provide tourists with a meet-and-greet service. To further improve our service, we are conducting trainings and workshops for our drivers.</p><p><strong>How will the 2022 FIFA World Cup positively impact the car rental industry? <br></strong>Everybody knows that the 2022 FIFA World Cup will be an avenue to stimulate innovation, promote positivity between Arab countries, and encourage sustainable development. The government is keen on forming more PPPs, thus, encouraging international investors and companies to invest in Qatar. This works in our favor as business consultancy is one of our target sectors. Another key sector for us is sports management and marketing. Our third target sector is tourism. Qatar's tourism sector is a promising market for investors and businesses, and we plan to maximize this opportunity.</p><p><strong>What potential for growth do you see in the B2B part of your business for the next two to three years?<br></strong>We need to strengthen our presence in the sectors related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup and develop partnerships that will boom in the pre-planning stage of this major event. We have started to sign new contracts with companies who recently started to operate in Qatar. Generally, it is hard to predict the market situation two to three years from now but the Qatari government's initiatives give us an indication that the next few years will be great for the sector. Hertz specializes in corporate leasing and fleet management solutions, and our comprehensive lease solutions provide efficient and cost-effective vehicle management. We provide tailored leasing plans and can combine professional fleet management with fixed-cost budgeting to free up our customers' time and resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the company's main areas of focus and activities? <br></strong>The company was established in 2016 with a share capital of QAR100 million. This capital was subscribed by 343 local Qatari shareholders, making it a private joint stock company. The capital was raised to purchase dry bulk carriers for transporting gabbro. Since its inception, the main focus of the company has been to become Qatar's largest owner of dry bulk carriers to primarily transport the majority of gabbro imported by Qatar. </p><p><strong>How did the embargo affect your operations?<br></strong>The embargo was a surprise for us. In fact, one of our ships was in the midst of loading gabbro from Fujairah in UAE when this announcement was made public. Another ship was carrying cargo from Japan to the UAE. The situation was bad because all our ships not only fly under the Qatari flag and are registered in Qatar, but also 100% owned by Qataris. I must give credit to our extremely professional team who not only resolved the company's above contractual obligations without significant damage but also shifted the fleet to international trading. Since then, we have been successfully transporting goods around the world, from the US to China and Australia. To date, we have globally transported about 4 million tons of dry bulk cargo.</p><p><strong>What are your goals and objectives for the years ahead?<br></strong>Recognizing our excellent performance and capabilities, Qatar Development Bank (QDB) decided to fund the company's expansion. So, in November 2018, we purchased our fifth ship, fully funded by QDB. In the meantime, our shareholders also approved to fund the company's expansion plan. Thus, the company entered into agreement to purchase two additional ships for a price of about QAR75 million. Both the ships will be delivered to us in June 2019. This will increase the company's fleet to seven ships and dwt to 483,522, thereby enhancing our cargo carrying capacity and boosting our revenue. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us more about your main milestones in the past year?<br></strong>Since the start of operations, we have handled more than 3 million TEUs and over 7 million tons of general cargo. This is a significant milestone considering that we have only been in operation for just under three years. This demonstrates that business going through Hamad Port is robust. Roughly 93% of all cargo that comes into Qatar moves through Hamad Port. We were able to hit these milestones relatively quickly, which is unusual because developing ports typically require longer periods for these kinds of milestones to be reached. The unjust blockade has, in some sense, helped us as the operator of the port because as the borders are closed, everything has to come via sea or air.</p><p><strong>What is the relevance of having QTerminals operating this port, and how is its participation reflected in these positive results?<br></strong>This is demonstrated by the fact that the shipping lines that used to bring in feeder services now bring in their main line ships, which are larger dedicated container vessels of between 8,000 to 14,000TEUs per vessel. In terms of general cargo, we are seeing larger vessels calling as well. We have direct calls from all the main geographical regions including China, the Indian subcontinent, Asia, Europe, and Africa. We also now have a direct service to Mogadishu and are growing our portfolio of major lines with nine major weekly calls now. The good news is that the equipment that was originally delivered to handle these larger vessels is now handling the vessels for which they were designed, instead of the smaller feeder vessels.</p><p><strong>What will be your cooperation with the free zones?<br></strong>There are a number of free zones being developed. For example, just north of Hamad Port is Um Al Houl, to which we expect to attract import/export business for companies setting up there. We are also in discussions to see how we can partner with the Qatar Free Zone Authority (QFZA). It depends on how the free zones are developed and structured. The free zone near us will be more industrial and will have chemical, manufacturing, and plastics. Although there is a waterway there, it is not as big or deep as the one at Hamad Port. We are looking at how we can assist in handling more product that requires re-processing and, once processed, handling the re-processed products as exports. It is early days yet, so we will see how it goes.</p><p><strong>What are the current areas of focus for QTerminals?<br></strong>We are currently developing Phase 2 (Container Terminal 2) of Hamad Port and have already placed the order for the equipment. In the first phase of the development, we are buying three new quay cranes and 12 new rubber-tired gantries (RTG), which are yard cranes. We have just completed the tendering and technical and commercial evaluation of the main works package and anticipate making an award to the preferred bidder in early December 2019. The manufacturing of the equipment is proceeding on schedule. We are looking at delivery in the middle of 2020 as planned. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Milaha is one of the main transport companies in Qatar, offering seamless supply chain solutions for a broad range of sectors. What has been the company's contribution to the logistics sector?<br></strong>For more than six decades, Milaha has been at the forefront of the shipping and logistics sector in Qatar, designing and delivering exceptional services in the provision of logistics, shipping, and ports. Milaha's experts have a lot of experience in offering a wide range of logistical services that include air and sea freight forwarding, clearing and cargo handling, as well as land transport and warehousing. In more recent years, several of our facilities have undergone complete refurbishment, which has been complemented by the introduction of cutting edge, technologically advanced, third-party logistics capabilities and services, uniquely designed to provide a solid foundation for Qatar's supply chain connectivity and ongoing rapid development. We are especially proud of Logistics City, which marks our entry into the field of cold chain solutions. Logistics City is a state-of-the art project with 400,000sqm of land; it is also home to Doha's first 3PL bonded warehouse.</p><p><strong>How did Qatar's world-class ports help cope with the impact of the blockade?<br></strong>For more than half a century, Milaha has been a major provider of feeder services within the GCC region, using its modern fleet to meet the many and varied needs of local importers and exporters. Since the blockade, Milaha has played a central role in ensuring Qatar's supply links and export capabilities by enhancing operations at Hamad Port through the inauguration of new shipping routes. For example, we launched a new feeder route that links Greece, Turkey, and Russia. This is a landmark accomplishment as it is the first service linking the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Another highlight was the launch of the first-ever container feeder service between Qatar and Iraq. Other successful projects are the launch of direct cargo services with ports in Oman, Kuwait, Pakistan, and beyond. Another particularly exciting development was the expansion of our operations into the African continent through the deployment of Milaha Explorer, our lift boat that supports marine platforms off the West African coast. At present, Milaha's container services calls at 12 ports directly and serves in excess of 20 more via its liner services that operate throughout the Middle East, Indian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, and Europe with a modern fleet comprised of fully cellular container vessels, ranging from 515 TEUs to 4,606 TEUs in nominal capacity. </p><p><strong>Milaha reported a 6% increase in net profit in H12019. How did the company capitalize on profitable growth opportunities and pursue sustainable cost optimization initiatives to achieve greater cost efficiency?<br></strong>In the face of challenging circumstances, Milaha has succeeded in realizing a significant number of important achievements through its innovative initiatives and projects. We are pursuing more cost-optimization initiatives, such as the recent implementation of a new digital system designed to improve current working efficiency and enhance our ability to offer clients innovative new supply and shipping services. Another landmark event was the 2018 deployment and integration of robotic process automation solutions to enhance our back-office operations. The new system involves the use of software robots and AI in the performance of administrative tasks and functions.</p><p><strong>What is the outlook for your company in the year ahead?<br></strong>Milaha's success has been built on its forward-looking strategies, and this will not change. 2020 is already shaping up to be an exceptionally busy year, as we build on our strong position as the partner-of-choice in both Qatar's maritime and logistics sectors. We will continue to develop and expand Logistics City and the Milaha shipyard, which is due for completion in 2020. Moreover, we aim to capture niche segments of the maritime sector, such as high-end yachts and sophisticated coastguard and navy vessels. Looking at 2020, Milaha intends to continue its operational expansion beyond the region, seeking to enter other emerging, high-growth markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to the company?</h4><p>GFT is a German company that was founded 34 years ago and went public in 1999. In parallel, Deutsche Bank was developing an internal hub for international projects in Barcelona. GFT saw the potential to run projects in Spain through Germany, later running the same projects from Spain to save costs. In 2001, Deutsche Bank decided to move its subsidiary to the market, which is when GFT acquired the subsidiary and entered the financial services sector. We were 300 people, growing locally while also supporting the growth of our international business. We decided to focus on banking, which is our expertise and thus certified many of our people and developed our knowledge of investment banking, growing from 300 to 1,000 people. From Spain we began the process of internationalization to Brazil, the US, and Mexico as well as expanding our operations into the industrial sector. Nowadays the GFT team in Spain is made up of around 2,000 employees, working for local and global projects in six locations.</p><h4>What services make up the majority of your global operations?</h4><p>Our core business is developing projects, maintenance, and consultancy. We accompany our clients through the process of digitalization with tools including AI, blockchain, and cloud technology. In the finance sector specifically, our focus is on clients adopting open banking systems with our help. Some customers have asked for more end-to-end solutions, which sometimes require partnerships. We are partners with the three main cloud providers:  Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services. Such partnerships are fundamental in our line of work as the majority of companies have such partnerships, creating a special relationship with the provider of a product or service. This helps to give a better portfolio to the customer.</p><h4>You had a global revenue of EUR412 million in 2018, almost EUR94.2 million of which came from your Spanish clients. What differentiates the Spanish financial market?</h4><p>From 2008 onward, there were many mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector. That process has yet to end; when it finishes, we will probably have five or six big banks. This makes dynamic movements in technology with the banks competing hard for customers. Santander and BBVA are two large international banks. Sabadell is now in process of internationalization, now in the UK and with a subsidiary in Mexico. This means that the banks cannot be seen as just local. Given our international footprint we support these banks globally.  For instance, we work for BBVA and Santander in Spain and Mexico. And for Santander also in Brazil. Size matters, so you can be more efficient. You are also able to access certain markets that you could not enter if you were smaller.</p><h4>How do you believe the traditional banking sector ought to evolve to tackle the rise in new players such as fintech companies?</h4><p>Despite the rise of fintechs, banks still represent size as they are based on legacy systems. However, that is set to change in the future. In the past, one of the KPIs was the number of branches, which is no longer the case. Fintechs decide which part of the cake the banking industry takes. This is only a slice, but it is very promising. If you can go to customers without a number of branches, employees and IT systems, then you can get the benefits without a huge cost. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are making a great deal of noise. The banking industry as we have known it will disappear, forcing banks to reinvent themselves for the future with technological changes happening, including open banking that works to personalize and adapt banking services to clients depending on their needs.</p><h4>How much are you investing in R&amp;D?</h4><p>One tenth of our budget is dedicated to R&amp;D and we have a team in Spain leading the global business development of the GFT Group. We also have a team working with fintechs and different partners since 2014 in our GFT Digital innovation Lab. We have won the testbeds award at the last edition of the IoT Solutions Congress. There, we showed a data streaming demo of a connected car in partnership with Google and demonstrated how we can use this car to get information and data to be used in different sectors, such as insurance, automotive, logistics, etc. We are able to manage the idea of an entire bank, being able to take care of everything but infrastructure. As well, we are leveraging our knowledge of new technologies to expand into new sectors. Moving forward, we are entering the industrial sector.</p><h4>Where do you want to go forward with your expansion?</h4><p>In our eyes, the two most promising sectors for future expansion are retail and automotive. We have a team working in Valencia for an industrial company in Germany that only builds robots. We also aim to help banks accompany their clients in their day to day journeys, by facilitating all their concerns related to finance wherever or whenever it occurs</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[ICV, ADNOC, and the Private Sector]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[yousef-al-nowais-chairman-managing-director-arab-development]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you walk us through the operating mandate of Arab Development and how your key services, areas of expertise, and portfolio within the oil and gas and water and power sectors have evolved since the inception of the organization?</h4><p>Arab Development first started in the 1980s and the primary area of focus was power; however, this evolved through time toward the energy sector. I come from an oil and gas background; this has been a beneficial foundation as it has allowed me to contribute and add value to the company. What is more, it granted me the opportunity to grow Arab Development into a respectable entity within the oil and gas sector. This is a sector that is close to my heart. I am comfortable navigating the vast segments of the industry and I am able to do business with diverse stakeholders. Even though the organization started many years ago, it is still very much relevant in today's economy. Throughout time, we have invested heavily in building competence, knowledge, and resources. We are very well positioned to help the private sector, especially ADNOC and its subsidiaries; this can be across varied specialisms and projects. As an example, we can assist in the services field or manufacturing. ADNOC is an integral part of the private sector and the economy of Abu Dhabi. Consequently, the leadership of ADNOC also recognizes the role that the private sector plays in helping them to achieve their goals. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber has made it clear that he would like greater collaboration and synergies to be created across the industry. He has also stated that he would like to find ways of improving the quality of key services and also finding ways to reduce costs. We must be careful about how we propose reducing operating costs in the energy sector as it is a highly sensitive industry. I believe that strategic investments create long term sustainability and resilience. Moreover, it is essential to deploy the right equipment and people. If operational problems arise, the consequences can be very grave. The same can be said about which partners you engage with. </p><h4>What are some of the primary criteria you use when engaging in strategic partnerships, agency representation agreements, and joint ventures both in the UAE and internationally?</h4><p>At first, we look at reputation; it is the most critical dynamic to me and many of my peers in the industry. If a person or organization lose their reputation in the UAE, it won't be easy to recover. A good track record is also essential as it shows reliability, while a company's financial position reflects its ability to deliver. Furthermore, a positive sign is the willingness of an organization to invest in new proven technologies that add value. These new technologies may improve operating abilities or enhance safety. This technology can be used to save time and money. Automation is a critical technology in the energy sector today. It is a positive sign if a company is deploying automation throughout its operations. Again, this saves money, time, and resources, which are some of the main factors we assess when selecting a partner. </p><h4>What role do you see Arab Development playing in helping ADNOC achieve its ambitious production targets?</h4><p>The best operational practice is for a company to deploy technology that optimizes and improves production. I think ADNOC's ambitions to increase production to 4 million barrels per day is a significant challenge. As a result, companies that are experienced in executing the work in the fields will gain traction. We have seen this already with the historic concessions agreements that have been announced at different periods over the last two years. Many of these companies have proven competencies working in challenging environments. What's more, it will be interesting to see how these companies cope with some of the rigorous operating environments here and how smoothly they can integrate new technology. ADNOC makes decisions quickly these days; it continuously adapts and overhauls procedures. Consequently, it also listens to what's going on in the sector. It has been fundamental for ADNOC to be pragmatic, especially considering the newer projects coming online. ADNOC's commercial department continuously meets with the private sector, such as the EPC contractors, and the vendors, to uncover what the issues are and how these can be resolved. There are some significant challenges, but at the same time there is a willingness for ADNOC to address these. Furthermore, the private sector needs to be in touch with the developments of ADNOC. What I have noticed is that the entire industry is receptive to working to solve issues collaboratively.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi's continued expansion of the downstream refining and petrochemical segment aims to unlock further value from production. In terms of scale and growth opportunity, what are your expectations for participation in this segment in the coming years?</h4><p>There is a major opportunity to unleash the potential of the downstream sector. The same can be said for gas as we are now investing in developing the sour gas fields. Ruwais in Abu Dhabi can become a significant hub for petrochemicals. In the past, we were perhaps a bit behind some of our neighboring countries in regards to petrochemical development.<br>ADNOC is trying hard to build capability in this area, with strategic alliances and joint ventures. This is excellent news as it has the potential to bring added value to Abu Dhabi. Enlarging petrochemical capability is only going to be plus. We have the gas, we have the refineries, and the organizations involved in downstream are already here. All the fundamentals are present. By developing these products, we can increase the UAE's export potential. This allows us to maximize the value of each barrel.</p><h4>The introduction of ADNOC's ICV program has driven change in the local market, particularly in regards to tender evaluation and contractor selection. What has been Arab Developments' experience working with the ICV program since it was first introduced 18 months ago?</h4><p>This is a topic that I have spoken about on several occasions. I believe it is one of the best things to happen to Abu Dhabi. What's significant is ADNOC accepting to change within six months as per the demand of the other companies. They keep improving the ICV by continuously fine-tuning it. ADNOC doesn't want the ICV program to be rigid. It knows that there must be corrections along the way. Like everything else, it's not perfect, and in the beginning there were some teething problems. In the past, it was not uncommon for international companies to come to Abu Dhabi and not engage local resources. What ICV does is that it ensures there is a better utilization of local resources, in particular, human resources. There is an abundance of human resources that can be utilized across oil and gas, with many young people eager and willing to build careers in the sector. These people can be trained in the engineering, operations, and commercial side of the business. Since the establishment of the ICV, there is now a backlog of work for some companies in fabrications, installations, and on. This is happening now because there is a presence of local engagement. There are visible areas where ICV cannot be applied effectively as perhaps it is not applicable for local participation such as; gas turbines or big machinery, motors. They cannot be manufactured here in the UAE, yet they are very sensitive areas. I believe these should be excluded until alternative solutions can be found. ADNOC should be willing to comprise on these areas. Overall, I am a big proponent of ICV, and I believe it has brought a lot of benefits to Abu Dhabi. It has led many international companies to invest in Abu Dhabi. It makes sense if you want to be regarded as a true partner of Abu Dhabi or the UAE, you must invest in it. ADNOC continuously looks at ways to develop and make amendments to the program. It has been very flexible, and its team has been diligent in carrying out this program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>QAA was founded in 1977 as the civil aviation college for the Gulf States. What have been the main areas of focus and milestones of the company? </strong><br>We aim to update our programs in line with the requirements and standards of international organizations. QAA has become more open to the outside aviation community thanks to events that were held in 2018, such as the Fifth Aviation Training Symposium and The TrainAir Plus Program. These events have also paved the way for other conferences and forums. We are also focused on partnerships with international organizations. QAA is a member of ICAO and the European Association of Aviation Education and Training Organizations (EATEO). In 2019, we attended a seminar on safety held by ICAO. We have introduced a number of programs over the years and the most important one is the advanced master's program in air safety management, for which we partnered with ENAC in France. Notably, the institution's name was changed from Qatar Aeronautical College to Qatar Aeronautical Academy in 2019.</p><p><strong>How does your institution incorporate the latest trends in the market? <br></strong>We coordinate with local authorities to prepare programs in line with the needs of the local market. We also design courses and programs that suit the training requirements of different clients. We also study the local market and try to reduce the cost of training in order to attract more students. At QAA, we continuously upgrade our infrastructure and fleet. Moreover, we import the latest equipment for both audio and video display to stay in line with the latest technologies.</p><p><strong>What is your opinion on the potential of Qatar as a hub of regional aviation?<br></strong>Qatar is one of the strongest candidates to become a regional aviation hub because its ports and airports, especially the Hamad International Airport, are some of the world's most modern infrastructures, designed to keep pace with international trends. A great development in this sense is Qatar Airways' expansion.</p><p><strong>What will be the role of QAA in ensuring that Qatar has the capacity to manage the increase in traffic related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</strong><br>QAA will play an important role in hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We responsible for training the human resources capable of handling the increase in flights. This includes pilots, air traffic controllers, and airport service personnel.</p><p><strong>What job opportunities are available for students graduating from QAA?<br></strong>There are a number of job opportunities for our students, and we are ready to provide the local market with the required specialists. Our aircraft engineering and maintenance students can also work in petroleum institutions after obtaining certain complementary courses. Our students have the opportunity to not just find good jobs in Qatar but also abroad.</p><p><strong>What are your plans and expectations for 2020?<br></strong>We have numerous plans and objectives that relate to the college's strategic plan, which will be implemented in the short and long term. QAA is working hard to introduce post graduate programs for all disciplines and implement the advanced program in the management of air safety. In 2020, we will also partner with other entities to offer coop programs. We are in discussions with a prestigious university to help develop our foundation department and the curriculum. We have our eyes on a number of projects. The most important one is the purchase of simulators for the meteorology and air traffic control departments. We are also working with a consultant to expand our campus in 2020. Notably, the first batch of our students in the advanced master's for aviation management will graduate in 2020. We are also in the process of making our security and passport program international. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been the impact of global trade wars on QR Cargo?<br></strong>Compared to 2018, we have continued to grow, despite global trade shrinking by 4-5%. There is much uncertainty in Europe right now due to Brexit, which is a major factor. Another major cause is the trade war between China and the US, which is really shifting the equilibrium. There has been a massive drop in exports from China to the US, and a number of Southeast Asian countries are now exporting more to the US to fill the gap. Fortunately, we are well represented in these countries, such as Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines. Overall, global trade is down, and airlines are among the first to suffer. With our network, we are present globally in all regions and that is the way to mitigate any of the risks and impacts of global trade wars. It is also one of the reasons we continue with our growth strategy despite the challenges with global air freight demand that we have seen throughout 2019. We remain resilient due to our flexibility and extensive network.</p><p><strong>What were the main reasons behind the growth of your company?<br></strong>Qatar Airways has managed to sustain its growth and is now the largest air cargo carrier in the world with a market share of 6.8%. We grew for two reasons. First is added capacity, as we received five additional Boeing 777 freighters in 2019. We now operate a fleet of 28 freighters, which makes us one of the largest freighter operators in the world. 2019 was extremely interesting, because we have managed to continue growing in a declining market. We have also grown because of the addition of our passenger fleet, which represents 50% of our tonnage. There is no notable change compared to 2018 in the distribution of volumes, meaning that Doha, our hub, represents 15-17% of our business. Cargo gets broken down here and repacked in full containers for the final destination. Innovation and digitalization are key factors to our growth as well. Through our digital initiatives such as e-freight and e-AWB, we are looking for ways to enhance and modernize our relationship with clients. Through understanding our customers' needs and adapting our offering to exceed their expectations, we are able to build our brand and business.</p><p><strong>How did QR Cargo increase its international operations?<br></strong>2019 was a year of tremendous expansion for us. We commenced freighter operations to Guadalajara, Almaty, and Singapore while also opening up belly-hold cargo operations in eight destinations globally and increasing capacity on several routes. As part of our transpacific freighter route expansion, we have added Hanoi as a new stop in 2019. The transpacific route benefits our customers greatly as it results in time and cost savings. The new order for five additional Boeing 777 freighters that we signed at the Paris Air Show in June 2019 will start arriving from April 2020 onward. We are currently handling 2.3 million tons with a number of workarounds at Hamad International Airport. This is higher than the actual cargo capacity that the airport was designed to handle, which is 1.4 million tons. Recently, we kicked off the expansion project, namely Cargo Terminal 2, which will boost the combined cargo capacity of both terminals to 3.27 million tons.</p><p><strong>What makes QR Cargo such a good cargo company?<br></strong>We are a customer-centric organization where each employee is focused on customer centricity and driven by the values of passion, compassion, and discipline. Additionally, we are extremely lean. This means that decisions are made extremely quickly compared to other organizations. All airlines fly similar routes, utilize mostly the same aircraft, and operate on similar schedules. So, the difference really is the people, and when you call Qatar Airways Cargo, you discover that the person who serves you is motivated to do good from the bottom of their hearts. We are in the people industry, and this is something we always remember. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of your achievements and milestones over the last 10 years?<br></strong>Qatar Executive was established 10 years ago and started its operations with a small aircraft, the Challenger 300, which was then superseded by the larger Challenger 605. It was a logical step as there was a lot of VIP travel locally and within the region that required this kind of transportation; however, with an order for 30 Gulfstream aircraft in 2015, we were catapulted into a new dimension. At present, we are flying the Gulfstream 650 ER, the largest, fastest, and most comfortable business jet. It is the crown jewel of our fleet. Notably, we were the first customer of the Gulfstream 500, and we received three of them in 2018. One exciting achievement for Qatar Executive in 2019 was when we made history with the One More Orbit team by beating the world circumnavigation speed record for any aircraft flying over the north and south poles. This huge accomplishment took place on a QE G650ER jet.</p><p><strong>How did the blockade impact your business?<br></strong>The blockade has been an interesting time for us. Not only has it re-directed our focus to outside the GCC, it has also presented opportunities for growth. This change in strategy forced us to rethink flight patterns as well, because there is still certain airspace that we are cut off from, which means we are taking a longer time to get to certain areas. However, because we have adopted the approach of leaving every charter where it lands, our fleet is spread across the world in an efficient way. We are able to use this dispersed fleet to better serve our markets. This is, interestingly, something we likely would have done anyway, because markets like Asia have the greatest potential. There has been a shift away from buying personal aircraft in some parts of the world, which presents opportunities for the charter jet business. </p><p><strong>What are the main routes that you have developed?<br></strong>The Asian Pacific, Russian, European, and African markets are all important. We have launched new sales offices in each of these markets in order to capture business there. We are putting boots on the ground so that we are closer to the clients. Operationally, we have gone through quite a transformation over the last two years and are working to make ourselves stronger and more functional. We are dedicated to crafting a new level of luxury.</p><p><strong>What benefits will VIPs get from flying with the new aircraft you recently added to your fleet?<br></strong>The first benefit is that they are flying in an extremely high-performance aircraft. At such a high altitude, it is highly important to create an environment within the cabin that is pleasurable for the passenger. As an example, the cabin altitude in our new Gulfstream aircraft when the aircraft is flying at 45,000ft is 4,200ft. This increased pressure means that when a passenger arrives at their destination, they feel far less tired. For a passenger who flies frequently, as many of our passengers do, this makes a huge difference in their overall health and wellbeing. Our passengers can take comfort in knowing that their personal schedule is being adhered to. We offer a great deal of flexibility and comfort by providing 24/7 expert flight support from pre-flight coordination to executive ground handling, catering, and landing permits. </p><p><strong>What are the main challenges that the 2022 FIFA World Cup will present to the private aviation sector?<br></strong>Since matches will occur in the same place but at different times of the day, traffic and congestion will increase. For perspective, on the first day of the World Cup in Russia, more than 650 business jet movements were registered. After the final, it was more than 750. We have to be ready to handle this volume of traffic as efficiently as possible. It will be a challenge, but one we will be well-prepared for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Which developments helped HIA become the fourth-best airport in the world? <br></strong>2018 was an interesting and successful year for HIA, fostering a culture of hospitality and innovation across all operations and bringing a new dimension to travel through unique shopping, dining, leisure, and convenience. We have expanded and diversified the F&amp;B portfolio at HIA by introducing new offerings that respond to the diverse needs of the modern traveler. We have also added more entertainment options, with a state-of-the-art golf simulator, which was inaugurated at the Oryx Airport Hotel as well as videogame consoles at Concourse C. The airport has successfully completed its first phase of the Smart Airport program and is currently testing the second phase, which will revolutionize the way passengers experience their journey at HIA. The second phase of the program utilizes facial biometric recognition technology at key passenger touchpoints. This will improve the speed at which customers cross these touchpoints, while simultaneously providing them with a seamless and enjoyable travel experience. HIA further improved its transportation services by adding two more transfer areas, bringing the total to four, which has increased its security screening capacity and reduced queuing time for its transfer passengers to under five minutes per passenger. HIA ranked the second best in the world in terms of on-time performance, with 85% of its flights operating on time according to OAG. </p><p><strong>What has been the role of the airport in ensuring the appropriate development of the Qatari economy? <br></strong>As an integral and vital part of the infrastructure, HIA has maintained a steady growth rate the past few years, in parallel with the local economy, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The airport stimulates the local economy by transporting goods and people. HIA handled 2.2 million tons of cargo in 2018, with an 8.4% YoY increase. We are constructing a new cargo terminal that will increase the capacity handled to 3 million tons per year. HIA served 34.5 million passengers in 2018, with more growth projected for 2019. </p><p><strong>How is the Smart Airport program changing the overall passenger experience? <br></strong>The Smart Airport program utilizes the latest innovations in the field to support HIA's goal of transforming the passenger journey. The program gives passengers the option to eliminate the need to use travel documents at various touch points by combining a passenger's passport, flight ticket, and facial biometric data into a single token that will take passengers from check-in to boarding. E-gate registered users will have their immigration process automated as well, which will greatly improve efficiency, passenger autonomy, and the overall experience. The first phase, which concluded earlier in 2019, implemented the self-check in and self-service bag-drop kiosks, which are currently fully operational. At present, HIA has initiated the trial of the second phase of its Smart Airport program, which includes testing biometric capabilities at self-check-in, self-bag drop, pre-immigration, and self-boarding gates. The trial is expected to end in the upcoming months followed by a period of implementation. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that international travelers spent USD776 billion in 2018 alone, and the aviation global market is expected to double every decade. The projected increase in demand is a tremendous opportunity for Qatar, especially considering that 80% of the world's population can be reached within six hours.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the year ahead? <br></strong>We are looking to expand our operational capacity to 53 million passengers. We have to overcome challenges that eliminate bottlenecks and improve overall efficiency. The airport's metro station will also be operational shortly, which will bring convenience to many passengers. Qatar will be hosting the 2019 World Athletics Championships, which will help us prepare for the large influx of fans anticipated for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Qatar Airways recently was recently recognized as the best airline of the year for a record fifth time. What are the reasons behind the growth of the company? <br></strong>The success of Qatar Airways is down to one reason—our customers are our number-one priority. We take into consideration every detail, no matter how small, in order to deliver a superior passenger experience, and that is why at the 2019 Skytrax World Airline Awards, we were awarded the highest accolade of 'the World's Best Airline,'becoming the only airline in the competition's history to win it five times.</p><p><strong>What have been your main areas of focus and milestones in the last few years? <br></strong>In the last financial year, our fleet continued to make headlines as we acquired 25 new aircraft. As of 30 September 2019, our current fleet comprises 203 passenger aircraft, 24 cargo, and 24 Qatar Executive jets. These additions have enabled us to expand our network, including exciting new passenger destinations such as Davao, Izmir, and Lisbon, along with new all-cargo destinations such as Macau and Almaty. We also continue to set the benchmark in the industry with the unveiling of our new economy class experience at ITB Berlin in March 2019. The new economy class seat—the rollout of which will begin in 2020—will ensure that our passengers arrive at their destinations feeling rested and refreshed. Our new in-flight dining experience 'Quisine' redefines the economy class service with a new retail-style tableware, a more diverse menu, and bigger portion sizes. Economy class passengers will also be able to enjoy improved connectivity, including up to 10 times faster broadband, larger screens, 19-degree recline system, additional legroom, dual trays, 13.3-inch, 4K widescreens, and a new fast-charging USB port. <br> <br><strong>Hamad International Airport was ranked as the fourt-best airport in the world at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2019. What is your opinion of Qatar's potential as a regional aviation hub?</strong><br>At the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2019, HIA moved up in its ranking to become the fourth-best airport in the world while maintaining its five-star status as the best airport in the Middle East for the fifth consecutive year and best staff service in the Middle East for the fourth consecutive year. Since beginning operations in May 2014, HIA has served over 175 million passengers, establishing itself as a major global air transport hub. Between April 2018 and March 2019, the airport served 34,938,250 passengers from 163 destinations. HIA has also started the second phase of its terminal expansion plans to accommodate 53 million passengers annually by 2022. Plans are in place for the construction of an airport city, which will provide significant future investment opportunities, including a free trade zone, an office and business complex, and hotels. HIA will also see the construction of a new cargo terminal to help accommodate the expected surge in freight traffic.</p><p><strong>What will be the role of Qatar Airways in ensuring that Qatar has the capacity to manage the influx of arrivals with the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</strong><br>Our state-of-the-art fleet continues to be one of the youngest and most modern in the industry. We receive a new aircraft on average every 13.5 days, enabling us to continue our aggressive route expansion strategy and provide our passengers with increased connectivity across the globe. This aggressive growth will ensure we have the capacity available to bring people from all over the world to celebrate the World Cup.</p><p><strong>What is the aggressive growth plan of Qatar Airways for 2019-2020 based on? <br></strong>Qatar Airways is still a young airline; however, the achievements we have made in this short time frame are a tribute to the commitment, drive, and perseverance of our staff and nation. I am optimistic that our growth will continue and that we will serve even more countries around the world. Gaborone, Botswana, Luanda, Angola, and Osaka will soon be added to our network. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>MoTC has recently published its key strategy on private sector participation (PSP) in the transport industry. What does the involvement of the private sector entail?<br></strong>The PSP guidebook was developed to provide a framework for implementing PSP projects in Qatar's transport sector. MoTC seeks to implement PSP projects where suitable to achieve efficient asset delivery and operations, thereby freeing up public sector finances, growing the local private sector, and attracting foreign investors. For the transport sector, a typical PSP project would be long term in nature, require significant investment, and have a potential for risk transfer to the private sector through a performance-based specification approach. The private sector also seeks certain assurances from the government that will make them confident about the cash flows that help in making the project viable. The government is already working to provide a clear legal framework and guidance for implementing PSP projects. </p><p><strong>How will the Doha metro transform the mobility in the city?<br></strong>Mobility is essential to all of society. It allows people to connect with places and shapes how we live our lives. A focus on people is central to mobility. Understanding how citizens and businesses make decisions and interact with transport and technology provides an opportunity to place the user at the heart of an integrated transport system. People and businesses make transport decisions as part of wider choices about accessibility, lifestyle, and connectivity. People are strongly influenced by practical factors such as the built environment, location, cost, journey times, and availability of infrastructure. The metro is playing a major role in influencing a modal shift by implemented initiatives such as Metrolink feeder services and on-demand ride-sharing services such as MetroExpress that provide easy and convenient connections to the metro network. The Doha metro is integrated with the bus network at major interchange locations, thereby facilitating seamless mobility. A friendly fare structure incorporating integrated ticketing, called Sila, will add to this seamless mobility by creating one ticket to be used across all modes of public transport and taxis. A surface journey across the entire Red line route from Al Wakrah to Lusail—which on a good traffic day would take about 45-60 minutes—can now be completed in 30 minutes in the comfort of an air-conditioned, state-of-the-art metro. The metro will be instrumental in changing travel attitudes and behaviors of citizens in Qatar. It is also linked with other light rail systems under development, such as Lusail Light Rail, Education City Tram, and Msheireb Tram system, providing commuters with options and connecting them to major hubs of education, work, and recreation in the country.</p><p><strong>Recently you have announced that 20% of public transport in Qatar will be eco-friendly by 2022. Why is it important for Qatar to increase efficiency in transport and make it more ecological? </strong><br>MoTC recently developed a detailed electric bus implementation plan (EBIP) that will provide the framework for a gradual shift to a fully electric public bus system in Qatar and the utilization of electric buses on key services during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. MoTC has engaged with stakeholder organizations including the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Kahramaa, and Mowasalat. EBIP also makes official the gradual transition of public bus and government school bus services to electric buses by 2030. Electric public transport is now a global trend that is imperative to provide environmental benefits. Qatar has a strong electricity grid with enough spare capacity to provide most of the electric bus fleet requirements. We also plan to use solar energy to provide power for the fleet. The electric bus implementation will promote Qatar as a global leader in clean energy mass transit and make it the first country in the world with a fully integrated electric public transport system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Peninsula is one of the leading English newspapers in Qatar. What have been its main areas of focus over the last few years?<br></strong>Since its inception in 1996, The Peninsula has assumed the responsibility of highlighting the issues of Qatar and its citizens and residents. Our top priority is focus on all sorts of local issues, such as economic, social, cultural, and political, as well as those related to expats. At the global and regional levels, we provide coverage of news and international affairs with dedicated pages for the Gulf, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This is to keep Qatar's citizens, residents, and institutions updated on current happenings in other countries. To achieve this, the newspaper has subscribed to several esteemed international news agencies and well-known media organizations.</p><p><strong>What are some of the major milestones of your organization? <br></strong>One of our most significant achievements is our ability to compete with newspapers that were established decades before us. This has enabled us to reach a wide readership in Qatar. We also cover economic and political events taking place outside the country, including conferences and inaugurations of several Qatari investment projects and ventures. The newspaper also has a distinctive website and special publications that provide more space for initiatives and activities carried out by some entities in Qatar, benefiting not only readers but also researchers. Based on all this, in 2017, The Peninsula won the prestigious Middle East Digital Media Award for its website from the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA). The newspaper has also been able to attract qualified cadres and establish partnerships with institutions in the public and private sectors.</p><p><strong>What have been the main reasons behind the success of The Peninsula? <br></strong>The most important factor behind the success of The Peninsula is its strategy that focuses on local issues without undermining regional and global issues that concern its readers. Good planning and a strong commitment to materialize plans chalked out for short and long terms are also factors behind our successful growth. The Peninsula believes in healthy competition and always strives to be the best in the arena. Other factors behind our success are our creativity and the innovative technologies that we have incorporated. </p><p><strong>What has been the impact of new technologies to the operations of your company?<br></strong>Social media has become part of the global media system and emerged as a strong force. It is different from traditional media because of its ability to transfer news quickly and reach any spot in the world without censorship. But social media is facing a number of problems. No code of ethics regulates its use or operation, making it difficult to distinguish between authentic news and propaganda. Nonetheless, everyone acknowledges the importance of social media. We provide news and media material on our website and various digital news applications and social media platforms.</p><p><strong>How will the launch of Media City impact journalism in Qatar? <br></strong>Media City will attract international media and create a wider space for the Qatari media companies. This will help the local industry exchange experiences and improve their quality. In addition, Media City will provide a sophisticated media infrastructure that will revolutionize communications and media services. It will have a positive impact not only on the press and media in Qatar but on the entire region. One similar example from the past is that of Al-Jazeera.</p><p><strong>What are your plans and expectations for 2019-2020? <br></strong>We will continue to provide the best content and service, and strive for excellence. We will maintain our position as the top English newspaper in Qatar, while striving for renewal and keeping pace with the local and international developments. Without going into details, we will maintain readers' loyalty to our newspaper and expand our reach to every reader in Qatar and beyond, by touching on people's needs and interests. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What encouraged you to focus on the health sector?<br></strong>Providing sustainable healthcare with better outcomes and cost-effectiveness is one of the key objectives of Qatar's national vision. The healthcare sector is fragmented, and it demands more innovation and digital health solutions like a central patient health record, virtual consultation, and telehealth. Although the Ministry of Public Health has been doing a great job in implementing the national health strategy, there are a number of challenges that we need to overcome to improve the quality of healthcare while maintaining costs. This can best be done through innovation and PPPs. This is what led us to establish Shoura, which is today known as a fast-growing company that provides technological solutions and consultation services. It is powered by an international network of partners that aim to accelerate the digital transformation in Qatar. An increasing number of corporates have realized the values and uniqueness we bring to the table. For example, we were the key partner of various consortiums bidding for TASMU initiatives launched by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</p><p><strong>Are you focusing only on healthcare, or are you working in other sectors as well?<br></strong>We serve other sectors and are not only limited to healthcare. Shoura is a master reseller of Governance, Performance, Risk, and Compliance (GPRC), the leading software for businesses. It enables organizations to implement corporate governance, continually improve their business performance, manage risk, and stay on top of compliance. It offers an easy way for organizations to address a specific performance need or take a holistic approach looking at a broad spectrum of solutions, including performance management, project and portfolio management, employee performance management, KPIs, dashboards, and analytics. In 2018, we won three projects for Qatar Development Bank (QDB), Qatar University, and Qatar Civil Aviation Authority. At Shoura, we either source the right solution from international markets or develop it internally. Notably, Shoura is the sole owner of Smart Communication and Analytics Learning Engine (SCALE), which bridges the gap between interactive voice response (IVR) technology and electronic medical records using HL7 protocol to help reduce the cost of patient care and provide significant insight into business performance.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you foresee in the coming years within the health sector, and what are the gaps?<br></strong>There are many opportunities that have not yet been tapped, such as data analytics, IoT, VR, and telemedicine. We want to bring healthcare services to patients for non-critical cases. Healthcare providers need to change their standards, regulations, and processes to speed up the adoption of technological innovations and scale them.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of Qatar's potential as a technological hub?<br></strong>Over the last 10 years, Qatar has established many entities to support technology, innovation, and incubation to develop and commercialize local tech-based products and services. Qatar also attracted multinational companies to participate in various tenders and projects and collaborate with local technology companies. For example, Qatar Smart Nation program is developing Qatar's ICT infrastructure to transform the country. We work on major strategies and projects with key stakeholders in Qatar to understand local challenges. We bring innovative thinking and a fresh approach that has been tested and validated in other similar markets. Our strategic partners and international experts are also our key competitive advantages.</p><p><strong>What main outcomes do you expect from QITCOM 2019?<br></strong>QITCOM 2019 has started to bring in SMEs like us and link them to big corporates. In 2018, we were talking about digital transformation, and now we have new digital trends. We are no longer talking about mobile apps but IoT, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and smart cities. Therefore, we have to change the mindset. There are companies coming in with different solutions, initiatives, and out-of-the-box thinking. I believe QITCOM is not only a place for showcasing solutions but most importantly, it is a platform for bringing all the stakeholders together in order to accelerate digital transformation in all sectors and achieve the vision of a smart Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been Vodafone's main areas of focus in the last few years, and what have been its main milestones and projects?<br></strong>We have achieved major strides in the last few years in terms of strengthening our core business as a fully converged telecommunications company. Our investments in building world-class infrastructure to deliver the best possible experience to our customers—more than QAR1 billion over the past two years—has gone toward the deployment of our fixed access network, IPTV, Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and 5G. To emphasize our promise of delivering a world-class experience, we rebranded our network to GigaNet and launched our successful GigaHome and GigaBusiness broadband services along with GigaTV, our premium entertainment service. Our customer-centric approach in revamping our product portfolio saw us move toward a simplified set of unlimited data plans. We also revamped our IT stack, which supports a greater number of integrations. These investments have enabled us to diversify our revenue mix, and our strategic focus is yielding strong results despite adverse trends affecting the industry. We are progressively realizing our commitment to bring world-class infrastructure to the country and contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><p><strong>What is the level of innovation that Vodafone brings to Qatar when it comes to 5G?<br></strong>We have invested heavily in delivering the state-of-the-art communications infrastructure needed to unlock the full potential of 5G. Our 5G GigaNet network, in just over a year since its launch, covers 70% of Doha and is continuously expanding. Our extensive 5G network rollout across Qatar enables this revolutionary technology to drive newer technologies such as AI, virtual and augmented reality, and automation for innovation in all sectors. These breakthroughs will fundamentally transform the way people in Qatar live, work, and stay entertained. Our vision for a Giga Society powered by 5G technology is one that will cement Qatar's position as one of the most digitally connected countries in the world. The accelerated journey toward adoption of 5G-enabled technologies will also position Qatar as a global industry leader. We demonstrated some of those technologies, such as AI, connected driverless vehicles, VR/AR, and connected, in our Giga Society model city during QITCOM 2019, the largest information and communications showcase in Qatar.</p><p><strong>What is the role of Vodafone in transforming Qatar into one of the most advanced smart cities?<br></strong>Deploying 5G technology for smart cities will propel Qatar's progress toward delivering the smart city transformation underway in Lusail City and Msheireb Downtown Doha. We are pioneering digital innovation that delivers these smart solutions and contributes to Qatar's vision of the knowledge economy by 2030. Our expanding 5G technology provides intelligent platforms and connectivity solutions to leverage 5G-enabled technologies such as IoT. Our NB-IoT network, launched nationwide in 2019, will propel companies to consider connecting things that would not have been viable with existing technologies. NB-IoT solutions targeted for smart city applications enables city owners to optimize their resources, increase their efficiency, and manage their operations through a variety of different applications like smart waste management, smart parking, and smart lighting, among others. We consider ourselves partners in Qatar's smart city evolution, and these advancements have already put Qatar at the forefront of the digital transformation.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals for 2020?<br></strong>We will continue focusing around four key pillars: strengthening and growing our core business, finding ways to simplify the way we work and the products we build, partnering with leading local and international brands as well as digital-native companies and bringing to market our own digital services and solutions, and continuing to generate long-term value in a responsible manner for our shareholders. These pillars will accelerate Vodafone Qatar's future development as an industry leader. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Qatar's ICT market is likely to reach USD4.4billion in 2021. What will drive this growth?<br></strong>As Qatar transforms itself into a knowledge-based economy that relies on the production, distribution, and use of knowledge and information, a strong and stable ICT sector is one of the key drivers of economic success. Within this sector, innovation and access continue to increase, and businesses are adapting accordingly to become as technologically advanced as possible. At MoTC, we execute multiple initiatives according to clear and well-planned strategies, including first and foremost the TASMU Smart Qatar Program, in addition to investing in the ICT industry to raise its contribution to Qatar's GDP, which stood at 2.7% in 2018. Revolutionary advances in technology are reshaping the way people live, work and relate to one another, transforming the way societies function and the way they are governed. Our market assessments indicate that cloud computing, augmented reality, virtual reality, and blockchain will play a vital role in the growth of Qatar's ICT sector. Cloud computing, for example, has revolutionized not only the IT industry but also how we work in general. Allowing employees to access to their organization's files at anytime from anywhere, cloud services are one of the main drivers of digital transformation. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud computing in an effort to become more agile, lower IT costs, and have the ability to scale. The worldwide public cloud services market is growing rapidly and will double in size by 2021, becoming a USD302 billion market. We expect the public cloud services market in Qatar to grow exponentially to reach USD112 million by 2022, with software as a service being the largest segment of the market accounting for almost 40% of the market. Smart cities are complex systems that depend on large data points generated by a set of devices, sensors, people, and software, and require high-speed network, high performance computational power, as well as immense storage capacities of cloud computing infrastructure. Cloud computing solutions will underpin and power most of TASMU's use cases to make Doha one of the most connected global cities. As part of our National ICT Strategy, we are also focusing on increasing use of ICT by SMEs through a multitude of initiatives. </p><p><strong>One of Qatar National Vision 2030's goals is to  ensure human development. What is MoTC is working on to make that happen? </strong>    <br>At MoTC, we relentlessly work to inspire and support all people in Qatar to gain the skills, knowledge and understanding they need to use ICT effectively and safely so that they can engage in the country's economic and cultural life. Our main goal is to support the development of a vibrant and capable ICT vocational and professional workforce in Qatar. We are keen on enhancing ICT readiness and usage of all members of society and businesses so that everyone can participate in building Qatar's knowledge-based economy. Specifically, Digital Society aims to ensure all people in Qatar have the skills and capabilities to use ICTs in an effective and safe way. The division's programs work to bridge the digital divide in the country by creating opportunities for the population that is at risk of digital exclusion to safely access, effectively use, and fully benefit from ICTs. Alongside that, Digital Society works with strategic partners to enhance ICT education and students' capabilities and skills, as well as carrying out studies to measure the impact of information and communication technologies on Qatari society and measuring changes over time. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main sectors where Goodwin is active?<br></strong>Our portfolio of products is diverse, ranging from glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP) planter pots to GRP pipes and accessories. These are not only normal-sized pipes, but also large ones as well, spanning from 0.1m to 2m. Further we have plans to extend our product line to anything that can be made with GRP, including electric boxes. GRP is more resistant, efficient, and does not rust. We can extend this to all kinds of products in Qatar. The vast majority of our business, 90%, is with Kahramaa and Ashghal. These companies are increasingly ordering products from us that protect equipment from external weather. We have internationally recognized certificates for the administrative quality and the health and safety of our products, which are compulsory by the government. The government is also helping Qatari companies create an industrial sector in the country. Qatar Development Bank (QDB) is facilitating all the processes and providing support.</p><p><strong>Is Goodwin looking to diversify its GRP production?<br></strong>In total, there are three main competing companies doing what we do in Qatar. We are constantly working to innovate our product lists, so that in the near future we will be able to create differentiated GRP products under our brand name. We are currently taking all the necessary steps toward achieving this goal. Currently, we are working on getting approval for our pressure-resistant pipes. We are planning and slowly progressing toward achieving our long-term objectives through product diversification and quality assurance.</p><p><strong>What are the efforts of Goodwin in order to keep investing in R&amp;D?<br></strong>The government has realized the usefulness of GRP products. Before, pipes were made from concrete and other substances that were easily corroded. With its non-corrosive property and long durability, the future seems to be bright for GRP products, though maintaining a competitive costing structure and keeping abreast of the new technologies and innovation in the market are the key factors that will make a difference between a good company and a great company. Thus, a good amount of our profits is invested in R&amp;D to ensure Goodwin remains a great company.</p><p><strong>What opportunities have the major sports events brought to your company?<br></strong>We have been associated with major contracting companies in Doha for stadium works that are under FIFA. We have worked for the stadium projects, namely Khalifa Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Al Rayyan, and Education City. These works are challenging, as they require a great deal of planning and coordination. At the same time, we are constantly pushed to deliver the finest version of ourselves each time. Finally, we are glad we had an opportunity to be a part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. It will be one of the many global events that Qatar will host in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been the impact of FIFA for Qatar, and what is the plan after FIFA?<br></strong>The impact of FIFA on the Qatar economy has been extremely positive; its projects form a major portion of infrastructure spending. We set up our seat manufacturing business because there was a need for seats in Qatar for the World Cup stadiums. We have set up manufacturing partnerships with companies that are leaders in their fields, which has enabled us to not only manufacture world-class products in Qatar but also bring them to market at a lower cost. That is the value creation we intend to provide to our customers. For all the products that we manufacture, there is a fundamental baseline quality that has to be top class. Our products are able to compete with the best in the world, and our state-of-the-art factories have been set up on par with the best in the industry.</p><p><strong>How will you maintain momentum after the World Cup contracts are completed?<br></strong>We are aware of the fact that the construction boom we are experiencing will not be sustainable post World Cup. We expect growth in the oil sector, for which we are gearing up. We also intend to shift from the construction sector to focus on manufacturing products where we can maintain a competitive advantage to be the market leader. Exports will be another major area for growth and will help us better spread the risk in multiple markets.</p><p><strong>What new production lines are you working on at the moment?<br></strong>We started manufacturing lamp posts and high masts in 3Q2019, and the machine for manufacturing crash barriers in collaboration with our German partner has been commissioned. We have a partnership with a British company for locally manufacturing explosion-proof doors for the defense and oil sectors. We also have a few other products related to the oil sector in the pipeline. In Qatar, We currently manufacture stadium seats, lamp posts, high masts, lockers and cubicles, slotted channels, road safety barriers, and explosion-proof hangar doors. Coastal's next focus area is on exporting its products worldwide. We have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the local demand and export. The government has been supporting us in establishing export channels and networks, especially QIDB, which organizes exhibitions around the world. We took part in a few exhibitions in Oman, Kuwait, Nigeria, Germany, South Africa, and Kenya, and there are a few more coming up. We have a special focus on Africa and Asia at the moment and plan to expand into Europe later.</p><p><strong>How is Coastal involved in innovative beautification projects in Qatar?<br></strong>Leading up to FIFA 2022, we have a fair number of beautification projects for public spaces around Qatar. We wanted the elements of the beautification project like benches, lamp posts, bollards, and others to imbibe the art and heritage of Qatar that visitors can experience. With this objective in mind, we collaborated with the Fire Station and Qatar Museum to launch a competition called Qatar Al Fann for local artists to design functional art for beautification projects that will subsequently be manufactured in Qatar. We held a few workshops for the artists to train them on design aspects. The competition is ongoing, and hopefully by end December the artworks will be delivered. We have a panel of judges to shortlist the designs that will be used for production. The competition theme is Qatari art and heritage, so it will have Qatari elements like sand dunes, the sea, and the art of Qatar. Our next step will be to export this to regional countries. There will be an exhibition in March at the Fire Station to showcase the talent of local artists. This would also hopefully encourage other private-sector companies to come forward with projects to support local artists. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give an overview of the company's energy mix?<br></strong>We seek to diversify according to two angles: geography and technology. Our assets today and those in our target markets are spread such that we can cover different geographies and technologies. Today, we are in Oman with other partners, working on a 2,000MW project that is the single biggest one of its kind in Oman. When that was commissioned, it represented over 30% of the grid. We are in four projects in Jordan, including Amman East, which is 370MW; Shams Maán, which is 52.5MW; and IPP4, which is 241MW. We are also constructing AM Solar and are trying to acquire the shares of AES. We signed the sale and purchase agreement and are in the process of obtaining the approval necessary for closing. Once this is done, we will own 16-17% of the grid in Jordan. In Indonesia, we are a shareholder of Paiton Energy, a 2,045-MW power plant that was our first investment in Southeast Asia, an extremely important market for us. We also have our ZEN investment in the Netherlands, which is a company we control and own 75% of. Currently, it has over 96MW. In April, we signed a SPA for four projects in Brazil for a total of 490MW. We will own an 80% controlling stake and hope to start construction of the first project by August 2020. Everything will be photovoltaic and bi-facial panels.</p><p><strong>What is the aim of the company?<br></strong>We have a target to reach 10GW in net capacity of the company's portfolio by 2026, of which at least 30% will come from renewables. We are looking for diversification in geography and are considering new markets such as Latin America. We are currently in Brazil but are in the process of evaluating different assets in that region. We are also seriously considering Australia and hope to announce at least one deal there shortly. We look for both greenfield and brownfield investments. Within our portfolio, we target both, as each have their own advantages and disadvantages. </p><p><strong>What main technologies are you using to obtain energy?<br></strong>Our main focus today is CCGT technology, which are gas-fired power plants. In terms of fossil fuels, gas is the cleanest energy. In addition, Qatar is the biggest exporter of LNG worldwide, and we have great relations with Qatargas and Qatar Petroleum. One model we are trying to adopt is the gas-to-power solutions, which we are working on now with our partners to adopt in different areas of the world. This is where we provide the full solution. We focus on all technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal, except for nuclear. We are also stopping our investment in coal.</p><p><strong>What role does Nebras Power play in helping the country transition toward a diversified economy?<br></strong>The company is majority owned by the government, and thus one of the pillars of the future economy of Qatar, diversification, will be through Nebras investing in international markets. Through that investment, being involved in different projects and geographies, and our expected growth and target of 10GW, we will be a sizable company and add value to the economy away from exporting oil and gas. We also participate in bringing technology to Qatar and having the know-how and investment in the international market. More importantly, part of our success is due to our 22% Qatarization, as we seek to develop Qataris in different sectors within the company. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of your recent operations?<br></strong>For the last year, our operation was focused on completing ongoing projects and following up the market moves. We had many discussions with our clients for upcoming projects and our expected contribution. Moreover, we were looking at every opportunity to expand our business portfolio through new business lines such as AI and big data.</p><p><strong>What are the main projects you are working on at the moment?<br></strong>We are continuing our work on our ongoing EPC projects and supporting the ongoing work for North Field Expansion FEED project awarded to our parent company (Chiyoda Corporation) with our up-to-date project know-how in Qatar gained through 11 years of operations here. Chiyoda Almana has also focused on brownfield areas and the maintenance and modifications necessary at plants. We engage in intensive studies regarding the best modifications and implement them in the most effective way. </p><p><strong>What support services are you providing to your global headquarters? <br></strong>Chiyoda was awarded the FEED Contract of the NFE Project, so as the local subsidiary of Chiyoda in Qatar and with our cumulative experience in the market, we give all the required support to our headquarters for the completion of the NFE FEED Project. In addition, Chiyoda (with Technip) was one of the three EPC joint ventures invited to tender for EPC works of the four LNG mega-trains of the North Field Expansion project. In this sense, Chiyoda Almana supports its headquarters in the tender preparations. Chiyoda Almana is aware of local market conditions, regulations, and ways of doing business. In this sense, we are able to provide a great deal of experience-based support and advice. In our business model, greenfield projects are typically taken up by our global headquarters. After completion, Chiyoda Almana takes care of operation support and upgrades to maintain optimum performance. We visit sites and determine the needs of the client and provide the proper services. Chiyoda Almana also has the great advantage of its global headquarters, which we can tap for its sheer expertise to differentiate us from other engineering firms in Qatar. </p><p><strong>Which clients is Chiyoda Almana currently serving? <br></strong>We serve QP, Qatargas, and QAFAC, among others. As we have strength in LNG, Qatargas is one of our primary customers, while QP and its associated companies have many other facilities that we provide services for. </p><p><strong>How is the project on the North Field progressing?<br></strong>This is being led by our headquarters, but we are involved in providing certain specialty services to ensure smooth development and provide essential data that allows headquarters to make more accurate estimates. </p><p><strong>How do you assess the business environment in Qatar for an EPC company such as yours? <br></strong>In the oil and gas sector, the major project is the North Field expansion project, with QP additionally planning a large petrochemical complex as part of this expansion. So far, clients are focusing on these two major projects. Luckily, we are providing support to the Chiyoda global headquarters, which is pursuing EPC opportunities on these major schemes. </p><p><strong>How has the market evolved in recent years, and what opportunities do you see going forward?<br></strong>Major projects are moving forward quickly, and we hope to see some big opportunities in 2020 to support these projects, which will be completed after five or six years. The four LNG trains are part of this, along with the petrochemical plant upon whose completion a significant increase of the brownfield market is expected. For the moment, we are focused on supporting these significant projects. Once they enter operations, further opportunities will arise that we are preparing for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Qatar benefiting from Total's new recovery techniques and technologies?<br></strong>Total and Qatar Petroleum (QP) are partners in two oil-producing assets in Qatar: Al Shaheen field, operated by the North Oil Company (NOC) since July 2017; and Al-Khalij Field, located on Block 6, operated by Total. In 2014, we renewed the contract for operatorship of Al-Khalij field for a further 25 years, and despite being a complex field, it still has potential for production growth. We expect to tap into this potential notably thanks to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and being leaner in our operations. For EOR, we are notably supported by our research team in QSTP-the Total Research Center-Qatar (TRC-Q). The industry is changing for the better through digitalization, which is a strong catalyst for a safer and more efficient operating model. The first step in digitalization is through data analytics, but drones and robotics are other potential next steps that promise to be exciting. New technologies will also help to improve safety in the workplace, optimize the maintenance policies, and save costs. Being an operator in Qatar is, therefore, both a privilege and a responsibility; we must continuously demonstrate our operational excellence and the added value that we bring to the state of Qatar.</p><p><strong>How will Total continue to develop the Al-Shaheen field?<br></strong>Al-Shaheen field has potential for production growth. As an equity partner, Total is supporting NOC in becoming a world-class offshore operator—notably through our specialized teams of geoscientists and development planners. Production at Al-Shaheen field is currently close to 300,000bpd, and we have conducted pilots for EOR techniques. What is key for Al-Shaheen is to keep drilling to increase production potential, which means we need new well head platforms. Last year, we sanctioned the first development project, and by the end of 2019 we should have made a decision for additional ones. We are also working to optimize the export scheme. Overall, there is quite a significant amount of capital expenditure associated with the development of the field, and we are aligned with Qatar Petroleum on the key targets and development plan. </p><p><strong>What is the future of the LNG sector in Qatar?<br></strong>Total has integrated its overall strategy with the expected changes in the global energy mix in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Accordingly, we foresee an increase in the demand for gas, as it is a clean and reliable source of energy for power production and limits greenhouse gas emissions. To accompany the growth in the gas market, you have to strategically position yourself to where LNG will be the most cost effective. Qatar's advantage is that it is geographically well placed and has reliability and efficiency in operations to scale. Total already has a strong footprint in the global LNG market, especially since we acquired the LNG business from Engie in 2018. Today, Total's portfolio is close to 40 million tons of LNG, which is quite significant, as it has placed it in the second position in the market. We have been developing strong LNG optimization and trading projects around the world and hope to be able to add North Field Expansion project in Qatar to our portfolio if we are selected as a partner. </p><p><strong>How will Total transition toward renewable energies?<br></strong>We are one of the bidders for the Kahramaa solar project in Qatar. Globally, Total already has built a significant footprint in the solar market, and through this project we could showcase our expertise. It makes perfect sense for Qatar to embark on this to diversify its energy mix and prove its commitment to reducing emissions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the role of NOC in Qatar's upstream sector? <br></strong><span></span>NOC has been entrusted by the state of Qatar with the operation and further development of Al Shaheen, the largest offshore oil field in the country and among the largest worldwide. NOC started its operations in July 2017, and the license is valid through 2042. The production potential is in the order of 300,000bpd, and continuous investment will be required over the coming years to sustain that level. </p><p><strong>What have been your main milestones thus far? <br></strong>The long-term stability of low-cost production is fundamental to NOC's success. Since taking over in the summer of 2017, NOC, with the support of its shareholders, has been able to put in place a major investment program focusing on several priorities: first, quickly restart drilling activities from existing platforms to manage the well stock and provide production potential. Second, design and initiate the fabrication of new well-head platforms. Third, jackets were installed in 2019 whose pre-drilling will start in early 2020. Fourth, take control of the integrity of the asset by delivering an extensive program of maintenance and inspection. Fifth, think long term by preparing the development of new areas and the addition of new processing facilities. And sixth, ensure that NOC continues to be a major contributor to Qatar's economy in terms of industrial development and value generation. </p><p><strong>Are you using new technologies such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR)? <br></strong>We are indeed investing in EOR programs, but also in 4D seismic and in digital technologies, to mention but a few. On the EOR side, we are industrializing a Water-Alternate-Gas (WAG) pilot initiated by the previous operator. We have also kicked off a pilot of surfactant injections to reduce the amount of residual oil left behind after the water injection. We are also conducting lab studies on several other technologies in addition to completing a vast 3D seismic survey covering 1000sqkm that will be the baseline for future 4D monitors, allowing us to the visualize the displacement of fluids and the variation of pressure within the reservoir. We also have a digital roadmap that is already providing results, such as the "digital asset," a system of 3D models of all the Al Shaheen facilities interconnected with smart documentation tools used to optimize maintenance of the existing facilities and design new developments and integrate them into existing facilities. </p><p><strong>What type of oil do you have in Al Shaheen? <br></strong>It is high-quality oil, though it varies across the field. The field is so vast that the API gravity ranges from 18, a rather heavy crude, to 35, an indicator of much better-quality, depending on where one is in the field and which reservoir you are looking at. With its large resource base, Al Shaheen has the potential to provide long-term supply stability for decades to come. And the quality of our crude makes it less technically challenging to process than others in the region. </p><p><strong>How are you implementing the Tawteen project? <br></strong>Our commitment to Tawteen is total, which is why we committed to developing 10 investor opportunities in a variety of domains, from mud engineering to drilling tools and manufacturing steel flanges. Come 2020, NOC will be evaluating tenders based on In-Country-Value (ICV) contributions to ensure that Tawteen's aim of increasing ICV from 15% to 40% is fulfilled. </p><p><strong>What practical steps will be implemented in 2020? <br></strong>There will be a fifth drilling rig coming to Al Shaheen sometime in 2020. We will be extremely busy offshore in 2020, installing three topsides on the jackets we installed in 2019 and laying two intra field pipelines. We will also start the fabrication of two additional well-head platforms, which should be delivered and put into production at the beginning of 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What were the reasons behind your excellent results in 2019?<br></strong>Striking the correct balance between our technical and investment income, in 2018 we had to make adjustments as a result of large claims from our re-insurance arm. We made the decision at the end of 2018 to run off our engineering and property portfolios in MENA RE, our reinsurance company. We focused on more profitable lines including casualty and liability. We changed our stance from top growth to bottom line driven. As a result, we saw positive figures in insurance and this proved to be successful in 2019. During the change, there is often a drop in topline revenues, though we made up for it by increasing our market share in Qatar and in our Beirut branch. We have a presence in the UK, though that is still pre-revenue. We will be ready to start operations by 2Q2020.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the potential of takaful in the market?<br></strong>There is always a market for takaful business, especially among the younger generation for individual retail rather than corporations. We are extremely proud of our subsidiary. Now, it is focused on general lines while we develop ideas as to whether we specialize in certain underwriting products down the line. While the principle is the same as mutual insurances in the West, with similar coverage, the methodology of calculation is different. This is what is attractive to people: the share of profit and risk. Now, Doha Takaful is a standalone company, with its own organization structure and capital.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the relevance of national insurance companies in Qatar?<br></strong>We are proud to have the trust of the largest strategic and important clients in Qatar—Qatar Airways, the Armed Forces, and Qatar Petroleum, to name a few—and we will be involved in their projects and expansions in Qatar. The national companies are there to support anything to do with national industry. The 2022 FIFA World Cup and its related projects has also been something of a success story for all national companies since the start. All infrastructure projects, the Qatar Rail project, and all the stadiums are insured by national companies. All national companies have enough support to cover all government needs. The Qatari market and national companies are always extremely attractive to partner with reinsurers. DIG only deals with A-rated companies and securities, including many Lloyd's reinsurers and its European counterparts. We have been rated A- since 2013. This is our main promise to all our clients as well as our main advantage; we do not go cheap, nor will we because we do not sacrifice our service or our promise.</p><p><strong>How is Doha Insurance transitioning toward offering digital solutions?<br></strong>It is always under development. Our company in Jordan develops all our in-house products and needs. We have seen growth in our online sales, applications, and the online portal. Customers can complete their claims online. Our computer authenticates photos to ensure there was no tampering or photoshopping. In addition, DIG is actively embracing automation technology, the latest introduction being a new software automated robotic system called Sanad. Across the business, we saw opportunities to turn manual, time-intensive processes with legacy systems into competitive advantages through increased efficiency, capacity, and output volume by leveraging automation. DIG is focused on the long-term digital transformation of its business processes. This platform was selected to enable our team of dedicated resources to build and manage their digital workforces. This helped with the rapid adoption of robotic process automation and opened new doors for innovation-led processes. The solutions were implemented for reconciliation and claims process and in record time too. We have successfully started with two divisions, claims and finance. Most of our claims are now handled by Sanad, and human interaction only comes into play when flags are raised. Hopefully, by the end of 1Q2020, we will have a clearer picture and likely roll out the program even further. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your overview of the insurance sector in Qatar in recent years?<br></strong>In 2018, we faced several flash floods that affected the financials of the insurance sector. This year is better, and we have seen improvements in almost every company, especially Al Khaleej, where we have seen excellent improvements in profitability. The appetite for insurance in the market, especially at the retail level, has increased. In the last 10 years, there has been huge downward pressure on the price of insurance, increasing premiums at the expense of profitability. The good part is that lower prices became attractive to new customers. Medical, car, and property insurance are also becoming more popular.</p><p><strong>With what do you associate the successful results of this year?<br></strong>Part of it comes from insurance, which is doing better, but it is also because of the measures we have introduced for claim management and writing assessments. The investment part has played a role as well. Insurance companies have two major lines of business: insurance and investment. The results have been much better than the last few years.</p><p><strong>Where do you invest primarily?<br></strong>We have a relatively balanced portfolio with investments in real estate, equity, cash and its equivalent, deposits, and bonds. Insurance companies to some extent can be the go-to for investors. One can invest in a portfolio as well as insurance.</p><p><strong>What main contracts have you been involved in over this last year?<br></strong>We write motor insurance, medical, life, and general insurance for engineering and properties. Some are growing fairly rapidly, like medical and life. There has also been a change in demographics that will likely continue, with people more into risk management, partially because they can afford it and because of their education level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your assessment of premiums when it comes to insurance in Qatar?<br></strong>The Middle East writes around USD60 billion of premiums, whereby penetration to GDP across the region is still short of 2%, compared to nearly 5.5% globally. In Qatar, insurance premium penetration to GDP ratio has grown by nearly 50% in the past five years to reach 1.5% in 2018 and is expected to match the Middle East penetration rate by 2020. An important reason for seeing such a low penetration level in the Middle East, particularly in Qatar, is attributed to the fact that the insurance sector is still highly dependent on the hydrocarbon sector. In that regard, we estimate that the oil and gas sector's direct impact on insurance premiums in the market is around USD500 million out of nearly USD3 billion, while the balance of USD2.5 billion is outside the oil and gas direct premium segment, but is impacted by the wealth of the oil and gas sector. It is in this space that insurers compete and where people can innovate, create, and come up with new ideas in order to open up the market and increase premium penetration to GDP ratio.</p><p><strong>Why is the penetration so low?<br></strong>There are a number of reasons, but we can look at them through two separate angles. On the one hand, there is GDP and its growth drivers. On the other is the numerator, i.e. the insurance premium and its growth drivers. The main GDP driver in Qatar is the hydrocarbon sector, which represents nearly one-third of overall GDP and contributes around 17% to the overall market insurance premium. Market insurance premiums are highly dependent on corporate business across various sectors that have been feeding the growth plans over the past 10 years and needed to achieve the 2030 strategy. Those projects required insurance types that are project-based and thus not renewable, such as engineering. On the other hand, renewable insurance types that are known to feed growth depend on demand created either by consumer need or by legislation to reduce market risk and improve business standards. We find that market demand is quite healthy in the large enterprises segment but can scale up in the SME and retail segments. Such growth can be a result of a momentum created by market forces but can also be supported and led by new legislation that is needed to reduce risk in areas such as property insurance—both commercial and residential—and professional indemnity insurance.</p><p><strong>Is there any particular growing sector you will be targeting in the upcoming years?<br></strong>The potential is definitely in retail and SMEs. We believe in being a customer-centric organization that focuses on ensuring the personal satisfaction of our clients. This is the core of our success and is where we focus when creating products, pricing our products, and expanding growth.</p><p><strong>How can Qatar regulate the insurance sector in order to avoid bad practices?<br></strong>First of all, we are insurance people, and, in the insurance business, we need to be generating returns to our shareholders based on our insurance business. The long-term sustainability of the business depends on the success of the core insurance operations. Thus, we focus on our technical underwriting profits before we focus on investment profits. This is where we may disagree with strategies that lead to the dominance of diversification over the core business. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will QSE keep up with its excellent results from 2018?<br></strong>In 2018, market performance exceeded 20%, and market capital increased by 24%. The company's dividend was 6.6%. 2018 was an excellent year for the QSE. The next challenge is trying to keep up this good performance in 2019. To achieve this, we are doing a number of things. One is to include more companies in the Emerging Markets Index and support these companies to reach their goals. We have completed a stock split that is aimed at increasing the liquidity of some companies and encourage investors to return to the market. We are also doing some education programs to provide expatriates with information about how to invest in Qatar.</p><p><strong>What benefits can expatriates looking to invest in Qatar expect to see from having access to the QSE?<br></strong>QSE is an alternative for investments when expatriates do not know what to do with their savings. We open up investment in the stock market for everybody in Qatar. What option do you have to invest as an expatriate in Qatar? You can go to the bank or simply invest through a fund. Hence, we are giving them opportunities with this new company to find alternative forms of local investment.<br></p><p><strong>How does investing in stocks compare with investing as real estate at the moment?<br></strong>Investing in the markets is a cash equivalent because you can liquidate your assets immediately through buying and selling. If you invest in real estate and want to get out, you cannot always find a buyer. Furthermore, if you are a small investor you cannot afford to acquire a large building or do a development. The only alternative is the banks, where the interest rates are very low. By comparison if you go to the stock market, hand pick your stock, and understand what you are doing, you will get better returns and good growth in your shares. Investors just need to open an account with QSE; this is how they receive their dividends. You also need to have a bank account in Qatar, but this is a requirement we are reconsidering currently. You can invest through a custodian, such as an international brokerage company.</p><p><strong>The economy is going through a process of diversification, with industry and food security booming. Are these changes reflected in the QSE?</strong><br>There are two sides to this. There are government companies that we would like to see listed as part of the country's privatization program, but there are also family-owned businesses in sectors such as retail, manufacturing, industrial, pharmaceutical, real estate, and healthcare that we will continue to work with. We are seeing a high degree of interest in the stock exchange from these companies and are very confident we can maintain our position as the second-largest exchange in the region. </p><p><strong>What are your main plans and goals for 2019-2020?<br></strong>Staying ahead is our plan. This includes all the things we are doing such as working to list more companies and products and studying the derivatives market. We need to keep fit to stay ahead, which we are doing by pushing all these new things in the market.</p><p><strong>What are the main investment opportunities in Qatar for international investors in the upcoming year?<br></strong>Industry, manufacturing, and agriculture are important sectors that we further have to build on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some milestones over your 45 years, and what have been the main areas of focus over the last year?<br></strong>Since its inception, Commercial Bank has focused on two main areas: consumer experience and innovation. The whole franchise has been built around these two areas. It is part of our support for the Qatari economy to bring in the latest developments in banking. For example, we were the first bank to introduce ATMs, point of sale machines, and credit cards to the country. We have also been a leading bank in tapping the international bond market. We have continued our focus on innovation, and in 2019 we won the Asian Banker's Financial Technology and Innovation Award for Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It all links back to consumer experience. Qatar has many expatriates who frequently send money abroad. We found that everyone wants speedy delivery and acknowledgement that money has been received. We started with main destinations like India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Philippines, and Pakistan, have now added Turkey, Jordan, the UK, and Europe, and will soon add Australia and Singapore. In most locations, the money is credited to the beneficiaries' account within a few minutes and the client gets a confirmation. This has been hugely successful for our customer base. This is all digital, which is what helped us win the award. It shows that we have built a world-class technology out of Qatar. We want to continue this trend. We have also launched contactless cards. With our reach and scale, we are really capturing the market. You can introduce a card, but if it is not widespread among outlets and merchants it will not really work. Therefore, we did a lot of training with a few thousand merchants. Our card can also be used on the Doha Metro. We are also the first Qatari bank to join blockchain. It is a consortium of 300 banks focusing on using blockchain for technology and around certain banking areas, such as payment and trade. The aim is to deliver a fully digitalized platform that is easy to use and efficient. Blockchain is going to change the way many things run. In banking, we are expecting a significant impact in the future, but we do not know exactly where or how. </p><p><strong>How do you assess the evolution of Qatar's banking sector over the last six months?<br></strong>Moody's upgrade of Qatar to stable in October 2018 was reflective of the fundamental strength of the Qatari economy. It is one of the strongest economies in the Gulf because of its dominant position in oil and gas exports, its budget surplus, and prudent fiscal and monetary management. In all aspects Qatar is sound. That reflects on the banking sector, which is well capitalized, has decent liquidity, and reasonable NPL ratios. We have also received positive responses from international investors to Qatari banks' bond issuances and incoming deposits. Investment will continue up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup and realization of the 2030 Vision. After the World Cup, there will also be LNG expansion.</p><p><strong>What will be the impact of splitting your stocks?<br></strong>Usually splits are meant to enhance liquidity, making it easier for retail investors to own shares. Spreading retail investor ownership and access to the market is always a good thing. It provides more diversity rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few large-scale investors. Over time, it will enhance the overall index.</p><p><strong>What initiatives do you have for supporting QNV 2030?<br></strong>Supporting Qatar's self-sufficiency projects, logistical infrastructure, and initiatives to develop its SMEs are all very important to us. We have a strong SME program in partnership with Qatar Development Bank called Al Dhameen and support QP's Tawteen localization program for services and industries in the energy sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The objective of QDB is to develop and empower Qatari entrepreneurs and innovators to contribute to the diversification of the Qatari economy. What have been the main milestones and areas of activity of QDB in recent years?<br></strong>QDB was founded with the main objective of growing Qatar's private sector and diversifying its economy. Since our establishment in 1997, we have been at the forefront of these efforts by working with thousands of Qatari entrepreneurs and enterprises. We have provided investment and guidance to entrepreneurs, start-ups, and well-established corporations, and have built a reputation for identifying promising investment opportunities. To promote the local private sector, we extend wide-ranging financial and non-financial support to entrepreneurs across myriad industries, including a series of initiatives to promote an entrepreneurial spirit and create start-ups. Our development schemes, such as the eco-friendly Jahiz I and Jahiz II initiatives, have empowered local SMEs operating across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, electronics, plastics, wood materials, as well as food and beverage. As the SME landscape grows ever more intricate and complex, we turned our attention to strategic partnerships to further support and empower local entrepreneurs. Our focus is on the market gaps: access to training and information, funding, and markets. In 2010, we introduced Al Dhameen program, our partial loan guarantee scheme in which we guarantee up to 85% of loans through our partner banks. The following year we launched Tasdeer, the Qatar Export Development Agency, to level the playing field for exporters. When we merged with Enterprise Qatar in 2014, our goal was to create a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs and SMEs. Today, our scope extends from ideation to market launch and export support. In 2018, we provided training for 3,000 beneficiaries, supported the development of more than 50 feasibility studies, and incubated over 200 companies. We have also supported 13 companies to start exporting, as well as engaged 26 companies in trade missions, identified more than 500 business opportunities for customers, and achieved QAR3.6 million in signed deals. Through Al Dhameen service, we have also helped 310 clients obtain guarantees and achieved QAR955 million in outstanding guarantees. We have also extended direct lending support amounting to QAR6.2 billion to more than 540 customers.</p><p><strong>QDB is working on the launch of business incubators specializing in sports and fintech. How do these sectors complement the diversification of the Qatari economy? </strong><br>The new incubation centers are dedicated to fintech and sports technology (sportstech) and provide support in every way possible to budding Qatari entrepreneurs who aspire to participate in transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based society. Powered by StartupBootcamp, the world's largest network of innovation programs, the Qatar SportsTech Accelerator hosted its first QST Demo Day in May 2019. This celebrated the graduation of the first batch of 10 international sportstechs that were accelerated in the three-month program. In 2019, the start-ups will be presenting solutions for the benefit of the sports industry using the most advanced technology available. The need for a robust sportstech industry is only going to increase as we approach the 2022 FIFA World Cup and will continue well beyond. Thus, the creation of Qatar SportsTech Accelerator will play an increasingly essential role both locally and globally in taking the sports industry to the next level. QDB is also planning to invest more in venture capital initiatives. In May 2018, we signed deals with six international venture capital firms providing QAR100 million worth of funding for Qatari SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been QNB's main areas of focus in the last few years at the national and international level, and what are its plans and expectations for 2020? </strong><br>While our aspiration is to become a leading bank in the Middle East, Africa, and South East Asia by 2020, our main focus is to pursue sustainable, profitable growth. Our aspiration and focus are underpinned by a long-term strategy that encompasses protecting our dominant position in Qatar and accelerating international growth organically and inorganically. Domestically, we continue to focus on maintaining our leading position by maintaining our market share and profitability in the public sector as well as our profitability from the private sector and individuals. We focus on four primary areas: utilities, transport, 2022 FIFA World Cup infrastructure, and real estate. In addition to these, we are supporting a number of private-sector initiatives to make Qatar more self-sufficient in food production, logistics, and manufacturing to ensure its long-term economic sustainability. Furthermore, international organic expansion was and is one of the cornerstones of QNB Group's strategy. Through expansion, QNB aims to diversify its earnings and risk. Our growing international footprint is largely in frontier and emerging markets. As we expand, so too do the opportunities across our network. QNB Group is present in 31 countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe, and it has continued to strengthen its contribution from previous acquisitions in Egypt and Turkey. In both these markets, we see further growth potential and a pickup in economic growth. In Asia, we have a branch in Singapore, which serves as our Asia hub, and a subsidiary in Indonesia, the largest economy in ASEAN. We are specifically targeting ASEAN countries, which are export-oriented economies that have exceeded global economic growth in the last two decades and are expected to continue to do so. Besides organic growth, we also continue to consider strategic investments in markets that enable us to expand our geographic footprint. We are very selective in our approach with regards to further expansion and look at targets in relevant markets with regards to macroeconomic outlook, banking sector penetration, growth potential and regulatory requirements, risk/reward, target quality, strategic fit, and price.</p><p><strong>Moody's Investors Service upgraded the outlook for Qatar's banking system from negative to stable in October 2018. How has the banking sector evolved in the last few years, and why did Moody's upgrade Qatar's rating? </strong><br>The upgrading of the banking sector outlook to stable reflected the resilience of the Qatar's economy and banking system. The rating agency also stated that country's banking sector profitability will remain stable with capital buffers remaining strong. This upgrade stems from the successful rebalancing of Qatari banks' funding profile. Moreover, the sector has continued to demonstrate sustainable and healthy growth, substantiated by high asset quality, strong capitalization, and high profitability. Nonperforming loans were low, at 1.9% of total loans in 2018, and returns to equity were high, at 15.3%. Banks comply fully with Basel III capital adequacy standards with a capital adequacy ratio of 18% as of the end of 2018. Strong supervision by the central bank and prudent lending policies will ensure that the strong health of the Qatari banking sector will continue in the future. </p><p><strong>How has the QNB rallied around the government's policies to make sure the objectives dictated in the QNV 2030 are accomplished and the economy is diversified? <br></strong>The strategic initiatives around QNV 2030 are focused on human, social, economic, and environmental development. The achievement of the QNV 2030 goals requires strong coordination among major institutions in Qatar, both public and private. As a financial intermediary, we view ourselves as a natural catalyst to nurture the growth of the private sector, specifically SMEs. QNB Group has continued to build on the successful launch of its SME unit as a one-stop shop. What's more, we have broadened our value proposition for SMEs to enable a seamless service to support them throughout all lifecycle stages. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>QCB faced a historic problem when the blockade began. What policy tools were used to defend the riyal and Qatar's banking system? <br></strong>Qatar's economy responded well to the initial disturbances associated with the blockade and overcame the negative effects before the end of 2017. The blockade was handled successfully by various policy measures taken by the government and QCB. To ensure price stability, arrangements were made to establish alternative supply chains for the smooth supply of goods. We rerouted trade channels and initiated fresh trade relationships with other countries to avoid disturbance to external trade. The government also provided the necessary support to the SME sector to set up domestic production facilities. New ports were commissioned and warehouse facilities were improved. The Qatar banking sector, the mainstay of the financial sector, has remained sound and liquid, part of which was because of the introduction of Basel III guidelines back in 2013/2014, which ensured a strong capital base for the banks. The pool of high-quality liquid instruments with the introduction of treasury bills and bonds in 2011 also enabled the banks to withstand the sudden liquidity pull back from the blocked countries. QCB has also set up an internal emergency committee to monitor the developments in various segments of the financial sector. Based on its assessment by analyzing high-frequency data on select financial sector parameters, the committee provided suggestions for policy measures that could be taken by QCB. In response to a withdrawal of funds by the blockade countries, liquidity management measures were taken by QCB and supported by the government and public-sector entities. A speculative attack on the currency was also warded off through the announcement of our firm commitment to the peg. Legal investigations were also initiated against banks involved in speculative attacks. With the return of confidence, the stock market, which declined in the immediate aftermath of the blockade, has also fully recovered. </p><p><strong>The recent upgrades and affirmations of international ratings agencies confirm Qatar's prudent management of its assets. To what policy move do you attribute this stability?</strong> <br>The government and QCB took a series of quick and proactive measures to tide over the aftereffects of the blockade, such that it had no lasting impact, and the economy rebalanced quickly in 2H2017. The government also took various measures to improve the investment environment, encourage local manufacturing industries, initiate self-sufficiency in diary and farm products, expand into new air and sea routes, offer visa-free entry, and enact fiscal reforms through expenditure rationalization, among others. These initiatives revived the economy and ensured more private-sector participation in the overall development of the economy. Indeed, QCB's active liquidity management has brought liquidity in the banking system back to complete normalcy, making the sector sound and profitable. Renewed international investor confidence also reinforced the stability of financial markets. QCB also proactively utilized communication channels to establish stability in the price of Qatari riyal within a short span of time. Thus, it is not one policy measure, but a combination of policies by the authorities that helped the economy prudently manage its assets.</p><p><strong>QCB has been recently working on a platform to support fintech. What is fintech's potential impact on the Qatari banking system, and how does QCB plan to regulate it? </strong><br>Fintech activities have grown exponentially in the global financial sector arena in recent years, and QCB is actively working on developing strategies to adapt to this changing horizon. Fintech can bring positive change to the sector, but also additional risks. It helps financial sector stakeholders streamline their processes to achieve more efficiency and faster delivery, in addition to facilitating communication with their customers to better understand their needs and enhance their access to financial services. Fintech is also known to increase the contribution of the financial sector to GDP, diversify the economy, and create new market dynamics, which is why we are formulating an approach to fintech that takes lessons from other major global initiatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your expertise in sports legislation?<br></strong>We also specialize in sports law, though we have not seen the same challenges in sports law; however, with the approach of the World Cup, we anticipate more points that will require legal action to settle. We will see legal changes emerging as sporting events start to take on increasing importance. We need to have enough legal practitioners in place to ensure we can satisfy growing demand. Qatar is preparing a specific law for the World Cup. This law will be applied for only a short period of time in order for Qatar to meet the specific challenges we might face in this area. This law will be for special occasions and applied only temporarily when such events take place. Eventually, we will take a few articles and make them permanent if it is determined that they are necessary on a longer-term basis. The main goal of this law is to take control and manage such events. Many people were treating this area in a laissez-faire manner, and the government wanted to take more control. It has done an excellent job in terms of sending legal practitioners to other major sporting events to understand how to navigate these issues.</p><p><strong>What impact will the new foreign ownership law have on new companies in Qatar?<br></strong>Qatar has been highly focused on trying to make things much easier. Foreign investors used to be allowed to have 100% ownership of companies, though there were certain procedures that had to be fulfilled to achieve this. It was difficult to reach this point. Now, however, certain sectors have 100% ownership without these requirements, which significantly helps the economy. Qatar has now allowed 100% ownership in areas where the country really needs international investment and experts. We have seen a great deal of improvements in these areas, and many companies are interested in entering these markets with 100% ownership. This law, however, does not prevent foreign companies from engaging in partnerships with local companies. Many foreign companies are also interested in the partnership route. The real domestic expertise comes from those Qatari companies that have been here for years. We see many JVs being established. </p><p><strong>What is the impact of the new exit visa law for improving the rights of employees in Qatar?<br></strong>There are many changes and impacts in these areas right now. This law will definitely help competition. Whenever there is freer movement of people, the market improves. Additionally, this is a key human rights matter that has to be put into consideration. It helps build trust between employers and employees as well help Qatar build trust with the international community. I have written a book on labor law that will be a comprehensive resource in both Arabic and English.</p><p><strong>Based on your experience, what legislation is currently lacking in Qatar?<br></strong>The first thing we have to understand is what we are missing. This is the most important matter in terms of understanding what we need to do to improve. We have already begun implementing changes in order to tackle and improve these issues. As soon as a new law or procedure is implemented, we have to give it time to understand how it will develop and what the feedback will be. We have to make these changes in a deliberate and considered manner. Foreign investors appreciate seeing a market that moves in a steady and predictable way, and this is exactly what we offer. This is why we improved our arbitration law in 2017 to help foreign investors and to make them trust the market and the economy of Qatar. They now have broader freedom to choose how a dispute will be arbitrated. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main areas of focus and milestones of QICDRC in the last year?<br></strong>2019 has been a busy year at the QICDRC. In June 2019, we signed a cooperation agreement with the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to allow both parties to conduct all or any part of arbitration proceedings at the seat of the other center. This close cooperation is a testament of our capabilities and will promote both the wider use of arbitration and mediation, as well as the exchange of information on alternative dispute resolution methods. Our growing participation in local and international conferences reiterates our determination to gain further exposure within the global legal community to solidify our position as a leading civil and commercial court in the region. In September, we returned to the global conference circuit for the third consecutive year as Gold Sponsor of the International Bar Association Annual Conference (IBA 2019) held in Seoul, during which we hosted a successful seminar on 'The Rise of Commercial Courts in Asia and the Middle East'. Notably, we pursued and achieved associate membership status of the International Consortium for Court Excellence (ICCE) by implementing an approved framework across several areas of court excellence. Our extended partnership with ICCE was an important step in fulfilling our role as a credible justice system for entities established in Qatar and those who do business with them. Overall, we continue to play an active role in Qatar as a specialized judicial authority supporting, among other things, the Qatar Financial Centre in its mission to attract FDI as outlined in the economic pillar set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><p><strong>What is the important role played by your institution in order to ensure the rights of international investors and companies in Qatar?</strong><br>Since our establishment, our mission has been to maintain an effective and rapid delivery of justice through an authoritative legal framework that helps advance Qatar's reputation as a trustworthy business and investment environment. With the number of companies registered under the Qatar Financial Centre reaching an all-time high of over 700 and total assets value exceeding QAR70 billion, we have steadily been able to position our court as an entity capable of meeting investor needs. As international companies and investors look to expand their work in Qatar, QICDRC is strongly positioned to demonstrate and maintain its assurance of a specialized and efficient legal system, which can be utilized in the case of civil and commercial disputes.</p><p><strong>How is your institution promoting the knowledge transfer, maximizing the experience of your interims? What is your new CSR strategy?</strong><br>Active knowledge-transfer with our stakeholders in academia, business and the public is a key priority in our overall strategy. As a leader in the legal field, we consider it a responsibility to establish and maintain strong exchange ties and further cooperation. We are also in the pre-planning phases for several exciting knowledge-exchange initiatives with the local academic sector that are part of our CSR strategy for 2020. As part of our economic and moral responsibility, we will institute regular annual educational events to promote youth development through discussion forum, informal luncheons, seminars, and awareness sessions.</p><p><strong>What are the plans and expectations for QICDRC for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>We will continue to work to gain recognition as a leading court for the resolution of civil and commercial disputes, bringing together some of the most revered legal and judicial figures from Qatar and the world, who are known for their independence, impartiality, and professionalism. We are confident that we remain well-positioned to continue to add to the development of Qatar's legal environment and lead regional efforts by spearheading a distinguished and innovative legal model for commercial and civil dispute resolution. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us why Tolaram group decided to operate in Nigeria and what businesses Tolaram has in the country?</h4><p>It is exciting to operate in an environment which brings constant challenge. There are number of reasons why we do what we do. It was the unique opportunity to build businesses that have the potential to deliver substantial value for all stakeholders. The flamboyant entrepreneurial spirit of Nigerians and ever-expanding work force makes it more attractive for businesses. In late 1990s Tolaram group decided to venture into CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) segment with Indomie noodles. After the success of Indomie noodles we have launched many other brands like Hypo bleach, Power Vegetable Oil, Power Pasta, Minimie Chinchin, and attracted lot of foreign investment in the country with the companies like Arla foods of Denmark, Kellogg company and Colgate Palmolive of USA. Nigeria has more than half of west Africa GDP and its population accounts for 20% of African population. This makes Nigeria one of most attractive markets in Africa. Today, Tolaram Group also operates in infrastructure, where we have the Lekki Deep Sea Port project and the Lagos Free Trade Zone project.</p><h4>What are the major trends you foresee in the consumer markets in West Africa and Africa as a whole?</h4><p>Urbanization is a trend that will continue in African market. African consumer will tend to move from a low-cost trend to an aspirational one. Ever expanding population of Africa is mostly young and it will continue to grow both in size and income. The long-term prospects for sustained economic growth and consumption are positive, which will lead to more information on available choices. Unfortunately, an increasing number of people in the region are suffering from the malnutrition and health problems arising from under-nutrition, such as deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. That is why consumers are increasingly looking for convenient yet affordable, nutritious foods that are manufactured in hygienic conditions. People are becoming more aware of nutritional aspects as well as health risks. This will result in higher standards in the fast-moving consumer goods segment; players that incorporate nutritional improvements into their products will be in a better position and will complement efforts that are being made by governments to improve standards of living. Another aspect increasing the options available to the final consumer will be increased intra-regional trade that is being driven by ECOWAS &amp; ACFTA.</p><h4>What are some of the main infrastructure challenges that consumer-packaged goods (CPG) companies face in Nigeria?</h4><p>Power generation is a huge burden on manufacturing companies. The absence of reliable grid power is a major constraint on the cost competitiveness of Nigerian products in both the domestic and export markets. To develop Nigeria through industrialization and export-led growth, it is important that we create an attractive investment environment that encourages investors to invest in power generation sector. Most factories are located in Lagos &amp; Ogun states and dispatching goods around the country has become a major challenge, given the long distance to be covered. It takes four days on average to drive a truck from Lagos to Maiduguri. As the economy has grown and consumption has risen, the ports system has become a major bottleneck and hindered expansion. We have also witnessed infrastructure challenges with regards to the diminishing availability of trucks. Logistics would stand to benefit significantly from upgrades such as a more efficient railway system.</p><h4>What are your expectations in Nigeria for the years to come within the sectors you are currently operating in?</h4><p>Nigeria's major GDP contribution comes through agriculture followed by oil and gas. In manufacturing sector Nigeria is still lagging behind and depends on lot of imports. We have invested heavily in the country in setting up manufacturing plants. Government is always very supportive with the policies to encourage manufacturing set ups. Recently we have invested more than 40 billion naira setting up Kellogg factory in Lekki. We are very confident with such investments and huge consumer base our businesses will thrive in Nigeria. We have been operating in the country for more than 30 years and we have ever-lasting commitment to serving our consumers.</p><h4>Would you give us an insight into the group's backward integration strategy within Nigeria?</h4><p>More than 90 million Nigerians live below poverty line and to serve bottom of the pyramid we needed to have cost leadership strategy. To do full backward integration of supply chain we did lot of investments which created lot of jobs and impacted communities positively. Such kind of investments need to have very long-term view which denotes our believe in the country and commitment to serve Nigerian consumers. Today we operate more than 20 manufacturing plants in the country and employ more than 15,000 Nigerians.</p><h4>What role did Tolaram Group play in the development of the Lagos Free Trade Zone, and what other projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>The Lagos Free Trade Zone is fully owned by Tolaram Group. Many industries/manufacturing plants are already operating in the zone. We are still in the process of developing 800ha of land in Lagos Free Trade Zone. The first phase is the industrial park, where we will be providing all the infrastructure and utilities for industries to operate. The second phase will be developing residential areas. Our Lekki Deep Sea Port project is a JV with China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) and next to Lagos Free Trade Zone. Anyone operating in Lagos free trade zone will have direct access to the port. This offers a lot of logistical advantages, which is why many companies are interested in establishing their manufacturing facilities in the zone.</p><h4>Tolaram is said to have a very strong culture. Many of your managers have spent their entire careers with the Group. How do you keep your people open to progress and change?</h4><p>It's true that we have a strong culture which is guided by our values. Diversity and inclusion are important parts of it. Look at how we handle partnerships and acquisitions, for instance. We have entered into a partnership with Asian, European &amp; American companies and we are open to learn from them. For one thing, we send up-and-coming managers of different nationalities to these countries. But mostly we need local talent — people with a deep-seated understanding of the mentality of each place, with a feeling for the man on the street and his consumer habits and preferences. A graduate from a foreign business school won't necessarily help us here. It goes without saying that their preferences and means are vastly different from those of consumers in industrialized nations. Every one of our employees understands what it means to their daily work and our culture is the glue that hold us all together.</p><h4>What role is Tolaram Group going to play in Nigerian economy in 2020?</h4><p>Nigeria is a country which imports a lot and have high unemployment rate. Agriculture is the one field where with less investment you can create more jobs. We have decided to go into Palm Oil plantation and cassava plantation in Nigeria. We have got 18,000 Hectare land in Edo state for Palm Oil Plantation. It will create thousands of jobs and save the forex to the country by reducing the import bill. The Nigerian government has set up incentives to help modernize and mechanize the agricultural industry. At the same time, our Lekki Deep Sea Port project is in progress. As we all know businesses have stagnated in Nigeria because of congestion at the largest port in Apapa. The eroded infrastructure and slow-moving nature of the port's operations have resulted in perpetual congestion, but the inefficiency is costing the economy significantly as container traffic to the port has dipped more than 30% in the past few years. Our Lekki deep seaport will make significant impact on Nigerian economy, once it's operational in next 24 months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What main trends will bring diversification to Qatar?<br></strong>We have seen faster decision-making and key strategic initiatives in Qatar over the past few years, and, despite the geopolitical situation, there is a great deal of momentum in the market today to create a more self-sustainable Qatar, especially in terms of who it trades and partners with. Qatar is working on diversifying its economy away from oil and gas. The first push for diversification comes from the new taxation policy, including VAT. Upon successful completion, we expect VAT to generate a good source of revenue for the country and result in positive spillover effects for the wider local economy. Second, we see huge potential in localization. Localization has also been supported by public procurement policies and by incubating local SMEs, including through Qatar Development Bank. One of the most sustained efforts has come from Qatar Petroleum (QP), particularly through its new Tawteen program, launched in February. It aims to add at least QAR8 billion a year in value to the economy, create thousands of high-skilled white-collar jobs, and help to develop SMEs. The third pillar is privatization to generate FDI and sustain local economies. We have started to create a framework for governments to subsidize small private investments so that small enterprises will feel comfortable and safe to invest. The fourth features digitization programs, such as digital economies and the “Smart Qatar" program. We have been working with local entities on developing and implementing Qatar digital strategy, including different initiatives and programs around the digital sector to enable new sectors to use digital platforms. The fifth pillar is internationalization, which we see a great deal of now. QP, Qatar Airways, Qatar Foundation, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), and many others are becoming more of an international brand, and, alongside that, are forming stronger trade agreements and new external partners.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the impact of the new legislation to attract FDI?<br></strong>Some 49% of FDI in the GCC is from the state. Since the new law, the government seeks to attract more FDI from private entities, especially by permitting 100% ownership, which is what most GCC countries are trying to do. Recently, in order to boost this initiative, we created a portal specifically for investors. It is a single-window system, which makes it easy and simple for people to find opportunities and buy real estate. To deliver these core capabilities, one needs talent and strong enablers around building talent. We see many discussions between our clients about leadership development and training at a senior level. Other enablers are more about funding mechanisms, and we have started to create easier ones. With PPPs, we have created a system of national investors that will step in and grant access to funding, which will enable those pillars to develop.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see coming up, especially in light of the 2022 FIFA World Cup?<br></strong>The World Cup will give Qatar greater recognition as a brand and a hub for sports. However, this is an area where we can do much more. We are now focused on beyond 2022 and what more can be done to make Qatar a global sports capital. There is also room for industrialization, which means creating local manufacturing or plants. Here, the challenge is on the demand side. We have 10-12 sub-sectors we could focus on, though we chose only some. Qatar is good in choosing a few things and making them gold. The soccer team is full of superstars, QIA is one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the world, QNB is the biggest bank in the Middle East, and Qatar Airways was named the best airline in the world. If we continue with that mindset and build new trade agreements, while focusing on the next few big things—and the World Cup or sports in general could be one of them—it will create a key branding position. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the core values and principles behind the success of your group?<br></strong>TARIQ AL SHAMLAN We are a corporate with a family soul. However, the family was never Al Shamlan only, but all our employees, suppliers, partners, customers, and stakeholders. Our success over the years has been a result of mutual efforts and sincere collaboration working and progressing as one solid family. We take pride in our employees who have been with us for many years now, and we do our best to preserve and grow them. In addition, we sustain long-lasting partnerships with our suppliers and customers based on honesty and transparency.</p><p><strong>What is the legacy story behind Marzooq Shamlan Al Shamlan Holding?<br></strong>MARZOOQ TARIQ AL SHAMLAN The holding is a 70-year-old family business started by my grandfather, the late Marzooq Al Shamlan, who was a visionary entrepreneur passionate about developing new businesses. His initial business was trading with watches, and he then started trading in power tools and other automotive garage equipment in addition to importing tires from the world's top brands. We greatly acknowledge the major role of our late uncle, Mohamed Al Shamlan, who took over in the late 1970s with a vision that still directs what we do today. In the early 2000s, he started a concept called Q-Tire, the first multi-brand tire shop chain in Qatar, and established two joint ventures related to warehousing solutions and cleaning services contracting.</p><p><strong>How did the family business evolve in the past years?<br></strong>Joe Lahoud Realizing that we had to change and evolve to ensure our continued growth, the family board decided to transform the group of decentralized companies into a unified holding. For this, a major restructuring initiative was launched in 2016 where the operating business units went through a modernization of their operating model and business dynamics. In addition, a set of shared services functions was created to support the operating companies with all their needs. Today, we have a solid group of companies with the right infrastructure, corporate governance, and professional people all set and ready to capture the future growth of our market and beyond.</p><p><strong>What is your expertise when it comes to representing strong international principles?<br></strong>TAS We have been partnering with premium German brands for many years now, including Bosch and Karcher. Both partnerships have lasted more than 40 years, and we continue investing to grow their market share. We create partnerships with our customers and suppliers rather than business deals. We are regarded as one of two oldest dealers of Goodyear in the Middle East, which has not changed since 1959. Hence, our relationship with our suppliers is long term. </p><p><strong>What are you planning to implement in the company?<br></strong>MTAS Now that the holding's infrastructure has been completed, there is only one way forward: growth and business development. The business basics are all the same, but our clients are different. We will start by upgrading all our information management systems and working on our digital transformation. We grew because of our customers, so the company will remain focused on the sole goal of being customer-centric. One of the major initiatives we are trying to develop is a strong customer relationship system. Today, we are in a situation where we have to sell, follow up with our customers, and subsequently retain them for life.</p><p><strong>What are the needs you have identified in Qatar that you could be serving?<br></strong>JL The strength of our group is that we cater to all market segments through our 150 multinational-brand portfolio. Qatar is yet to become a mature market and will still be growing and expanding even after the FIFA 2022 World Cup kicks in, as there is still much to be done. That is why we are always on the lookout, trying to identify the right partners who can cater to our market's future needs in line with our strategy to offer comprehensive solutions supported with premium after-sales services. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>With healthcare as one of your main businesses, what are the main companies under this umbrella?<br></strong>In January 2018, Allegheny International, a Philadelphia-based hospital, came here and started operating Doha Clinic, which has been around for a while. Healthcare is the backbone of our holding company. We have the hospital and clinics, two pharmacies, and a medical company that imports and exports medicine. We have Icon Medical, which started in 2013 and is for orthopedics and neurology. We also have West Bay Petroleum, which was established in the 1980s to import and export chemicals. We do a great deal of business with Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Baker Hughes. We are also in the hospitality sector with Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, which was the first hotel we invested in. It is a five-star hotel, unlike most Crowne Plaza hotels, which are usually four stars. We have a great occupancy rate, even though the hotels here are suffering from the blockade. We started a Holiday Inn as a four-star hotel, where Holiday Inn is usually three stars. We have excellent food and beverage offerings in both hotels, which contributes to the hotel revenue.</p><p><strong>What new business lines do you plan to open?<br></strong>By the beginning of 2020, we will open up a mall with a high-end Lulu supermarket. It will start operating after decorations are completed. We hope for this to open in April 2020. In terms of healthcare, there are plans to build a new hospital next to that mall. We own the whole plot measuring 1.1 million sqm. It used to be my father's farm. It is the biggest plot close to Doha, so we decided to develop it with the mall first and then the hospital, which will require three years, at least, to build. That will start in 2020. The whole project will be called Abu Sidra City. In 2019, we did not open any new businesses, as we plan to invest in the stock market, which is now picking up.<br>Do you see more opportunity of investment inside or outside of Qatar?<br>If there is a window of opportunity, we will go for it; however, at the moment, we will focus on Doha, as Qatar is a safe place to invest money. You will not get growth of 50%, but will always get growth of 8%. This is positive compared to the rates of interest you would get from a bank. In the medical sector, we saw growth of around 400% from 2017 to 2018. It is a sector that we know about and where we can succeed.</p><p><strong>How will the 2022 World Cup affect these sectors?<br></strong>Tourism picked up in 2018, as people want to know more about the country set to host the World Cup. We saw many Europeans coming to visit Doha, especially on cruises. Many people from Turkey and the UK want to come and visit, as they see Qatar advertised everywhere. There is a big integration now with Qatar Airways and the Tourism Authority, which advertise everywhere together. We have Trans Orient air services, which was the first business my father started in the group. The tourism sector is picking up. We see this through Trans Orient as many people are looking for packages and things to do in Doha. We started working on beach and desert experience packages as we have had many requests for this.</p><p><strong>What are your main plans and expectations for the year ahead?<br></strong>We are thinking about how we can benefit the most from the World Cup tournament and other exhibitions happening in Doha. The hospitality sector will definitely bounce back. Our main focus will be on the stock market, as we see an opportunity there. At the beginning of 2020, we will see many listed companies receiving a boost. The World Cup is coming, and the closer we get, the more occupancy increases. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main areas of activity and companies of Alfardan Group, as well as main milestones?<br></strong>When Alfardan Group's journey first started as a family business, it was at a critically transformative time for global and GCC economies. We diversified our portfolio and business across sectors, turned our pearl trading family business into one of the leading conglomerates, expanded across markets, and built a legacy of firsts throughout this journey. But most importantly, we learned to turn challenges into opportunity. At the core of our success lies our commitment to delivering best-in-class products and services to ensure the ultimate experience for our customers across various industries while abiding by international standards and best practices within the markets we operate in. Furthermore, we take pride in every initiative, event, and step, be it big or small, that empowers and equips our brightest and most innovative minds with the skill sets, the tools, and, most importantly, the platform to develop the seeds of their ideas into successful businesses. The very history of our group—and by extension our nation—is rooted in this entrepreneurial spirit, without which progress would not have been possible.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the strength of the Qatari economy, and what are the main drivers behind this favorable situation?<br></strong>Today, Qatar boasts an astonishing list of achievements and is considered a significant global player, from the sporting arena to the political front and economic development. Qatar has risen through the ranks because it has successfully illustrated the extent to which the national environment encourages enterprises to perform in an innovative, profitable, and responsible manner. Alfardan Group is a living example of these policies. We have benefited from Qatar's growth because it has been centered on a drive to encourage new businesses along with outstanding support to existing industries. As a group that places excellence as the guiding principle in all that it does, we have been able to raise the bar and introduce pioneering trends in several sectors of the economy.</p><p><strong>Where are the most appealing sectors and countries in which to continue diversifying your business portfolio?<br></strong>Our diversification plans are based on two main themes: a strong culture of innovation and a drive to fulfill the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030. This is why most of our activities meet the current needs of Qatar while simultaneously securing a sustainable high standard of living for all. Alfardan Group maintains a rich portfolio of leading companies, including Alfardan Jewellery, Alfardan Exchange, Alfardan Properties and Hospitality, Alfardan Automotive, Alfardan Investment, Alfardan Marine Services, and Alfardan Medical. We are continuously exploring areas that can broaden our role in the economy, as this will support diversification and create new employment opportunities. More recently, the group has expanded its international presence in Oman, Turkey, and Switzerland.</p><p><strong>What opportunities does the 2022 FIFA World Cup represent for your company and the country?<br></strong>The tourism sector lies at the heart of our core offerings since we have established Alfardan Hospitality, and we are always guided by the vision of HE Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani to build a highly developed and sustainable nation. The conscious efforts of the government focused on tourism is highly reflected in the launching of the next chapter of the National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030. As the country's blueprint for tourism growth in the next five years, it strategically designs the six geographic zones across the country and highlights its best and most natural tourism assets. We will continue to build our products and services in pursuit of this agenda and in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 to take advantage of the strong momentum in the country's tourism and hospitality sector. The generous support of the Qatari government for sustainable development further reinforces our confidence to significantly contribute and tap our business capabilities and ingenuity to strengthen Qatar's presence on the global tourism map. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main areas of activity and companies of your holding, as well as its main milestones?<br></strong>Al Faisal Holding Group adopts a diversified business model operating in different sectors such as real estate, hospitality, trading and distribution, services, construction and project management, culture, and education. In addition, Al Faisal's investments include its interest in Aamal Company Q.P.S.C, one of Qatar's largest, most diversified and fastest-growing companies. All the investments we have made in the past 57 years form an important component of our DNA and who we are today, as each project added a distinct experience that contributed to our progress and enriched our experience. Our start was in 1967 through a company called GETTCO Trading and Distribution and is currently known as Aamal Trading and Distribution. In 1970, we established Ebn Sina Medical and GETTCO Travel, which is currently known as Aamal Travel. I am extremely proud that these companies are still operating and enjoy leading market positions in the Qatari market. With the development and prosperity of the economy, we entered new fields such as real estate through Al Jazi Real Estate Investment Company, established in 1995, and education through the Gulf English School and Stenden University, established in 1993 and 1998, respectively. There was the opening of City Center Doha Shopping Mall in 2000, considered a landmark in the West Bay area. We also expanded to regional and international markets through Al Rayan Tourism Investment Company (ARTIC), established in 2003 and currently with investments in Europe, the US, and the Middle East and North Africa. Some of our businesses became publicly listed under Aamal Company at the end of 2007. These listings were in line with the government's vision to support the local economy and strengthen the financial market. </p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the strength of the Qatari economy, and what have been the main drivers that resulted in its success?</strong><br>The strong performance of the Qatari economy and its ability to achieve growth despite the surrounding conditions is considered the best evidence of its resilience. Among the most important factors that contributed to sustainable growth is the government's strategy of economic diversification, infrastructure development, and stable oil prices. Qatar's strong economy and sustainable growth has contributed to creating many investment opportunities in multiple sectors, strengthening the private sector's role and its increased participation in major projects, and creating job opportunities, which in turn are reflected positively on the economy as a whole.</p><p><strong>Where are the most appealing sectors and countries to continue diversifying your business portfolio?<br></strong>We are always keen on achieving synergy among our business operations, which comes through a careful and balanced diversification strategy in key sectors. We always aim to achieve excellence in all our activities through adhering to highest corporate governance standards, investing in human capital, and encouraging entrepreneurship spirit and innovation. We are always seeking strategic investment opportunities that provide added value to all stakeholders, are in line with our business model, and uphold the quality standards that we have set since our founding. The four main pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030—human development, social development, economic development and environmental development—are all at the heart of our operations. We continuously invest in building our human capital and encouraging entrepreneurial spirit. We are also keen on being an effective member of the local community in order to keep up with the most important and recent developments in the international community. We aim to be an active and integral part of the local private sector, which has a significant role in diversifying resources of the local economy and achieving self-sufficiency. Finally, we give great attention to preserving the environment, reducing pollution and our dependence on hydrocarbon resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is RDI so important, and why does Qatar need to focus on RDI?<br></strong>First, a greater focus on RDI can offer significant economic gains and opportunities. Specifically, Qatar can boost the productivity of its existing industries and sectors, as better methods, new technologies, and ways of working are deployed. It can also develop new R&amp;D intensive-sectors that not only help expand the country's export base but also create exciting job opportunities for a highly skilled national and expatriate workforce. Second, RDI is a key lever for solving social, environmental, and other national challenges to enhance people's quality of life, well-being, and security. A vibrant research community and innovative business sector would improve the knowledge and technology required to help address these challenges, which often call for breakthrough solutions. For Qatar, investments in RDI should aim to generate tailored solutions to the country's unique and pressing challenges. Finally, RDI can become an exciting platform in Qatar's ongoing global connectivity success story, similar to the connectivity platforms created by Qatar's oil and gas industry and the sports platform leading to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. As Qatar becomes a preferred location for international corporations and individuals to conduct RDI activities, the country's connectivity to the region and the world can deepen.</p><p><strong>In your view, what makes a successful RDI ecosystem?<br></strong>Mobility, namely of people, ideas, and capital. A mobile, dynamic, and fully integrated RDI ecosystem allows for the exchange of people and ideas across disciplines, industries, and sectors. To build a thriving RDI ecosystem, we need to facilitate interactions and coordinate RDI leadership across government, industry, and academia, thereby bridging gaps and creating much-needed linkages. We also need to have the right incentives in place to initiate or grow RDI activities across the public and private sectors so that ideas and solutions can be sourced from across the ecosystem. Finally, we must continue to make Qatar a friendly place to live and work as we attract and graduate the brightest minds. Mobility will allow RDI talent to find the right opportunities and the optimum spaces to think, grow, and apply their efforts in RDI.</p><p><strong>How do you define RDI talent, and how does Qatar fare on this front?<br></strong>Qatar's talent pool is, and will continue to be, a determining factor in its ability to grow, innovate, and impact local and global change. We define RDI talent as research scientists and engineers (RSEs) and other product development and innovation professionals with the right combination of skills, education, and attributes to support innovation. This includes product and industry managers, product designers and developers, entrepreneurs, and support professionals. Qatar can continue to build its talent pipeline, develop, attract, and retain qualified RSEs and further improve the regulatory environment to support innovation entrepreneurship in order to grow its RDI talent pool. Through the collaborative work of government, academia, and industry, Qatar can develop a stronger base of domestic and international RDI talent that drives research and innovation excellence in the country. The country's strategic location, global connectivity, and existing state-of-the-art research and education facilities highlight Qatar as an attractive destination for RDI talent.</p><p><br><strong>Can you tell us more about the QRDI Council and the work undertaken so far?<br></strong>Our council members have a wealth of knowledge across domains strategic to Qatar while also representing a cross-section of leadership from government, academia, and industry. The council composition is a good model for how initiatives and RDI activity can take place going forward. Over the last year, the council has undertaken a robust diagnostic process to understand the current RDI ecosystem and build insights on the way forward, engaging with more than 200 stakeholders, enlisting the support of international subject matter experts and specialized consultants, and analyzing and learning from other countries that are similar to Qatar, while reviewing existing RDI programs and initiatives in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does QCCI serve new sectors being developed in Qatar? <br></strong>The chamber assists companies in the fields of market research, trade fair participation, and delegation visits and provides support and general services to its members. In addition, it also encourages members to invest in non-traditional sectors and innovation-based projects in line with the country's policy aiming to build a more knowledge-based economy. To do so, QCCI promotes its liaison and coordination with the concerned authorities in the county in order to streamline procedures of establishing businesses and offer more incentives for these new sectors. QCCI's sectorial committees play a key role in this regard. These panels hold regular meetings with officials of concerned bodies to review means of developing new sectors and eradicating any obstacles facing their progress. During the siege imposed on the country for more than two years, Qatar has made significant progress in the area of self-sufficiency thanks to the progress made in the industrial and agricultural sectors. Structural changes have been made to the economy in order to diversify it, focusing on industrialization, diversification of opportunities, and the development of the industrial and agricultural sectors. The numerous large-scale investments in various sectors are proof of the growing attractiveness of the Qatar market and the success of combined efforts exerted by all bodies, including QCCI.</p><p><strong>How do you integrate with other governmental institutions, like Single Window or the Qatar Free Zone Authority (QFZA)?<br></strong>Building positive relations with all governmental bodies in the country, like Single Window or QFZA, is one of the chamber's priorities. The chamber is an active member of many joint committees with governmental authorities and ministries to review issues related to the private sector and solve any obstacles facing our members. We also forward the private sector's views regarding issues or laws to these bodies. Beyond any doubt, the strong communication and integration with these bodies has a positive impact on the progress and development of the private sector in general. This also contributes to facilitating business procedures and promoting Qatar as an attractive destination for business and investments. The integration between the country's different institutions has a significant impact on all sectors, especially industry. It helps establish the procedures and mechanisms necessary for the development of this vital sector.</p><p><strong>What are your main strategies in place to increase international awareness of Qatar for investors?<br></strong>Qatar is on the right track to build a diversified economy that is open for foreign investments. One of the most important missions of QCCI is to promote Qatar as an attractive business and investment hub for companies from around the world. Over the past years, the chamber has stepped up its efforts to strengthen economic and trading ties by establishing channels for dialogue between Qatari companies and their global counterparts. It also organizes high-level trade missions for Qatari businessmen in other countries and hosts meetings with foreign trade delegations to inform them of the business opportunities available in the Qatari market, as well as the incentives offered for investors by the government. Other activities carried out by the chamber include participating in international fairs such as Hanover Fair and World Chamber Congress to raise awareness about Qatar as a hub for international investments.</p><p><strong>What will be the next steps for QCCI in 2020?<br></strong>We have many important projects to accomplish in the coming year, including hosting the Halal Conference and Expo as well as the eighth edition of Made in Qatar, which will be held in Kuwait. We will also implement an inclusive improvement of our website to include many additional e-services with a view to helping our members to apply all chamber's services online. We also will issue the Qatar Exporters Directory to promote SMEs and exporting companies, as well as help them gain access to all world markets. It will be distributed to trade delegations visiting the chamber and embassies and diplomatic missions to Qatar and introduced to commercial chambers around the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will The Single Window project facilitate the establishment of companies in Qatar?<br></strong>The objective of Single Window is to have a one-stop shop for starting your business in Qatar. There used to be up to 100 different paper applications that an investor had to fill in, depending on their intended business, before they could launch new companies. Now, we will receive just one application with no duplication. The investor will apply at a single destination and will not have to follow up with the various ministries. In addition, applicants can track the process online without having to go down to the ministry. The process will be transparent in terms of cost and knowing beforehand the information and documents that are required for the application. In summary, the five main objectives of Single Window are to: create a single point of contact; have direct and smooth transactions; improve governmental efficiency and transparency; improve the ease of doing business; and attract more FDI to Qatar. We are working toward achieving the last goal through the Invest in Qatar platform, and we have attracted almost 100 new companies over 2019.</p><p><strong>What phase of development is Single Window at right now?<br></strong>We launched phase one in September 2019, which includes all the processes for launching or starting a business here. This means that investors will be able to start their companies either at our counters, which are available already, or through the online investor portal we are working on. The most important innovation in the whole process is the approvals portal. Instead of having to go to a ministry in person, the applicant's paperwork will be directed to the concerned ministry electronically, and they will review the application and accept, reject, or request changes, and so on. The two most critical elements of the Single Window system are using a digital signature that applicants add to the documents by inputting their ID and the approvals portal. We have linked the approvals portal with 19 departments, including health, education, and aviation. Investors can go to one portal to make a single application covering all their needs.</p><p><strong>How much time will the Single Window save for companies?<br></strong>For example, establishing a nursery used to take 35 days and require 13 visits, nine applications, and six payments. Now, there are just three interactions. Once the application is completed, it is returned to the applicant, and the entire process takes 14 days. Establishing a nursery is considered one of the most complicated applications and strictest licenses in Qatar due to safety requirements. For other sectors, the simplified process takes less than one hour now.</p><p><strong>Is Single Window more for locals or foreign investors coming to Qatar?<br></strong>The Single Window system is available for all investors to use and benefit from. Because local investors already know the business processes here, Single Window is particularly helpful for a foreign investor who wants to establish a business in Qatar. They have a straightforward process to follow and will know exactly how many days it will take and how much it will cost.</p><p><strong>What are the next phases and practical steps for Single Window?<br></strong>At the moment, we are focusing on facilitating new business launch; however, establishing a company is only one part—keeping it going is another. We are working on addressing our existing issues, such as implementing the upcoming VAT tax system. We also need to make the tax inspection and fees system clearer and more transparent for businesses. The main challenge now is enhancing communication with the private sector, because at the moment, people are still going to the relevant ministries. Our first task therefore is to encourage people to go online. We have signed 10 service level agreements with the main ministries, and we need to work closely together to ensure these collaborations achieve the desired results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the overarching objective of the IPA?<br></strong>We are currently unifying promotional activities and communication strategies to provide clear information about the Qatari market and the significant investment opportunities. We also act as a coordinating agency for foreign investors to help navigate within the local business ecosystem. This includes broad stakeholder management across all of the entities involved and represented on our board and beyond. We promote and produce investor leads, as well as conduct our own promotional events domestically and abroad. IPA was established in July 2019 under the purview of the advisory committee on investments. It also includes all other responsible FDI agencies, such as Media City, the Qatar Free Zone Authority (QFZA), Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), and Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP). The Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister's Office are also represented on our board.</p><p><strong>What have been your main activities over recent months?<br></strong>We recently held an event in New York, a joint event with QFC, QFZA, and the Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with Bloomberg. Those entities came together in a joint event targeting investors, mainly in the financial industry. Given its success, we are planning a number of further events. There were also numerous business-to-business meetings held on the sidelines. </p><p><strong>What partnerships are you establishing to scale international standards?<br></strong>We are currently following a strategy around building partnerships, in particular with foreign promotion agencies. We have signed an agreement with the Malaysian Investment Development Agency and have a number of others in the pipeline. IPA also recently joined the World Association for Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA), which falls under the UN Conference on Trade and Development. We participated in a WAIPA conference in Warsaw. There are a number of benefits that we have enjoyed from engaging with other IPAs. We have been able to share best practices and receive technical assistance from the association to our benefit. </p><p><strong>What incentives can investors expect in Qatar?<br></strong>Qatar offers a very attractive value proposition. Our legal framework has many platforms that are interesting for investors. QFC is one, and QFZA another, both allowing 100% foreign investments. They also fall under the jurisdiction of the Qatar International Court, which is under English Common Law. The new FDI law recently introduced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also allows up to 100% foreign investment across all sectors. There are a number of other pro-business regulations that have also come into play. We offer foreign residency ownership of real estate now in many areas of Doha, including freeholdings and 99-year leases. There have also been new reforms on labor, and we have abolished exit permits. These measures help attract investment and retain know-how and skilled people. </p><p><strong>What specific areas are you seeking to attract investment to? <br></strong>There are prioritized sectors in the QNV2030, and we essentially follow that roadmap. We are helping the various platforms attract investment in logistics, manufacturing, emerging technologies, chemicals, financial services, professional services, insurance, education, tourism, and real estate. We are also working to attract companies involved in all stages of the supply chain. We are interested in promoting PPPs, as a number of such programs have been launched to help enhance the private sector, and this area is now open to FDI. A new law passed now allows companies registered in the QFC and the free zones to participate in government tenders. We seeing great interest from companies that are keen to serve the African and Asian markets and plan to use Qatar as a base. There is also strong potential for serving the GCC.</p><p><strong>What are the next steps on your agenda?<br></strong>We are in the final stage of developing a national brand for FDI. In addition, we are focused on building our joint stakeholder approach toward attracting FDI. We will see a natural process of sector prioritization based upon our objectives, which is shortly forthcoming. We are promoting Qatar and are interested in facilitating the entire investment cycle. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Manateq is one of the main drivers to incentivize the private sector to diversify the Qatari economy. What have been the main areas of focus for Manateq during the last year?<br></strong>Our work over the past year has been focused on putting in place solid foundations for the creation of logistics parks and industrial zones to ensure that the investors we attract are able to leverage favorable business incentives. We have paid attention to fostering the non-oil private sector—particularly the SME segment—and I am pleased to report that more than 2,300 plots have been allocated to investors looking to establish projects in our logistics parks and industrial zones. We have formed, and continue to nurture, strong bonds with the private sector, encouraging it to contribute to economic diversification and the country's development. This is vital to securing long-term, sustainable growth and the establishment of an economic bedrock capable of competing globally and providing the country with future jobs and prosperity, long after major infrastructure projects are completed. In designing our parks, we have drilled down into the current and future needs of the entire assembly, retail, and logistics sector to ensure we meet their requirements and help foster their success. The public sector working in close partnership with the private sector can create transformative opportunities for the country.</p><p><strong>How will you work together with other institutions like Qatar Free Zones Authority (QFZA) and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOIC) in order to attract FDI to Qatar?</strong><br>We work closely with all organizations that, like Manateq, are keenly focused on achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030 and its economic diversification aiming at fostering the development of a vibrant private sector and a diversified knowledge-based economy. For example, we have cooperated with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on the drafting of a manufacturing strategy to stimulate FDI into the country. The strategy is developed to create conditions that enable a vibrant industrial development across various sectors, remove the constraints that may emerge, create compelling sources of competitive advantage, and create a unique investment proposition for Qatar. Manateq and QFZA work hand in hand to identify potential international investors willing to invest in Qatar. When identified, the potential investors will be directed to QFZA as they continue their process under the free zones regulations to benefit from the incentives offered.</p><p><strong>What benefits does Manateq offer investors?<br></strong>The benefits are numerous, though they amount to an overall solution to ease business setup in a strategically located, well-serviced, and modern destination. Manateq's total land bank is about 29 million sqm, across our logistics, industrial, and warehousing parks, and from this we can offer investors land plots of various sizes so they can develop their own industrial facilities in the industrial zones, while they can also build their own warehouse or workshop along with a showroom, workers' accommodation, and office space all in the same plot at the logistics parks. Alternatively, we offer ready-built warehouses in the warehousing parks that have been developed in partnership with the private sector. In addition, we help facilitate business setup. When businesses invest through a Manateq project, they are serviced via a dedicated point of contact who takes care of the business setup processes in Qatar and enables a smooth transition into the state's business landscape. All associated costs are taken into consideration depending on the project. We act as a full-service agent for investors easing the strain of business set up and massively reducing start-up times. Another incentive for investors to locate in our logistics parks is that they can benefit from a range of client services, unparalleled interconnectivity, integrated infrastructure, an easy set-up process, and financing. Moreover, by facilitating the easy start-up of businesses in these parks, we hope to attract a wider range of sectors, indigenous enterprises, and local investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As the onshore business and financial center, QFC provides an excellent platform for firms to do business in Qatar and the region. What are your main areas of focus as managing director of business development?</strong></p><p>A successful business development office must be able to develop and increase awareness, generate new opportunities, stay up to date with trends and the competition, and build and maintain relations with key stakeholders. So far, these have been the focus areas of our office, which has enabled us to create long-term value for QFC. It has a clear mandate to help develop and diversify the Qatari economy, and we have demonstrated significant success in fulfilling that role. In line with QFC's 2022 strategy, the business development team is focused on identifying business opportunities within the digital, media, and sports sectors, each of which are poised for growth.</p><p><strong>What international companies is QFC looking to attract to Qatar or facilitate agreements with?<br></strong>QFC's objective is to diversify the economy and position Doha as the region's leading financial and commercial capital. A critical part of that objective is attracting foreign investment and encouraging businesses to expand to Qatar as the gateway to the Middle East and beyond. QFC has been successful in attracting some of the most influential players across a broad range of industries, from professional services firms such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters to global banking powerhouses like JPMorgan Chase Credit Suisse, Barclays Bank, and Bank of China into Qatar. We have also signed MoUs with a variety of firms, including B-Hive and Qatar Development Bank (QDB) to support the establishment of a fintech ecosystem; Aspire Zone Foundation (AZF) to establish Qatar as the region's first-ever sports business park; and Paris EUROPLACE to support the development of the digital industry in Qatar. We are now placing a more targeted focus on sports and digital—key clusters we expect will continue to attract leading firms.</p><p><strong>As a social entrepreneur, with numerous businesses in different sectors, how do you assess the capacity of Qatar to create a solid and diversified business community?</strong><br>I have made multiple investments in Qatar across sectors because I see numerous actionable opportunities. Qatar as a market is rapidly developing, and commercial opportunities abound as we continue to mature. There are a wealth of attractive opportunities in Qatar, many of which leverage the world-class infrastructure Qatar has erected in recent years, starting with our new seaport, airport, and 5G network. We are now in an advanced stage of the country's physical development, and this presents a whole host of commercial opportunities for firms to actualize. Start-ups and entrepreneurs are also gaining a foothold in Qatar's business environment and the QFC is taking an active role in that space. We are working together with QDB and other entities on Sport Accelerator — Qatar Business District, a pioneer sport business hub dedicated to creating new business opportunities for the private sector, attracting foreign investment and supporting entrepreneurs. </p><p><strong>What are the priorities for business development at QFC in the coming years?<br></strong>QFC business development's overwhelming priority in the years ahead is to execute QFC's 2022 strategy. As part of that effort, we will concentrate on increasing the number of firms in media, sport, and digital on our platform. In tandem, QFC is also aggressively pursuing asset managers, fintech, and wealth advisors to set up operations. Collectively, we are working to execute our vision of maturing our already-vibrant financial center to include over 1,000 companies employing 10,000 high-skilled staff. Also, one of the biggest mandates of business development at QFC is to host international roadshows, known as investment roundtables, around the world to strengthen ties with international business communities and seek out areas for cooperation. We will continue pursuing opportunities within key markets in an effort to strengthen the presence of international firms here in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the results of 2019 for QFC?<br></strong>2019 was an exceptionally good year for QFC, and we have seen 22% growth in terms of the number of companies compared to 2018. A great deal of our focus this year has been on increasing the number of companies and highly-skilled workers in the market. Since announcing our new business strategy, we have also focused on intensifying our relations with our global partners. In 2018, we announced we would start work on the New Emerging Belt Initiative markets, which include Iraq, Oman, Kuwait, Southeast Asia, and Turkey. This amounts to USD2 trillion of GDP surrounding Qatar. Since 2017, we have attracted more companies doing regional business rather than only focusing on the local market. A large part of our emphasis has been on attracting companies that want to do business in these markets.</p><p><strong>How many companies do you have in total established in QFC?<br></strong>We have more than 760 companies now. We had 22% growth in 2019 alone, which is equivalent to 120 companies. We are talking about 100% growth since 2017. We saw growth of 66% in 2017, 33% in 2018, and more than 20% in 2019, so there has been a positive flow of foreign companies establishing themselves in QFC and Qatar.</p><p><strong>How are you working with the Investment Promotion Agency Qatar (IPAQ) to avoid overlapping with other free zones?<br></strong>We are currently defining sectors with the state of Qatar and IPAQ. Our core business is financial services, and none of the financial service activities will be anywhere else except QFC. That is a big part of our business proposition. Regarding different sectors, one can establish themselves either in the QFC or QFZA. What we seek to do is minimize the overlapping as much as possible through IPAQ, which will coordinate all the efforts by serving as a complete source of investment solutions for FDI.</p><p><strong>How is QFC facilitating the establishment of fintech companies in Qatar?<br></strong>Our main focus right now is on fintech. The sector has been an intensive investment pocket. The MENA region has been slightly slower because the regulations have not been formulated yet; however, we expect fintech to play an important role in our strategy. We have already licensed a handful of companies, even though the regulations are not ready. We are working closely with the central bank to come up with a sandbox for fintech companies. We see many technological finance companies moving into QFC and working with local banks. This is an area moving dynamically day by day, though we happen to be the only gateway into the country for technological companies in the financial space. There is a broader digital strategy with the ministry. Our role is to allow the digital companies being seeded by the ministry or QSTP to operate freely without any hindrance and hopefully have a cluster of digital companies moving into Qatar through the QFC platform.</p><p><strong>What are the next practical steps that you plan to implement in QFC?<br></strong>We want to attract more than 1,000 companies and create 10,000 jobs. We want to contribute to more listings on the stock exchange. We have announced those targets and are fixed on achieving them by 2022. All that has to do with attracting more FDI and creating more highly skilled labor on the ground, contributing to the growth of the Qatari population. 85% of our population right now is blue collar, and in order to generate the most benefit possible on our GDP, we need to focus more on the business community and high-skilled labor. QFC, the free zones, the ministry, and Media City have all been put together to contribute toward that goal, which is creating a world-class business environment, contributing to white-collar employment, and being able to grow the population in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is now a good time to invest in Qatar?<br></strong>Qatar has experienced rapid development over the past few decades, steadily building up our physical, social, and economic infrastructure to create the compelling investment environment we are able to offer today. 40 years ago, we began investing heavily in building modern physical infrastructure, beginning with development of an advanced transportation system including highways, bridges, tunnels, and a cross-country rail network, and leading to the opening of our now world-leading airport and seaport. We complemented this with soft infrastructure, establishing and strengthening a high-quality education system now comprising more than 15 universities and research institutes. These institutions produce skilled talent for the market, helping spur innovation and advance the economy, alongside our top-ranked health system, cultural and tourist attractions and recreational activities. We have also built robust economic institutions, diversifying our economy through cornerstone entities such as Qatar Airways, Al Jazeera, Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar Science and Technology Park, Qatar Financial Center, and Qatar Development Bank. QFZA was established to support this ongoing diversification and provide a new access point for international investors and their families to come and benefit from Qatar's prosperity and bright future. This is all supported by a business-friendly regulatory environment, with a legal system based on common law and backed by strong IP and data protection regulation. The government has recently set new laws and regulations to continue liberalizing the economy and encouraging investment, while strong institutions ensure investors are able to take best advantage of this environment. Additionally, the government has taken major reforms to support attraction of FDI to the country and recently established the Investment Promotions Agency (IPAQ) to promote Qatar as a preferred destination location for foreign direct investment.</p><p><strong>How does QFZA support companies seeking to capitalize on opportunities in Qatar?<br></strong>We're dedicated to providing companies in our free zones—or considering opening operations in our free zones—with top-of-the-line services and opportunities, including brand-new infrastructure, tax exemptions, partnership opportunities with Qatari entities, access to investment funds for eligible companies and a wide range of land plots including different building options in both zones to meet all needs. Unlike many free zone developers, QFZA oversees Qatar's free zones as an independent regulatory body, providing a one-stop shop for the entire set-up and management process.</p><p><strong>QFZA initially focused on logistics, chemicals, and emerging technology. What is the rationale for selecting those sectors?<br></strong>Building a diverse knowledge-based economy is at the heart of Qatar's National Vision 2030, and we're committed to supporting that vision, for the benefit of Qatar and all the businesses that work with us. We identified these three themes as they are all areas where Qatar has a strong value proposition, so we can develop and offer specialized solutions for businesses based on the nature of their product. Logistics, for example, is a very natural fit, as Qatar sits at the intersection of three continents and is one of the world's largest cargo hubs and currently a key logistics player. We also have powerful logistical infrastructure, including our leading airport and seaport and an advanced domestic transportation system. Chemicals and its supply chain, meanwhile, build on our strengths in natural gas production and the availability of feedstock in the ground, which is very attractive for international investors. Emerging technology is an obvious area of focus given the country's small size, powerful technological infrastructure and high internet and smartphone penetration, all protected by strong IP and data protection regulations. Technology is an integral aspect of the new economy, and we have a great ecosystem in place to support tech companies. However, these are not the only areas we are focused on. We are also particularly interested in welcoming businesses operating in the fields of food manufacturing, agriculture, trading, and import and export activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In 2018, Qatar's GDP grew to USD225 billion and foreign trade jumped 19% to reach USD116 billion. What are the major factors behind this improvement, and what new measures are you planning to bolster the business environment in Qatar?<br></strong>In recent years, international trade and investments have been the main drivers behind Qatar's economic growth and diversification. Capitalizing on its strategic location between East and West, Qatar has successfully established direct commercial routes with a number of strategic hubs and major markets around the world using its advanced infrastructure to bolster its trade activities. Qatar's trade balance registered a surplus of QAR191.4 billion in 2018 compared to QAR136.9 billion in 2017, as exports grew to QAR306.8 billion, an increase of QAR61.1 billion or 24.9% compared to 2017, which recorded total exports of QAR245.7 billion. Growth in international trade is expected to maintain momentum, as Qatar expands its activities to major international markets using the country's high-tech logistics and advanced facilities. Today, the new Hamad port accounts for 27% of the regional trade volume in the Middle East, with an annual capacity of 7.5 million cargo containers, positioning Qatar as a major transit hub with links to more than 40 ports in three continents. Hamad International Airport, meanwhile, is one of the biggest in the region, linking Qatar to more than 160 destinations worldwide via Qatar Airways, which operates a fleet of more than 230 aircraft.</p><p><strong>What are the most appealing sectors to continue diversifying the economy, and what measures from your administration will ensure their proper development?</strong><br>Qatar has been channeling its hydrocarbon revenues into supporting various economic sectors and transforming national industries and trade sectors into active partners in achieving the objectives of QNV 2030. Ongoing investments into the development of Qatar's infrastructure enhances the competitiveness of domestic industries and lays the foundations of a strong production base that is contributing to balanced economic growth. This has been evident in the increasing contribution of Qatar's non-oil sectors to GDP, which maintained its growth in the first half of 2018, increasing by over 5% compared to the same period of 2017. While Qatar has accelerated the implementation of plans aimed at bolstering productive sectors, particularly the industrial sector, the government is also dedicating a great deal of importance to bolster its energy sector, with plans to increase its LNG production capacity increased from 77 million tons to 110 million tons by 2024. By embracing these integrated and balanced policies, Qatar is expanding its economic base, bolstering investor confidence in the country, and increasing the contribution of various sectors to the development of the national economy in line with QNV 2030, which envisions a future built on the principle of sustainable development to ensure prosperity for future generations. Moreover, Qatar's second national development strategy has (2018-2022) identified six priority sectors to ensure diversification of the economy: manufacturing, financial services, professional and scientific activities, tourism, logistics, and ICT.</p><p><strong>What will be the relevance of the contribution of the private sector in order to develop the Qatari economy?<br></strong>In April 2019, the government approved a draft law to regulate public-private partnerships, which will provide investors with the opportunity to finance, develop, and operate projects in a number of priority sectors. Once ratified, the law will provide a legislative framework to involve the private sector in the implementation of various state projects through build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts among other forms of partnerships depending on the nature of projects. The law will pave the way for investments in the fields of food security, sports, tourism, health, education, and logistics. Major projects in food security among various other sectors in addition to projects associated with preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup account for 43.3% of Qatar's total expenditures in 2019. In total, Qatar is committed to the implementation of new projects worth QAR421 billion, including new projects worth QAR48 billion in 2019, with QAR22.7 billion allocated for the health sector and QAR19.2 billion for the education sector. Qatar's spending on these projects will provide a myriad of opportunities for the private sector to tap.</p><p><strong>What are the efforts in terms of new measures and policies applied by the government of Qatar in order to attract FDI?<br></strong>In the past few years, Qatar has revised its legislative framework and business regulations to improve the country's business-friendly environment and bolster investments by providing attractive incentives to foreign investors. These include a law on regulating the investment of non-Qatari capital in economic activity that allows foreign investors up to 100% ownership in all economic and commercial activities. Under current legislation, Qatar offers income tax exemptions as well as exemptions from customs duties on the import of all required goods for production with no restrictions on repatriation of capital. Foreign companies that choose to operate in Qatar have access to warehousing parks and industrial zones as well as free and logistics zones in strategic locations in close proximity to Hamad International Airport and Hamad Port. Investors in free zones can export to local markets, tap investment funds, and enter into joint ventures with state-backed local companies. Qatar has also opened its real estate sector to foreign investors by easing restrictions on property ownership with the issuance of Law No. 16 of 2018 on regulating non-Qatari ownership and use of real estate in Qatar. The law enables investments in the property market through investment funds in 16 areas, freehold ownership in 10 strategic areas, the ownership of residential villas within compounds, and the ownership of shops within malls.</p><p><strong>How is the ministry standardizing the different resources under the same umbrella for companies to be easily established in Qatar, through initiatives like the Single Window?</strong><br>The Single Window for investor services is one of numerous initiatives that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has launched to speed up licensing procedures for both local and international investors and to streamline business and industrial activities across the country.<br>The Single Window for Investor Services enables investors to complete numerous transactions such as the incorporation of companies and factories, the registration of trade names and the issuance of commercial records, environmental permits, and industrial licenses among other licenses and services such as the recruitment of foreign labor. Investors in the industrial sector also benefit from several other initiatives. These include streamlining the processing of permits among 19 government agencies, the extraction of a construction license for a warehouse within three working days, and “Own Your Factory Within 72 Hours" initiative, which streamlines the issuance of all industrial and environmental approvals and licenses.</p><p><strong>What will be the next practical steps of ministry in 2019-2020?<br></strong>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry will pursue its efforts to further improve Qatar's business environment, attract new investments into the country and bolster the competitiveness and productivity of the private sector with a special focus on expanding the industrial sector. This includes the expansion of the Small and Medium Scale Industrial Area, which will offer 155 land plots to accommodate new industries. Some 400 industrial projects currently under construction and a total of 775 industrial land plots have been allocated so far in the industrial area. Another 19 additional investment opportunities will be announced in a number of sectors and industrial activities in the coming period. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main objectives and areas of work of your institution?<br></strong>Qatar Charity is an international humanitarian and developmental non-government organization founded in response to the common will of the civil society that is driven by the values, principles, and the cultural heritage of the Qatari people to achieve global solidarity and effectively address the most important humanitarian and development challenges faced by needy people all over the world. Our top priority is children, particularly those affected by crises and disasters, while also expanding our work to include diverse humanitarian and development sectors. Qatar Charity's vision is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals that aim for an integrated development system to help the beneficiary become a key partner in finding appropriate solutions for development through partnerships and networks to work locally, regionally, and internationally.</p><p><strong>What humanitarian challenges do your current programs address?<br></strong>In the humanitarian field, Qatar Charity continues to intervene in crises-stricken areas. A major portion of the current crises impacts the Arab world, with some of them extending over the course of nearly nine years. Hence, this issue represents one of Qatar Charity's main pillars and is a focal issue in terms of our current and future projects. Moreover, we continue with sustainable programs that contribute to promoting stability, peace, and social harmony in conflict-affected areas such as Darfur, where Qatar Charity implemented a number of projects as part of the state of Qatar's Development Initiative. Added to that, Qatar Charity continues to develop social welfare programs through the Qatar Charity Initiative Rofaqa for child welfare and protection, which sponsors more than 162,000 children around the world. We also continue to launch different projects to offer various quality services, such as the village of Sheikha Aisha bint Hamad al-Attiyah in Sudan.</p><p><strong>Qatar has been increasing its funds to realize global sustainable development. What has been achieved with this increased amount for international development?</strong><br>QFFD has designed its interventions in developing countries to achieve several goals of the Agenda 2030, supporting priority areas like education, healthcare, economic empowerment, infrastructure development, and humanitarian relief. Since 2015, Qatar's aid has touched USD2.3 billion and reached over 80 countries worldwide. Millions of out-of-school children in poor and conflict-affected regions have benefited from our joint programs with strategic partners in the field of education. The programs ranged from building schools and other necessary infrastructure, training teachers, providing scholarships, and developing educational curricula. In the area of health, our programs target emergency relief in conflict settings and more long-term programmatic interventions in other countries, including building specialized hospitals, training medical staff and midwives, and funding health programs in eye scanning and operations, among other projects. Finally, Qatar Fund has been striving to widen its portfolio into more allocation of funds on jobs creation and support for SMEs. Our Qatar Friendship Fund in Tunisia has so far helped over 27,000 Tunisian youth in either accessing job markets or starting up their businesses. Contemplating on our diversification of portfolio plans, we anticipate launching a new program next year that targets Syrian youth and their host communities.</p><p><strong>Which other major projects is QFFD involved in at the moment?<br></strong>Infrastructure projects have always had the lion's share of our budget, with large funds being dedicated to building roads, power line carriers, and dams, all with the objective of alleviating poverty, supporting lives and livelihoods, and providing access to economic corridors and centers. From Gaza, to Mogadishu, Khartoum, Tunis, and Nazwa and Thamrit in Oman, our infrastructure projects have touched and will have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people.</p>]]></richbody0content>
